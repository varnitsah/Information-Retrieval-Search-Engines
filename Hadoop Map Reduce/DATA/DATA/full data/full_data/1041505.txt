1041505	smith and the pharaohs and other tales  by h rider haggard   contents       smith and the pharaohs       magepa the buck       the blue curtains       little flower       only a dream       barbara who came back      smith and the pharaohs    i  scientists or some scientistsfor occasionally one learned person differs from other learned personstell us they know all that is worth knowing about man which statement of course includes woman they trace him from his remotest origin they show us how his bones changed and his shape modified also how under the influence of his needs and passions his intelligence developed from something very humble they demonstrate conclusively that there is nothing in man which the dissectingtable will not explain that his aspirations towards another life have their root in the fear of death or say others of them in that of earthquake or thunder that his affinities with the past are merely inherited from remote ancestors who lived in that past perhaps a million years ago and that everything noble about him is but the fruit of expediency or of a veneer of civilisation while everything base must be attributed to the instincts of his dominant and primeval nature man in short is an animal who like every other animal is finally subdued by his environment and takes his colour from his surroundings as cattle do from the red soil of devon such are the facts they or some of them declare all the rest is rubbish  at times we are inclined to agree with these sages especially after it has been our privilege to attend a course of lectures by one of them then perhaps something comes within the range of our experience which gives us pause and causes doubts the old divine doubts to arise again deep in our hearts and with them a yet diviner hope  perchance when all is said so we think to ourselves man is something more than an animal perchance he has known the past the far past and will know the future the far far future perchance the dream is true and he does indeed possess what for convenience is called an immortal soul that may manifest itself in one shape or another that may sleep for ages but waking or sleeping still remains itself indestructible as the matter of the universe    an incident in the career of mr james ebenezer smith might well occasion such reflections were any acquainted with its details which until this its setting forth was not the case mr smith is a person who knows when to be silent still undoubtedly it gave cause for thought to one individualnamely to him to whom it happened indeed james ebenezer smith is still thinking over it thinking very hard indeed  j e smith was well born and well educated when he was a goodlooking and able young man at college but before he had taken his degree trouble came to him the particulars of which do not matter and he was thrown penniless also friendless upon the rocky bosom of the world no not quite friendless for he had a godfather a gentleman connected with business whose christian name was ebenezer to him as a last resource smith went feeling that ebenezer owed him something in return for the awful appellation wherewith he had been endowed in baptism  to a certain extent ebenezer recognised the obligation he did nothing heroic but he found his godson a clerkship in a bank of which he was one of the directorsa modest clerkship no more also when he died a year later he left him a hundred pounds to be spent upon some souvenir  smith being of a practical turn of mind instead of adorning himself with memorial jewellery for which he had no use invested the hundred pounds in an exceedingly promising speculation as it happened he was not misinformed and his talent returned to him multiplied by ten he repeated the experiment and being in a position to know what he was doing with considerable success by the time that he was thirty he found himself possessed of a fortune of something over twentyfive thousand pounds then and this shows the wise and practical nature of the man he stopped speculating and put out his money in such a fashion that it brought him a safe and clear four per cent  by this time smith being an excellent man of business was well up in the service of his bankas yet only a clerk it is true but one who drew his four hundred pounds a year with prospects in short he was in a position to marry had he wished to do so as it happened he did not wishperhaps because being very friendless no lady who attracted him crossed his path perhaps for other reasons  shy and reserved in temperament he confided only in himself none not even his superiors at the bank or the board of management knew how well off he had become no one visited him at the flat which he was understood to occupy somewhere in the neighbourhood of putney he belonged to no club and possessed not a single intimate the blow which the world had dealt him in his early days the harsh repulses and the rough treatment he had then experienced sank so deep into his sensitive soul that never again did he seek close converse with his kind in fact while still young he fell into a condition of oldbachelorhood of a refined type  soon however smith discoveredit was after he had given up speculatingthat a man must have something to occupy his mind he tried philanthropy but found himself too sensitive for a business which so often resolves itself into rude inquiry as to the affairs of other people after a struggle therefore he compromised with his conscience by setting aside a liberal portion of his income for anonymous distribution among deserving persons and objects  while still in this vacant frame of mind smith chanced one day when the bank was closed to drift into the british museum more to escape the vile weather that prevailed without than for any other reason wandering hither and thither at hazard he found himself in the great gallery devoted to egyptian stone objects and sculpture the place bewildered him somewhat for he knew nothing of egyptology indeed there remained upon his mind only a sense of wonderment not unmixed with awe it must have been a great people he thought to himself that executed these works and with the thought came a desire to know more about them yet he was going away when suddenly his eye fell on the sculptured head of a woman which hung upon the wall  smith looked at it once twice thrice and at the third look he fell in love needless to say he was not aware that such was his condition he knew only that a change had come over him and never never could he forget the face which that carven mask portrayed perhaps it was not really beautiful save for its wondrous and mystic smile perhaps the lips were too thick and the nostrils too broad yet to him that face was beauty itself beauty which drew him as with a cartrope and awoke within him all kinds of wonderful imaginings some of them so strange and tender that almost they partook of the nature of memories he stared at the image and the image smiled back sweetly at him as doubtless it or rather its originalfor this was but a plaster casthad smiled at nothingness in some tomb or hidinghole for over thirty centuries and as the woman whose likeness it was had once smiled upon the world  a short stout gentleman bustled up and in tones of authority addressed some workmen who were arranging a base for a neighbouring statue it occurred to smith that he must be someone who knew about these objects overcoming his natural diffidence with an effort he raised his hat and asked the gentleman if he could tell him who was the original of the mask  the officialwho in fact was a very great man in the museumglanced at smith shrewdly and seeing that his interest was genuine answered  i dont know nobody knows she has been given several names but none of them have authority perhaps one day the rest of the statue may be found and then we shall learnthat is if it is inscribed most likely however it has been burnt for lime long ago  then you cant tell me anything about her said smith  well only a little to begin with thats a cast the original is in the cairo museum mariette found it i believe at karnac and gave it a name after his fashion probably she was a queenof the eighteenth dynasty by the work but you can see her rank for yourself from the broken uraeus smith did not stop him to explain that he had not the faintest idea what a uraeus might be seeing that he was utterly unfamiliar with the snakeheaded crest of egyptian royalty you should go to egypt and study the head for yourself it is one of the most beautiful things that ever was found well i must be off good day  and he bustled down the long gallery  smith found his way upstairs and looked at mummies and other things somehow it hurt him to reflect that the owner of yonder sweet alluring face must have become a mummy long long before the christian era mummies did not strike him as attractive  he returned to the statuary and stared at his plaster cast till one of the workmen remarked to his fellow that if he were the gent hed go and look at a liveun for a change  then smith retired abashed  on his way home he called at his booksellers and ordered all the best works on egyptology when a day or two later they arrived in a packingcase together with a bill for thirtyeight pounds he was somewhat dismayed still he tackled those books like a man and being clever and industrious within three months had a fair working knowledge of the subject and had even picked up a smattering of hieroglyphics  in januarythat was at the end of those three monthssmith astonished his board of directors by applying for ten weeks leave he who had hitherto been content with a fortnight in the year when questioned he explained that he had been suffering from bronchitis and was advised to take a change in egypt  a very good idea said the manager but im afraid youll find it expensive they fleece one in egypt  i know answered smith but ive saved a little and have only myself to spend it upon  so smith went to egypt and saw the original of the beauteous head and a thousand other fascinating things indeed he did more attaching himself to some excavators who were glad of his intelligent assistance he actually dug for a month in the neighbourhood of ancient thebes but without finding anything in particular  it was not till two years later that he made his great discovery that which is known as smiths tomb here it may be explained that the state of his health had become such as to necessitate an annual visit to egypt or so his superiors understood  however as he asked for no summer holiday and was always ready to do another mans work or to stop overtime he found it easy to arrange for these winter excursions  on this his third visit to egypt smith obtained from the directorgeneral of antiquities at cairo a licence to dig upon his own account being already well known in the country as a skilled egyptologist this was granted upon the usual termsnamely that the department of antiquities should have a right to take any of the objects which might be found or all of them if it so desired  such preliminary matters having been arranged by correspondence smith after a few days spent in the museum at cairo took the night train to luxor where he found his headman an exdragoman named mahomet waiting for him and his fellaheen labourers already hired there were but forty of them for his was a comparatively small venture three hundred pounds was the amount that he had made up his mind to expend and such a sum does not go far in excavations  during his visit of the previous year smith had marked the place where he meant to dig it was in the cemetery of old thebes at the wild spot not far from the temple of medinet habu that is known as the valley of the queens here separated from the restingplaces of their royal lords by the bold mass of the intervening hill some of the greatest ladies of egypt have been laid to rest and it was their tombs that smith desired to investigate as he knew well some of these must yet remain to be discovered who could say fortune favours the bold it might be that he would find the holy grave of that beauteous unknown royalty whose face had haunted him for three long years  for a whole month he dug without the slightest success the spot that he selected had proved indeed to be the mouth of a tomb after twentyfive days of laborious exploration it was at length cleared out and he stood in a rude unfinished cave the queen for whom it had been designed must have died quite young and been buried elsewhere or she had chosen herself another sepulchre or mayhap the rock had proved unsuitable for sculpture  smith shrugged his shoulders and moved on sinking trial pits and trenches here and there but still finding nothing twothirds of his time and money had been spent when at last the luck turned one day towards evening with some halfdozen of his best men he was returning after a fruitless morning of labour when something seemed to attract him towards a little wadi or bay in the hillside that was filled with tumbled rocks and sand there were scores of such places and this one looked no more promising than any of the others had proved to be yet it attracted him thoroughly dispirited he walked past it twenty paces or more then turned  where go you sah asked his headman mahomet  he pointed to the recess in the cliff  no good sah said mahomet no tomb there bedrock too near top too much water run in there dead queen like keep dry  but smith went on and the others followed obediently  he walked down the little slope of sand and boulders and examined the cliff it was virgin rock never a tool mark was to be seen already the men were going when the same strange instinct which had drawn him to the spot caused him to take a spade from one of them and begin to shovel away the sand from the face of the clifffor here for some unexplained reason were no boulders or debris seeing their master to whom they were attached at work they began to work too and for twenty minutes or more dug on cheerfully enough just to humour him since all were sure that here there was no tomb at length smith ordered them to desist for although now they were six feet down the rock remained of the same virgin character  with an exclamation of disgust he threw out a last shovelful of sand the edge of his spade struck on something that projected he cleared away a little more sand and there appeared a rounded ledge which seemed to be a cornice calling back the men he pointed to it and without a word all of them began to dig again five minutes more of work made it clear that it was a cornice and half an hour later there appeared the top of the doorway of a tomb  old people wall him up said mahomet pointing to the flat stones set in mud for mortar with which the doorway had been closed and to the undecipherable impress upon the mud of the scarab seals of the officials whose duty it had been to close the last restingplace of the royal dead for ever  perhaps queen all right inside he went on receiving no answer to his remark  perhaps replied smith briefly dig man dig dont waste time in talking  so they dug on furiously till at length smith saw something which caused him to groan aloud there was a hole in the masonrythe tomb had been broken into mahomet saw it too and examined the top of the aperture with his skilled eye  very old thief he said look he try build up wall again but run away before he have time finish and he pointed to certain flat stones which had been roughly and hurriedly replaced  digdig said smith  ten minutes more and the aperture was cleared it was only just big enough to admit the body of a man  by now the sun was setting swiftly swiftly it seemed to tumble down the sky one minute it was above the rough crests of the western hills behind them the next a great ball of glowing fire it rested on their topmost ridge then it was gone for an instant a kind of green spark shone where it had been this too went out and the sudden egyptian night was upon them  the fellaheen muttered among themselves and one or two of them wandered off on some pretext the rest threw down their tools and looked at smith men say they no like stop here they afraid of ghost too many afreet live in these tomb that what they say come back finish tomorrow morning when it light very foolish people these common fellaheen remarked mahomet in a superior tone  quite so replied smith who knew well that nothing that he could offer would tempt his men to go on with the opening of a tomb after sunset let them go away you and i will stop and watch the place till morning  sorry sah said mahomet but i not feel quite well inside think i got fever i go to camp and lie down and pray under plenty blanket  all right go said smith but if there is anyone who is not a coward let him bring me my big coat something to eat and drink and the lantern that hangs in my tent i will meet him there in the valley  mahomet though rather doubtfully promised that this should be done and after begging smith to accompany them lest the spirit of whoever slept in the tomb should work him a mischief during the night they departed quickly enough  smith lit his pipe sat down on the sand and waited half an hour later he heard a sound of singing and through the darkness which was dense saw lights coming up the valley  my brave men he thought to himself and scrambled up the slope to meet them  he was right these were his men no less than twenty of them for with a fewer number they did not dare to face the ghosts which they believed haunted the valley after nightfall presently the light from the lantern which one of them carried not mahomet whose sickness had increased too suddenly to enable him to come fell upon the tall form of smith who dressed in his white working clothes was leaning against a rock down went the lantern and with a howl of terror the brave company turned and fled  sons of cowards roared smith after them in his most vigorous arabic it is i your master not an afreet  they heard and by degrees crept back again then he perceived that in order to account for their number each of them carried some article thus one had the bread another the lantern another a tin of sardines another the sardineopener another a box of matches another a bottle of beer and so on as even thus there were not enough things to go round two of them bore his big coat between them the first holding it by the sleeves and the second by the tail as though it were a stretcher  put them down said smith and they obeyed now he added run for your lives i thought i heard two afreets talking up there just now of what they would do to any followers of the prophet who mocked their gods if perchance they should meet them in their holy place at night  this kindly counsel was accepted with much eagerness in another minute smith was alone with the stars and the dying desert wind  collecting his goods or as many of them as he wanted he thrust them into the pockets of the greatcoat and returned to the mouth of the tomb here he made his simple meal by the light of the lantern and afterwards tried to go to sleep but sleep he could not something always woke him first it was a jackal howling amongst the rocks next a sandfly bit him in the ankle so sharply that he thought he must have been stung by a scorpion then notwithstanding his warm coat the cold got hold of him for the clothes beneath were wet through with perspiration and it occurred to him that unless he did something he would probably contract an internal chill or perhaps fever he rose and walked about  by now the moon was up revealing all the sad wild scene in its every detail the mystery of egypt entered his soul and oppressed him how much dead majesty lay in the hill upon which he stood were they all really dead he wondered or were those fellaheen right did their spirits still come forth at night and wander through the land where once they ruled of course that was the egyptian faith according to which the ka or double eternally haunted the place where its earthly counterpart had been laid to rest when one came to think of it beneath a mass of unintelligible symbolism there was much in the egyptian faith which it was hard for a christian to disbelieve salvation through a redeemer for instance and the resurrection of the body had he smith not already written a treatise upon these points of similarity which he proposed to publish one day not under his own name well he would not think of them now the occasion seemed scarcely fittingthey came home too pointedly to one who was engaged in violating a tomb  his mind or rather his imaginationof which he had plentywent off at a tangent what sights had this place seen thousands of years ago once thousands of years ago a procession had wound up along the roadway which was doubtless buried beneath the sand whereon he stood towards the dark door of this sepulchre he could see it as it passed in and out between the rocks the priests shavenheaded and robed in leopards skins or some of them in pure white bearing the mystic symbols of their office the funeral sledge drawn by oxen and on it the great rectangular case that contained the outer and the inner coffins and within them the mummy of some departed majesty in the egyptian formula the hawk that had spread its wings and flown into the bosom of osiris god of death behind the mourners rending the air with their lamentations then those who bore the funeral furniture and offerings then the high officers of state and the first priests of amen and of the other gods then the sister queens leading by the hand a wondering child or two then the sons of pharaoh young men carrying the emblems of their rank  lastly walking alone pharaoh himself in his ceremonial robes his apron his double crown of linen surmounted by the golden snake his inlaid bracelets and his heavy tinkling earrings pharaoh his head bowed his feet travelling wearily and in his heartwhat thoughts sorrow perhaps for her who had departed yet he had other queens and fair women without count doubtless she was sweet and beautiful but sweetness and beauty were not given to her alone moreover was she not wont to cross his will and to question his divinity no surely it is not only of her that he thinks her for whom he had prepared this splendid tomb with all things needful to unite her with the gods surely he thinks also of himself and that other tomb on the farther side of the hill whereat the artists labour day by dayyes and have laboured these many years that tomb to which before so very long he too must travel in just this fashion to seek his place beyond the doors of death who lays his equal hand on king and queen and slave  the vision passed it was so real that smith thought he must have been dreaming well he was awake now and colder than ever moreover the jackals had multiplied there were a whole pack of them and not far away look one crossed in the ring of the lamplight a slinking yellow beast that smelt the remains of dinner or perhaps it smelt himself moreover there were bad characters who haunted these mountains and he was alone and quite unarmed perhaps he ought to put out the light which advertised his whereabouts it would be wise and yet in this particular he rejected wisdom after all the light was some company  since sleep seemed to be out of the question he fell back upon poor humanitys other anodyne work which has the incidental advantage of generating warmth seizing a shovel he began to dig at the doorway of the tomb whilst the jackals howled louder than ever in astonishment they were not used to such a sight for thousands of years as the old moon above could have told no man or at least no solitary man had dared to rob tombs at such an unnatural hour  when smith had been digging for about twenty minutes something tinkled on his shovel with a noise which sounded loud in that silence  a stone which may come in handy for the jackals he thought to himself shaking the sand slowly off the spade until it appeared there it was and not large enough to be of much service still he picked it up and rubbed it in his hands to clear off the encrusting dirt when he opened them he saw that it was no stone but a bronze  osiris reflected smith buried in front of the tomb to hallow the ground no an isis no the head of a statuette and a jolly good one tooat any rate in moonlight seems to have been gilded and reaching out for the lamp he held it over the object  another minute and he found himself sitting at the bottom of the hole lamp in one hand and statuette or rather head in the other  the queen of the mask he gasped the samethe same by heavens the very same  oh he could not be mistaken there were the identical lips a little thick and pouted the identical nostrils curved and quivering but a little wide the identical arched eyebrows and dreamy eyes set somewhat far apart above all there was the identical alluring and mysterious smile only on this masterpiece of ancient art was set a whole crown of uraei surrounding the entire head beneath the crown and pressed back behind the ears was a fullbottomed wig or royal headdress of which the ends descended to the breasts the statuette that having been gilt remained quite perfect and uncorroded was broken just above the middle apparently by a single violent blow for the fracture was very clean  at once it occurred to smith that it had been stolen from the tomb by a thief who thought it to be gold that outside of the tomb doubt had overtaken him and caused him to break it upon a stone or otherwise the rest was clear finding that it was but goldwashed bronze he had thrown away the fragments rather than be at the pains of carrying them this was his theory probably not a correct one as the sequel seems to show  smiths first idea was to recover the other portion he searched quite a long while but without success neither then nor afterwards could it be found he reflected that perhaps this lower half had remained in the thiefs hand who in his vexation had thrown it far away leaving the head to lie where it fell again smith examined this head and more closely now he saw that just beneath the breasts was a delicately cut cartouche  being by this time a master of hieroglyphics he read it without trouble it ran mamee great royal lady beloved of  here the cartouche was broken away  mame or it might be mami he reflected i never heard of a queen called mame or mami or mamu she must be quite new to history i wonder of whom she was beloved amen or horus or isis probably of some god i have no doubt at least i hope so  he stared at the beautiful portrait in his hand as once he had stared at the cast on the museum wall and the beautiful portrait emerging from the dust of ages smiled back at him there in the solemn moonlight as once the cast had smiled from the museum wall only that had been but a cast whereas this was real this had slept with the dead from whose features it had been fashioned the dead who lay or who had lain within  a sudden resolution took hold of smith he would explore that tomb at once and alone no one should accompany him on this his first visit it would be a sacrilege that anyone save himself should set foot there until he had looked on what it might contain  why should he not enter his lamp of what is called the hurricane brand was very good and bright and would burn for many hours moreover there had been time for the foul air to escape through the hole that they had cleared lastly something seemed to call on him to come and see he placed the bronze head in his breastpocket over his heart and thrusting the lamp through the hole looked down here there was no difficulty since sand had drifted in to the level of the bottom of the aperture through it he struggled to find himself upon a bed of sand that only just left him room to push himself along between it and the roof a little farther on the passage was almost filled with mud  mahomet had been right when from his knowledge of the bedrock he said that any tomb made in this place must be flooded it had been flooded by some ancient rainstorm and smith began to fear that he would find it quite filled with soil caked as hard as iron so indeed it was to a certain depth a result that apparently had been anticipated by those who hollowed it for this entrance shaft was left quite undecorated indeed as smith found afterwards a hole had been dug beneath the doorway to allow the mud to enter after the burial was completed only a miscalculation had been made the natural level of the mud did not quite reach the roof of the tomb and therefore still left it open  after crawling for forty feet or so over this caked mud smith suddenly found himself on a rising stair then he understood the plan the tomb itself was on a higher level  here began the paintings here the queen mamee wearing her crowns and dressed in diaphanous garments was presented to god after god between her figure and those of the divinities the wall was covered with hieroglyphs as fresh today as on that when the artist had limned them a glance told him that they were extracts from the book of the dead when the thief of bygone ages had broken into the tomb probably not very long after the interment the mud over which smith had just crawled was still wet this he could tell since the clay from the rascals feet remained upon the stairs and that upon his fingers had stained the paintings on the wall against which he had supported himself indeed in one place was an exact impression of his hand showing its shape and even the lines of the skin  at the top of the flight of steps ran another passage at a higher level which the water had never reached and to right and left were the beginnings of unfinished chambers it was clear to him that this queen had died young her tomb as she or the king had designed it was never finished a few more paces and the passage enlarged itself into a hall about thirty feet square the ceiling was decorated with vultures their wings outspread the looped cross of life hanging from their talons on one wall her majesty mamee stood expectant while anubis weighed her heart against the feather of truth and thoth the recorder wrote down the verdict upon his tablets all her titles were given to her here such asgreat royal heiress royal sister royal wife royal mother lady of the two lands palmbranch of love beautifulexceedingly  smith read them hurriedly and noted that nowhere could he see the name of the king who had been her husband it would almost seem as though this had been purposely omitted on the other walls mamee accompanied by her ka or double made offerings to the various gods or uttered propitiatory speeches to the hideous demons of the underworld declaring their names to them and forcing them to say pass on thou art pure  lastly on the end wall triumphant all her trials done she the justified osiris or spirit was received by the god osiris saviour of spirits  all these things smith noted hurriedly as he swung the lamp to and fro in that hallowed place then he saw something else which filled him with dismay on the floor of the chamber where the coffins had beenfor this was the burial chamberlay a heap of black fragments charred with fire instantly he understood after the thief had done his work he had burned the mummycases and with them the body of the queen there could be no doubt that this was so for look among the ashes lay some calcined human bones while the roof above was blackened with the smoke and cracked by the heat of the conflagration there was nothing left for him to find  oppressed with the closeness of the atmosphere he sat down upon a little bench or table cut in the rock that evidently had been meant to receive offerings to the dead indeed on it still lay the scorched remains of some votive flowers here his lamp between his feet he rested a while staring at those calcined bones see yonder was the lower jaw and in it some teeth small white regular and but little worn yes she had died young then he turned to go for disappointment and the holiness of the place overcame him he could endure no more of it that night  leaving the burial hall he walked along the painted passage the lamp swinging and his eyes fixed upon the floor he was disheartened and the paintings could wait till the morrow he descended the steps and came to the foot of the mud slope here suddenly he perceived projecting from some sand that had drifted down over the mud what seemed to be the corner of a reed box or basket to clear away the sand was easy andyes it was a basket a foot or so in length such a basket as the old egyptians used to contain the funeral figures which are called ushaptis or other objects connected with the dead it looked as though it had been dropped for it lay upon its side smith opened itnot very hopefully for surely nothing of value would have been abandoned thus  the first thing that met his eyes was a mummied hand broken off at the wrist a womans little hand most delicately shaped it was withered and paperwhite but the contours still remained the long fingers were perfect and the almondshaped nails had been stained with henna as was the embalmers fashion on the hand were two gold rings and for those rings it had been stolen smith looked at it for a long while and his heart swelled within him for here was the hand of that royal lady of his dreams  indeed he did more than look he kissed it and as his lips touched the holy relic it seemed to him as though a wind cold but scented blew upon his brow then growing fearful of the thoughts that arose within him he hurried his mind back to the world or rather to the examination of the basket  here he found other objects roughly wrapped in fragments of mummycloth that had been torn from the body of the queen these it is needless to describe for are they not to be seen in the gold room of the museum labelled bijouterie de la reine mame xviiieme dynastie thebes smiths tomb it may be mentioned however that the set was incomplete for instance there was but one of the great gold ceremonial earrings fashioned like a group of pomegranate blooms and the most beautiful of the necklaces had been torn in twohalf of it was missing  it was clear to smith that only a portion of the precious objects which were buried with the mummy had been placed in this basket why had these been left where he found them a little reflection made that clear also something had prompted the thief to destroy the desecrated body and its coffin with fire probably in the hope of hiding his evil handiwork then he fled with his spoil but he had forgotten how fiercely mummies and their trappings can burn or perhaps the thing was an accident he must have had a lamp and if its flame chanced to touch this bituminous tinder  at any rate the smoke overtook the man in that narrow place as he began to climb the slippery slope of clay in his haste he dropped the basket and dared not return to search for it it could wait till the morrow when the fire would be out and the air pure only for this desecrator of the royal dead that morrow never came as was discovered afterwards    when at length smith struggled into the open air the stars were paling before the dawn an hour later after the sky was well up mahomet recovered from his sickness and his myrmidons arrived  i have been busy while you slept said smith showing them the mummied hand but not the rings which he had removed from the shrunk fingers and the broken bronze but not the priceless jewellery which was hidden in his pockets  for the next ten days they dug till the tomb and its approach were quite clear in the sand at the head of a flight of steps which led down to the doorway they found the skeleton of a man who evidently had been buried there in a hurried fashion his skull was shattered by the blow of an axe and the shaven scalp that still clung to it suggested that he might have been a priest  mahomet thought and smith agreed with him that this was the person who had violated the tomb as he was escaping from it the guards of the holy place surprised him after he had covered up the hole by which he had entered and purposed to return there they executed him without trial and divided up the plunder thinking that no more was to be found or perhaps his confederates killed him  such at least were the theories advanced by mahomet whether they were right or wrong none will ever know for instance the skeleton may not have been that of the thief though probability appears to point the other way  nothing more was found in the tomb not even a scarab or a mummybead smith spent the remainder of his time in photographing the pictures and copying the inscriptions which for various reasons proved to be of extraordinary interest then having reverently buried the charred bones of the queen in a secret place of the sepulchre he handed it over to the care of the local guardian of antiquities paid off mahomet and the fellaheen and departed for cairo with him went the wonderful jewels of which he had breathed no word and another relic to him yet more preciousthe hand of her majesty mamee palmbranch of love  and now follows the strange sequel of this story of smith and the queen mamee    ii  smith was seated in the sanctum of the distinguished directorgeneral of antiquities at the new cairo museum it was a very interesting room books piled upon the floor objects from tombs awaiting examination lying here and there a hoard of ptolemaic silver coins just dug up at alexandria standing on a table in the pot that had hidden them for two thousand years in the corner the mummy of a royal child aged six or seven not long ago discovered with some inscription scrawled upon the wrappings brought here to be deciphered by the master and the withered lotusbloom loves last offering thrust beneath one of the pink retaining bands  a touching object thought smith to himself really they might have left the dear little girl in peace  smith had a tender heart but even as he reflected he became aware that some of the jewellery hidden in an inner pocket of his waistcoat designed for banknotes was fretting his skin he had a tender conscience also  just then the director a french savant bustled in alert vigorous full of interest  ah my dear mr smith he said in his excellent english i am indeed glad to see you back again especially as i understand that you are come rejoicing and bringing your sheaves with you they tell me you have been extraordinarily successful what do you say is the name of this queen whose tomb you have foundmamee a very unusual name how do you get the extra vowel is it for euphony eh did i not know how good a scholar you are i should be tempted to believe that you had misread it memee mamee that would be pretty in french would it not ma miemy darling well i dare say she was somebodys mie in her time but tell me the story  smith told him shortly and clearly also he produced his photographs and copies of inscriptions  this is interestinginteresting truly said the director when he had glanced through them you must leave them with me to study also you will publish them is it not so perhaps one of the societies would help you with the cost for it should be done in facsimile look at this vignette most unusual oh what a pity that scoundrelly priest got off with the jewellery and burnt her majestys body  he didnt get off with all of it  what mr smith our inspector reported to me that you found nothing  i dare say sir but your inspector did not know what i found  ah you are a discreet man well let us see  slowly smith unbuttoned his waistcoat from its inner pocket and elsewhere about his person he extracted the jewels wrapped in mummycloth as he had found them first he produced a sceptrehead of gold in the shape of a pomegranate fruit and engraved with the throne name and titles of mamee  what a beautiful object said the director look the handle was of ivory and that sacre thief of a priest smashed it out at the socket it was fresh ivory then the robbery must have taken place not long after the burial see this magnifyingglass shows it is that all  smith handed him the surviving half of the marvellous necklace that had been torn in two  i have rethreaded it he muttered but every bead is in its place  oh heavens how lovely note the cutting of those cornelian heads of hathor and the gold lotusblooms betweenyes and the enamelled flies beneath we have nothing like it in the museum  so it went on  is that all gasped the director at last when every object from the basket glittered before them on the table  yes said smith that isno i found a broken statuette hidden in the sand outside the tomb it is of the queen but i thought perhaps you would allow me to keep this  but certainly mr smith it is yours indeed we are not niggards here still if i might see it  from yet another pocket smith produced the head the director gazed at it then he spoke with feeling  i said just now that you were discreet mr smith and i have been reflecting that you are honest but now i must add that you are very clever if you had not made me promise that this bronze should be yours before you showed it mewell it would never have gone into that pocket again and in the public interest wont you release me from the promise  no said smith  you are perhaps not aware went on the director with a groan that this is a portrait of mariettes unknown queen whom we are thus able to identify it seems a pity that the two should be separated a replica we could let you have  i am quite aware said smith and i will be sure to send you a replica with photographs also i promise to leave the original to some museum by will  the director clasped the image tenderly and holding it to the light read the broken cartouche beneath the breasts  mame great royal lady beloved of  beloved of whom well of smith for one take it monsieur and hide it away at once lest soon there should be another mummy in this collection a modern mummy called smith and in the name of justice let the museum which inherits it be not the british but that of cairo for this queen belongs to egypt by the way i have been told that you are delicate in the lungs how is your health now our cold winds are very trying quite good ah that is excellent i suppose that you have no more articles that you can show me  i have nothing more except a mummied hand which i found in the basket with the jewels the two rings off it lie there doubtless it was removed to get at that bracelet i suppose you will not mind my keeping the hand  of the beloved of smith interrupted the director drolly no i suppose not though for my part i should prefer one that was not quite so old still perhaps you will not mind my seeing it that pocket of yours still looks a little bulky i thought that it contained books  smith produced a cigarbox in it was the hand wrapped in cotton wool  ah said the director a pretty wellbred hand no doubt this mamee was the real heiress to the throne as she describes herself the pharaoh was somebody of inferior birth halfbrothershe is called royal sister you rememberson of one of the pharaohs slavewomen perhaps odd that she never mentioned him in the tomb it looks as though they didnt get on in life and that she was determined to have done with him in death those were the rings upon that hand were they not  he replaced them on the fingers then took off one a royal signet in a cartouche and read the inscription on the other bes ank ank bes bes the living the living bes  your mamee had some human vanity about her he added bes among other things as you know was the god of beauty and of the adornments of women she wore that ring that she might remain beautiful and that her dresses might always fit and her rouge never cake when she was dancing before the gods also it fixes her period pretty closely but then so do other things it seems a pity to rob mamee of her pet ring does it not the royal signet will be enough for us  with a little bow he gave the hand back to smith leaving the bes ring on the finger that had worn it for more than three thousand years at least smith was so sure it was the bes ring that at the time he did not look at it again  then they parted smith promising to return upon the morrow which owing to events to be described he did not do  ah said the master to himself as the door closed behind his visitor hes in a hurry to be gone he has fear lest i should change my mind about that ring also there is the bronze monsieur smith was ruse there it is worth a thousand pounds that bronze yet i do not believe he was thinking of the money i believe he is in love with that mamee and wants to keep her picture mon dieu a wellestablished affection at least he is what the english call an odd fish one whom i could never make out and of whom no one seems to know anything still honest i am surequite honest why he might have kept every one of those jewels and no one have been the wiser and what things what a find ciel what a find there has been nothing like it for years benedictions on the head of oddfish smith  then he collected the precious objects thrust them into an inner compartment of his safe which he locked and doublelocked and as it was nearly five oclock departed from the museum to his private residence in the grounds there to study smiths copies and photographs and to tell some friends of the great things that had happened    when smith found himself outside the sacred door and had presented its venerable guardian with a baksheesh of five piastres he walked a few paces to the right and paused a while to watch some native labourers who were dragging a huge sarcophagus upon an improvised tramway as they dragged they sang an echoing rhythmic song whereof each line ended with an invocation to allah  just so reflected smith had their forefathers sung when millenniums ago they dragged that very sarcophagus from the quarries to the nile and from the nile to the tomb whence it reappeared today or when they slid the casing blocks of the pyramids up the great causeway and smooth slope of sand and laid them in their dizzy restingplaces only then each line of the immemorial chant of toil ended with an invocation to amen now transformed to allah the east may change its masters and its gods but its customs never change and if today allah wore the feathers of amen one wonders whether the worshippers would find the difference so very great  thus thought smith as he hurried away from the sarcophagus and those bluerobed darkskinned fellaheen down the long gallery that is filled with a thousand sculptures for a moment he paused before the wonderful white statue of queen amenartas then remembering that his time was short hastened on to a certain room one of those which opened out of the gallery  in a corner of this room upon the wall amongst many other beautiful objects stood that head which mariette had found whereof in past years the cast had fascinated him in london now he knew whose head it was to him it had been given to find the tomb of her who had sat for that statue her very hand was in his pocketyes the hand that had touched yonder marble pointing out its defects to the sculptor or perhaps swearing that he flattered her smith wondered who that sculptor was surely he must have been a happy man also he wondered whether the statuette was also this masters work he thought so but he wished to make sure  near to the end of the room he stopped and looked about him like a thief he was alone in the place not a single student or tourist could be seen and its guardian was somewhere else he drew out the box that contained the hand from the hand he slipped the ring which the directorgeneral had left there as a gift to himself he would much have preferred the other with the signet but how could he say so especially after the episode of the statuette  replacing the hand in his pocket without looking at the ringfor his eyes were watching to see whether he was observedhe set it upon his little finger which it exactly fitted mamee had worn both of them upon the third finger of her left hand the bes ring as a guard to the signet he had the fancy to approach the effigy of mamee wearing a ring which she had worn and that came straight from her finger to his own  smith found the head in its accustomed place weeks had gone by since he looked upon it and now to his eyes it had grown more beautiful than ever and its smile was more mystical and living he drew out the statuette and began to compare them point by point oh no doubt was possible both were likenesses of the same woman though the statuette might have been executed two or three years later than the statue to him the face of it looked a little older and more spiritual perhaps illness or some premonition of her end had then thrown its shadow on the queen he compared and compared he made some rough measurements and sketches in his pocketbook and set himself to work out a canon of proportions  so hard and earnestly did he work so lost was his mind that he never heard the accustomed warning sound which announces that the museum is about to close hidden behind an altar as he was in his distant shadowed corner the guardian of the room never saw him as he cast a last perfunctory glance about the place before departing till the saturday morning for the morrow was friday the mohammedan sabbath on which the museum remains shut and he would not be called upon to attend so he went everybody went the great doors clanged were locked and bolted and save for a watchman outside no one was left in all that vast place except smith in his corner engaged in sketching and in measurements  the difficulty of seeing owing to the increase of shadow first called his attention to the fact that time was slipping away he glanced at his watch and saw that it was ten minutes to the hour  soon be time to go he thought to himself and resumed his work  how strangely silent the place seemed not a footstep to be heard or the sound of a human voice he looked at his watch again and saw that it was six oclock not five or so the thing said but that was impossible for the museum shut at five evidently the desert sand had got into the works the room in which he stood was that known as room i and he had noticed that its arab custodian often frequented room k or the gallery outside he would find him and ask what was the real time  passing round the effigy of the wonderful hathor cow perhaps the finest example of an ancient sculpture of a beast in the whole world smith came to the doorway and looked up and down the gallery not a soul to be seen he ran to room k to room h and others still not a soul to be seen then he made his way as fast as he could go to the great entrance the doors were locked and bolted  watch must be right after all im shut in he said to himself however theres sure to be someone about somewhere probably the salle des ventes is still open shops dont shut till they are obliged  thither he went to find its door as firmly closed as a door can be he knocked on it but a sepulchral echo was the only answer  i know he reflected the director must still be in his room it will take him a long while to examine all that jewellery and put it away  so for the room he headed and after losing his path twice found it by help of the sarcophagus that the arabs had been dragging which now stood as deserted as it had done in the tomb a lonesome and impressive object in the gathering shadows the directors door was shut and again his knockings produced nothing but an echo he started on a tour round the museum and having searched the ground floors ascended to the upper galleries by the great stairway  presently he found himself in that devoted to the royal mummies and being tired rested there a while opposite to him in a glass case in the middle of the gallery reposed rameses ii near to on shelves in a side case were rameses son meneptah and above his son seti ii while in other cases were the mortal remains of many more of the royalties of egypt he looked at the proud face of rameses and at the little fringe of white locks turned yellow by the embalmers spices also at the raised left arm he remembered how the director had told him that when they were unrolling this mighty monarch they went away to lunch and that presently the man who had been left in charge of the body rushed into the room with his hair on end and said that the dead king had lifted his arm and pointed at him  back they went and there true enough was the arm lifted nor were they ever able to get it quite into its place again the explanation given was that the warmth of the sun had contracted the withered muscles a very natural and correct explanation  still smith wished that he had not recollected the story just at this moment especially as the arm seemed to move while he contemplated it a very little but still to move  he turned round and gazed at meneptah whose hollow eyes stared at him from between the wrappings carelessly thrown across the parchmentlike and ashen face there probably lay the countenance that had frowned on moses there was the heart which god had hardened well it was hard enough now for the doctors said he died of ossification of the arteries and that the vessels of the heart were full of lime  smith stood upon a chair and peeped at seti ii above his weaker countenance was very peaceful but it seemed to wear an air of reproach in getting down smith managed to upset the heavy chair the noise it made was terrific he would not have thought it possible that the fall of such an article could produce so much sound satisfied with his inspection of these particular kings who somehow looked quite different now from what they had ever done beforemore real and imminent so to speakhe renewed his search for a living man  on he went mummies to his right mummies to his left of every style and period till he began to feel as though he never wished to see another dried remnant of mortality he peeped into the room where lay the relics of iouiya and touiyou the father and mother of the great queen taia cloths had been drawn over these and really they looked worse and more suggestive thus draped than in their frigid and unadorned blackness he came to the coffins of the priestkings of the twentieth dynasty formidable painted coffins with human faces there seemed to be a vast number of these priestkings but perhaps they were better than the gold masks of the great ptolemaic ladies which glinted at him through the gathering gloom  really he had seen enough of the upper floors the statues downstairs were better than all these dead although it was true that according to the egyptian faith every one of those statues was haunted eternally by the ka or double of the person whom it represented he descended the great stairway was it fancy or did something run across the bottom step in front of himan animal of some kind followed by a swiftmoving and indefinite shadow if so it must have been the museum cat hunting a museum mouse only then what on earth was that very peculiar and unpleasant shadow  he called puss puss puss for he would have been quite glad of its company but there came no friendly miau in response perhaps it was only the ka of a cat and the shadow wasoh never mind what the egyptians worshipped cats and there were plenty of their mummies about on the shelves but the shadow  once he shouted in the hope of attracting attention for there were no windows to which he could climb he did not repeat the experiment for it seemed as though a thousand voices were answering him from every corner and roof of the gigantic edifice  well he must face the thing out he was shut in a museum and the question was in what part of it he should camp for the night moreover as it was growing rapidly dark the problem must be solved at once he thought with affection of the lavatory where before going to see the director only that afternoon he had washed his hands with the assistance of a kindly arab who watched the door and gracefully accepted a piastre but there was no arab there now and the door like every other in this confounded place was locked he marched on to the entrance  here opposite to each other stood the red sarcophagi of the great queen hatshepu and her brother and husband thotmes iii he looked at them why should not one of these afford him a nights lodging they were deep and quiet and would fit the human frame very nicely for a while smith wondered which of these monarchs would be the more likely to take offence at such a use of a private sarcophagus and acting on general principles concluded that he would rather throw himself on the mercy of the lady  already one of his legs was over the edge of that solemn coffer and he was squeezing his body beneath the massive lid that was propped above it on blocks of wood when he remembered a little naked withered thing with long hair that he had seen in a side chamber of the tomb of amenhotep ii in the valley of kings at thebes this caricature of humanity many thought and he agreed with them to be the actual body of the mighty hatshepu as it appeared after the robbers had done with it  supposing now that when he was lying at the bottom of that sarcophagus sleeping the sleep of the just this little personage should peep over its edge and ask him what he was doing there of course the idea was absurd he was tired and his nerves were a little shaken still the fact remained that for centuries the hallowed dust of queen hatshepu had slept where he a modern man was proposing to sleep  he scrambled down from the sarcophagus and looked round him in despair opposite to the main entrance was the huge central hall of the museum now the cement roof of this hall had he knew gone wrong with the result that very extensive repairs had become necessary so extensive were they indeed that the directorgeneral had informed him that they would take several years to complete therefore this hall was boarded up only a little doorway being left by which the workmen could enter certain statues of seti ii and others too large to be moved were also roughly boarded over as were some great funeral boats on either side of the entrance the rest of the place which might be two hundred feet long with a proportionate breadth was empty save for the colossi of amenhotep iii and his queen taia that stood beneath the gallery at its farther end  it was an appalling place in which to sleep but better reflected smith than a sarcophagus or those mummy chambers if for instance he could creep behind the deal boards that enclosed one of the funeral boats he would be quite comfortable there lifting the curtain he slipped into the hall where the gloom of evening had already settled only the skylights and the outline of the towering colossi at the far end remained visible close to him were the two funeral boats which he had noted when he looked into the hall earlier on that day standing at the head of a flight of steps which led to the sunk floor of the centre he groped his way to that on the right as he expected the projecting planks were not quite joined at the bow he crept in between them and the boat and laid himself down    presumably being altogether tired out smith did ultimately fall asleep for how long he never knew at any rate it is certain that if so he woke up again he could not tell the time because his watch was not a repeater and the place was as black as the pit he had some matches in his pocket and might have struck one and even have lit his pipe to his credit be it said however he remembered that he was the sole tenant of one of the most valuable museums in the world and his responsibilities with reference to fire so he refrained from striking that match under the keel of a boat which had become very dry in the course of five thousand years  smith found himself very wide awake indeed never in all his life did he remember being more so not even in the hour of its great catastrophe or when his godfather ebenezer after much hesitation had promised him a clerkship in the bank of which he was a director his nerves seemed strung tight as harpstrings and his every sense was painfully acute thus he could even smell the odour of mummies that floated down from the upper galleries and the earthy scent of the boat which had been buried for thousands of years in sand at the foot of the pyramid of one of the fifth dynasty kings  moreover he could hear all sorts of strange sounds faint and faraway sounds which at first he thought must emanate from cairo without soon however he grew sure that their origin was more local doubtless the cement work and the cases in the galleries were cracking audibly as is the unpleasant habit of such things at night  yet why should these common manifestations be so universal and affect him so strangely really it seemed as though people were stirring all about him more he could have sworn that the great funeral boat beneath which he lay had become repeopled with the crew that once it bore  he heard them at their business above him there were trampings and a sound as though something heavy were being laid on the deck such for instance as must have been made when the mummy of pharaoh was set there for its last journey to the western bank of the nile yes and now he could have sworn again that the priestly crew were getting out the oars  smith began to meditate flight from the neighbourhood of that place when something occurred which determined him to stop where he was  the huge hall was growing light but not as at first he hoped with the rays of dawn this light was pale and ghostly though very penetrating also it had a blue tinge unlike any other he had ever seen at first it arose in a kind of fan or fountain at the far end of the hall illumining the steps there and the two noble colossi which sat above  but what was this that stood at the head of the steps radiating glory by heavens it was osiris himself or the image of osiris god of the dead the egyptian saviour of the world  there he stood in his mummycloths wearing the feathered crown and holding in his hands which projected from an opening in the wrappings the crook and the scourge of power was he alive or was he dead smith could not tell since he never moved only stood there splendid and fearful his calm benignant face staring into nothingness  smith became aware that the darkness between him and the vision of this god was peopled that a great congregation was gathering or had gathered there the blue light began to grow long tongues of it shot forward which joined themselves together illumining all that huge hall  now too he saw the congregation before him rank upon rank of them stood the kings and queens of egypt as though at a given signal they bowed themselves to the osiris and ere the tinkling of their ornaments had died away lo osiris was gone but in his place stood another isis the mother of mystery her deep eyes looking forth from beneath the jewelled vulturecap again the congregation bowed and lo she was gone but in her place stood yet another a radiant lovely being who held in her hand the sign of life and wore upon her head the symbol of the shining dischathor goddess of love a third time the congregation bowed and she too was gone nor did any other appear in her place  the pharaohs and their queens began to move about and speak to each other their voices came to his ears in one low sweet murmur  in his amaze smith had forgotten fear from his hidingplace he watched them intently some of them he knew by their faces there for instance was the longnecked khuenaten talking somewhat angrily to the imperial rameses ii smith could understand what he said for this power seemed to have been given to him he was complaining in a high weak voice that on this the one night of the year when they might meet the gods or the magic images of the gods who were put up for them to worship should not include his god symbolized by the aten or the suns disc  i have heard of your majestys god replied rameses the priests used to tell me of him also that he did not last long after your majesty flew to heaven the fathers of amen gave you a bad name they called you the heretic and hammered out your cartouches they were quite rare in my time oh do not let your majesty be angry so many of us have been heretics my grandson seti thereand he pointed to a mild thoughtfulfaced manfor example i am told that he really worshipped the god of those hebrew slaves whom i used to press to build my cities look at that lady with him beautiful isnt she observe her large violet eyes well she was the one who did the mischief a hebrew herself at least they tell me so  i will talk with him answered khuenaten it is more than possible that we may agree on certain points meanwhile let me explain to your majesty  oh i pray you not now there is my wife  your wife said khuenaten drawing himself up which wife i am told that your majesty had many and left a large family indeed i see some hundreds of them here tonight now ibut let me introduce nefertiti to your majesty i may explain that she was my only wife  so i have understood your majesty was rather an invalid were you not of course in those circumstances one prefers the nurse whom one can trust oh pray no offence nefertari my loveoh i beg pardon astnefertnefertari has gone to speak to some of her childrenlet me introduce you to your predecessor the queen nefertiti wife of amenhotep ivi mean khuenaten he changed his name you know because half of it was that of the father of the gods she is interested in the question of plural marriage goodbye i wish to have a word with my grandfather rameses i he was fond of me as a little boy  at this moment smiths interest in that queer conversation died away for of a sudden he beheld none other than the queen of his dreams mamee oh there she stood without a doubt only ten times more beautiful than he had ever pictured her she was tall and somewhat faircomplexioned with slumbrous dark eyes and on her face gleamed the mystic smile he loved she wore a robe of simple white and a purplebroidered apron a crown of golden uraei with turquoise eyes was set upon her dark hair as in her statue and on her breast and arms were the very necklace and bracelets that he had taken from her tomb she appeared to be somewhat moody or rather thoughtful for she leaned by herself against a balustrade watching the throng without much interest  presently a pharaoh a blackbrowed vigorous man with thick lips drew near  i greet your majesty he said  she started and answered oh it is you i make my obeisance to your majesty and she curtsied to him humbly enough but with a suggestion of mockery in her movements  well you do not seem to have been very anxious to find me mamee which considering that we meet so seldom  i saw that your majesty was engaged with my sister queens she interrupted in a rich low voice and with some other ladies in the gallery there whose faces i seem to remember but who i think were not queens unless indeed you married them after i was drawn away  one must talk to ones relations replied the pharaoh  quite so but you see i have no relationsat least none whom i know well my parents you will remember died when i was young leaving me egypts heiress and they are still vexed at the marriage which i made on the advice of my counsellors but is it not annoying i have lost one of my rings that which had the god bes on it some dweller on the earth must be wearing it today and that is why i cannot get it back from him  him why him hush the business is about to begin  what business my lord  oh the question of the violation of our tombs i believe  indeed that is a large subject and not a very profitable one i should say tell me who is that and she pointed to a lady who had stepped forward a very splendid person magnificently arrayed  cleopatra the greek he answered the last of egypts sovereigns one of the ptolemys you can always know her by that roman who walks about after her  which asked mamee i see severalalso other men she was the wretch who rolled egypt in the dirt and betrayed her oh if it were not for the law of peace by which we must abide when we meet thus  you mean that she would be torn to shreds mamee and her very soul scattered like the limbs of osiris well if it were not for that law of peace so perhaps would many of us for never have i heard a single king among these hundreds speak altogether well of those who went before or followed after him  especially of those who went before if they happen to have hammered out their cartouches and usurped their monuments said the queen dryly and looking him in the eyes  at this homethrust the pharaoh seemed to wince making no answer he pointed to the royal woman who had mounted the steps at the end of the hall  queen cleopatra lifted her hand and stood thus for a while very splendid she was and smith on his hands and knees behind the boarding of the boat thanked his stars that alone among modern men it had been his lot to look upon her rich and living loveliness there she shone she who had changed the fortunes of the world she who whatever she did amiss at least had known how to die  silence fell upon that glittering galaxy of kings and queens and upon all the hundreds of their offspring their women and their great officers who crowded the double tier of galleries around the hall  royalties of egypt she began in a sweet clear voice which penetrated to the farthest recesses of the place i cleopatra the sixth of that name and the last monarch who ruled over the upper and the lower lands before egypt became a home of slaves have a word to say to your majesties who in your mortal days all of you more worthily filled the throne on which once i sat i do not speak of egypt and its fate or of our sinswhereof mine were not the leastthat brought her to the dust those sins i and others expiate elsewhere and of them from age to age we hear enough but on this one night of the year that of the feast of him whom we call osiris but whom other nations have known and know by different names it is given to us once more to be mortal for an hour and though we be but shadows to renew the loves and hates of our longperished flesh here for an hour we strut in our forgotten pomp the crowns that were ours still adorn our brows and once more we seem to listen to our peoples praise our hopes are the hopes of mortal life our foes are the foes we feared our gods grow real again and our lovers whisper in our ears moreover this joy is given to usto see each other as we are to know as the gods know and therefore to forgive even where we despise and hate now i have done and i the youngest of the rulers of ancient egypt call upon him who was the first of her kings to take my place  she bowed and the audience bowed back to her then she descended the steps and was lost in the throng where she had been appeared an old man simplyclad longbearded wisefaced and wearing on his grey hair no crown save a plain band of gold from the centre of which rose the snakeheaded uraeus crest  your majesties who came after me said the old man i am menes the first of the accepted pharaohs of egypt although many of those who went before me were more truly kings than i yet as the first who joined the upper and the lower lands and took the royal style and titles and ruled as well as i could rule it is given to me to talk with you for a while this night whereon our spirits are permitted to gather from the uttermost parts of the uttermost worlds and see each other face to face first in darkness and in secret let us speak of the mystery of the gods and of its meanings next in darkness and in secret let us speak of the mystery of our lives of whence they come of where they tarry by the road and whither they go at last and afterwards let us speak of other matters face to face in light and openness as we were wont to do when we were men then hence to thebes there to celebrate our yearly festival is such your will  such is our will they answered    it seemed to smith that dense darkness fell upon the place and with it a silence that was awful for a time that he could not reckon that might have been years or might have been moments he sat there in the utter darkness and the utter silence  at length the light came again first as a blue spark then in upward pouring rays and lastly pervading all there stood menes on the steps and there in front of him was gathered the same royal throng  the mysteries are finished said the old king now if any have aught to say let it be said openly  a young man dressed in the robes and ornaments of an early dynasty came forward and stood upon the steps between the pharaoh menes and all those who had reigned after him his face seemed familiar to smith as was the side lock that hung down behind his right ear in token of his youth where had he seen him ah he remembered only a few hours ago lying in one of the cases of the museum together with the bones of the pharaoh unas  your majesties he began i am the king metesuphis the matter that i wish to lay before you is that of the violation of our sepulchres by those men who now live upon the earth the mortal bodies of many who are gathered here tonight lie in this place to be stared at and mocked by the curious i myself am one of them jawless broken hideous to behold yonder day by day must my ka sit watching my desecrated flesh torn from the pyramid that with cost and labour i raised up to be an eternal house wherein i might hide till the hour of resurrection others of us lie in far lands thus as he can tell you my predecessor mankaura he who built the third of the great pyramids the pyramid of her sleeps or rather wakes in a dark city called london across the seas a place of murk where no sun shines others have been burnt with fire others are scattered in small dust the ornaments that were ours are stole away and sold to the greedy our sacred writings and our symbols are their jest soon there will not be one holy grave in egypt that remains undefiled  that is so said a voice from the company but four months gone the deep deep pit was opened that i had dug in the shadow of the pyramid of cephren who begat me in the world there in my chamber i slept alone two handfuls of white bones since when i died they did not preserve the body with wrappings and with spices now i see those bones of mine beside which my double has watched for these five thousand years hid in the blackness of a great ship and tossing on a sea that is strewn with ice  it is so echoed a hundred other voices  then went on the young king turning to menes i ask of your majesty whether there is no means whereby we may be avenged on those who do us this foul wrong  let him who has wisdom speak said the old pharaoh  a man of middle age short in stature and of a thoughtful brow who held in his hand a wand and wore the feathers and insignia of the heir to the throne of egypt and of a high priest of amen moved to the steps smith knew him at once from his statues he was khaemuas son of rameses the great the mightiest magician that ever was in egypt who of his own will withdrew himself from earth before the time came that he should sit upon the throne  i have wisdom your majesties and i will answer he said the time draws on when in the land of death which is life the land that we call amenti it will be given to us to lay our wrongs as to this matter before those who judge knowing that they will be avenged on this night of the year also when we resume the shapes we were we have certain powers of vengeance or rather of executing justice but our time is short and there is much to say and do before the sungod ra arises and we depart each to his place therefore it seems best that we should leave these wicked ones in their wickedness till we meet them face to face beyond the world  smith who had been following the words of khaemuas with the closest attention and considerable anxiety breathed again thanking heaven that the engagements of these departed monarchs were so numerous and pressing still as a matter of precaution he drew the cigarbox which contained mamees hand from his pocket and pushed it as far away from him as he could it was a most unlucky act perhaps the cigarbox grated on the floor or perhaps the fact of his touching the relic put him into psychic communication with all these spirits at any rate he became aware that the eyes of that dreadful magician were fixed upon him and that a bone had a better chance of escaping the search of a rontgen ray than he of hiding himself from their baleful glare  as it happens however went on khaemuas in a cold voice i now perceive that there is hidden in this place and spying on us one of the worst of these vile thieves i say to your majesties that i see him crouched beneath yonder funeral barge and that he has with him at this moment the hand of one of your majesties stolen by him from her tomb at thebes  now every queen in the company became visibly agitated smith who was watching mamee saw her hold up her hands and look at them while all the pharaohs pointed with their fingers and exclaimed together in a voice that rolled round the hall like thunder  let him be brought forth to judgment  khaemuas raised his wand and holding it towards the boat where smith was hidden said  draw near vile one bringing with thee that thou hast stolen  smith tried hard to remain where he was he sat himself down and set his heels against the floor as the reader knows he was always shy and retiring by disposition and never had these weaknesses oppressed him more than they did just then when a child his favourite nightmare had been that the foreman of a jury was in the act of proclaiming him guilty of some dreadful but unstated crime now he understood what that nightmare foreshadowed he was about to be convicted in a court of which all the kings and queens of egypt were the jury menes was chief justice and the magician khaemuas played the role of attorneygeneral  in vain did he sit down and hold fast some power took possession of him which forced him first to stretch out his arm and pick up the cigarbox containing the hand of mamee and next drew him from the friendly shelter of the deal boards that were about the boat  now he was on his feet and walking down the flight of steps opposite to those on which menes stood far away now he was among all that throng of ghosts which parted to let him pass looking at him as he went with cold and wondering eyes they were very majestic ghosts the ages that had gone by since they laid down their sceptres had taken nothing from their royal dignity moreover save one none of them seemed to have any pity for his plight she was a little princess who stood by her mother that same little princess whose mummy he had seen and pitied in the directors room with a lotus flower thrust beneath her bandages as he passed smith heard her say  this vile one is frightened be brave vile one  smith understood and pride came to his aid he a gentleman of the modern world would not show the white feather before a crowd of ancient egyptian ghosts turning to the child he smiled at her then drew himself to his full height and walked on quietly here it may be stated that smith was a tall man still comparatively young and very goodlooking straight and spare in frame with dark pleasant eyes and a little black beard  at least he is a wellfavoured thief said one of the queens to another  yes answered she who had been addressed i wonder that a man with such a noble air should find pleasure in disturbing graves and stealing the offerings of the dead words that gave smith much cause for thought he had never considered the matter in this light  now he came to the place where mamee stood the blackbrowed pharaoh who had been her husband at her side on his left hand which held the cigarbox was the gold bes ring and that box he felt constrained to carry pressed against him just over his heart  as he went by he turned his head and his eyes met those of mamee she started violently then she saw the ring upon his hand and again started still more violently  what ails your majesty asked the pharaoh  oh naught she answered yet does this earthdweller remind you of anyone  yes he does answered the pharaoh he reminds me very much of that accursed sculptor about whom we had words  do you mean a certain horu the court artist he who worked the image that was buried with me and whom you sent to carve your statues in the deserts of kush until he died of feversor was it poison  aye horu and no other may set take and keep him growled the pharaoh  then smith passed on and heard no more now he stood before the venerable menes some instinct caused him to bow to this pharaoh who bowed back to him then he turned and bowed to the royal company and they also bowed back to him coldly but very gravely and courteously  dweller on the world where once we had our place and therefore brother of us the dead began menes this divine priest and magicianand he pointed to khaemuasdeclares that you are one of those who foully violate our sepulchres and desecrate our ashes he declares moreover that at this very moment you have with you a portion of the mortal flesh of a certain majesty whose spirit is present here say now are these things true  to his astonishment smith found that he had not the slightest difficulty in answering in the same sweet tongue  o king they are true and not true hear me rulers of egypt it is true that i have searched in your graves because my heart has been drawn towards you and i would learn all that i could concerning you for it comes to me now that once i was one of youno king indeed yet perchance of the blood of kings alsofor i would hide nothing even if i couldi searched for one tomb above all others  why o man asked the judge  because a face drew me a lovely face that was cut in stone  now all that great audience turned their eyes towards him and listened as though his words moved them  did you find that holy tomb asked menes if so what did you find therein  aye pharaoh and in it i found these and he took from the box the withered hand from his pocket the broken bronze and from his finger the ring  also i found other things which i delivered to the keeper of this place articles of jewellery that i seem to see tonight upon one who is present here among you  is the face of this figure the face you sought asked the judge  it is the lovely face he answered  menes took the effigy in his hand and read the cartouche that was engraved beneath its breast  if there be here among us he said presently one who long after my day ruled as queen in egypt one who was named mame let her draw near  now from where she stood glided mamee and took her place opposite to smith  say o queen asked menes do you know aught of this matter  i know that hand it was my own hand she answered i know that ring it was my ring i know that image in bronze it was my image look on me and judge for yourselves whether this be so a certain sculptor fashioned it the son of a kings son who was named horu the first of sculptors and the head artist of my court there clad in strange garments he stands before you horu or the double of horu he who cut the image when i ruled in egypt is he who found the image and the man who stands before you or mayhap his double cast in the same mould  the pharaoh menes turned to the magician khaemuas and said  are these things so o seer  they are so answered khaemuas this dweller on the earth is he who long ago was the sculptor horu but what shall that avail he once more a living man is a violator of the hallowed dead i say therefore that judgment should be executed on his flesh so that when the light comes here tomorrow he himself will again be gathered to the dead  menes bent his head upon his breast and pondered smith said nothing to him the whole play was so curious that he had no wish to interfere with its development if these ghosts wished to make him of their number let them do so he had no ties on earth and now when he knew full surely that there was a life beyond this of earth he was quite prepared to explore its mysteries so he folded his arms upon his breast and awaited the sentence  but mamee did not wait she raised her hand so swiftly that the bracelets jingled on her wrists and spoke out with boldness  royal khaemuas prince and magician she said hearken to one who like you was egypts heir centuries before you were born one also who ruled over the two lands and not so illwhich prince never was your lot answer me is all wisdom centred in your breast answer me do you alone know the mysteries of life and death answer me did your god amen teach you that vengeance went before mercy answer me did he teach you that men should be judged unheard that they should be hurried by violence to osiris ere their time and thereby separated from the dead ones whom they loved and forced to return to live again upon this evil earth  listen when the last moon was near her full my spirit sat in my tomb in the buryingplace of queens my spirit saw this man enter into my tomb and what he did there with bowed head he looked upon my bones that a thief of the priesthood had robbed and burnt within twenty years of their burial in which he himself had taken part and what did this man with those bones he who was once horu i tell you that he hid them away there in the tomb where he thought they could not be found again who then was the thief and the violator he who robbed and burnt my bones or he who buried them with reverence again he found the jewels that the priest of your brotherhood had dropped in his flight when the smoke of the burning flesh and spices overpowered him and with them the hand which that wicked one had broken off from the body of my majesty what did this man then he took the jewels would you have had him leave them to be stolen by some peasant and the hand i tell you that he kissed that poor dead hand which once had been part of the body of my majesty and that now he treasures it as a holy relic my spirit saw him do these things and made report thereof to me i ask you therefore prince i ask you all royalties of egyptwhether for such deeds this man should die  now khaemuas the advocate of vengeance shrugged his shoulders and smiled meaningly but the congregation of kings and queens thundered an answer and it was  no  mamee looked to menes to give judgment before he could speak the darkbrowed pharaoh who had named her wife strode forward and addressed them  her majesty heiress of egypt royal wife lady of the two lands has spoken he cried now let me speak who was the husband of her majesty whether this man was once horu the sculptor i know not if so he was also an evildoer who by my decree died in banishment in the land of kush whatever be the truth as to that matter he admits that he violated the tomb of her majesty and stole what the old thieves had left her majesty says alsoand he does not deny itthat he dared to kiss her hand and for a man to kiss the hand of a wedded queen of egypt the punishment is death i claim that this man should die to the world before his time that in a day to come again he may live and suffer in the world judge o menes  menes lifted his head and spoke saying  repeat to me the law o pharaoh under which a living man must die for the kissing of a dead hand in my day and in that of those who went before me there was no such law in egypt if a living man who was not her husband or of her kin kissed the living hand of a wedded queen of egypt save in ceremony then perchance he might be called upon to die perchance for such a reason a certain horu once was called upon to die but in the grave there is no marriage and therefore even if he had found her alive within the tomb and kissed her hand or even her lips why should he die for the crime of love  hear me all this is my judgment in the matter let the soul of that priest who first violated the tomb of the royal mamee be hunted down and given to the jaws of the destroyer that he may know the last depths of death if so the gods declare but let this man go from among us unharmed since what he did he did in reverent ignorance and because hathor goddess of love guided him from of old love rules this world wherein we meet tonight with all the worlds whence we have gathered or whither we still must go who can defy its power who can refuse its rites now hence to thebes    there was a rushing sound as of a thousand wings and all were gone  no not all since smith yet stood before the draped colossi and the empty steps and beside him glorious unearthly gleamed the vision of mamee  i too must away she whispered yet ere i go a word with you who once were a sculptor in egypt you loved me then and that love cost you your life you who once dared to kiss this hand of mine that again you kissed in yonder tomb for i was pharaohs wife in name only understand me well in name only since that title of royal mother which they gave me is but a graven lie horu i never was a wife and when you died swiftly i followed you to the grave oh you forget but i remember i remember many things you think that the priestly thief broke this figure of me which you found in the sand outside my tomb not so i broke it because daring greatly you had written thereon beloved not of horus the god as you should have done but of horu the man so when i came to be buried pharaoh knowing all took the image from my wrappings and hurled it away i remember too the casting of that image and how you threw a gold chain i had given you into the crucible with the bronze saying that gold alone was fit to fashion me and this signet that i bearit was you who cut it take it take it horu and in its place give me back that which is on your hand the bes ring that i also wore take it and wear it ever till you die again and let it go to the grave with you as once it went to the grave with me  now hearken when ra the great sun arises again and you awake you will think that you have dreamed a dream you will think that in this dream you saw and spoke with a lady of egypt who died more than three thousand years ago but whose beauty carved in stone and bronze has charmed your heart today so let it be yet know o man who once was named horu that such dreams are ofttimes a shadow of the truth know that this glory which shines before you is mine indeed in the land that is both far and near the land wherein i dwell eternally and that what is mine has been is and shall be yours for ever gods may change their kingdoms and their names men may live and die and live again once more to die empires may fall and those who ruled them be turned to forgotten dust yet true love endures immortal as the souls in which it was conceived and from it for you and me the night of woe and separation done at the daybreak which draws on there shall be born the splendour and the peace of union till that hour foredoomed seek me no more though i be ever near you as i have ever been till that most blessed hour horu farewell  she bent towards him her sweet lips touched his brow the perfume from her breath and hair beat upon him the light of her wondrous eyes searched out his very soul reading the answer that was written there  he stretched out his arms to clasp her and lo she was gone    it was a very cold and a very stiff smith who awoke on the following morning to find himself exactly where he had lain downnamely on a cement floor beneath the keel of a funeral boat in the central hall of the cairo museum he crept from his shelter shivering and looked at this hall to find it quite as empty as it had been on the previous evening not a sign or a token was there of pharaoh menes and all those kings and queens of whom he had dreamed so vividly  reflecting on the strange phantasies that weariness and excited nerves can summon to the mind in sleep smith made his way to the great doors and waited in the shadow praying earnestly that although it was the mohammedan sabbath someone might visit the museum to see that all was well  as a matter of fact someone did and before he had been there a minutea watchman going about his business he unlocked the place carelessly looking over his shoulder at a kite fighting with two nesting crows in an instant smith who was not minded to stop and answer questions had slipped past him and was gliding down the portico from monument to monument like a snake between boulders still keeping in the shadow as he headed for the gates  the attendant caught sight of him and uttered a yell of fear then since it is not good to look upon an afreet appearing from whence no mortal man could be he turned his head away when he looked again smith was through those gates and had mingled with the crowd in the street beyond  the sunshine was very pleasant to one who was conscious of having contracted a chill of the worst egyptian order from long contact with a damp stone floor smith walked on through it towards his hotelit was shepheards and more than a mile awaymaking up a story as he went to tell the hallporter of how he had gone to dine at mena house by the pyramids missed the last tram and stopped the night there  whilst he was thus engaged his left hand struck somewhat sharply against the corner of the cigarbox in his pocket that which contained the relic of the queen mamee the pain caused him to glance at his fingers to see if they were injured and to perceive on one of them the ring he wore surely surely it was not the same that the directorgeneral had given him that ring was engraved with the image of the god bes on this was cut the cartouche of her majesty mamee and he had dreamedoh he had dreamed    to this day smith is wondering whether in the hurry of the moment he made a mistake as to which of those rings the directorgeneral had given him as part of his share of the spoil of the royal tomb he discovered in the valley of queens afterwards smith wrote to ask but the directorgeneral could only remember that he gave him one of the two rings and assured him that that inscribed bes ank ank bes was with mamees other jewels in the gold room of the museum  also smith is wondering whether any other bronze figure of an old egyptian royalty shows so high a percentage of gold as on analysis the broken image of mamee was proved to do for had she not seemed to tell him a tale of the melting of a golden chain when that effigy was cast  was it all only a dream or was itsomething moreby day and by night he asks of nothingness  but be she near or far no answer comes from the queen mamee whose proud titles were her majesty the good god the justified dweller in osiris daughter of amen royal heiress royal sister royal wife royal mother lady of the two lands wearer of the double crown of the white crown of the red crown sweet flower of love beautiful eternally  so like the rest of us smith must wait to learn the truth concerning many things and more particularly as to which of those two circles of ancient gold the directorgeneral gave him yonder at cairo  it seems but a little matter yet it is more than all the worlds to him    to the astonishment of his colleagues in antiquarian research smith has never returned to egypt he explains to them that his health is quite restored and that he no longer needs this annual change to a more temperate clime    now which of the two royal rings did the directorgeneral return to smith on the mummied hand of her late majesty mamee      magepa the buck    in a preface to a story of the early life of the late allan quatermain known in africa as macumazahn which has been published under the name of marie mr curtis the brother of sir henry curtis tells of how he found a number of manuscripts that were left by mr quatermain in his house in yorkshire of these marie was one but in addition to it and sundry other completed records i the editor to whom it was directed that these manuscripts should be handed for publication have found a quantity of unclassified notes and papers some of these deal with matters that have to do with sport and game or with historical events and some are memoranda of incidents connected with the career of the writer or with remarkable occurrences that he had witnessed of which he does not speak elsewhere  one of these notesit is contained in a book much soiled and worn that evidently its owner had carried about with him for yearsreminds me of a conversation that i had with mr quatermain long ago when i was his guest in yorkshire the note itself is short i think that he must have jotted it down within an hour or two of the event to which it refers it runs thus   i wonder whether in the land beyond any recognition is granted for acts of great courage and unselfish devotiona kind of spiritual victoria cross if so i think it ought to be accorded to that poor old savage magepa as it would be if i had any voice in the matter upon my word he has made me feel proud of humanity and yet he was nothing but a nigger as so many call the kaffirs   for a while i the editor wondered to what this entry could allude then of a sudden it all came back to me i saw myself as a young man seated in the hall of quatermains house one evening after dinner with me were sir henry curtis and captain good we were smoking and the conversation had turned upon deeds of heroism each of us detailed such acts as he could remember which had made the most impression on him when we had finished old allan said    with your leave ill tell you a story of what i think was one of the bravest things i ever saw it happened at the beginning of the zulu war when the troops were marching into zululand now at that time as you know i was turning an honest penny transportriding for the government or rather for the military authorities i hired them three wagons with the necessary voorloopers and drivers sixteen good salted oxen to each wagon and myself in charge of the lot they paid me well never mind how muchi am rather ashamed to mention the amount the truth is that the imperial officers bought in a dear market during that zulu war moreover things were not always straight i could tell you stories of folk not all of them colonials who got rich quicker than they ought commissions and that kind of thing but perhaps these are better forgotten as for me i asked a good price for my wagons or rather for the hire of them of a very wellsatisfied young gentleman in uniform who had been exactly three weeks in the country and to my surprise got it but when i went to those in command and warned them what would happen if they persisted in their way of advance then in their pride they would not listen to the old hunter and transportrider but politely bowed me out if they had there would have been no isandhlwana disaster  he brooded awhile for as i knew this was a sore subject with him one on which he would rarely talk although he escaped himself quatermain had lost friends on that fatal field he went on  to return to old magepa i had known him for many years the first time we met was in the battle of the tugela i was fighting for the kings son umbelazi the handsome in the ranks of the tulwana regimenti mean to write all that story for it should not be lost well as i have told you before the tulwana were wiped out of the three thousand or so of them i think only about fifty remained alive after they had annihilated the three of cetewayos regiments that set upon them but as it chanced magepa was one who survived  i met him afterwards at old king pandas kraal and recognised him as having fought by my side whilst i was talking to him the prince cetewayo came by to me he was civil enough for he knew how i chanced to be in the battle but he glared at magepa and said  why macumazahn is not this man one of the dogs with which you tried to bite me by the tugela not long ago he must be a cunning dog also one who can run fast for how comes it that he lives to snarl when so many will never bark again ow if i had my way i would find a strip of hide to fit his neck  not so i answered he has the kings peace and he is a brave man braver than i am anyway prince seeing that i ran from the ranks of the tulwana while he stood where he was  you mean that your horse ran macumazahn well since you like this dog i will not hurt him and with a shrug he went his way  yet soon or late he will hurt me said magepa when the prince had gone ucetewayo has a memory long as the shadow thrown by a tree at sunset moreover as he knows well it is true that i ran macumazahn though not till all was finished and i could do no more by standing still you remember how after we had eaten up the first of cetewayos regiments the second charged us and we ate that up also well in that fight i got a tap on the head from a kerry it struck me on my mans ring which i had just put on for i think i was the youngest soldier in that regiment of veterans the ring saved me still for a while i lost my mind and lay like one dead when i found it again the fight was over and cetewayos people were searching for our wounded that they might kill them presently they found me and saw that there was no hurt on me  here is one who shams dead like a stinkcat said a big fellow lifting his spear  then it was that i sprang up and ran who was but just married and desired to live he struck at me but i jumped over the spear and the others that they threw missed me then they began to hunt me but macumazahn i who am named the buck because i am swifter of foot than any man in zululand outpaced them all and got away safe  well done magepa i said still remember the saying of your people at last the strong swimmer goes with the stream and the swift runner is run down  i know it macumazahn he answered with a nod and perhaps in a day to come i shall know it better  i took little heed of his words at the time but more than thirty years afterwards i remembered them  such was my first acquaintance with magepa now friends i will tell you how it was renewed at the time of the zulu war  as you know i was attached to the centre column that advanced into zululand by rorkes drift on the buffalo river before war was declared or at any rate before the advance began while it might have been and many thought it would be averted i was employed transportriding goods to the little rorkes drift station that which became so famous afterwards and incidentally in collecting what information i could of cetewayos intentions hearing that there was a kraal a mile or so the other side of the river of which the people were said to be very friendly to the english i determined to visit it you may think this was rash but i was so well known in zululand where for many years by special leave of the king i was allowed to go whither i would quite unmolested and indeed under the royal protection that i felt no fear for myself so long as i went alone  accordingly one evening i crossed the drift and headed for a kloof in which i was told the kraal stood ten minutes ride brought me in sight of it it was not a large kraal there may have been six or eight huts and a cattle enclosure surrounded by the usual fence the situation however was very pretty a knoll of rising ground backed by the wooded slopes of the kloof as i approached i saw women and children running to the kraal to hide and when i reached the gateway for some time no one would come out to meet me at length a small boy appeared who informed me that the kraal was empty as a gourd  quite so i answered still go and tell the headman that macumazahn wishes to speak with him  the boy departed and presently i saw a face that seemed familiar to me peeping round the edge of the gateway after a careful inspection its owner emerged  he was a tall thin man of indefinite age perhaps between sixty and seventy with a finelycut face a little grey beard kind eyes and very wellshaped hands and feet the fingers which twitched incessantly being remarkably long  greeting macumazahn he said i see you do not remember me well think of the battle of the tugela and of the last stand of the tulwana and of a certain talk at the kraal of our fatherwhoisdead that is king panda and of how he who sits in his place he meant cetewayo told you that if he had his way he would find a hide rope to fit the neck of a certain one  ah i said i know you now you are magepa the buck so the runner has not yet been run down  no macumazahn not yet but there is still time i think that many swift feet will be at work ere long  how have you prospered i asked him  well enough macumazahn in all ways except one i have three wives but my children have been few and are dead except one daughter who is married and lives with me for her husband too is dead he was killed by a buffalo and she has not yet married again but enter and see  so i went in and saw magepas wives old women all of them also at his bidding his daughter whose name was gita brought me some maas or curdled milk to drink she was a wellformed woman very like her father but sadfaced perhaps with a prescience of evil to come clinging to her finger was a beautiful boy of something under two years of age who when he saw magepa ran to him and threw his little arms about his legs the old man lifted the child and kissed him tenderly saying  it is well that this toddler and i should love one another macumazahn seeing that he is the last of my race all the other children here are those of the people who have come to live in my shadow  where are their fathers i asked patting the little boy who his mother told me was named sinala upon the cheek an attention that he resented  they have been called away on duty answered magepa shortly and i changed the subject  then we began to talk about old times and i asked him if he had any oxen to sell saying that this was my reason for visiting the kraal  nay macumazahn he answered in a meaning voice this year all the cattle are the kings  i nodded and replied that as it was so i had better be going whereon as i half expected magepa announced that he would see me safe to the drift so i bade farewell to the wives and the widowed daughter and we started  as soon as we were clear of the kraal magepa began to open his heart to me  macumazahn he said looking up at me earnestly for i was mounted and he walked beside my horse there is to be war cetewayo will not consent to the demands of the great white chief from the capehe meant sir bartle frerehe will fight with the english only he will let them begin the fighting he will draw them on into zululand and then overwhelm them with his impis and stamp them flat and eat them up and i who love the english am very sorry yes it makes my heart bleed if it were the boers now i should be glad for we zulus hate the boers but the english we do not hate even cetewayo likes them still he will eat them up if they attack him  indeed i answered and then as in duty bound i proceeded to get what i could out of him and that was not a little of course however i did not swallow it all since that i suspected that magepa was feeding me with news that he had been ordered to disseminate  presently we came to the mouth of the kloof in which the kraal stood and here for greater convenience of conversation we halted for i thought it as well that we should not be seen in close talk on the open plain beyond the path here i should add ran past a clump of green bushes i remember they bore a white flower that smelt sweet and were backed by some tall grass elephantgrass i think it was among which grew mimosa trees  magepa i said if in truth there is to be fighting why dont you move over the river one night with your people and cattle and get into natal  i would if i could macumazahn who have no stomach for this war against the english but there i should not be safe since presently the king will come into natal too or send thirty thousand assegais as his messengers then what will happen to those who have left him  oh if you think that i answered laughing you had better stay where you are  also macumazahn the husbands of those women at my kraal have been called up to their regiments and if their wives fled to the english they would be killed again the king has sent for nearly all our cattle to keep them safe he fears lest we border zulus might join our people in natal and that is why he is keeping our cattle safe  life is more than cattle magepa at least you might come  what and leave my people to be killed macumazahn you did not use to talk so still hearken macumazahn will you do me a service i will pay you well for it i would get my daughter gita and my little grandson sinala into safety if i and my wives are wiped out it does not matter for we are old but her i would save and the boy i would save so that one may live who will remember my name now if i were to send them across the drift say at the dawn not tomorrow and not the next day but the day after would you receive them into your wagon and deliver them safe to some place in natal i have money hidden fifty pieces of gold and you may take half of these and also half of the cattle if ever i live to get them back out of the keeping of the king  never mind about the money and we will speak of the cattle afterwards i said i understand that you wish to send your daughter and your little grandson out of danger and i think you wise very wise when once the advance begins if there is an advance who knows what may happen war is a rough game magepa it is not the custom of you black people to spare women and children and there will be zulus fighting on our side as well as on yours do you understand  ow i understand macumazahn i have known the face of war and seen many a little one like my grandson sinala assegaied upon his mothers back  very good but if i do this for you you must do something for me say magepa does cetewayo really mean to fight and if so how oh yes i know all you have been telling me but i want not words but truth from the heart  you ask secrets said the old fellow peering about him into the gathering gloom still a spear for a spear and a shield for a shield as our saying runs i have spoken no lie the king does mean to fight not because he wants to but because the regiments swear that they will wash their assegais they who have never seen blood since that battle of the tugela in which we two played a part and if he will not suffer it well there are more of his race also he means to fight thus and he gave me some very useful information that is information which would have been useful if those in authority had deigned to pay any attention to it when i passed it on  just as he had finished speaking i thought that i heard a sound in the dense green bush behind us it reminded me of the noise a man makes when he tries to stifle a cough and frightened me for if we had been overheard by a spy magepa was as good as dead and the sooner i was across the river the better  whats that i asked  a bush buck macumazahn there are lots of them about here  not being satisfied though it is true that buck do cough like this i turned my horse to the bush seeking an opening thereon something crashed away and vanished into the long grass in those shadows of course i could not see what it was but such light as remained glinted on what might have been the polished tip of the horn of an antelope oran assegai  i told you it was a buck macumazahn said magepa still if you smell danger let us come away from the bush though the orders are that no white man is to be touched as yet  then while we walked on towards the ford he set out with great detail as kaffirs do the exact arrangements that he proposed to make for the handing over of his daughter and her child into my care i remember that i asked him why he would not send her on the following morning instead of two mornings later he answered because he expected an outpost of scouts from one of the regiments at his kraal that night who would probably remain there over the morrow and perhaps longer while they were in the place it would be difficult if not impossible for him to send away gita and her son without exciting suspicion  near the drift we parted and i returned to our provisional camp and wrote a beautiful report of all that i had learned of which report i may add no one took the slightest notice  i think it was the morning before that whereon i had arranged to meet gita and the little boy at the drift that just about dawn i went down to the river for a wash having taken my dip i climbed on to a flat rock to dress myself and looked at the billows of beautiful pearly mist which hid the face of the water and consideredi almost said listened tothe great silence for as yet no live thing was stirring  ah if i had known of the hideous sights and sounds that were destined to be heard ere long in this same haunt of perfect peace indeed at that moment there came a kind of hint or premonition of them since suddenly through the utter quiet broke the bloodcurdling wail of a woman it was followed by other wails and shouts distant and yet distinct then the silence fell again  now i thought to myself that noise might very well have come from old magepas kraal luckily however sounds are deceptive in mist  well the end of it was that i waited there till the sun rose the first thing on which its bright beams struck was a mighty column of smoke rising to heaven from where magepas kraal had stood  i went back to my wagons very sadso sad that i could scarcely eat my breakfast while i walked i wondered hard whether the light had glinted upon the tip of a bucks horn in that patch of green bush with the sweetsmelling white flowers a night or two ago or had it perchance fallen upon the point of the assegai of some spy who was watching my movements in that event yonder column of smoke and the horrible cries that preceded it were easy to explain for had not magepa and i talked secrets together and in zulu  on the following morning at dawn i attended at the drift in the faint hope that gita and her boy might arrive there as arranged but nobody came which was not wonderful seeing that gita lay dead stabbed through and through as i saw afterwards she made a good fight for the child and that her spirit had gone to wherever go the souls of the bravehearted be they white or black only on the farther bank of the river i saw some zulu scouts who seemed to know my errand for they called to me asking mockingly where was the pretty woman i had come to meet  after that i tried to put the matter out of my head which indeed was full enough of other things since now definite orders had arrived as to the advance and with these many troops and officers  it was just then that the zulus began to fire across the river at such of our people as they saw upon the bank at these they took aim and as a result hit nobody a raw kaffir with a rifle in my experience is only dangerous when he aims at nothing for then the bullet looks after itself and may catch you to put a stop to this nuisance a regiment of the friendly nativesthere may have been several hundred of themwas directed to cross the river and clear the kloofs and rocks of the zulu skirmishers who were hidden among them i watched them go off in fine style and in the course of the afternoon heard a good deal of shouting and banging of guns on the farther side of the river  towards evening someone told me that our impi as he called it grandiloquently was returning victorious having at the moment nothing else to do i walked down to the river at a point where the water was deep and the banks were high here i climbed to the top of a pile of boulders whence with my fieldglasses i could sweep a great extent of plain which stretched away on the zululand side till at length it merged into hills and bush  presently i saw some of our natives marching homewards in a scattered and disorganised fashion but evidently very proud of themselves for they were waving their assegais and singing scraps of warsongs a few minutes later a mile or more away i caught sight of a man running  watching him through the glasses i noted three things first that he was tall secondly that he ran with extraordinary swiftness and thirdly that he had something tied upon his back it was evident further that he had good reason to run since he was being hunted by a number of our kaffirs of whom more and more continually joined the chase from every side they poured down upon him trying to cut him off and kill him for as they got nearer i could see the assegais which they threw at him flash in the sunlight  very soon i understood that the man was running with a definite object and to a definite point he was trying to reach the river i thought the sight very pitiful this one poor creature being hunted to death by so many also i wondered why he did not free himself from the bundle on his back and came to the conclusion that he must be a witchdoctor and that the bundle contained his precious charms or medicines  this was while he was yet a long way off but when he came nearer within three or four hundred yards of a sudden i caught the outline of his face against a good background and knew it for that of magepa  my god i said to myself it is old magepa the buck and the bundle in the mat will be his grandson sinala  yes even then i felt certain that he was carrying the child upon his back  what was i to do it was impossible for me to cross the river at that place and long before i could get round by the ford all would be finished i stood up on my rock and shouted to those brutes of kaffirs to let the man alone they were so excited that they did not hear my words at least they swore afterwards that they thought i was encouraging them to hunt him down  but magepa heard me at the moment he seemed to be failing but the sight of me appeared to give him fresh strength he gathered himself together and leapt forward at a really surprising speed now the river was not more than three hundred yards away from him and for the first two hundred of these he quite outdistanced his pursuers although they were most of them young men and comparatively fresh then once more his strength began to fail  watching through the glasses i could see that his mouth was wide open and that there was red foam upon his lips the burden on his back was dragging him down once he lifted his hands as though to loose it then with a wild gesture let them fall again  two of the pursuers who had outpaced the others crept up to himlank lean men of not more than thirty years of age they had stabbing spears in their hands such as are used at close quarters and these of course they did not throw one of them gained a little on the other  now magepa was not more than fifty yards from the bank with the first hunter about ten paces behind him and coming up rapidly magepa glanced over his shoulder and saw then put out his last strength for forty yards he went like an arrow running straight away from his pursuers until he was within a few feet of the bank when he stumbled and fell  hes done i said and upon my word if i had had a rifle in my hand i think i would have stopped one or both of those bloodhounds and taken the consequences  but no just as the first man lifted his broad spear to stab him through the back on which the bundle lay magepa leapt up and wheeled round to take the thrust in the chest evidently he did not wish to be speared in the backfor a certain reason he took it sure enough for the assegai was wrenched out of the hand of the striker still as he was reeling backwards it did not go through magepa or perhaps it hit a bone he drew out the spear and threw it at the man wounding him then he staggered on back and back to the edge of the little cliff  it was reached at last with a cry of help me macumazahn magepa turned and before the other man could spear him leapt straight into the deep water he rose yes the brave old fellow rose and struck out for the other bank leaving a little line of red behind him  i rushed or rather sprang and rolled down to the edge of the stream to where a point of shingle ran out into the water along this i clambered and beyond it up to my middle now magepa was being swept past me i caught his outstretched hand and pulled him ashore  the boy he gasped the boy is he dead  i severed the lashings of the mat that had cut right into the old fellows shoulders inside of it was little sinala spluttering out water but very evidently alive and unhurt for presently he set up a yell  no i said he lives and will live  then all is well macumazahn a pause it was a spy in the bush not a buck he overheard our talk the kings slayers came gita held the door of the hut while i took the child cut a hole through the straw with my assegai and crept out at the back she was full of spears before she died but i got away with the boy till your kaffirs found me i lay hid in the bush hoping to escape to natal then i ran for the river and saw you on the farther bank i might have got away but that child is heavy a pause give him food macumazahn he must be hungry a pause farewell that was a good saying of yoursthe swift runner is outrun at last ah yet i did not run in vain another pause the last then he lifted himself upon one arm and with the other saluted first the boy sinala and next me muttering remember your promise macumazahn  that is how magepa the buck died i never saw anyone carrying weight who could run quite so well as he and quatermain turned his head away as though the memory of this incident affected him somewhat  what became of the child sinala i asked presently  oh i sent him to an institution in natal and afterwards was able to get some of his property back for him i believe that he is being trained as an interpreter      the blue curtains    i  in his regiment familiarly they called him bottles nobody quite knew why it was however rumoured that he had been called bottles at harrow on account of the shape of his nose not that his nose was particularly like a bottle but at the end of it was round and large and thick in reality however the sobriquet was more ancient than that for it had belonged to the hero of this story from babyhood now when a man has a nickname it generally implies two things first that he is goodtempered and secondly that he is a good fellow bottles alias john george peritt of a regiment it is unnecessary to name amply justified both these definitions for a kindliertempered or better fellow never breathed but unless a thick round nose a pair of small lightcoloured eyes set under bushy brows and a large but not badly shaped mouth can be said to constitute beauty he was not beautiful on the other hand however he was big and wellformed and a pleasantmannered if a rather silent companion  many years ago bottles was in love all the regiment knew it he was so very palpably and completely in love over his bed in his tidy quarters hung the photograph of a young lady who was known to be the young lady which when the regiment individually and collectively happened to see it left no doubt in its mind as to their comrades taste it was evident even from that badlycoloured photograph that miss madeline spenser had the makings of a lovely figure and a pair of wonderful eyes it was said however that she had not a sixpence and as our hero had but very few the married ladies of the battalion used frequently to speculate how mr peritt would manage when it came to matrimony  at this date the regiment was quartered in maritzburg natal but its term of foreign service had expired and it expected to be ordered home immediately  one morning bottles had been out buck hunting with the scratch pack kept in those days by the garrison at maritzburg the run had been a good one and after a seven or eightmile gallop over the open country they had actually killed their bucka beautiful oribe this was a thing that did not often happen and bottles returned filled with joy and pride with the buck fastened behind his saddle for he was whip to the pack the hounds had met at dawn and it was nine oclock or so when as he was riding hot and tired up the shadier side of broad and dusty church street a gun fired at the fort beyond government house announced the arrival of the english mail  with a beaming smilefor to him the english mail meant one if not two letters from madeline and possibly the glad news of sailing ordershe pushed on to his quarters tubbed and dressed and then went down to the messhouse for breakfast expecting to find the letters delivered but the mail was a heavy one and he had ample time to eat his breakfast also to sit and smoke a pipe upon the pleasant verandah under the shade of the bamboos and camellia bushes before the orderly arrived with the bag bottles went at once into the room that opened on to the veranda and stood by calmly not being given to betraying his emotions while slowly and clumsily the mess sergeant sorted the letters at last he got his packetit only consisted of some newspapers and a single letterand went away back to his seat on the veranda feeling rather disappointed for he had expected to hear from his only brother as well as from his ladylove having relit his pipefor he was of a slow and deliberate mind and it rather enhances a pleasure to defer it a littleand settled himself in the big chair opposite the camellia bush just now covered with sealingwaxlike blooms he opened his letter and read   my dear george   good heavens he thought to himself what can be the matter she always calls me darling bottles   my dear george he began again i hardly know how to begin this letteri can scarcely see the paper for crying and when i think of you reading it out in that horrid country it makes me cry more than ever there i may as well get it out at once for it does not improve by keepingit is all over between you and me my dear dear old bottles   all over he gasped to himself   i hardly know how to tell the miserable story went on the letter but as it must be told i suppose i had better begin from the beginning a month ago i went with my father and my aunt to the hunt ball at atherton and there i met sir alfred croston a middleaged gentleman who danced with me several times i did not care about him much but he made himself very agreeable and when i got home auntyou know her nasty waycongratulated me on my conquest well next day he came to call and papa asked him to stop to dinner and he took me in and before he went away he told me that he was coming to stop at the george inn to fish for trout in the lake after that he came here every day and whenever i went out walking he always met me and really was kind and nice at last one day he asked me to marry him and i was very angry and told him that i was engaged to a gentleman in the army who was in south africa he laughed and said south africa was a long way off and i hated him for it that evening papa and aunt set on meyou know they neither of them liked our engagementand told me that our affair was perfectly silly and that i must be mad to refuse such an offer and so it went on for he would not take no for an answer and at last dear i had to give in for they gave me no peace and papa implored me to consent for his sake he said the marriage would be the making of him and now i suppose i am engaged dear dear george dont be angry with me for it is not my fault and i suppose after all we could not have got married for we have so little money i do love you but i cant help myself i hope you wont forget me or marry anybody elseat least not just at presentfor i cannot bear to think about it write to me and tell me you wont forget me and that you are not angry with me do you want your letters back if you burn mine that will do goodbye dear if you only knew what i suffer it is all very well to talk like aunt does about settlements and diamonds but they cant make up to me for you goodbye dear i cannot write any more because my head aches soever yours  madeline spenser   when george peritt alias bottles had finished reading and rereading this letter he folded it up neatly and put it after his methodical fashion into his pocket then he sat and stared at the red camellia blooms before him that somehow looked as indistinct and misty as though they were fifty yards off instead of so many inches  it is a great blow he said to himself poor madeline how she must suffer  presently he rose and walkedrather unsteadily for he felt much upsetto his quarters and taking a sheet of notepaper wrote the following letter to catch the outgoing mail   my dear madelinei have got your letter putting an end to our engagement i dont want to dwell on myself when you must have so much to suffer but i must say that it has been and is a great blow to me i have loved you for so many years ever since we were babies i think it does seem hard to lose you now after all i thought that when we got home i might get the adjutancy of a militia regiment and that we might have been married i think we might have managed on five hundred a year though perhaps i have no right to expect you to give up comforts and luxuries to which you are accustomed but i am afraid that when one is in love one is apt to be selfish however all that is done with now as of course putting everything else aside i could not think of standing in your way in life i love you much too well for that dear madeline and you are too beautiful and delicate to be the wife of a poor subaltern with little beside his pay i can honestly say that i hope you will be happy i dont ask you to think of me too often as that might make you less so but perhaps sometimes when you are quiet you will spare your old lover a thought or two because i am sure nobody could care for you more than i do you need not be afraid that i shall forget you or marry anybody else i shall do neither the one nor the other i must close this now to catch the mail i dont know that there is anything more to say it is a hard trialvery but it is no good being weak and giving way and it consoles me to think that you are bettering yourself as the servants say goodbye dear madeline may god bless you is now and ever my earnest prayer  j g peritt   scarcely was this letter finished and hastily dispatched when a loud voice was heard calling bottles bottles my boy come rejoice with me the orders have comewe sail in a fortnight followed by the owner of the voice another subaltern and our heros bosom friend why you dont seem very elated said he of the voice noting his friends dejected and somewhat dazed appearance  nothat is not particularly so you sail in a fortnight do you  you sail what do you mean why we all sail of course from the colonel down to the drummerboy  i dont think that ii am going to sail jack was the hesitating answer  look here old fellow are you off your head or have you been liquoring up or what  nothat is i dont think so certainly not the firstthe second i mean  then what do you mean  i mean that in short i am sending in my papers i like this climate i in short am going to take to farming  sending in your papers going to take to farming and in this godforsaken hole too you must be screwed  no indeed it is only ten oclock  and how about getting married and the girl you are engaged to and whom you are looking forward so much to seeing is she going to take to farming  bottles winced visibly  no you seein short we have put an end to that i am not engaged now  oh indeed said the friend and awkwardly departed    ii  twelve years have passed since bottles sent in his papers and in twelve years many things happen amongst them recently it had happened that our heros only and elder brother had owing to an unexpected development of consumption among the expectant heirs tumbled into a baronetcy and eight thousand a year and bottles himself into a modest but to him most ample fortune of as many hundred when the news reached him he was the captain of a volunteer corps engaged in one of the numerous basuto wars in the cape colony he served the campaign out and then in obedience to his brothers entreaties and a natural craving to see his native land after an absence of nearly fourteen years resigned his commission and returned to england  thus it came to pass that the next scene of this little history opens not upon the south african veld or in a whitewashed house in some halfgrown hobbledehoy colonial town but in a set of the most comfortable chambers in the albany the local and appropriate habitation of the bachelor brother aforesaid sir eustace peritt  in a very comfortable armchair in front of a warm fire for the month is november sits the bottles of old daysbigger uglier shyer than ever and in addition disfigured by an assegai wound through the cheek opposite to him and peering at him occasionally with fond curiosity through an eyeglass is his brother a very different stamp of man sir eustace peritt is a wellpreserved londonlooking gentleman of apparently any age between thirty and fifty his eye is so bright his figure so well preserved that to judge from appearances alone you would put him down to the former age but when you come to know him so as to be able to measure his consummate knowledge of the world and to have the opportunity of reflecting upon the goodnatured but profound cynicism which pleasantly pervades his talk as absolutely as the flavour of lemon pervades rum punch you would be inclined to assign his natal day to a much earlier date in reality he was forty neither more nor less and had both preserved his youthful appearance and gained the mellowness of his experience by a judicious use of the opportunities of life  well my dear george said sir eustace addressing his brotherdetermined to take this occasion of meeting after so long a time to be rid of the nickname bottles which he hatedi havent had such a pleasure for years  asas what  as meeting you again of course when i saw you on the vessel i knew you at once you have not changed at all unless expansion can be called a change  nor have you eustace unless contraction can be called a change your waist used to be bigger you know  ah george i drank beer in those days it is one of things of which i have lived to see the folly in fact there are not many things of which i have not lived to see the folly  except living itself i suppose  exactlyexcept living i have no wish to follow the example of our poor cousins he answered with a sigh to whose considerate behaviour however he added brightening we owe our present improved position then came a pause  fourteen years is a long time george you must have had a rough time of it  yes pretty rough i have seen a good deal of irregular service you know  and never got anything out of it i suppose  oh yes i have got my bread and butter which is all i am worth  sir eustace looked at his brother doubtfully through his eyeglass you are modest he said that does not do you must have a better opinion of yourself if you want to get on in the world  i dont want to get on i am quite content to earn a living and i am modest because i have seen so many better men fare worse  but now you need not earn a living any more what do you propose to do live in town i can set you going in a very good lot you will be quite a lion with that hole in your cheekby the way you must tell me the story and then you see if anything happens to me you stand in for the title and estates that will be quite enough to float you  bottles writhed uneasily in his chair thank you eustace but really i must ask youin short i dont want to be floated or anything of the sort i would rather go back to south africa and my volunteer corps i would indeed i hate strangers and society and all that sort of thing im not fit for it like you  then what do you mean to doget married and live in the country  bottles coloured a little through his suntanned skina fact that did not escape the eyeglass of his observant brother no i am not going to get married certainly not  by the way said sir eustace carelessly i saw your old flame lady croston yesterday and told her you were coming home she makes a charming widow  what ejaculated his brother slowly raising himself out of his chair in astonishment is her husband dead  dead yes died a year ago and a good riddance too he appointed me one of his executors i am sure i dont know why for we never liked each other i think he was the most disagreeable fellow i ever knew they say he gave his wife a roughish time of it occasionally serve her right too  why did it serve her right  sir eustace shrugged his shoulders  when a heartless girl jilts the fellow she is engaged to in order to sell herself to an elderly beast i think she deserves all she gets this one did not get half enough indeed she has made a good thing of itbetter than she expected  his brother sat down again before he answered in a constrained voice dont you think you are rather hard on her eustace  hard on her no not a bit of it of all the worthless women that i know i think madeline croston is the most worthless look how she treated you  eustace broke in his brother almost sharply if you dont mind i wish you would not talk of her like that to me i cantin short i dont like it  sir eustaces eyeglass dropped out of sir eustaces eyehe had opened it so wide to stare at his brother why my dear fellow he ejaculated you dont mean to tell me you still care for that woman  his brother twisted his great form about uncomfortably in the low chair as he answered i dont know im sure about caring for her but i dont like to hear you say such things about her  sir eustace whistled softly i am sorry if i offended you old fellow he said i had no idea that it was still a sore point with you you must be a faithful people in south africa here the holy feelings of the heart are shorter lived we wear out several generations of them in twelve years    iii  bottles did not go to bed till late that night long after sir eustace who always careful of his health never stopped up late if he could avoid ithad vanished yawning his brother sat smoking pipe after pipe and thinking he had sat many times in the same way on a wagonbox in the african veld or up where the moonlight turned the falls of the zambesi into a rushing cataract of silver or alone in his tent when all the camp was sleeping round him it was a habit of this queer silent man to sit and think for hours at night and arose to a great extent from an incapacity to sleep that was the weak point in his constitution  as for his meditations they were various but mostly the outcome of a curious speculative side to his nature which he never revealed to the outside world dreams of a happiness of which heretofore his hard life had given him no glimpse semimystical religious meditations upon the great unknown around us and grand schemes for the regeneration of mankindall formed part of them  but there was one central thought the fixed star of his mind round which all the others continually revolved taking their light and colour from it and that was the thought of madeline croston the woman to whom he had been engaged years and years had passed since he had seen her face and yet it was always present to him beyond the occasional mention of her name in some society paperseveral of which by the way he took in for years and conscientiously searched on the chance of finding ittill this evening he had never even seen it or heard it spoken and yet with all the tenacity of his strong deep nature he clung to her dear memory that she had left him to marry another man weighed as nothing in the balance of his love once she had loved him and thereby he was repaid for the devotion of his life he had no ambitions madeline had been his great ambition and when that had fallen all the others had fallen with it even to the dust he simply did his duty whatever it might be as well as in him lay without fear of blame or hope of praiseshunning men and never if he could avoid it speaking to a woman content to earn his livelihood and for the rest rendered colourless by his secret and pathetic passion  and now it appeared that madeline was a widow which meantand his heart beat fast at the thoughtthat she was a free woman madeline was a free woman and he was within a few minutes walk of her no thousands of miles of ocean rolled between them now he rose went to the table and consulted a red book that lay on it there was the addressa house in grosvenor street overcome by an uncontrollable impulse he went out of the room going to his own he found his mackintosh and a round hat and softly left the house it was then past two in the morning pouring with rain and blowing hard  he had been a little in london as a lad and remembered the main thoroughfares so had no great difficulty in finding his way up piccadilly till he came to park lane into which the red book told him grosvenor square opened but to find grosvenor street itself was a more difficult matter and at such a time on such a night there was naturally nobody to askleast of all a policeman at last he found it and hurried on down the street with a quickening pulse what he was hurrying to he could not tell but that overmastering impulse forced him on quicker and quicker yet  suddenly he halted and examined the number of one of the houses by the faint and struggling light from the nearest lamp it was her house now there was nothing between them but a few feet of space and fourteen inches of brickwork he crossed over to the other side of the street and looked up at the house but could scarcely make it out through the driving rain there was no light in the house and no sign of life about the street but there were both light and life in the heart of this watcher all the pulses of his blood were astir keeping time with the commotion of his mind he stood there in the shadow gazing at the murky house heedless of the bitter wind and pelting rain and felt his life and spirit pass out of his control into an unknown dominion the storm that raged around him was nothing to the convulsion of his inner self in that hour of madness which was yet happiness yet as it had arisen thus suddenly so with equal swiftness it died away and left him standing there with a chill sense of folly in his mind and of the bitter weather in his body for on such a night a mackintosh and a dress coat were not adapted to keep the most ardent lover warm he shivered and turning made his way back to albany feeling heartily ashamed of himself and his midnight expedition and heartily glad that no one knew of it except himself  on the following day bottlesfor convenience sake we still call him by his old nicknamewas obliged to see a lawyer with reference to the money which he had inherited and to search for a box which had gone astray aboard the steamer also to buy a tall hat such as he had not worn for fourteen years so that between one thing and another it was halfpast four before he got back to the albany here he donned the new hat which did not fit very well and a new black coat which fitted so well that it seemed to cut into his large frame in every possible direction and departed furiously struggling with a pair of gloves also new for grosvenor street  a quarter of an hours walk for he knew the road this time brought him to the house glancing for a while at the spot where he had stood on the previous night he walked up the steps and pulled the bell though he looked bold enough outwardlyindeed rather imposing than otherwisewith his broad shoulders and the great scar on his bronzed face his breast was full of terrors in these however he had not much time to indulge for a footman still decked in the trappings of vicarious grief opened the door with the most startling promptitude and he was ushered upstairs into a small but richly furnished room  madeline was not in the room though to judge from the lace handkerchief lying on the floor by a low chair and the open novel on a little wicker table alongside she had not left it long the footman departed saying in a magnificent undertone that her ladyship should be informed and left our hero to enjoy his sensations being one of those people whom suspense of any sort makes fidgety he employed himself in looking at the pictures and china even going so far as to walk to a pair of very heavy blue velvet curtains that apparently communicated with another room and peep through them at a much larger apartment of which the furniture was done up in ghostlylooking bags  retreating from this melancholy sight finally he took up a position on the hearthrug and waited would she be angry with him for coming he wondered would it recall things she had rather forget but perhaps she had already forgotten themit was so long ago would she be very much changed perhaps he should not know her perhapsbut here he happened to lift his eyes and there standing between the two blue velvet curtains was madeline now a woman in the full splendour of a remarkable beauty and showing as yet at any rate in that dull november twilight no traces of her years there she stood her large dark eyes fixed upon him with a look of wistful curiosity her shapely lips just parted to speak and her bosom gently heaving as though with trouble  poor bottles one look was enough there was no chance of his attaining the blessed haven of disillusionment in five seconds he was farther out to sea than ever when she knew that he had seen her she dropped her eyes a littlehe saw the long curved lashes appear against her cheek and moved forward  how do you do she said softly extending her slim cool hand  he took the hand and shook it but for the life of him could think of nothing to say not one of the little speeches he had prepared would come into his mind yet the desperate necessity of saying something forced itself upon him  how do you do he ejaculated with a jerk itits very cold isnt it  this remark was such an utter and ludicrous fiasco that lady croston could not choose but laugh a little  i see she said that you have not got over your shyness  it is a long while since we met he blurted out  i am very glad to see you was her simple answer now sit down and talk to me tell me all about yourself stop before you beginhow very curious it is do you know i dreamed about you last nightsuch a curious painful dream i dreamed that i was asleep in my roomwhich indeed i wasand that it was blowing a gale and raining in torrentswhich i believe it was alsoso there is nothing very wonderful about that but now comes the odd part i dreamed that you were standing out in the rain and wind and yet looking at me as though you saw me i could not see your face because you were in the dark but i knew it was you then i woke up with a start it was a most vivid dream and now today you have come to see me after all these years  he shifted his legs uneasily considering the facts of the case her dream frightened him which was not strange fortunately at that moment the impressive footman arrived with the teathings and asked whether he should light the lamps  no said lady croston put some wood on the fire she knew that she looked her very best in those halflights  then when she had given him his tea delighting him by remembering that he did not like sugar she fell to drawing him out about the wild life he had been leading  by the way she said presently perhaps you can tell mea few days ago i bought a book for my boyshe had two childrenall about brave deeds and that sort of thing and in it there was a story of a volunteer officer in south africa the name was not mentioned which interested me very much did you ever hear of it it was this the officer was in command of a fort containing a force that was operating against a native chief while he was away the chief sent a flag of truce down to the fort which was fired on by some of the volunteers in the fort because there was a man among the truce party against whom they had a spite just afterwards the officer returned and was very angry that such a thing had been done by englishmen whose duty it was he said to teach all the world what honour meant  now comes the brave part of the story without saying any more and notwithstanding the entreaties of his men who knew that in all probability he was going to a death by torture for he was so brave that the natives had set a great price upon him wishing to kill him and use his body for medicine which they thought would make them as brave as he was that officer rode out far away into the mountains with only an interpreter and a white handkerchief till he came to the chiefs stronghold but when the natives saw him coming holding up his white handkerchief they did not fire at him as his men had fired at them because they were so astonished at his bravery that they thought he must be mad or inspired so he came straight on to the walls of the stronghold called to the chief and begged his pardon for what had happened and then rode away again unharmed shortly afterwards the chief having captured some of the officers volunteers whom in the ordinary course of affairs he would have tortured to death sent them back again untouched with a message to the effect that he would show the english officer that he was not the only man who could behave like a gentleman i should like to know that man do you know who he was  bottles looked uncomfortable as well he might for it was an incident in his own career but her praise and enthusiasm sent a flush of pride into his face  i believe it was some fellow in the basuto war he said prevaricating with peculiar awkwardness  oh then it is a true story  yesthat is it is partially true there was nothing heroic about it it was a necessary act if our honour as fair opponents was to continue to be worth anything  but who was the man she asked fixing her dark eyes on him suspiciously  the man he stammered oh the manwell in short and he stopped  in short george she put in for the first time calling him by his christian name that man was you and i am so proud of you george  it was very hateful to him in a way for he loathed that kind of personal adulation even from her he was so intensely modest he had never even reported the incident in question it had come out in some roundabout way yet he could not but feel happy that she had found him out it was a great deal to him to have moved her and her sparkling eyes and heaving bosom showed that she was somewhat moved  he looked up and his eyes caught hers the room was nearly dark now but the bright flame from the wood the servant had put on the fire played upon her face his eyes caught hers and there was a look in them from which he could not escape even if he had wished to do so she had thrown her head back so that the coronet of her glossy hair rested upon the back of her low seat and thus without strain could look straight up into his face he had risen and was standing by the mantelpiece a slow sweet smile grew upon the perfect face and the dark eyes became soft and luminous as though they shone through tears  in another second it had ended as she thought that it would end and had intended that it should end the great strong man was downyes down on his knees before her one trembling hand catching at the arm of her chair and the other clasping her tapering fingers there was no hesitation or awkwardness about him now the greatness of his longpent passion inspired him and he told her all without let or stopall that he had suffered for her sake throughout those lonely years all his wretched hopelessness keeping nothing back  much she did not understand such a passion as this was too deep to be fathomed by her shallow lines too soaring for her to net in her worldstraitened imagination once or twice even his exalted notions made her smile it seemed ridiculous knowing the world as she did that any man should think thus of any woman nor when at length he had finished did she attempt an answer feeling that her strength lay in silence for she had a poor case at least the only argument that she used was a purely feminine one but perfectly effective she bent her beautiful face towards him and he kissed it again and again    iv  the revulsion of feeling experienced by bottles as he hurried back to the albany to dress for dinnerfor he was to dine with his brother at one of his clubs that nightwas so extraordinary and overwhelming that it took him figuratively speaking off his legs as yet his mind so long accustomed to perpetual misfortune in this the ruling passion of his life could not quite grasp his luck that he should after all have won back his lost madeline seemed altogether too good to be true  as it happened sir eustace had asked one or two men to meet him amongst them an undersecretary for the colonies who having to prepare for a severe crossexamination in the house upon south african affairs had jumped at the opportunity of sucking the brains of a man thoroughly acquainted with the subject but the expectant undersecretary was destined to meet with a grievous disappointment for out of bottles came no good thing for the most part of the dinner he sat silent only speaking when directly addressed and then answering so much at random that the undersecretary quickly came to the conclusion that sir eustaces brother was either a fool or that he had drunk too much  sir eustace himself saw that his brothers taciturnity had spoilt his little dinner and his temper was not improved thereby he was not accustomed to have his dinners spoiled and felt that so far as the undersecretary was concerned he had put himself into a false position  my dear george he said in a tone of bland exasperation when they had got back to the albany i wonder what can be the matter with you i told atherleigh that you would be able to post him up thoroughly about all this bechuana mess and he could not get a word out of you  his brother absently filled his pipe before he answered  the bechuanas oh yes i know all about them i lived among them for a year  then why on earth didnt you tell him what you knew you put me in rather a false position  i am very sorry eustace he answered humbly i will go and see him if you like and explain the thing to him tomorrow the fact of the matter is i was thinking of something else  sir eustace interrogated him with a look  i was thinking he went on slowly about madabout lady croston  oh  i went to see her this afternoon and i think i hope that i am going to marry her  if bottles expected that this great news would be received by his elder brother as such news ought to be receivedwith congratulatory rejoicinghe was destined to be disappointed  good heavens ejaculated sir eustace shortly letting his eyeglass drop  why do you say that eustace bottles asked uneasily  becausebecause answered his brother in the emphatic tone which was his equivalent for strong language you must be mad to think of such a thing  why must i be mad  because you still a young man with all your life before you deliberately propose to tie yourself up to a middleaged and passee womanshe is extremely passee by daylight let me tell youwho has already treated you like a dog and is burdened with a couple of children and who if she marries again will bring you very little except her luxurious tastes but i expected this i thought she would try to catch you with those languishing black eyes of hers you are not the first i know her of old  if said his brother rising in dudgeon you are going to abuse madeline to me i think i had better say good night for we shall quarrelwhich i would not do for anything  sir eustace shrugged his shoulders those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad he muttered as he lit his hand candle this is what comes of a course of south africa  but sir eustace was an amenable man his favourite motto was live and let live and having given the matter his best consideration during the lengthy process of shaving himself on the following morning he came to the conclusion reluctantly enough it must be owned that it was evident that his brother meant to have his own way and therefore the best thing to be done was to fall in with his views and trust to the chapter of accidents to bring the thing to naught sir eustace for all his apparent worldliness and cynicism was a good fellow at heart and cherished a warm affection for his awkward taciturn brother he also cherished a great dislike for lady croston whose character he thoroughly understood he saw a good deal of her it is true because he happened to be one of the executors of her husbands will and since he had come into the baronetcy it had struck him that she had developed a considerable partiality for his society    the idea of a marriage between his brother and his brothers old flame was in every way distasteful to him in the first place under her husbands will madeline would bring comparatively speaking relatively little with her should she marry again that was one objection another and still more forcible one from sir eustaces point of view was that at her time of life she was not likely to present the house of peritt with an heir now sir eustace had not the slightest intention of marrying matrimony was he considered an excellent institution and necessary to the carrying on of the world in a respectable manner but it was not one with which he was anxious to identify himself therefore if his brother married at all it was his earnest desire that the union should bring children to inherit the title and estates prominent above both these excellent reasons stood his intense distrust and dislike of the lady  needs must however when the devil by whom he understood madeline drives he was not going to quarrel with his only brother and presumptive heir because he chose to marry a woman who was not to his taste so he shrugged his shouldershaving finished his shaving and his reflections togetherand determined to put the best possible face on his disappointment  well george he said to his brother at breakfast so you are going to marry lady croston  bottles looked up surprised yes eustace he answered if she will marry me  sir eustace glanced at him i thought the affair was settled he said  bottles rubbed his big nose reflectively as he answered well no i dont think that marriage was mentioned but i suppose she means to marry me in short i dont see how she could mean anything else  sir eustace breathed more freely guessing what had taken place so there was as yet no actual engagement  when are you going to see her again  tomorrow she is engaged all today  his brother took out a pocketbook and consulted it then i am more fortunate than you are he said i have an appointment with lady croston this evening after dinner dont look jealous old fellow it is only about some executors business i think i told you that i am one of her husbands executors blessings on his memory she is a peculiar woman your inamorata and swears that she wont trust her lawyers so i have to do all the dirty work myself worse luck you had better come too  shant i be in the way asked bottles doubtfully struggling feebly against the bribe  it is evident my dear fellow that you cannot be de trop i shall present my papers for signature and vanish you ought to be infinitely obliged to me for giving you such a chance we will consider that settled we will dine together and go round to grosvenor street afterwards  bottles agreed could he have seen the little scheme that was dawning in his brothers brain perhaps he would not have assented so readily  when her old lover went away reluctantly to dress for dinner on the previous day madeline croston sat down to have a good think and the result was not entirely satisfactory it had been very pleasant to see him and his passionate declaration of enduring love thrilled her through and through and even woke an echo in her own breast it made her proud to think that this man who notwithstanding his ugliness and awkwardness was yet her instinct told her worth half a dozen smart london fashionables still loved her and had never ceased to love her poor bottles she had been very fond of him once they had grown up together and it really gave her some cruel hours when a sense of what she owed to herself and her family had forced her to discard him  she remembered as she sat there this evening how at the time she had wondered if it was worth itif life would not be brighter and happier if she made up her mind to fight through it by her honest lovers side well she could answer that question now it had been well worth it she had not liked her husband it is true but on the whole she had enjoyed a good time and plenty of money and the power that money brings the wisdom of her later days had confirmed the judgment of her youth as regards bottles himself she had soon got over that fancy for years she had scarcely thought of him till sir eustace told her that he was coming home and she had that curious dream about him now he had come and made love to her not in a civilised philandering sort of a way such as she was accustomed to but with a passion and a fire and an utter selfabandonment which while it thrilled her nerves with a curious sensation of mingled pleasure and pain not unlike that she once experienced at a spanish bullfight when she saw a man tossed was yet extremely awkward to deal with and rather alarming    now too the old question had come up again and what was to be done she had sheered him off the question that afternoon but he would want to marry her she felt sure of that if she consented what were they to live on her own juncture in the event of her remarriage would be cut down to a thousand a yearshe had four now and was pinched on that and as for bottles she knew what he hadeight hundred for sir eustace had told her he was next heir to the baronetcy it was true but sir eustace looked as though he would live for ever and besides he might marry after all  for a few minutes lady croston contemplated the possibility of existing on eighteen hundred a year and what chancery would give her as guardian of her children in a poky house somewhere down at kensington soon she realised that the thing was not to be done  unless sir eustace will do something for him it is very clear that we cannot be married she said to herself with a sigh however i need not tell him that just yet or he will be rushing back to south africa or something    v  sir eustace and his brother carried out their programme they dined together and about halfpast nine drove round to grosvenor street here they were shown into the drawingroom by the solemn footman who informed sir eustace that her ladyship was upstairs in the nursery and had left a message for him that she would be down presently  all right there is no hurry said sir eustace absently and the man went downstairs  bottles being nervous was fidgeting round the room as usual and his brother being very much at ease was standing with his back to the fire and staring about him presently his glance lit upon the blue velvet curtains which shut off the room they were in from the larger saloon that had not been used since lady crostons widowhood and an idea which had been floating about in his brain suddenly took definite shape and form he was a prompt man and in another second he had acted up to that idea  george he said in a quick low voice listen to me and for heavens sake dont interrupt for a minute you know that i do not like the idea of your marrying lady croston you know that i think her worthlessno wait a minute dont interrupti am only saying what i think you believe in her you believe that she is in love with you and will marry you and have good reason to believe it have you not  bottles nodded  very well supposing that i can show you within half an hour that she is perfectly ready to marry somebody elsemyself for instancewould you still believe in her  bottles turned pale the thing is impossible he said  that is not the question would you still believe in her and would you still marry her  great heavens no  good then i tell you what i will do for you and it will perhaps give you some idea of how deeply i feel in the matter i will sacrifice myself  sacrifice yourself  yes i mean that i will this very evening propose to madeline croston under your nose and i bet you five pounds she accepts me  impossible said bottles again besides if she did you dont want to marry her  marry her no indeed i am not mad i shall have to get out of the scrape as best i canalways supposing my view of the lady is correct  excuse me said bottles with a gasp but i must ask youin short have you ever been on affectionate terms with madeline  never on my honour  and yet you think she will marry you if you ask her even after what took place with me yesterday  yes i do  why  because my boy replied sir eustace with a cynical smile i have eight thousand a year and you have eight hundredbecause i have a title and you have none that you may happen to be the better fellow of the two will i fear not make up for those deficiencies  bottles with a motion of his hand waved his brothers courtly compliment away as it were and turned on him with a set white face  i do not believe you eustace he said do you understand what you make out this lady to be when you say that she could kiss me and tell me that she loved mefor she did both yesterdayand promise to marry you today  sir eustace shrugged his shoulders i think that the lady in question has done something like that before george  that was years ago and under pressure now eustace you have made this charge you have upset my faith in madeline whom i hope to marry and i say prove itprove it if you can i will stake my life you cannot  dont agitate yourself my dear fellow and as to betting i would not risk more than a fiver now oblige me by stepping behind those velvet curtainsa la school for scandaland listening in perfect silence to my conversation with lady croston she does not know that you are here so she will not miss you you can escape when you have had enough of it for there is a door through on to the landing and as we came up i noticed that it was ajar or if you like you can appear from between the curtains like an infuriated husband on the stage and play whatever role occasion may demand really the situation has a laughable side i should enjoy it immensely if i were behind the curtain too come in you go  bottles hesitated i cant hide he said  nonsense remember how much depends on it all is fair in love or war quick here she comes  bottles grew flurried and yielded scarcely knowing what he did in another second he was in the darkened room behind the curtains through the crack in which he could command the lighted scene before him and sir eustace was back at his place before the fire reflecting that in his ardour to extricate his brother from what he considered a suicidal engagement he had let himself in for a very pretty undertaking suppose she accepted him his brother would be furious and he would probably have to go abroad to get out of the ladys way and suppose she refused him he would look a fool  meanwhile the sweep sweep of madelines dress as she passed down the stairs was drawing nearer and in another instant she was in the room she was beautifully dressed in silvergrey silk plentifully trimmed with black lace and cut square back and front so as to show her rounded shoulders she wore no ornaments being one of the few women who are able to dispense with them unless indeed a red camellia pinned in the front of her dress can be called an ornament bottles shivering with shame and doubt behind his curtain marked that red camellia and wondered of what it reminded him  then in a flash it all came back the scene of years and years agothe verandah in faraway natal with himself sitting on it an open letter in his hand and staring with all his eyes at the camellia bush covered with bloom before him it seemed a bad omen to himthat camellia in madelines bosom next second she was speaking  oh sir eustace i owe you a thousand apologies you must have been here for quite ten minutes for i heard the front door bang when you came but my poor little girl effie is ill with a sore throat which has made her feverish and she absolutely refused to go to sleep unless she had my hand to hold  lucky effie said sir eustace with his politest bow i am sure i can understand her fancy  at the moment he was holding madelines hand himself and gave emphasis to his words by communicating the gentlest possible pressure to it as he let it fall but knowing his habits she did not take much notice comparative strangers when sir eustace shook hands with them were sometimes in doubt whether he was about to propose to them or to make a remark upon the weather alas it had always been the weather  i come as a man of business besides and men of business are accustomed to being kept waiting he went on  you are really very good sir eustace to take so much trouble about my affairs  it is a pleasure lady croston  ah sir eustace you do not expect me to believe that laughed the radiant creature at his side but if you only knew how i detest lawyers and what you spare me by the trouble you take i am sure you would not grudge me your time  do not talk of it lady croston i would do a great deal more than that for you in fact here he dropped his voice a little there are few things that i would not do for you madeline  she raised her delicate eyebrows till they looked like notes of interrogation and blushed a little this was quite a new style for sir eustace was he in earnest she wondered impossible  and now for business he continued not that there is much business as i understand it you have only to sign this document which i have already witnessed and the stock can be transferred  she signed the paper which he had brought in a big envelope almost without looking at it for she was thinking of sir eustaces remark and he put it back in the envelope  is that all the business sir eustace she asked  yes quite all now i suppose that as i have done my duty i had better go away  i wish to heaven he would groaned bottles to himself behind the curtains he did not like his brothers affectionate little ways or madelines tolerance of them  indeed no you had better sit down and talk to methat is if you have got nothing pleasanter to do  we can guess sir eustaces prompt reply and madelines smiling reception of the compliment as she seated herself in a low chairthat same low chair she had occupied the day before  now for it said sir eustace to himself i wonder how george is getting on  my brother tells me that he came to see you yesterday he began  yes she answered smiling again but wondering in her heart how much he had told him  do you find him much changed  not much  you used to be very fond of each other once if i remember right said he  yes once  i often think how curious it is went on sir eustace in a reflective tone to watch the various changes time brings about especially where the affections are concerned one sees children at the seaside making little mounds of sand and they think if they are very young children that they will find them there tomorrow but they reckon without their tide tomorrow the sands will have swept as level as ever and the little boys will have to begin again it is like that with our youthful love affairs is it not the tide of time comes up and sweeps them away fortunately for ourselves now in your case for instance it is i think a happy thing for both of you that your sandhouse did not last is it not  madeline sighed softly yes i suppose so she answered  bottles behind the curtains rapidly reviewed the past and came to a different conclusion  well that is all done with said sir eustace cheerfully  madeline did not contradict him she did not see her way to doing so just at present  then came a pause  madeline said sir eustace presently in a changed voice i have something to say to you  indeed sir eustace she answered lifting her eyebrows again in her note of interrogation manner what is it  it is this madelinei want to ask you to be my wife  the blue velvet curtains suddenly gave a jump as though they were assisting at at spiritualistic seance  sir eustace looked at the curtains with warning in his eye  madeline saw nothing  really sir eustace  i dare say i surprise you went on this ardent lover my suit may seem a sudden one but in truth it is nothing of the sort  o lord what a lie groaned the distracted bottles  i thought sir eustace murmured madeline in her sweet low voice that you told me not very long ago that you never meant to marry  nor did i madeline because i thought there was no chance of my marrying you which i am sure i hope there isnt he added to himself butbut madeline i love you heaven forgive me for that listen to me madeline before you answer and he drew his chair closer to her own i feel the loneliness of my position and i want to get married i think that we should suit each other very well at our age now that our youth is past he could not resist this dig at which madeline winced probably neither of us would wish to marry anybody much our junior i have had many opportunities lately madeline of seeing the beauty of your character and to the beauties of your person no man could be blind i can offer you a good position a good fortune and myself such as i am will you take me and he laid his hand upon hers and gazed earnestly into her eyes  really sir eustace she murmured this is so very unexpected and sudden  yes madeline i know it is i have no right to take you by storm in this way but i trust you will not allow my precipitancy to weight against me take a little time to think it overa week say by which time he reflected i hope to be in algiers only if you can madeline tell me that i may hope  she made no immediate answer but letting her hands fall idly in her lap looked straight before her her beautiful eyes fixed upon vacancy and her mind amply occupied in considering the pros and cons of the situation then sir eustace took heart of grace bending down he kissed the madonnalike face still there was no response only very gently she pushed him from her whispering  yes eustace i think i shall be able to tell you that you may hope  bottles waited to see no more with set teeth and flaming eyes he crept a broken man through the door that led on to the landing crept down the stairs and into the hall on the pegs were his hat and coat he took them and passed into the street  i have done a disgraceful thing he thought and i have paid for it  softly as the door closed sir eustace heard it and then he too left the room murmuring i shall soon come for my answer madeline  when he reached the street his brother was gone    vi  sir eustace did not go straight back to the albany but calling a hansom drove down to his club  well he thought to himself i have played a good many curious parts in my time but i never had to do with anything like this before i only hope george is not much cut up his eyes ought to be opened now what a woman but we will not repeat sir eustaces comments upon the lady to whom he was nominally half engaged  at the club sir eustace met his friend the undersecretary who had just escaped from the house thanks to information furnished to him that morning by bottles who had been despatched by sir eustace in a penitent mood to the colonial office to see him he had just succeeded in confusing if not absolutely in defeating the impertinent people who wanted to know accordingly he was jubilant and greeted sir eustace with enthusiasm and they sat talking together for an hour or more  then sir eustace being as has been said of early habits made his way home  in his sittingroom he found his brother smoking and contemplating the fire  hullo old fellow he said i wish you had come to the club with me atherleigh was there and is delighted with you what you told him this morning enabled him to smash up his enemies and as the smashing lately has been rather the other way he is jubilant he wants you to go to see him again tomorrow oh by the way you made your escape all right i only hope i may be as lucky well what do you think of your ladylove now  i think said bottles slowlythat i had rather not say what i do think  well you are not going to marry her now i suppose  no i shall not marry her  that is all right but i expect that it will take me all i know to get clear of her however there are some occasions in life when one is bound to sacrifice ones own convenience and this is one of them after all she is really very pretty in the evening so it might have been worse  bottles winced and sir eustace took a cigarette  by the way old fellow he said as he settled himself in his chair again i hope you are not put out with me over this believe me you have no cause to be jealous she does not care a hang about me it is only the title and the money if a fellow who was a lord and had a thousand a year more proposed to her tomorrow she would chuck me up and take him  no i am not angry with you said bottles you meant kindly but i am angry with myself it was not honourable toin short play the spy upon a womans weakness  you are very scrupulous yawned sir eustace all means are fair to catch a snake dear me i nearly exploded once or twice it was better than yawn any yawn play and sir eustace went to sleep  bottles sat still and stared at the fire  presently his brother woke up with a start oh you are there are you bottles it was the first time he had called him by that name since his return odd thing but do you know that i was dreaming that we were boys again and troutfishing in the old cantlebrook stream i dreamt that i hooked a big fish and you were so excited that you jumped right into the river after ityou did once you rememberand the river swept you away and left me on the bank most unpleasant dream well good night old boy i vote we go down and have some troutfishing together in the spring god bless you  good night said bottles gazing affectionately after his brothers departing form  then he too rose and went to his bedroom on a table stood a battered old tin despatchboxthe companion of all his wanderings he opened it and took from it first a little bottle of chloral  ah he said i shall want you if i am to sleep again setting the bottle down he extracted from a dirty envelope one or two letters and a faded photograph it was the same that used to hang over his bed in his quarters at maritzburg these he destroyed tearing them into small bits with his strong brown fingers  then he shut the box and sat down at the table to think opening the sluicegates of his mind and letting the sea of misery flow in as it were  this then was the woman whom he had forgiven and loved and honoured for all these years this was the end and this the reward of all his devotion and of all his hopes and he smiled in bitterness of his pain and selfcontempt  what was he to do go back to south africa he had not the heart for it live here he could not his existence had been wasted he had lost his delusionthe beautiful delusion of his lifeand he felt as though it would drive him mad as the man whose shadow left him went mad  he rose from the chair opened the window and looked out it was a clear frosty night and the stars shone brightly for some while he stood looking at them then he undressed himself generally for he was different to most men he said his prayers for years indeed he had not missed doing so any more than he had missed praying providence in them to watch over and bless his beloved madeline but tonight he said no prayers he could not pray the three angels faith hope and love whose whisperings heretofore had been ever in his ears had taken wing and left him as he played the eavesdropper behind those blue velvet curtains  so he swallowed his sleepingdraught and laid himself down to rest        when madeline croston heard the news at a dinnerparty on the following evening she was much shocked and made up her mind to go home early to this day she tells the story as a frightful warning against the careless use of chloral      little flower    i  the rev thomas bull was a man of rocklike character with no more imagination than a rock of good birth good abilities good principles and good repute really he ought to have been named not thomas but john bull being as he was a typical representative of the british middle class by nature a really religious man and owing to the balance of his mind not subject to most of the weaknesses which often afflict others very early in his career he determined that things spiritual were of far greater importance than things temporal and that as eternity is much longer than time it was wise to devote himself to the spiritual and leave the temporal to look after itself there are quite a number of good people earnest believers in the doctrine of rewards and punishments who take that practical view with such  repaid a thousandfold shall be  is a favourite line of a favourite hymn  it is true that his idea of the spiritual was limited perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it was unlimited since he accepted without doubt or question everything that was to be found within the four corners of what he had been taught as a boy he had been noted for his prowess in swallowing the largest pills  dont think he would say to his weaker brothers and sisters especially one of the latter whose throat seemed to be so constituted that she was obliged to cut up these boluses with a pair of scissors dont think but gulp em down  so it was with everything else in life thomas did not think he gulped it down thus in these matters of faith if other young folk ventured to talk of allegory or even to cast unhallowed doubts upon such points as those of the exact method of the appearance on this earth of their mother eve or whether the sun actually did stand still at the bidding of joshua or the ark filled with countless pairs of living creatures floated to the top of ararat or jonah defying digestive juices in fact abode three days in the interior of a whale thomas looked on them with a pitying smile and remarked that what had been written by moses and other accepted prophets was enough for him  indeed a story was told of him when he was a boy at school which well exemplified this attitude by way of lightening their labours a very noted geologist who had the art of interesting youthful audiences and making the rocks of the earth tell their own secular story was brought to lecture to his house this eminent man lectured extremely well he showed how beyond a doubt the globe we inhabit one speck of matter floating in the sea of space had existed for millions upon millions of years and how by the evolutionary changes of countless ages it had at length become fitted to be the habitation of men who probably themselves had lived and moved and had their being there for at least a million of years perhaps much longer  at the conclusion of the entrancing story the boys were invited to ask questions thomas bull a large beetlebrowed youth rose at once and inquired of their titled and aged visitor a man of worldwide reputation why he thought it funny to tell them fairy tales the old gentleman greatly interested put on his spectacles and while the rest of the school gasped and the head master and other pedagogues stared amazed studied this strange lad then said  i am outspoken myself and i like those who speak out when they do so from conviction but my young friend why do you consider that iwell exaggerate  because the bible says so replied thomas unabashed the bible tells us that the world was made in six days not in millions of years and that the sun and the moon and the stars were put in the sky to light it also that man was created four thousand years bc therefore either you are wrong sir or the bible is and i prefer the bible  the eminent scientist took off his spectacles and carefully put them away remarking  most logical and conclusive pray young gentleman do not allow any humble deductions of my own or others to interfere with your convictions only i believe it was archbishop ussher not the bible who said that the world began about 4000 bc i think that one day you may become a great manin your own way meanwhile i might suggest that a certain sugaring of manners sweetens controversy  after this no more questions were asked and the meeting broke up in confusion  from all of which it will be gathered that since none of us is perfect even in thomas there were weak points for instance he had what is known as a temper also he was blessed with a good idea of himself and his own abilities and had a share of that intolerance by which this is so often accompanied    in due course thomas bull became a theological student rarely was there such a student he turned neither to left nor right worked eight hours a day when he did not work ten and took the highest possible degrees on every subject then he was ordained about this time he chanced to hear a series of sermons by a colonial bishop that directed his mind towards the missionfield this was after he had served as a deacon in an east end parish and become acquainted with savagery in its western form  he consulted with his friends and his superiors as to whether his true call were not to the far parts of the earth unanimously they answered that they thought so so unanimously that a mild fellowlabourer whom he bullied was stung to the uncharitable remark that almost it looked as though they wanted to be rid of him perhaps they did perhaps they held that for energy so gigantic there was no fitting outlet in this narrow land  but as it chanced there was another to be consulted for by this time the rev thomas bull had become engaged to the only daughter of a deceased london traderin fact he had been a shopkeeper upon a large scale this worthy citizen had remarried late in life choosing or being chosen by a handsome and rather fashionable lady of a somewhat higher class than his own who was herself a widow by her he had no issue his daughter dorcas being the child of his first marriage mr humphreys for that was his name made a somewhat peculiar will leaving all his fortune which was considerable to his young widow charged however with an annuity of 300 pounds settled on his daughter dorcas  on the day before his death however he added a codicil which angered mrs humphreys very much when she saw it to the effect that if she remarried threefourths of the fortune were to pass to dorcas at once and that she or her heirs were ultimately to receive it all upon the decease of his wife  the result of these testamentary dispositions was that one house although it chanced to be large proved too small to hold mrs humphreys and her stepdaughter dorcas the latter was a mild and timid little creature with a turnedup nose lightcoloured fluffy hair and an indeterminate mouth still there was a degree of annoyance and fashionable scorn at which her spirit rose the end of it was that she went to live on her three hundred a year and to practise good works in the east end being laudably determined to make a career for herself which she was not in the least fitted to do  thus it was that dorcas came into contact with the rev thomas bull from the first time she saw her future husband he dominated and fascinated her he was in the pulpit and really looked very handsome there with his burly form his large black eyes and his determined cleanshaven face moreover he preached well in his own vigorous fashion  on this occasion he was engaged in denouncing the vices and pettiness of modern womanupperclass modern womanof whom he knew nothing at all a topic that appealed to an east end congregation he showed how worthless was this luxurious stamp of females what a deal they thought of dress and of other more evil delights he compared them to the florentines whom savonarola in his heart thomas saw resemblances between himself and that great if narrow man scourged till they wept in repentance and piled up their jewels and fripperies to be burned  what do they do with their lives he asked is there one in ten thousand of them who would abandon her luxuries and go forth to spread the light in the dark places of earth or would even pinch herself to support others who did and so on for thirty minutes  dorcas listening and reflecting on her stepmother thought how marvellously true it all was had he known her personally which so far as she was aware was not the case the preacher could not have described her better also it was certain that mrs humphreys and her friends had not the slightest intention of spreading any kind of light unless it were that of their own eyes and jewels or of going anywhere to do so except perhaps to monte carlo in the spring  how noble too was the picture he painted of the life of selfsacrifice and high endeavour that lay open to her sex she would like to lead that higher life being in truth a goodhearted little thing full of righteous impulses only unfortunately she did not know how for her present mild and tentative efforts had been somewhat disappointing in their fruits  then an inspiration seized her she would consult mr bull  she did so with results that might have been anticipated within three months she and her mentor were engaged and within six married  it was during those fervid weeks of engagement that the pair agreed not without a little hesitation upon the part of dorcas that in due course he would become a missionary and set forth to convert the heathen in what he called blackest africa first however there was much to be done he must go through a long course of training he must acquaint himself with various savage languages such as swahili and zulu and so must she  oh how poor dorcas who was not very clever and had no gift of tongues came to loathe those barbaric dialects still she worked away at them like a heroine confining herself ultimately with a wise and practical prescience to learning words and sentences that dealt with domestic affairs as as light the fire put the kettle on to boil sister have you chopped the wood cease making so much noise in the kitchenhut wake me if you hear the lion eating our cow and so forth  for more than a year after their marriage these preliminaries continued while thomas worked like a horse though it is true that dorcas slackened her attention to swahili and zulu grammar in the pressure of more immediate affairs especially was this so after the baby was born a girl flaxenhaired like her mother whom thomas christened by the name of tabitha and who in after years became the little flower of this history then as the time of departure drew near another thing happened her stepmother mrs humphreys insisted upon going to a ball in lent where she caught a chill that developed into inflammation of the lungs and killed her  the result of this visitation of providence as thomas called it was that dorcas suddenly found herself a rich woman with an income of quite 2000 pounds a year for her father had been wealthier than she knew now temptation took hold of her why she asked herself should thomas depart to africa to teach black people when with his gifts and her means he could stop at home comfortably and before very long become a bishop or at the least a dean  greatly daring she propounded this matter to her husband only to find that she might better have tried to knock down a stone wall with her head than induce him to change his plans he listened to her patientlyunless overirritated a perfectly exasperating patience was one of his giftsthen said in a cold voice that he was astonished at her  when you were poor he went on you vowed yourself to this service and now because we are rich you wish to turn traitor and become a seeker after the fleshpots of egypt never let me hear you mention the matter again  but there is the baby she exclaimed africa is hot and might not agree with her  heaven will look after the baby he answered  thats just what i am afraid of wailed dorcas  then they had their first quarrel in the course of which be it admitted she said one or two spiteful things for instance she suggested that the real reason he wished to go abroad was because he was so unpopular with his brother clergymen at home and especially with his superiors to whom he was fond of administering lectures and reproofs  it ended of course in her being crushed as flat as is a brokenwinged butterfly that comes in the path of a garden roller he stood up and towered over her  dorcas he said do what you will stay here if you wish and enjoy your money and your luxuries i sail on the first of next month for africa because you are weak do i cease to be strong  i think not she replied sobbing and gave in  so they sailed first classthis was a concession for he had intended to go thirdbut without a nurse on that point he stood firm  you must learn to look after your own children he said a remark at which she made a little face that meant more than he knew    ii  the career of mr and mrs bull during the next eight years calls for but little comment partly because tabitha was delicate at first and must be within reach of doctors they lived for the most part at various coast cities in africa where thomas worked with his usual fervour and earnestness acquiring languages which he learned to speak with considerable perfection though dorcas never did and acquainting himself thoroughly with the local conditions in so far as they affected missionary enterprise  he took no interest in anything else not even in the history of the natives or their peculiar forms of culture since for the most part they have a secret culture of their own all that was done with he said a turned page of the black and barbarous past it was his business to write new things upon a new sheet perhaps it was for this reason that thomas bull never really came to understand or enter into the heart of a zulu or a basuto or a swahili or indeed of any darkskinned man woman or child to him they were but brands to be snatched from the burning desperate and disagreeable sinners who must be saved and he set to work to save them with fearful vigour  his wife although her vocabulary was still extremely limited and much eked out with english or dutch words got on much better with them  you know thomas she would say they have all sorts of fine ideas which we dont understand and are not so bad in their way only you must find out what their way is  i have found out he said grimly it is a very evil way the way of destruction i wish you would not make such a friend of that sly black nursegirl who tells me a lie once out of every three times she opens her mouth  for the rest dorcas was fairly comfortable as with their means she was always able to have a nice house in whatever town they might be stationed where she could give tennis parties and even little lunches and dinners that is if her husband chanced to be away as often he was visiting upcountry districts or taking the duty there for another missionary who was sick or on leave indeed in these conditions she came to like africa fairly well for she was a chilly little thing who loved its ample allpervading sunshine and made a good many friends especially among young men to whom her helplessness and rather forlorn little face appealed  the women too liked her for she was kindly and always ready to help in case of poverty or other distresses luckily in a way she was her own mistress since her fortune came to her unfettered by any marriage settlements moreover it was in the hands of trustees so that the principal could not be alienated therefore she had her own account and her own chequebook and used her spare money as she liked more than one poor missionarys wife knew this and called her blessed as through her bounty they once again looked upon the shores of england or were able to send a sick child home for treatment but of these good deeds dorcas never talked least of all to her husband if he suspected them after one encounter upon some such matter in which she developed a hidden strength and purpose he had the sense to remain silent  so things went on for years not unhappily on the whole for as they rolled by the child tabitha grew acclimatised and much stronger by this time although dorcas loved her husband as all wives should obeying him in all or at any rate in most things she had come to recognise that he and she were very differently constituted of course she knew that he was infinitely her superior and indeed that of most people like everybody else she admired his uprightness his fixity of purpose and his devouring energy and believed him to be destined to great things still to tell the truth which she often confessed with penitence upon her knees on the whole she felt happier or at any rate more comfortable during his occasional absences to which allusion has been made when she could have her friends to tea and indulge in human gossip without being called worldly  it only remains to add that her little girl tabitha a name she shortened into tabbie was her constant joy especially as she had no other children tabbie was a bright fairhaired little thing clever too with resource and a will of her own an improved edition of herself but in every way utterly unlike her father a fact that secretly annoyed him everybody loved tabitha and tabitha loved everybody not excepting the natives who adored her between the kaffirs and tabitha there was some strong natural bond of sympathy they understood one another  at length came the blow    it happened thus not far from the borders of zululand but in the country that is vaguely known as portuguese territory was a certain tribe of mixed zulu and basuto blood who were called the amasisa that is the people of the sisa now sisa in the zulu tongue has a peculiar meaning which may be translated as sent away it is said that they acquired this name because the zulu kings when they exercised dominion over all that district were in the habit of despatching large herds of the royal cattle to be looked after by these people or in their own idiom to be sisad ie agisted as we say in english of stock that are entrusted to another to graze at a distance from the owners home  some however gave another reason in the territory of this tribe was a certain spot of which we shall hear more later where these same zulu kings were in the habit of causing offenders against their law or customs to be executed such also like the cattle were sent away and from one of these two causes whichever it may have been or perhaps from both the tribe originally derived its name  it was not a large tribe perhaps there were three hundred and fifty heads of families in it or say something under two thousand souls in all descendants probably of a mild peaceloving industrious basuto stock on to which had been grafted a certain number of the dominant warlike zulus who perhaps had killed out the men and possessed themselves of the basuto women and their cattle the result was that among this small people there were two strains one of the bellicose type who practically remained zulus and the other of the milder and more progressive basuto stamp who were in the majority  among these sisas missionaries had been at work for a number of years with results that on the whole were satisfactory more than half of them had been baptised and were christians of a sort a church had been built a more or less modern system of agriculture had been introduced and the most of the population wore trousers or skirts according to sex recently however trouble had arisen over the old question of polygamy the missionaries would not tolerate more than one wife while the zulu section of the tribe insisted upon the old prerogative of plural marriage  the dispute had ended in something like actual fighting in the course of which the church and the school were burnt also the missionarys house because of these troubles this excellent man was forced to camp out in the wet for it was the rainy season and catching a chill died suddenly of heartfailure following rheumatic fever just after he had moved into his new habitation which consisted of some rather glorified native huts  subsequently to these events there came a petition from the chief of the tribe a man called kosa whose name probably derived from the zulu word koos which means chief or captain addressed to the church authorities and asking that a new teacher might be sent to take the place of him who had died also to rebuild the church and the school if this were not done said the messengers the tribe would relapse into heathenism since the zulu and antichristian party headed by an old witchdoctor named menzi was strong and gaining ground  this was an appeal that could not be neglected since hitherto the sisa had been a spot of light in a dark place as most of the surrounding peoples who were of the old zulu stock remained heathen if that light went out the chances were that they would continue to be so whereas if it went on burning another result might be hoped since from a spark a great fire may come therefore earnest search was made for a suitable person to deal with so difficult and delicate a situation with the result that the lot fell upon the rev thomas bull  once his name was mentioned it was acclaimed by all he was the very man they said bold determined filled with a jesuits fiery zeal although it need scarcely be explained that he hated jesuits as a cat does mustard one whom no witchdoctors would daunt one moreover who being blessed with this worlds goods would ask no pay but on the contrary would perhaps contribute a handsome sum towards the rebuilding of the church this it may be explained as the mission itself scarcely possessed a spare penny with which to bless itself was a point that could not be overlooked  so thomas was sent for and offered the post after its difficulties and drawbacks had been fairly but diplomatically explained to him he did not hesitate a minute or at any rate five minutes he took it at once feeling that his call had come also that it was the very thing for which he had been seeking up in that secluded spot in portuguese territory he would he reflected be entirely on his own a sort of little bishop with no one to interfere with him and able to have his own way about everything which in more civilised regions he found he could not do here a set of older gentlemen who were always appealing to their experience of natives continually put a spoke into his wheel bringing his boldest plans to naught there it would be different he would fashion his own wheel and grind the witchdoctor with his following to dust beneath its iron rim he said that he would go at once and what is more he promised a donation of 1000 pounds towards the rebuilding of the church and other burntout edifices  that is very generous of bull remarked the dean when he had left the room  yes said another dignitary only i think that the undertaking must be looked upon as conditional i understand well that the money belongs to mrs bull  probably she will endorse the bond as she is a liberal little woman said the dean and in any case our brother bull if i may be pardoned a vulgarism will knock the stuffing out of that pestilent menzi and his crowd  do you think so asked the other i am not so certain i have met old menzi and he is a tough nut to crack he may knock the stuffing out of him bull sound as he is and splendid as he is in many ways does not it seems to me quite understand natives or that it is easier to lead them than to drive them  perhaps not said the dean but in the case of these sisas it is rather a matter of hobsons choice isnt it  so this affair was settled and in due course thomas received his letter of appointment as priestincharge of the sisa station    on his arrival home a few days later where he was not expected till the following week thomas was so preoccupied that he scarcely seemed to notice his wifes affectionate greeting even the fact that both she and tabitha were arrayed in smart and unmissionarylike garments escaped him dorcas also looked preoccupied the truth being that she had asked a few young people officers and maidens of the place alas as it chanced among them were no clergy or their wives and daughters to play tennis that afternoon and some of them to stop to supper now she was wondering how her austere spouse would take the news he might be cross and lecture her when he was both cross and lectured the combination was not agreeable  a few formal enquiries as to health and a certain sick person were made and answered dorcas assured him that they were both quite well tabitha especially and that she had visited the afflicted woman as directed  and how was she dear he asked  i dont know dear she answered you see when i got to the house i met mrs tomley the rectors wife at the door and she said rather pointedly i thought that she and her husband were looking after the case and though grateful for the kind assistance you had rendered felt that they need not trouble us any more as the patient was a parishioner of theirs  did they said thomas with a frown considering all thingswell let it be  dorcas was quite content to do so for she was aware that her husbands goodheartedness was apt to be interpreted as poaching by some who should have known better and that in fact the ground was dangerous  i have something to tell you she began nervously about an arrangement i have made for this afternoon  mr bull who was drinking a tumbler of waterhe was a teetotaller and nonsmoker and one of his grievances was that his wife found it desirable to take a little wine for the pauline reasonset it down and said  never mind your afternoon arrangements my dear they are generally of a sort that can be altered for i have something to tell you something very important my call has come  your call dear what call i did not know that you expected anyoneand by the way  she got no further for her husband interrupted  do not be ridiculous dorcas i said callnot caller and i use the word in its higher sense  oh i understand forgive me for being so stupid have they made you a bishop  a bishop  i mean a dean or an archdeacon or something she went on confusedly  no dorcas they have not i could scarcely expect promotion as yet though it is true that i thoughtbut never mind others no doubt have better claims and longer service i have however been honoured with a most responsible duty  indeed dear what duty  i have been nominated priestincharge of the sisa station  ooh and where is that is it anywhere near durban or perhaps maritzburg  i dont exactly know at present though i understand that it is about six days trek from eshowe in zululand but over the border in portuguese territory indeed i am not sure that one can trek all the way at least when the rivers are in flood then it is necessary to cross one of them in a basket slung upon a rope or if the river is not too full in a punt at this season the basket is most used  great heavens thomas do you propose to put me and tabbie in a basket like st paul and did you remember that we have just taken on this house for another year  of course i do the families of missionaries must expect to face hardships from which it is true circumstances have relieved you up to the present it is therefore only right that they should begin now when tabitha has become as strong as any child of her age that i know as for the house i had forgotten all about it it must be relet or failing that we must bear the loss which fortunately we can well afford  dorcas looked at him and said nothing because words failed her so he went on hurriedly  by the way love i have taken a slight liberty with your name it appears that the church at sisa which i understand was quite a nice one built with subscriptions obtained in england by one of my predecessors who chanced to have influence or connections at home has been recently burnt down together with the missionhouse now the house can wait since of course we can make shift for a year or two in some native huts but obviously we must have a church and as the society is overdrawn it cannot help in the matter under these circumstances i ventured to promise a gift of 1000 pounds which it is estimated will cover the reerection of both church and house  he paused awaiting a reply but as dorcas still said nothing continued  you will remember that you told me quite recently that you found you had 1500 pounds to your credit therefore i felt quite sure that you would not grudge 1000 pounds of it to enable me to fulfil this dutythis semidivine duty  oh said dorcas as a matter of fact i intended to spend that 1000 pounds or much of it otherwise there are some people here whom i wanted to help but fortunately i had not mentioned this to them so they will have to do without the money and their holiday also the children cannot be sent to school and by the way how is tabbie to be educated in this faraway place  i am sorry dear but after all private luxuries including that of benevolence must give way to sacred needs so i will write to the dean that the money will be forthcoming when it is needed as for tabithas education of course we will undertake it between us at any rate for the next few years  yes thomas since you have passed your word or rather my word the money will be forthcoming but meanwhile if you can spare me the odd 500 pounds i suggest that i should stay here with tabbie who could continue to attend the college as a dayscholar while you get us some place ready to live in among these savages the sneezers or whatever they are called  my dear answered thomas consider what you ask you are in perfect health and so is our child would it not then be a downright scandal that you should stop here in luxury while your husband went out to confront grave difficulties among the sisasnot the sneezersfor i may tell you at once that the difficulties are very grave there is a noted witchdoctor amongst this people named menzi who i understand is suspected of having burned down the missionhouse and probably the church also because he said that it was ridiculous that an unmarried man like the late priest should have so large a dwelling to live alone this of course was but a cunning excuse for his savage malevolence but if another apparent celibate arrives he might repeat the argument and its application also often these barbarians consider that a man who is not married must be insane therefore it is absolutely necessary that you and the child should be present with me from the first  oh is it said dorcas turning very pink well i am sorry to say that just now it is absolutely necessary that i should be absent from you since i have a tennis party this afternoonthe officers of the garrison are coming and about half a dozen girlsand i must go to arrange about the tea  a tennis party a tennis party to those godless officers and probably equally godless girls exclaimed her husband i am ashamed of you dorcas you should be occupied with higher things  then at last the worm turned  do you know thomas she answered springing up that i am inclined to be ashamed of you too who i think should be occupied in keeping your temper you have accepted some strange mission without consulting me you have promised 1000 pounds of my money without consulting me and now you scold me because i have a few young people to play tennis and stop to supper it is unchristian it is uncharitable it istoo bad and sitting down again she burst into tears  the rev thomas who by now was in a really regal rage not knowing what to say or do glared about him by illluck his eye fell upon a box of cigarettes that stood upon the mantelpiece  what are those things doing here he asked i do not smoke so they cannot be for me is our moneyi beg pardonyour money which is so much needed in other directions to be wasted in providing such unnecessariesfor officers andidle girls ohbless it all and seizing the offending cigarettes he hurled them through the open window a scattered shower of white tubes which some kaffirs outside instantly proceeded to collect  then he rushed from the house and dorcas went to get ready for her party but first she sent a servant to buy another box of cigarettes it was her first act of rebellion against the iron rule of the rev thomas bull    iii  in the end as may be guessed dorcas who was a good and faithful little soul accompanied her husband to the sisa country tabitha went also rejoicing having learned that in this happy land there was no school dorcas found the journey awful but really had she but known it it was most fortunate indeed ideal her husband who was a little anxious on the point had made the best arrangements that were possible on such an expedition  the wagon in which they trekked was good and comfortable and although it was still the rainy season fortune favoured them in the matter of weather so that when they came to the formidable river they were actually able to trek across it with the help of some oxen borrowed from a missionary in that neighbourhood without having recourse to the dreaded ropeslung basket or even to the punt  beyond the river they were met by some christian kaffirs of the sisa tribe who were sent by the chief kosa to guide them through the hundred miles or so of difficult country which still lay between them and their goal these men were pleasantspoken but rather depressed folk clad in muchworn european clothes that somehow became them very ill they gave a melancholy account of the spiritual condition of the sisas who since the death of their last pastor they said were relapsing rapidly into heathenism under the pernicious influence of menzi the witchdoctor therefore kosa sent his greetings and prayed the new teacher to hurry to their aid and put a stop to this state of things  fear nothing said thomas in a loud voice speaking in zulu which by now he knew very well i will put a stop to it  then they asked him his name he replied that it was thomas bull which after the native fashion having found out what bull meant in english they translated into a long appellation which strictly rendered meant roaringleaderoftheholyherd when he found this out thomas flatly declined any such unchristian title with the result that anxious to oblige they christened him tombool and as tombool thenceforward he was known dorcas objected to this name but tabitha remarked sagely that at any rate it was better than tomfool  this was to his face but behind his back they called him inkunzi which means bull and in order to keep up the idea designated poor dorcas isidanda that being interpreted signified a gentlenatured cow to tabitha they gave a prettier name calling her imba or little flower  at first dorcas was quite pleased with her title which sounded nice but when she came to learn what it meant it was otherwise  how can you expect me thomas to live among a people who call me a mild cow she asked indignantly  never mind my dear he answered in their symbolical way they are only signifying that you will feed them with the milk of human kindness a reply which did not soothe her at all in fact of the three the child alone was pleased because she said that opening flower was a prettier name than tabbie which reminded her of cats  thenceforward following a track for it could not be called a road they advanced slowly first over a mountain pass on the farther side of which the wagon nearly upset and then across a great bushclad plain where there was much game and the lions roared round them at night necessitating great fires to frighten them away these lions terrified dorcas a townbred woman who had never seen one of them except in the zoo so much that she could scarcely sleep but oddly enough tabitha was not disturbed by them  god will not let us be eaten by a lion will he father she asked in her simple faith  certainly not he answered and if the brute tries to do so i shall shoot it  id rather trust to god father because you know you can never hit anything replied tabitha  fortunately however it never became necessary for thomas to show his skill as a marksman for when they got through the bushveld there were no more lions  on the fourth day after they left the river they found themselves upon gentle sloping veld that by degrees led them upwards to high land where it was cold and healthy and there were no mosquitoes for two days they trekked over these high lands which seemed to be quite uninhabited save by herds of feeding buck till at length they attained their crest and below them saw a beautiful mimosaclad plain which the guides told them was the sisa country  the promised land at last it makes me feel like another moses said thomas waving his arm  oh isnt it lovely exclaimed tabitha  yes dear answered her mother butbut i dont see any town  this indeed was the case because there was none the sisa kraal for it could not be dignified by any other name being round a projecting ridge and out of sight for the rest the prospect was very fair being parklike in character with dotted clumps of trees among which ran or rather wound a silver stream that seemed to issue from between two rocky koppies in the distance  these koppies the guides told them were the gates of sisa town they neglected to add that it lay in a hot and unhealthy hillringed hollow beyond them the site having originally been chosen because it was difficult to attack being only approachable through certain passes therefore it was a very suitable place in which to kraal the cattle of the zulu kings in times of danger that day they travelled down the declivity into the plain where they camped by the following afternoon they came to the koppies through which the river ran and asked its name the answer was ukufa  ukufa said thomas why that means death  yes was the reply because in the old days this river was the river of death where evildoers were sent to be slain  how horrible said dorcas for unfortunately she had overheard and understood this conversation  by the side of the river was a kind of shelf of rock that was used as a road and over this they bumped in their wagon till presently they were past the koppies and could see their future home beyond it was a plain some miles across and entirely surrounded by precipitous hills the river entering it through a gorge to the north in the centre of this plain was another large koppie of which the river ukufa or death washed one side around this koppie amid a certain area of cultivated land stood the town of the christian branch of the sisa it consisted of groups of huts ten or a dozen groups in all set on low ground near the river which suggested that the population might number anything between seven hundred and a thousand souls  at the time that our party first saw it the sun was sinking and had disappeared behind the western portion of the barricade of hills therefore the valley if it may be so called was plunged in a gloom that seemed almost unnatural when compared with the brilliant sky above across which the radiant lights of an african sunset already sped like arrows or rather like red and ominous spears of flame  what a dreadful place exclaimed dorcas is our home to be here  i suppose so answered thomas who to tell the truth for once was himself somewhat dismayed it does look a little gloomy but after all it is very sheltered and home is what one makes it he added sententiously  here the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of the chief and some of the christian portion of the sisa tribe who having been warned of its approach by messenger to the number of a hundred and fifty or so had advanced to meet the party  they were a motley crowd clad in every kind of garment ranging from a motheaten generals tunic to practically nothing at all indeed one tall thin fellow sported only a battered helmet of rusty steel that had drifted here from some european army a moocha or waistbelt of catskins and a pair of decayed tennisshoes through which his toes appeared with them came what were evidently the remains of the church choir when there was a church for they wore dirty fragments of surplices and sang what seemed to be a hymn tune to the strains of a decadent accordion  the tune was long and ended in a kind of howl like to that of a disappointed jackal when at length it was finished the chief kosa appeared he was a middleaged man become prematurely old because he had lived too fast in his prechristian days or so report said now he had a somewhat imbecile appearance for his fingers twitched and when he spoke his mouth jerked up at the corners also he kept looking over his shoulder as though he were afraid of something behind him altogether he inspired thomas with no confidence whatever else he might be clearly he was not a staff for a crusader to lean upon  still he came forward and made a very nice speech as a highbred native noble such as he was can almost invariably do with many pious expressions he welcomed the new teacher saying that he and his people that is those of them who were christians would do their best to make him happy  thomas thanked him in appropriate language adding that he on his part would do his best to promote their welfare and to save their souls  kosa replied that he was glad to hear it because these needed saving since most of the sisa people were now servants of the devil since the last umfundisi or teacher died they had been walking the road to hell at a very great pace marrying many wives drinking gin and practising all kinds of witchcraft under the guidance of the isanusi or doctor menzi this man he added had burned down the church and the missionhouse by his magic though these had seemed to be destroyed by lightning  with a proud gesture thomas announced that he would soon settle menzi and all his works and that meanwhile as the darkness was coming on he would be glad if kosa would lead them to the place where they were to sleep    so they started the accordionman playing execrably leading the way and trekked for about a mile and a half till they came to the koppie in the centre of the plain reaching it by following the left bank of the river that washed its western face  passing between a number of tumbled walls built of loose stones that once in bygone generations had sheltered the cattle of chaka and other zulu kings they reached a bay in the side of the koppie that may have covered four acres of ground here by the edge of the river but standing a little above it were the burntout ruins of a building that by its shape had evidently been a church and near to it other ruins of a school and of a house which once was the missionstation  as they approached they heard swelling from within those cracked and melancholy walls the sound of a fierce defiant chant which thomas guessed must be some ancient zulu warsong as indeed it was it was a very impressive song chanted by many people which informed the listeners that those who sung it were the kings oxen born to kill the kings enemies and to be killed for the king and so forth a deepnoted savage song that thrilled the blood at the first sound of which the accordion gave a feeble wail and metaphorically expired  isnt that beautiful music father i never heard anything like that before exclaimed tabitha  before thomas could answer out from the ruined doorway of the church issued a band of menthere might have been a hundred of themclad in all the magnificent panoply of oldtime zulu warriors with tall plumes upon their heads large shields upon their arms kilts about their middles and fringes of oxtails hanging from their knees and elbows they formed into a double line and advanced waving broadbladed assegais then at a signal they halted by the wagon and uttered a deepthroated salute  in front of their lines was a little withered old fellow who carried neither shield nor spear but only a black rod to which was bound the tail of a wildebeeste except for his moocha he was almost naked and into his grey hair was woven a polished ring of black gum from which hung several little bladders upon his scraggy neck was a necklace of baboons teeth and amulets whilst above the moocha was twisted a snake that might have been either alive or stuffed  his face though aged and shrunken was finefeatured and full of breeding while his hands and feet were very small his eyes were brooding the eyes of a mystic but when his interest was excited their glance was as sharp as a bradawl just now it was fixed on thomas who felt as if it were piercing him through and through the owner of the eyes as thomas guessed at once was menzi a witchdoctor very famous in those parts  why are these men armed with spears it is against the law for kaffirs to carry spears he said to the chief  this is portuguese territory there is no law in portuguese territory answered kosa with a vacant stare  then we might be all murdered here and no notice taken exclaimed thomas  yes teacher many people have been murdered here my father was murdered and i dare say i shall be  who by  kosa made no answer but his vacant eyes rested for a little while on menzi  good god what a country said thomas to himself looking at dorcas who was frightened then he turned to meet menzi who was advancing towards them  casting a glance of contempt at kosa of whom he took no further notice menzi saluted the newcomers by lifting his hand above his head then with the utmost politeness he drew a snuffbox fashioned from the tip of a buffalohorn out of a slit in the lobe of his left ear extracted the wooden stopper and offered thomas some snuff  thank you but i do not take that nastiness said thomas  menzi sighed as though in disappointment and having helped himself to a little restoppered the horn and thrust it back into the lobe of his ear next he said speaking in a gentle and refined voice  greeting teacher who the messengers tell us are called tombool in your own language and in ours inkunzi a good name for in truth you look like a bull i am glad to see that you are made much more robust than was the last teacher and therefore will live longer in this place than he did though as for the ladyteacher and he glanced at the delicatelooking dorcas  thomas stared at this man to whom already he had taken a strong dislike then moved thereto either by a very natural outburst of temper or perchance by a flash of inspiration he replied  yes i shall live longer than did my brother who died here and has gone to heaven and longer i think than you will  this personal remark seemed to take menzi aback indeed for a moment he looked frightened recovering himself however he said  i perceive teacher tombool that like myself you are a witchdoctor and a prophet at present i do not know which of us will live the longer but i will consult my spirits and tell you afterwards  pray do not trouble to do so on my account for i do not believe in your spirits  of course you do not teacher no doctor believes in another doctors spirits since each has his own and there are more spirits than there are doctors teacher tombool i greet you and tell you at once that we are at war over this matter of spirits this tribe teacher is a cleft log yes it is split into two the chief there kosa sits on one half of the log with his christians i sit on the other half with the rest who are as our fathers were so if you wish to fight i shall fight with such weapons as i have no do not look at the spearsnot with spears but if you leave me and my following alone we shall leave you alone if you are wise i think that you will do well to walk your own road and suffer us to walk ours  on the contrary answered thomas i intend that all the sisa people shall walk one road the road that leads to heaven  is it so teacher menzi replied with a mysterious smile  then he turned his head and looked at the darkling river that just here where it ran beneath an overhanging ledge of the koppie was very deep and still thomas felt that there was a world of meaning in his look though what it might be he did not know suddenly he remembered that this river was named death  after menzi had looked quite a long while once more he saluted as though in farewell searching the faces of the three white people especially tabithas with his dreamy eyes and letting them fall searching the ground also near to where he stood grew a number of veld flowers such as appear in their glory after the rains in africa among these was a rare and beautiful white lily this lily menzi plucked and stepping forward presented it to tabitha saying  a flower for the flower a gift to a child from one who is childless  her father saw and meditated interference but he was too late tabitha had already taken the lily and was thanking menzi in his own tongue which she knew well enough having been brought up by zulu nurses he smiled at her saying  all spirits black or white love flowers  then for a third time he saluted not the others but tabitha with more heartiness than before and turning departed followed by his spearmen who also saluted tabitha as they filed in front of her  it was a strange sight to see these great plumed men lifting their broad spears to the beautiful brighthaired child who stood there holding the tall white lily in her hand as though it were a sceptre    iv  when menzi and his company had departed vanishing round the corner of the koppie thomas again asked the chief where they were to sleep an urgent matter as darkness was now approaching  kosa answered with his usual vagueness that he supposed in the hut where the late teacher had died after the missionhouse was burnt down so they trekked on a little way passing beneath the shelf of rock that has been mentioned as projecting from that side of the koppie which overhung the stream where there was just room for a wagon to travel between the cliff and the water  what a dark road said dorcas and one of the christian natives who understood some english having been the bodyservant of the late missionaryit was he with the accordionreplied in zulu  yes lady this rock is called the rock of evildoers because once those accused of witchcraft and others were thrown from it by the order of the king to be eaten by the crocodiles in that pool but he added brightening up do not be afraid for there are no more zulu kings and we have hunted away the crocodiles though it is true that there are still plenty of wizards who ought to be thrown from the rock and he looked over his shoulder in the direction menzi had taken adding in a low voice you have just seen the greatest of them lady  how horrible said dorcas for the second time  a few yards farther on they emerged from this tunnellike roadway and found themselves travelling along the northern face of the koppie here surrounded by a fence stood the chiefs kraal and just outside of it a large thatched hut with one or two smaller huts at its back it was a good hut of its sort being built after the basuto fashion with a projecting roof and a doorway and having a kind of verandah floored with beaten lime  this was the teachers house said kosa as the wagon halted  i should like to look inside it at once remarked dorcas doubtfully adding why whats that and she pointed to a suspiciouslooking oblong mound that was covered with weeds over which she had almost stumbled  that is the grave of the late teacher lady we buried him here because menzis people took up the bones of those who were in the churchyard and threw them into the river explained kosa  dorcas looked as though she were going to faint but thomas rising to the occasion remarked  come on dear the dead are always with us and what better company could we have than the dust of our sainted predecessor  i would rather have his room murmured dorcas and gathering herself together proceeded to the hut  somebody opened the door with difficulty and as it seemed to be very dark within thomas struck a match by the light of which dorcas peered into the interior next second she fell back into his arms with a little scream  take me away she said the place is full of rats  he stared it was quite true there sitting up upon the dead missionarys bed was a singularly large rat that did not seem in the least frightened by their appearance whilst other creatures of the same tribe scuttled about the floor and up the walls    dorcas slept or did not sleep that night in the wagon with tabitha while thomas took his rest beneath it as well as a drizzling rain that was falling would allow    such was the beginning of the life of the bull family in sisaland not an encouraging beginning it will be admitted though no worse and perhaps much better than that which many missionaries and their families are called upon to face in various regions of the earth what horror is there that missionaries have not been called upon to endure st paul tells us of his trials but they are paralleled if not surpassed even in the present day  missionaries however good may not always be wise folk the reader might even think the rev thomas bull to be no perfect embodiment of wisdom sympathy or perhaps manners but taking them as a class they are certainly heroic folks who endure many things for small reward as we reckon reward in nothing perhaps do they show their heroism and faith more greatly than in their persistent habit of conveying women and young children into the most impossible places of the earth there to suffer many things not exclusive occasionally of martyrdom at least the protestant section of their calling does this the roman catholics are wiser in renouncing marriage these save themselves from many agonies and having only their own lives and health at stake are perhaps better fitted to face rough work in rough places  even thomas bull not a particularly sensitive person was tempted more than once to arrive at similar conclusions during his period of service in sisaland although neither he nor his wife or child was called upon to face the awful extremities that have confronted others of his cloth for instance another thomas one owen who was a missionary in zululand at the time when dingaan the king massacred retief and his boers beneath his eyes  on the following morning thomas crept out from beneath his wagon not refreshed it is true but filled with a renewed and even more fiery zeal during those damp hours of unrest he had reflected much and brought the whole position into perspective a clear if a narrow perspective the chief with whom he had to deal evidently was a fool if not an imbecile and the christians who remained after a generation of teaching were for the most part poor creatures the weakkneed amongst this mixedblood tribe probably those of the milder basuto origin  such strength as remained in the people who were after all but a dwindling handful marooned in a distant spot was to be found among those of the old zulu stock they were descendants of the men sent by the kings chaka and dingaan to keep an eye upon the humble basuto slaves whose duty it was to herd the royal cattle the men too to whom was entrusted the proud but hateful business of carrying out the execution of persons that for one reason or another it was not desirable to kill at home  the individuals detailed for these duties were for the most part of high blood inconvenient persons perhaps whom it was desired to move to a distance thus as thomas bull soon learned menzi was said to be no less a man than the grandson of the king dingaan himself one whose father had developed troublesome ambitions but whose life had been spared because his mother was a favourite with the king  hence some of the grandsons pride which was enhanced by the fact that in his youth he had been trained in medicine and magic by a certain zikali alias openerofroads who was said to have been the greatest witchdoctor that ever lived in zululand and through him had acquired or perhaps developed inherent psychic gifts that were in any case considerable  in the end however he had returned to his petty tribe neglecting larger opportunities as thomas learned because of some woman to whom he was attached at home it seemed however that he might as well have stayed away since on his arrival he found that this woman had become one of the chiefs wives for which reason he afterwards killed that chief kosas father and possessed himself of the woman who died immediately afterwards as menzi suspected by poisoning it was principally for this reason that he hated kosa his enemys son and all who clung to him and partly because of that hatred and the fear that it engendered kosa and his people had turned christian hoping to protect themselves thus against menzi and his wizardries also for this dead womans sake menzi had never married again  thomas did not learn all these details and others that need not be mentioned at once but by the time he crept out from under that wagon he had guessed enough to show that he was face to face with a very tough proposition and being the man he was he girded his loins to meet it vowing that he would conquer menzi or die in the attempt  that very morning he called a council of the christians and set to work with a will the first thing to do was to make the late missionarys huts habitable which did not take long and the next to commence the rebuilding of the church thomas true to his principles insisted on beginning with the church and letting the missionhouse stand over although dorcas small blame to her complained at being obliged to live for an indefinite time in a hut like a kaffir woman however as usual she was obliged to give way  as it chanced here there was little difficulty about building operations for stone and wood and tambuki grass for thatching were all at hand in plenty also the basuto section of the sisa as is common among that race were clever masons and carpenters some of them having followed those trades in natal and the more settled places in zululand where dwellings had to be erected moreover they possessed wagons and now that the dry season was approaching were able to fetch stores of every kind from the borders of natal lastly thanks to dorcass banking account money was by comparison no object an unusual circumstance where missionaries are concerned  so all the week thomas laboured at these matters and at making himself acquainted with his congregation and all sunday he held openair services or taught in the ruins of the old church  thus in the midst of so many new interests matters went on not uncomfortably and dorcas became more or less reconciled to her life still she could never get over her loathing of the place which she believed to be illomened perhaps because of its gloomy aspect coupled with the name of the river and the uses to which it had been put after all not so very long ago naturally also this distaste was accentuated by the unlucky circumstances of their arrival  tabitha too was really happy since she loved this wild free life and having been brought up amongst kaffirs and talking their language almost as well as she did her own soon she made many friends  perhaps it was a sense that the information would not be well received by her father that prevented her from mentioning that the greatest of those friends was the old witchdoctor menzi whom she often met when she was rambling about the place or it may have been pure accident since thomas was too busy to bother about such trifles while her mother who of course knew kept her own counsel the truth is that though he was a heathen witchdoctor dorcas liked old menzi better than any other native in the district because she said quite truly that he was a gentleman however sinful and hardhearted he might be moreover with a womans perception she felt that if only he were a friend at a pinch he might be worth all the others put together while if he were an enemy conversely the same applied  so it came about that in the end there arose a very strange state of affairs menzi hated thomas and did all he could to thwart him he liked dorcas and did all he could to help her while the child tabitha he came to worship for some reason he never revealed which was hidden in the depths of his secret soul indeed ere long had she been his own daughter he could not have loved her more it was he who amongst many other things gave her the pretty carved walkingstick of black and white umzimbeet wood also the two young blue cranes and the kid that afterwards were such pets of hers and with them the beautiful white feathers of a cock ostrich that had been killed on the veld in the same way it was he who sent milk and eggs to dorcas when she was at her wits end for both which more than once were found mysteriously at the door of their hut and not any of his christian flock as thomas fondly imagined  thus things went on for a while  meanwhile thomas found this same menzi a stumblingblock and a rock of offence whenever he tried to convert man woman or child he was confronted with menzi or the shadow of menzi thus those with whom he was arguing would ask him why he could not work miracles like menzi let him show them pictures in the fire or tell them who had stolen their goods or where they would find their strayed cattle and perhaps they would believe him and so forth  at length thomas grew exasperated and announced publicly that he credited nothing of this magic and that menzi was only a common cheat who threw dust into their eyes if menzi could perform marvels let him show these marvels to him thomas and to his wife that they might judge of them for themselves  apparently this challenge was repeated to the witchdoctor at least one morning a few days later when thomas went out accompanied by dorcas and tabitha to meet the chief kosa and others and to discuss with them whether ultimately the missionhouse should be rebuilt upon the old site or elsewhere he found a great concourse of people all or nearly all the tribe indeed assembled on a level place where in the old days stood one of the great kraals designed to hold the kings cattle out of the crowd emerged kosa looking rather sillier than usual and of him thomas inquired why it was gathered was it to consult with him about the missionhouse  no teacher answered the chief menzi has heard that you call him a cheat and has come to show that he is none assembling all the people that they may judge between you and him  i do not want to see his tricks said thomas angrily tell him to go away  oh teacher replied kosa that would not be wise for then everyone would believe that menzis magic is so great that you are afraid even to look upon it it is better to let him try perhaps if you pray hard he will fail for his spirits will not always come when he calls them  thomas hesitated then being bold by nature determined that he would see the thing through after all menzi was an impostor and nothing else and could work no more magic than he could himself here was a providential opportunity to expose him so followed by the others he advanced into the crowd which made way for him  in an open space in its centre sat menzi wearing all his witchdoctors trappings bladders in his hair snakeskins tied about him and the rest but even in this grotesque attire still managing to look dignified with him were several acolytes or attendants one of them an old woman also peculiarly arrayed and carrying hide bags that contained their masters medicines he rose as they came saluted thomas and smiled at dorcas and tabitha very sweetly at the latter  o teacher he said my ears hear that you say that i am a liar and a cheat who have no wonders at my command to whom the spirits never speak and who deceives the people now teacher i have come here that it may be seen whether you are right or i am right if your magic is greater than mine then i can do nothing and i will eat the dust before you but if mine prevails then perhaps all these will say that you are the cheat not i also it is true that i am not a great magician as was my master zikali the openerofroads and cannot show you things worthy to be seen nor will i smell out evildoers witches and wizards since then the people might kill them and i think that there are some here who deserve to die in the ancient fashion no i will not do this since it is not right that those with you here he glanced at dorcas and tabitha should look upon the sight of blood even in this land where the whitemans law has no power still there are little things that may serve to amuse you for an hour and hurt no one have any of you lost anything for instance  yes i have said tabitha with a laugh  is it so little flower then be silent and do not say what you have lost have you told any what you have lost  no answered tabitha because i was afraid i should be scolded  there imba there little flower even that is too much because you see the old cheat might guess something from your words yes he might guess that it is something of value that you have lost such as a bracelet of gold or the thing that ticks on which you white people read the time nay be silent and do not let your face move lest i should read it now let us see what it is that you have lost  then he turned to his confederates as thomas called them and began to ask them questions which need not be set out in detail was it an animal that the little flower had lost no it was not an animal the spirits told him that it was not was it an article of dress no they did not think it was an article of dress yet the spirits seemed to suggest that it had something to do with dress was it a shoe was it scissors was it a comb was it a needle no but it was something that had to do with needles what had to do with needles thread was it thread no but something that had to do with thread was it a silver shield which pushed the needle that drew the thread  here tabitha could contain herself no longer but clapped her hands and cried out delightedly  yes thats it its my thimble  oh very well said menzi but it is easy to discover what is lost and hard to find it  then followed another long examination of the assessors or acolytes or witchdoctors chorus by which it was established at length that the thimble had been lost three days before when tabitha was sitting on a stone sewing that she believed it had fallen into a crevice of rocks and so forth  after this the chorus was silent and menzi himself took up the game apparently asking questions of the sky and putting his ear to the ground for an answer  at length he announced 1 that the thimble was not among the rocks 2 that it was not lost at all  but it is it is you silly old man cried tabitha excitedly i have hunted everywhere and i cried about it because i havent got another and cant buy one here and the needle hurts my finger  menzi contemplated her gravely as though he were looking her through and through  it is not lost little flower i see it you have it now put your hand into the pocket of your dress what do you find there  nothing said tabitha that is nothing except a hole  feel at the bottom of your dress there on the right no a little more to the front what do you feel there  something hard said tabitha  take this knife and cut the lining of your dress where you feel the hard thing ah there is the silver shield which you have been carrying about with you all these days  the crowd murmured approval dorcas exclaimed well i never and thomas looked first puzzled then angry then suspicious  does the teacher think that the floweret and the old doctor have made a plot together asked menzi can a sweet flower make plots and tell lies like the old doctor well well it is nothing now let us try something better my bags my bags  thomas made as though he would go away but menzi stopped him saying  no doubters must stay to see the end of their doubts what shall i do ah i have it  then from one of the bags he drew out a number of crooked black sticks that looked like bent ebony rulers and built them up crisscross in a little pile upon the ground next he found some bundles of fine dried grass which he thrust into the interstices between the sticks as he did so bidding one of his servants to run to the nearest hut and bring a coal of fire upon a sherd  a match will not do he said white men have touched it  presently the burning ember arrived and muttering something menzi blew upon it as though to keep it alight  now white teacher he said in a voice that had suddenly become commanding think of something think of what you will and i will show it to you  indeed said thomas with a smile i have thought of something now make good your words  menzi thrust the ember into the haylike fibres and blew they caught and blazed up fiercely making an extraordinarily large flame considering the small amount of the kindling the ebonylike sticks also began to blaze menzi grew excited  my spirit come to me my spirit come to me he cried o my spirit show this white teacher tombool that i am not a cheat  he ran round and round the fire he leapt into the air then suddenly shouted my spirit has entered into me my snake is in my breast  all his excitement went he grew quite calm almost cataleptic holding his thin hands over the fire slowly he let them fall and as he did so the fierce flames died down  its going out said tabitha  menzi smiled at her and lifted his hands again lo the fire that seemed to be dead leapt up after them in a fierce blaze again he dropped his hands and the fire died away then he moved his arms to and fro and it came back following the motions of his arms as though he drew it by a string  have you thought white teacher have you thought he asked good arise smoke  behold instead of the clear flame appeared a fanshaped column of dense white smoke behind which menzi vanished all except his outstretched hands  look on to the smoke white people and do you little flower tell me what you see there he called from behind this vaporous veil  tabitha stared they all stared then she cried out  i see a room i see an old man in a clergymans coat reading a letter why it is the dean whom we used to know in natal theres the wart on his nose and the tuft of hair that hangs down over his eye and hes reading a letter written by father i know the writing it begins my dear dean providence has appointed me to a strange place  is that what you see also teacher asked menzi and if so is it what you pictured in your thought  thomas turned away and uttered something like a groan for indeed he had thought of the dean and of the letter he had written to him a month before  the teacher is not satisfied said menzi if he had seen all he thought of being so good and honest he would tell us there is some mistake my spirit must have deceived me think of something else teacher and tell the lady and the child imba and kosa and another what it is you are thinking of go aside and tell them where i cannot hear  thomas did soin some way he felt compelled to do so  i am going to think of the church as i propose it shall be when finished according to the plans i have made he said hoarsely i am going to think of it with a belfry spire roofed with red tiles and a clock in the tower and i am going to think of the clock as pointing to the exact hour of noon do you all understand it is impossible that this man should know of how i mean to build that spire and about the clock because until this moment no one knew except myself if he can show me that i shall begin to believe that he is inspired by his master the devil do you all understand  they said they did and menzi called out  be quick white teacher be quick i grow tired my spirit grows tired the smoke grows tired come come come  they returned and stood in front of the fire and in obedience to menzis motions once more the fan of smoke arose on it grew something nebulous something uncertain that by degrees took the form of a church it was not very clear perhaps because thomas found it difficult to conceive the exact shape of the church as it would be when it was finished or only conceived it bit by bit one thing however was very distinct in his mind and that was the proposed spire and the clock as a result there was the spire standing at the end of the shadowy church vivid and distinct and there was the clock with its two copper hands exactly on the stroke of noon  tell me what you see little flower said menzi in a hollow voice  i see what father told me he would think of a church and the spire of the church and the clock pointing to twelve  do you all see that asked menzi and is it what the teacher said he would think about  yes doctor they answered  then look once more for i will think of something i will think of that church falling look once more  they looked and behold the shadowy fabric began to totter then it seemed to collapse and last of all down went the spire and vanished in the smoke  have you seen anything o people said menzi for standing behind this smoke i can see nothing mark that it is thick since through it i am invisible to you  this was true since they could only perceive the tips of his outstretched fingers appearing upon each side of the smokefan  yes they answered we have seen a church fall down and vanish  that was my thought said menzi have i not told you that was the thought my spirit gave me  this is black magic and you are a fiend shouted thomas and was silent  not so tombool though it is true that i have gifts which you clever white people do not understand answered menzi    by degrees the smoke melted away and there on the ground were the ten or twelve crooked pieces of ebony that they had seen consumed now to all appearance quite untouched by the flame there too on their farther side lay menzi shining with perspiration and in a swoon or sleeping  come away said thomas shortly and they turned to go but at this moment something happened  menzi it will be remembered had given tabitha a kid of a longhaired variety of goat peculiar to these parts this little creature had already grown attached to its mistress and walked about after her in the way which pet goats have it had followed her that morning but not being interested in tricks or magic engaged itself in devouring herbs that grew amongst the tumbled stones of the old kraal  suddenly menzi recovered from his faint or seizure and looking up directed his attendants to return the magical ebony rods which burned without being consumed to one of the hide bags that contained his medicines the assembly began to break up amidst a babel of excited talk  tabitha looked round for her goat and perceiving it at a little distance ran to fetch it since the creature being engaged in eating something to its taste would not come at her call she seized it by the neck to drag it away with the result that its forefeet obstinately set upon the wall overturned a large stone revealing a great puff adder that was sleeping there  the reptile thus disturbed instantly struck backwards after the fashion of its species so that its fangs just missing tabithas hands sank deep into the kids neck she screamed and there was a great disturbance a native ran forward and pinned down the puffadder with his walkingstick of which the top was forked the kid immediately fell on to its side and lay there bleeding and bleating tabitha began to weep calling out my goat is killed between her sobs  menzi distinguishing her voice amid the tumult asked what was the matter someone told him whereon he commanded that the kid should be brought to him and the snake also this was done tabitha following her dying pet with her mother for by now thomas had departed taking no heed of these events which perhaps he was too disturbed to notice  save my goat save my goat o menzi implored tabitha  the old witchdoctor looked at the animal also at the hideous puffadder that had been dragged along the ground in the fork of the stick  it will be hard little flower he said seeing that the goat is bitten in the neck and this snake is very poisonous still for your sake i will try although i fear that it may prove but a waste of good medicine  then he took one of his bags and from it selected a certain packet wrapped in a dried leaf out of which he shook some grey powder seizing the kid which seemed to be almost dead he made an incision in its throat over the wound and into it rubbed some of this powder next he spat upon more of the powder thus turning it into a paste and opening the kids mouth thrust it down its throat at the same time muttering an invocation or spell  now we must wait he said letting the kid fall upon the ground where it lay to all appearance dead  is that powder any good asked dorcas rather aimlessly  yes it is very good lady a medicine of power of which i alone have the secret a magic medicine see i will show you except the immamba the ringsnake that puffs out its head this one is the most deadly in our country yet i do not fear it look  leaning forward he seized the puffadder and drawing it from beneath the fork suffered it to strike him upon the breast after which he deliberately killed it with a stone then he took some of the grey powder and rubbed it into the punctures also put more of it into his mouth which he swallowed  oh exclaimed dorcas he will die and some of the christian kaffirs echoed her remark  but menzi did not die at all on the contrary after shivering a few times he was quite himself and indeed seemed rather brighter than before like a jaded business man who has drunk a cocktail  no wife of tombool he said i shall not die every year i doctor myself with this magic medicine that is called dawa after which all the snakes in sisalandremember that they are many little flowermay bite me if they like  is it your magic or is it the medicine that protects you asked dorcas  both lady the medicine dawa is of no use without the magic words and the magic words are of no use without the medicine therefore alone in all the land i can cure snake bites who have both medicine and magic look at your goat little flower look at your goat  tabitha looked as did everyone else the kid was rising to its feet it rose it baad and presently began to frisk about its mistress like menzi apparently rather brighter than before    v  a year had gone by during which time by the most heroic exertions thomas bull had at length succeeded in rebuilding the church there it stood a very nice missionchurch constructed of sundried bricks neatly plastered over cool and spacious within for the thatched roof was lofty beautifully furnished the font and the pulpit had been imported from england and finished off with the spire and clock of his dreams the latter also imported from england and especially adjusted for a hot climate  moreover there was a sweet and loudthroated bell upon which the clock struck with space allowed for the addition of others that must wait till thomas could make up his mind to approach dorcas as to the provision of the necessary funds yes the church was finished and the bishop of those parts had made a special journey to consecrate it at the hottest season of the year and as a reward for his energy had contracted fever and nearly been washed away in a flooded river  only one thing was lacking a sufficient congregation to fill this fine church which secretly the bishop who was a sensible man thought would have been of greater value had it been erected in any of several other localities that he could have suggested for alas the christian community of sisaland did not increase occasionally thomas succeeded in converting one of menzis followers and occasionally menzi snatched a lamb from the flock of thomas with the result that the scales remained even neither going up nor down  the truth was of course that the matter was chiefly one of race those of the sisas in whom the basuto blood preponderated became christian while those who were of the stubborn zulu stock strengthened and inspired by their prophet menzi remained unblushingly heathen  still thomas did not despair one day he told himself there would be a great change a veritable landslide and he would see that church filled with every zulu in the district needless to say he wished him no ill but menzi was an old man and before long it might please providence to gather that accursed wizard to his fathers for that he was a wizard of some sort thomas no longer doubted a person directly descended from the witch of endor or from some others of her company who were mentioned in the bible there was ample authority for wizards and if they existed then why should they they not continue to do so since he could not explain it thomas swallowed the magic much as in his boyhood he used to swallow the pills  yes if only menzi were removed by the will of heaven which really thought thomas must be outraged by such proceedings his opportunity would come and menzis herd as the heathens were called in sisaland would be added to his own the bishop it is true was not equally sanguine but said nothing to discourage zeal so laudable and so uncommon  it was while his lordship was recovering from the sharp bout of fever which he had developed in a new and mosquitohaunted hut with a damp floor that had been especially erected for his accommodation that at last the question of the rebuilding of the missionhouse came to a head which it could not do while all the available local labour to say nothing of some hired from afar was employed upon the church  thomas it was true wished to postpone it further pointing out that a school was most necessary and that after all they had grown quite accustomed to the huts and were fairly comfortable in them  on this point however dorcas was firm indeed it would not be too much to say that having already been disappointed once she struck with all the vigour of a tradeunionist she explained that the situation of the huts on the brink of the river was low and most unhealthy and that in them she was becoming a victim to recurrent attacks of fever he thomas might be feverproof as indeed she thought he was it was true also that tabitha had been extraordinarily well and grown much ever since she came to sisaland which puzzled her inasmuch as the place was notoriously unhealthy for children even if they were of native blood indeed in her agitation she added an unwise remark to the effect that she could only explain their daughters peculiar health by supposing that menzi had laid a good charm upon her as all the natives believed and he announced publicly that he had done  this made thomas very angry admittedly not without cause forgetting his conversation to a belief in the reality of menzis magic he talked in a loud voice about the disgrace of being infected with vile heathen superstitions such as he had never thought to hear uttered by his wifes christian lips dorcas however stuck to her point and enforced it by a domestic example adding that the creatures which in polite society are called bedpests that haunted the straw of the huts tormented her while tabitha never had so much as a single bite  the end of it was that the matter of missionhouse versus huts was referred to the bishop for his opinion as the teeth of his lordship were chattering with ague resulting he knew full well from the fever he had contracted in the said huts dorcas found in him a most valuable ally he agreed that a missionhouse ought to be built before the school or anything else and suggested that it should be placed in a higher and better situation above the mists that rose from the river and the height to which mosquitoes fly  bowing to the judgment of his superior which really he heard with gratitude although in his zeal and unselfishness he would have postponed his own comfort and that of his family till other duties had been fulfilled thomas replied that he knew only one such place which would be near enough to the chiefs town it was on the koppie itself about fifty feet above the level of and overhanging the river where he had noted there was always a breeze even on the hottest day since the conformation of this hill seemed to induce an unceasing draught of air he added that if his lordship were well enough they might go to look at the site  so they went all of them ascending a sloping ancient path that was never precipitous they came to the place a flat tableland that perhaps measured an acre and a half which by some freak of nature had been scooped out of the side of the koppie and was backed by a precipitous cliff in which were caves the front part of this plateau that which approached to and overhung the river was of virgin rock but the acre or so behind was filled with very rich soil that in the course of centuries had been washed down from the sides of the koppie or resulted from the decomposition of its material  the very place said the bishop the access is easy the house would stand hereno need to dig deep foundations in this stone and behind when those trees have been cleared away you could have a beautiful and fertile garden where anything will grow also look there is a stream of pure water running from some spring above it is an ideal site for a house not more than three minutes walk from the church below the best i should say in the whole valley and then consider the view  everyone agreed and they were leaving the place in high spirits dorcas who had household matters to attend having already departed when whom should they encounter but menzi seated on a stone just where the path began to descend thomas would have passed him without notice as one with whom he was not on speaking terms but the bishop having been informed by tabitha who he was was moved by curiosity to stop and interchange some words with him as knowing his tongue perfectly he could do  sakubona that is good day he said politely  menzi rose and saluted with his habitual courtesy first the bishop then the others as usual reserving his sweetest smile for tabitha  great priest he said at once i understand that the teacher tombool intends to build his house upon this place  the bishop wondered how on earth the man knew that since the matter had only just been decided by people talking in english but answered that perhaps he might do so  great priest went on menzi in an earnest voice i pray you to forbid the teacher tombool from doing anything of the sort  why friend asked the bishop  because great priest this place is haunted by the spirits of the dead and those who live here will be haunted also hearken i myself when i was young have seen evildoers brought from zululand and hurled from that rock blinded and brokenarmed by order of the king i say that scores have been thrown thence to be devoured by the crocodiles in the pool below will such a sight as this be pleasant for white eyes to look upon and will such cries as those of the evildoers who have gone down be nice for white ears to hear in the silence of the night  but my good man said the bishop what you say is nonsense these poor creatures are dead gone down as you say and do not return we christians have no belief in ghosts or if they exist we are protected from them  none at all interposed thomas boldly and speaking in zulu this man my lord is at his old tricks for reasons of his own he is trying to frighten us for my part i will not be frightened by a native witchdoctor and his rubbish even if he does deal with satan with your permission i shall certainly build the missionhouse here  quite right of course quite right said the bishop though within himself he reflected that evidently the associations of the spot were disagreeable and that were he personally concerned perhaps he should be inclined to consider an alternative site however it was a matter for mr bull to decide  i hear that tombool will not be turned from his purpose i hear that he will still build his house upon this rock so be it let him do so and see but this i say that imba the floweret shall not be haunted by the isitunzi the ghosts of the dead who wail in the night said menzi  he advanced to tabitha and holding his hands over her he cried out  sweet eyes be blind to the isitunzi little ears do not hear their groans spirits build a garden fence about this flower and keep her safe from all nightprowling evil things imba little flower sleep softly while others lie awake and tremble  then he turned and departed swiftly  dear me said the bishop a strange man a very strange man i dont know quite what to make of him  i do answered thomas he is a blackhearted villain who is in league with the devil  yes i dare sayi mean as to his being a villain that is according to our standardsbut does your daughtera clever and most attractive little girl by the waythink so she seemed to look on him with affectionone learns to read childrens eyes you know a very strange man i repeat if we could see all his heart we should know lots of things and understand more about these people than we do at present has it ever struck you mr bull how little we white people do understand of the black mans soul perhaps a child can see farther into it than we can what is the sayinga little child shall lead them is it not perhaps we do not make enough allowances faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is charityor love which is the same thing however of course you are quite right not to have been frightened by his silly talk about the isitunzi it would never do to show fear or hesitation still i am glad that mrs bull did not hear it you may have noticed that she had gone on ahead and if i were you i should not repeat it to her since ladies are so nervous tabitha my dear dont tell your mother anything of all this  no bishop answered tabitha i never tell her all the queer things that menzi says to me when i meet him or at least not many of them  i wish i had asked him if he had a cure for your local fever said the bishop with a laugh for against it although i have taken so much that my ears buzz quinine cannot prevail  he has given me one in a gourd bishop replied tabitha confidentially but i have never taken any because you see i have had no fever and i havent told mother for if i did she would tell father thomas had stridden ahead and was out of hearing and he might be angry because he doesnt like menzi though i do will you have some bishop it is well corked up with clay and menzi said it would keep for years  well my dear answered the bishop i dont quite know there may be all sorts of queer things in mr menzis medicine still he told you to drink it if necessary and i am absolutely certain that he does not wish to poison you so perhaps i might have a try for really i feel uncommonly ill  so later on with much secrecy the gourd was produced and the bishop had a try by some strange coincidence he felt so much better after it that he begged for the rest of the stuff to comfort him on his homeward journey which ultimately he accomplished in the best of health    that most admirable and wideminded prelate departed and so far as history records was no more seen in sisaland but thomas remained and set about the building of the house with his usual vigour upon the death rock as it was called in course of time he erected an excellent and most serviceable dwelling not too large but large enough having every comfort and convenience that his local experience could suggest and money could supply since in this matter the chequebook of the suffering dorcas was entirely at his service  at length the house was finished and with much rejoicing the bull family deserting their squalid huts moved into it at the commencement of the hot season after the first agitations of the change and of the arrangement of the furniture newlyarrived by wagon they settled down very comfortably directing all their energies towards the development of the garden which had already been brought into some rough order during the building of the house  one difficulty however arose at once for some mysterious reason they found that not a single native servant would sleep in the place no not even tabithas personal attendant who adored her every soul of them suddenly developed a sick mother or other relative who would instantly expire if deprived of the comfort of their society after dark or else they themselves became ailing at that hour saying they could not sleep upon a cliff like a rockrabbit  at any rate for one cause or another off they went the very moment that the sun vanished behind the western hills nor did they reappear until it was well up above those that faced towards the east  at least this happened for one night on the following day however a pleasantlooking woman named ivana whom they knew to be of good repute though of doubtful religion as sometimes she came to church and sometimes she did not appeared and offered her services as nightdogthat is what she called itto tabitha saying that she did not mind sleeping on a height since it was inconvenient to have no one about the place from dark to dawn and dorcas did not approve of tabitha being left to sleep alone the woman whose character was guaranteed by the chief kosa and the elders of the church was taken on at an indefinite wage to the matter of pecuniary reward indeed she seemed to be entirely indifferent  for the rest she rolled herself in blankets native fashion and slept across tabithas door keeping so good a watch that once when her father wished to enter the room to fetch something after the child was sleep she would not allow even him to do so when he tried to force a way past her suddenly ivana became so threatening that he thought she was about to spring at him after this he wanted to dismiss her but dorcas said it only showed that she was faithful and that she had better be left where she was especially as there was no one to take her place  so things went on till the day of full moon on that night ivana appeared to be much agitated and insisted that tabitha should go to bed earlier than was usual also after she was asleep dorcas noticed that ivana walked continually to and fro in front of the door of the childs room and up and down the veranda on to which its windows opened droning some strange song and waving a wand  however at the appointed hour having said their prayers dorcas and her husband went to bed  i wonder if there is anything strange about this place remarked dorcas it is so very odd that no native will stop here at night except that halfwild ivana  oh i dont know replied thomas with a yawn real or feigned these people get all sorts of ideas into their silly heads do stop twisting about and go to sleep  at last dorcas did go to sleep only to wake up again suddenly and with great completeness just as the church clock below struck three the sound of which she supposed must have roused her the brilliant moonlight flooded the room and as for some reason she felt creepy and disturbed dorcas tried to occupy her mind by reflecting how comfortable it looked with its new imported furnishings very different from that horrible hut in which they had lived so long  then her thoughts drifted to more general matters she was heartily tired of sisaland and wished earnestly that her husband could get a change of station which the bishop had hinted to her would not be impossiblesomewhere nearer to civilisation alas he was so obstinate that she feared nothing would move him at any rate until he had converted menzis herd who were also obstinate and remained as heathen as ever indeed why with their ample means should they be condemned to perpetual exile in these barbarous places was there not plenty of work to be done at home where they might make friends and live decently  putting herself and her own wishes aside this existence was not fair to tabitha who as she saw watching her with a mothers eye was becoming impregnated with the native atmosphere she who ought to be at a christian school now talked more zulu than she did english and was beginning to look at things from the zulu point of view and to use their idioms and metaphors even when speaking her own tongue she had become a kind of little chieftainess among these folk also christian and heathen alike indeed now most of them spoke of her as the maiden inkosikazi or chieftainess and accepted her slightest wish or order as law which was by no means the case where dorcas herself and even thomas were concerned  in fact one or twice they had been driven to make a request through the child notably upon an important occasion that had to do with the transportriding of their furniture to avoid its being left for a couple of months on the farther side of a flooded river the details do not matter but what happened was that when tabitha intervened that which had been declared to be impossible proved possible and the furniture arrived with wonderful celerity moreover tabitha made no request as dorcas knew though she hid it from thomas she sent for the headmen and when they were seated on the ground before her after their fashion menzi among them issued an order saying  what are my parents and i to live like dogs without a kennel or cattle that lack a winter kraal because you are idle inspan the wagons and fetch the things or i shall be angry hambago  thereon they rose and went without argument only lifting their right hands above their heads and murmuring ikosikaas umame chieftainess mother we hear you yes they called tabitha mother  it was all very wrong thought dorcas but she supposed being a pious little person that she must bear her burden and trust to providence to free her from it and she closed her eyes to wipe away a tear    when dorcas opened them again something very strange seemed to have happened she felt wide awake and yet knew that she must be dreaming because the room had disappeared there was nothing in sight except the bare rock upon which the house stood for instance she could see the gorge behind as it used to be before they made it into a garden for she recognised some of the very trees that they had cut down moreover from one of the caves at the end of it issued a procession a horrible procession of fiercelooking savage warriors with spears and knobkerries who between them half dragged half carried a young woman and an elderly man  they advanced they passed within a few feet of her and observing the condition of the woman and the man she saw that these must be led because for a certain reason they could not see where to gooh never mind what she saw  the procession reached the edge of the rock where the railing was only now the railing had gone like the house then for the first time dorcas heard for hitherto all had seemed to happen in silence  die umtakati die you wizard as the king commands and feed the riverdwellers said a deep voice  there followed a struggle a horrible twisting of shapes and the elderly man vanished over the cliff while a moment later from below came the noise of a great splash  next the girl was haled forward and the words of doom were repeated she seemed to break from her murderers and stagger to the edge of the precipice crying out  o father i come  then with one bloodcurdling shriek she vanished also and again there followed the sound of a great splash that slowly echoed itself to silence    all had passed away leaving dorcas paralysed with terror and wet with its dew so that her nightgear clung to her body the room was just as it had been filled with the soft moonlight and looking very comfortable  thomas gasped his wife wake up  i am awake he answered in his deep voice which shook a little i have had a bad dream  what did you dream did you see two people thrown from the cliff  something of that sort  oh thomas thomas i have been in hell this place is haunted dont talk to me of dreams tabitha will have seen and heard too she will be driven mad come to her  i think not answered thomas  still he came  at the door of tabithas room they found the woman ivana wideeyed solemn silent  have you seen or heard anything ivana asked thomas  yes teacher she answered i have seen what i expected to see and heard what i expected to hear on this night of full moon but i am guarded and do not fear  the child the child said dorcas  the inkosikazi imba sleeps disturb her not  taking no heed they thrust past her into the room there on her little white bed lay tabitha fast asleep and looking like an angel in her sleep for a sweet smile played about her mouth and while they watched she laughed in her dreams then they looked at each other and went back to their own chamber to spend the rest of the night as may be imagined  next morning when they emerged very shaken and upset the first person they met was ivana who was waiting for them with their coffee  i have a message for you teacher and lady never mind who sends it i have a message for you to which you will do well to give heed sleep no more in this house on the night of full moon though all other nights will be good for you only the little chieftainess imba ought to sleep in this house on the night of full moon  so indeed it proved to be no suburban villa could have been more commonplace and less disturbed than was their dwelling for twentyseven nights of every month but on the twentyeighth they found a change of air desirable once it is true the stalwart thomas like ajax defied the lightning or rather other things that come from aboveor from below but before morning he appeared at the hut beneath the koppie announcing that he had come to see how they were getting on and shaking as though he had a bout of fever  dorcas asked him no questions afterwards she gathered that he had been favoured with quite a new and very varied midnight programme but tabitha smiled in her slow way for tabitha knew all about this business as she knew everything that passed in sisaland moreover she laughed at them a little and said that she was not afraid to sleep in the missionhouse on the night of full moon  what is more she did so which was naughty of her for on one such occasion she slipped back to the house when her parents were asleep followed only by her nightdog the watchful ivana and returned at dawn just as they had discovered that she was missing singing and laughing and jumping from stone to stone with the agility of her own pet goat  i slept beautifully she cried and dreamed i was in heaven all night  thomas was furious and rated her till she wept then suddenly ivana became furious too and rated him  should he be wrath with the little chieftainess imba she asked him because the isitunzis the spirits of the dead loved her as did everything else did they not understand that the floweret was unlike them one adored of dead and living one to be cherished even in her dreams one whom heaven above together with those who had gone below built round with a wall of spellsand more of such talk which thomas thought so horrible and blasphemous that he fled before its torrent  but when he came back calmer he said no more to tabitha about her escapade    it was a long while afterwards at the beginning of the great drought that another terrible thing happened on a certain calm and beautiful day tabitha who still grew and flourished had taken some of the christian children to a spot on the farther side of the koppie where stood an old fortification originally built for purposes of defence here among the ancient walls with the assistance of the natives she had made a kind of summerhouse as children love to do and in this house like some learned eastern pundit in a cell a very pretty pundit crowned with a wreath of flowers she sat upon the ground and instructed the infant mind of sisaland  she was supposed to be telling them bible stories to prepare them for their sunday school examination which indeed she did with embellishments and in their own poetic and metaphorical fashion the particular tale upon which she was engaged by a strange coincidence was that from the acts which narrates how st paul was bitten by a viper upon the island of melita and how he shook it off into the fire and took no hurt  he must have been like menzi said ivana who was present whereon tabithas other attendant who was also with her as it was daytime started an argument for being a christian she was no friend to menzi whom she called a dirty old witchdoctor  tabitha who was used to these disputations listened smiling and while she listened amused herself by trying to thrust a stone into a hole in the side of her summerhouse which was formed by one of the original walls of the old kraal  presently she uttered a scream and snatched her arm out of the hole to it or rather to her hand was hanging a great hooded snake of the cobra variety such as the boers call ringhals she shook it off and the reptile after sitting up spitting hissing and expanding its hood glided back into the wall tabitha sat still staring at her lacerated finger which ivana seized and sucked  then bidding one of the oldest of the children to take her place and continue sucking ivana ran to a high rock a few yards away which overlooked menzis kraal that lay upon a plain at a distance of about a quarter of a mile and called out in the low ringing voice that kaffirs can command which carries to an enormous distance  awake o menzi come o doctor and bring with you your dawa the little chieftainess is bitten in the finger by a hooded snake the floweret withers imba dies  almost instantly there was a disturbance in the kraal and menzi appeared following by a man carrying a bag he cried back in the same strange voice  i hear i come tie string or grass round the lady imbas finger below the bite tie it hard till she screams with pain  meanwhile the christian nurse had rushed off over the crest of the koppie to fetch thomas and dorcas or either of them as it chanced she met them both walking to join tabitha in her bower and thus it came about that they reached the place at the same moment as did old menzi bounding up the rocks like a klipspringer buck or a mountain sheep hearing him thomas turned in the narrow gateway of the kraal and asked wildly  what has happened witchdoctor  this has happened whiteman answered menzi the floweret has been bitten by a hooded snake and is about to die look at her and he pointed to tabitha who notwithstanding the venom sucking and the grass tied round her blackened finger sat huddledup shivering and half comatose  let me pass whiteman that i may save her if i can he went on  get back said thomas i will have none of your black magic practised on my daughter if she is to live god will save her  what medicines have you whiteman asked menzi  none at least not here faith is my medicine  dorcas looked at tabitha she was turning blue and her teeth were chattering  let the man do his best she said to thomas there is no other hope  he shant touch her replied her husband obstinately  then dorcas fired up meeknatured though she was and accustomed though she was to obey her husbands will  i say that he shall she cried i know what he can do dont you remember the goat i will not see my child die as a sacrifice to your pride  i have made up my mind answered thomas if she dies it is so decreed and the spells and filth of a heathen cannot save her  dorcas tried to thrust him aside with her feeble strength but big and burly he stood in the path like a rock blocking the way with the stone entrance walls of the little pleasurehouse on either side of him  suddenly the old zulu menzi became rather terrible he drew himself up he seemed to swell in size his thin face grew set and fierce  out of the path whiteman he said or by chakas head i will kill you and from somewhere he produced a long thinbladed knife of native iron fixed on a bucks horn  kill on wizard shouted thomas kill if you can  listen said dorcas if our daughter dies because of you then i have done with you we part for ever do you understand  yes i understand he answered heavily so be it  tabitha behind them made some convulsive noise thomas turned and looked at her she was slowly sinking down upon her side his face changed all the rage and obstinacy went out of it  my child oh my child he cried i cannot bear this love is stronger than all when i come up for judgment may it be remembered that love is stronger than all  then he stepped out of the gateway and sat down upon a stone hiding his eyes with his hand  menzi threw down the knife and leapt in followed by his servant who bore his medicines and the woman ivana he did his office he uttered his spells and invocations he rubbed dawa into the wound and prising open the childs clenched teeth thrust more of it a great deal more down her throat while all three of them rubbed her cold limbs    about half an hour afterwards he came out of the place followed by ivana who carried tabitha in her strong arms tabitha was very weak but smiling and with the colour returning to her cheeks of thomas he took no notice but to dorcas he said  lady i give you back your daughter she is saved let her drink milk and sleep  then thomas whose judgment and charity were shaken for a while spoke saying  as a man and a father i thank you witchdoctor but know that as a priest i swear that i will never have more to do with you who i am sure by your arts can command these reptiles to work your will and have planned all this to shame me no not even if you lay dying would i come to visit you  thus stormed thomas in his wrath and humiliation believing that he had been the victim of a plot and not knowing that he would live bitterly to regret his words  i see that you hate me teacher said menzi and though here i do not find the gentleness you preach i do not wonder it is quite natural were i you i should do the same but you are little flowers fatherstrange that she should have grown from such a seedand though we fight for that reason i cannot hate you be not disturbed perhaps it was the sucking of the wound and the grass tied round her finger which saved her not my spells and medicine no no i cannot hate you although we fight for mastery and you pelt me with vile words saying that i charmed a deadly immamba to bite little flower whom i love that i might cure her and make a mock of you yet i do hate that snake which bit the maiden imba of its own wickedness the hooded immamba that you believe to be my familiar and it shall die man here he turned to his servant and you ivana and the others pull down that wall  they leapt to do his bidding and presently discovered the ringhals in its hole heedless of its fangs and writhings menzi sprang at it with a zulu curse and seizing it proceeded to kill it in a very slow and cruel fashion    vi  the great drought fell upon sisaland like a curse from heaven for month after month the sun beat fiercely the sky was as brass and no rain fell even the dews seemed to depart the springs dried up the river ukufa the river called death ceased to flow so that water could only be found in its deepest hollows the pool beneath the rock of evildoers the death rock sank till the bones of those who had been murdered there many years before appeared as the crocodiles had left them cattle died because there was no grass cows ceased to give their milk even where they could be partially fed and watered so that the little children died also even in the dampest situations the crops withered till at last it became certain that unless rain fell within a month before another cold season had gone by there would be starvation everywhere for the drought was widespread and therefore corn could not be sent from other districts even if there were cattle to draw it  every day thomas put up prayers for rain in the church and on two occasions held special services for this purpose these were better attended than any others had ever been because his congregation felt that the matter was extremely urgent affecting them all and that now was the time when whatever happened to the heathen good christians like themselves should be rewarded  however this did not chance since the drought went on as fiercely as before  menzi was of course a raindoctor a heavenherd of the highest distinction one who it was reputed could by his magic cause the most brazen sky to melt in tears his services had been called in by neighbouring tribes with the result it was rumoured that those tribes had been rewarded with partial showers also with great ceremony he had gone through his rites for the benefit of the heathen section of the sisa people behold by some curious accident on the following day a thunderstorm had come up and with it a short deluge of rain which sufficed to make it certain that the crops in those fields on which it fell would keep alive at any rate for a while  but mark what happened as is not uncommon in the case of thunder showers this rain fell upon the lands which the heathen cultivated on one side of the koppie whereas those that belonged to the christian section upon the other side received not a single drop the unjust were bedewed the just were left dry as bones all that they received was the lightning which killed an old man one of the best christians in the place the limits of the torrent might have been marked off with a line when it had passed to the heathen right stood pools of water to the christian left there was nothing but blowing dust  now these christians weakkneed some of them began to murmur especially those who having passed through a similar experience in their youth remembered what starvation meant in that country religion they reflected was all very well but without mealies they could not live and without kaffir corn there would be no beer indeed metaphorically before long they passed from murmurs to shouting and their shouts said this menzi must be invited to celebrate a rainservice in his own fashion for the benefit of the entire tribe  thomas argued in vain he grew angry he called them names which doubtless they deserved he said that they were spiritual outcasts by this time being frantic his flock did not care what he said either menzi must come they explained or they would turn heathen the great one in the sky could work as well through menzi as through him tombool or anybody else menzi must come  thomas threatened to excommunicate them all a menace which did not amount to much as they were already excommunicating themselves and when they remained obstinate told them that he would have nothing to do with this rainmaking business which was unholy and repugnant to him he told them moreover that he was certain that their wickedness would bring some judgment upon them in which he proved to be right  the end of it was that menzi was summoned and arrived with a triumphant smile saying that he was certain he could put everything in order and that soon they would have plenty of rain that is if they all attended his invocations and made him presents suitable to so great an occasion  the result was that they did attend them man woman and child seated in a circle in that same old kraal where the witchdoctor had so marvellously shown pictures upon the smoke each of them also brought his gift in his hand or if it were a living thing drove it before him  thomas went down and addressed them in the midst of a sullen silence calling them wicked and repeating his belief that they would bring a judgment on their own heads they who were worshipping baal and making offerings to his priest  after he had talked himself hoarse menzi said mildly that if the teacher tombool had finished he would get to business why should the teacher be angry because he menzi offered to do what the teacher could notsave the land from starving and as for the gifts to himself did not white teachers also receive pay and offerings at certain feasts  then making a gesture of despair thomas returned to his house and with dorcas and tabitha watched the savage ceremony from the edge of the cliff that overhung the river or rather what had been the river he could not see much of it because they were too far away but he perceived those apostate christians prostrating themselves at menzis order probably he reflected to make prayers to the devil in fact they were not doing this but only repeating menzis magical chants with appropriate gestures as for countless ages their forefathers had done upon similar occasions  next an unfortunate black goat was dragged forward by the horns a very thin black goat and its throat was cut over a little fire a sacrifice that suggested necromancy of the most satanic sort  after this thomas and his family went back into the house and shut the windows that they might not hear the unholy shoutings of the misguided mob when they went out again menzi had departed and so had the others the place was empty  the following day was sunday and thomas locked the church on the inner side and read the service with dorcas and tabitha for sole congregation it was a melancholy business for some sense of evil seemed to hang over all three of them also over everybody else for the christians went about with dejected looks and not one person spoke to them only ivana came at night as usual to sleep with tabitha though even she said nothing  next morning they woke up to find the heavens black with clouds heavy ominous clouds the truth being that the drought was drawing to its natural end thomas noted this and reflected bitterly how hard it was that this end should not have come twentyfour hours earlier but so events had been decreed and he was helpless  by midday it began to rain lightly at first and from his rock he could see the people looking unnatural and distorted in that strange gloom for the clouds had descended almost to the earth rushing about holding out their hands as though to clasp the blessed moisture and talking excitedly one to the other soon they were driven into their huts for the rain turned into a kind of waterspout never had such rain been known in sisaland  all that afternoon it poured and all the night with everincreasing violence yes and all the following morning so that by noon thomass raingauge showed that over twelve inches had fallen in about twentyfour hours and it was still raining water rushed down from the koppie even their wellbuilt house could not keep out the wet and to the despair of dorcas several of the rooms were flooded and some of the new furniture was spoiled the river beneath had become a raging torrent and was rising every hour already it was over its banks and the water had got into the huts of the chiefs kraal and the village round it so that their occupants were obliged to seek safety upon the lower rocks of the koppie where they sat shivering in the wet  night came at last and through the darkness they heard cries as of people in distress the long hours wore away till dawn a melancholy dawn for still it rained though more lightly now and no sun could be seen  father cried tabitha who clad in oilskins had gone a little way down the road come here and look  he went the child pointed to the village below or rather what had been the village for now there was none it had gone and with it kosas kraal the site was a pool the huts had vanished all of them and some of the roofs lay upon the sides of the koppie looking like overturned coracles only the church and the graveyard remained for those stood on slightly higher ground by the banks of the river  a little while later a miserable and dejected crowd arrived at the missionhouse wrapped up in blankets or anything else that they had managed to save  what do you want asked thomas  teacher replied the chief kosa with twitching face and rolling eyes we want you to come down to the church and pray for us our houses are gone our fields are washed away we want you to come to pray for us for more rain is gathering on the hills and we are afraid  you mean that you are cold and wish to take refuge in the church of which i have the key you have sought rain and now you have got rain such rain as you deserve why do you complain go to your witchdoctor and ask him to save you  teacher come down to the church and pray for us they wailed  in the end thomas went for his heart was moved to pity and dorcas and tabitha went with him  they entered the church wading to it through several inches of water and the service of intercession began attended by every christian in the placeexcept a few who were drowneda miserable and heartily repentant crowd    while it was still in progress suddenly there was a commotion and menzi himself rushed into the church it was the first time he had ever entered there  come forth he cried come forth if you would save your lives the water has eaten away the ground underneath this heavenhouse it falls i say it falls  then he peered about him in the shadowed place till he found tabitha leaping at her he threw his long thin arms round her and bore her from the church the others began to follow swiftly and as menzi passed the door carrying tabitha there came a dreadful rending sound and one of the walls opened letting in the light  all fled forth thomas still in his surplice and his soul filled with bitterness for as he went it came into his mind that this must be a farewell to that cherished church reared with so much love cost and labour  outside the building on a patch of higher land an upthrown plateau of rock where presently all gathered beyond the reach of the waters stood menzi and tabitha thomas looked at him and said  doubtless you think that your spells have worked well witchdoctor for see the ruin about us yet i hold otherwise and say wait till the end to set a rock rolling down a hill is easy for those who have the strength but who knows on whom it will fall at last  you speak foolishly teacher answered menzi i do not think that my spells have worked well for something stronger than i am has spoiled them mayhap it is you teacher or the greatgreat whom you serve in your own fashion i do not know but i pray you to remember that long since on the smoke of my magic fire i showed you what would come about if you rebuilt the heavenhouse upon this place but you said i was a cheat and would not be warned therefore things have gone as the spirits appointed that they should go your christians made me gifts and asked me to bring rain and it has come in plenty and with it other things more than you asked look and he pointed downwards  the church was falling its last foundations were washed away down it came with a mighty crash to melt into the flood that presently filled the place where it had been its collapse and the noise of it were terrible so terrible that the christians gathered on the rock uttered a heartrending wail of woe the spire being built upon a deeper bed because of its weight stood longer than the rest of the fabric but presently it went also  thrice it seemed to bow towards them then it fell like a childs castle reckoning its height with his eye thomas saw that it could not reach them where they stood and so did the others therefore no one stirred as the tower collapsed the clock sounded the first stroke of the hour then suddenly became silent for ever and vanished beneath the waters a mass of broken metal  but the bell on which it had struck was hurled forward by the sway of the fall like a stone from a sling it sped towards them through the air a great dark object men ran this way and that so that it fell upon the rock where none stood it fell it flew to pieces like an exploding shell and its fragments hurtled over them with a screaming sound yet as it chanced the tongue or clapper of it took a lower course perhaps because it was heavier and rushing onwards like a thrown spear struck menzi full upon the chest crushing in his breast bone  they bore him up to the missionhouse since there was nowhere else whither he could be taken here they laid him on a bed leaving the woman ivana to watch him for they had no skill to deal with such injuries as his indeed they thought him dead  for a long while menzi lay senseless but after night had fallen his mind returned to him and he bade ivana bring tabitha to him tabitha and no one else if she could not or would not come then ivana must bring no one else for if she did he would curse her and die at once  there were discussions and remonstrances but in the end tabitha was allowed to go for after all a fellowcreature was dying and this was his last wish she came and menzi received her smiling yes he smiled and saluted her with shaking but uplifted arm naming her inkosikazi and umame or mother  welcome maiden imba welcome little flower he said i wish to say goodbye to you and to bless you also to endow you with my spirit that it may guard you throughout your life till you are as i am i have hated some of the others but i have always loved you little flower  and i have loved you too menzi said tabitha with a sob  i know i know we witchdoctors read hearts but do not weep little flower why should you for such as i a black man a mere savage cheat as your father named me yet i have not been altogether a cheat o imba though sometimes i used tricks like other doctors for i have a strength of my own which your white people will never understand because they are too young to understand it only comes to the old folk who have been since the beginning of the world and remain as they were at the beginning i have been wicked little flower according to your white law i have killed men and done many other things that are according to the law of my own people and by that law i look for judgment yet o imba i will say thisthat i believe your law to be higher and better than my law has it not been shown today since of all that were gathered on the rock yonder i alone was struck down and in the hour of my victory the strongest law must be the best law is it not so tell me little flower would it please you if i died a christian  yes very much said tabitha fixing upon this point at once and by instinct avoiding all the other very doubtful disputations i will bring my father  nay nay little flower your father the teacher tombool swore in his wrath that he would not come to visit me even if i lay dying and now that i am dying he shall keep his oath and repent of it day by day till he too is dying if i am to die a christian you must make me one this moment you and no other otherwise i go hence a heathen as i have lived if you bring your father here i will die at once before he can touch me as i have power to do    then tabitha who although so young had strength and understanding and knew if she thwarted him that menzi would do as he threatened took water and made a certain sign upon the brow of that old witchdoctor uttering also certain words that she had often heard used in church at baptisms  perhaps she was wrong perhaps she transgressed and took too much upon her still being by nature courageous she ran the risk and did these things as afterwards ivana testified to the followers of menzi  thank you little flower said menzi i do not suppose that this christian magic will do me any good but that you wished it is enough it will be a rope to tie us together little flower also i have another thought when it is known that i became a christian at the last then if you bid them little flower the heathenherd will follow where the bull menzi went before them they are but broken sherds and scorched sticks ie rubbish but they will follow and that will please you little flower and your father also  here menzis breath failed but recovering it he continued  hearken o imba i give my people into your hand now let your hand bend the twig as you would have it grow make them christian if you will or leave them heathen if you will i care nothing they are yours to drive upon whatever path you choose to set their feet yours o imba not tombools also i who lack heirs give you my cattle all of them ivana make known my words and with them the curse of menzi the kings child the umazisi the seer on any who dare to disobey say to those of my house and to my people that henceforth the maiden imba is their lady and their mother  again he paused a little then went on  now i charge my spirit to watch over you little flower till you die and we come to talk over these matters otherwhere and my spirit as it departs tells me that it will watch well and that you will be a very happy woman little flower  he shut his eyes and lay still a while then he opened them again and said  o imba tell your father the teacher tombool from me that he does not understand us black people whom he thinks so common as you understand us little flower and that he would be wise to go to minister to white ones  after this once more he smiled at tabitha and then shut his eyes again for the last time and that was the end of the witchdoctor menzi    it may be added that after he had rebuilt the church for the second time and numbered all the menziherd among his congregation which he did now that the bull of the herd was dead as menzi had foretold that he would if tabitha whom he had wrapped with his blanket decreed it thomas took the sage advice of his departed enemy  now in the after years he is the must respected if somewhat feared bishop of white settlers in a remote dominion of the crown  thomas today knows more than he used to know but one thing he has never learned namely that it was the hand of a maid yes the little hidden hand of tabitha that drove all menzis herd into the gates of the heavenly kraal as some of them named his church  for tabitha knew when to be silent perhaps the kaffirs whose minds she could read as an open book taught her this or perhaps it was one of the best gifts to her of old menzis spirit into whose care he passed her with so much formality    this is the story of the great fight between thomas bull the missionary and menzi the witchdoctor who was led by his love of a little child whither he never wished to go not for his own souls sake but just because of that little child  menzi did not care about his soul but being so strange a man for some reason that he never explained for tabitha his little flower he cared very much indeed that was why he became a christian at the last since in his darkened spellbound heart he believed that if he did not when she too went down he would never find her again      only a dream    footprintsfootprintsthe footprints of one dead how ghastly they look as they fall before me up and down the long hall they go and i follow them pit pat they fall those unearthly steps and beneath them starts up that awful impress i can see it grow upon the marble a damp and dreadful thing  tread them down tread them out follow after them with muddy shoes and cover them up in vain see how they rise through the mire who can tread out the footprints of the dead  and so on up and down the dim vista of the past following the sound of the dead feet that wander so restlessly stamping upon the impress that will not be stamped out rave on wild wind eternal voice of human misery fall dead footsteps eternal echo of human memory stamp miry feet stamp into forgetfulness that which will not be forgotten  and so on on to the end    pretty ideas these for a man about to be married especially when they float into his brain at night like ominous clouds into a summer sky and he is going to be married tomorrow there is no mistake about itthe wedding i mean to be plain and matteroffact why there stand the presents or some of them and very handsome presents they are ranged in solemn rows upon the long table it is a remarkable thing to observe when one is about to make a really satisfactory marriage how scores of unsuspected or forgotten friends crop up and send little tokens of their esteem it was very different when i married my first wife i remember but then that match was not satisfactoryjust a lovematch no more  there they stand in solemn rows as i have said and inspire me with beautiful thoughts about the innate kindness of human nature especially the human nature of our distant cousins it is possible to grow almost poetical over a silver teapot when one is going to be married tomorrow on how many future mornings shall i be confronted with that teapot probably for all my life and on the other side of the teapot will be the cream jug and the electroplated urn will hiss away behind them both also the chased sugar basin will be in front full of sugar and behind everything will be my second wife  my dear she will say will you have another cup of tea and probably i shall have another cup  well it is very curious to notice what ideas will come into a mans head sometimes sometimes something waves a magic wand over his being and from the recesses of his soul dim things arise and walk at unexpected moments they come and he grows aware of the issues of his mysterious life and his heart shakes and shivers like a lightningshattered tree in that drear light all earthly things seem far and all unseen things draw near and take shape and awe him and he knows not what is true and what is false neither can he trace the edge that marks off the spirit from the life then it is that the footsteps echo and the ghostly footprints will not be stamped out  pretty thoughts again and how persistently they come it is one oclock and i will go to bed the rain is falling in sheets outside i can hear it lashing against the window panes and the wind wails through the tall wet elms at the end of the garden i could tell the voice of those elms anywhere i know it as well as the voice of a friend what a night it is we sometimes get them in this part of england in october it was just such a night when my first wife died and that is three years ago i remember how she sat up in her bed  ah those horrible elms she said i wish you would have them cut down frank they cry like a woman and i said i would and just after that she died poor dear and so the old elms stand and i like their music it is a strange thing i was half brokenhearted for i loved her dearly and she loved me with all her life and strength and nowi am going to be married again  frank frank dont forget me those were my wifes last words and indeed though i am going to be married again tomorrow i have not forgotten her nor shall i forget how annie guthrie whom i am going to marry now came to see her the day before she died i know that annie always liked me more or less and i think that my dear wife guessed it after she had kissed annie and bid her a last goodbye and the door had closed she spoke quite suddenly there goes your future wife frank she said you should have married her at first instead of me she is very handsome and very good and she has two thousand a year she would never have died of a nervous illness and she laughed a little and then added  oh frank dear i wonder if you will think of me before you marry annie guthrie wherever i am i shall be thinking of you  and now that time which she foresaw has come and heaven knows that i have thought of her poor dear ah those footsteps of one dead that will echo through our lives those womans footprints on the marble flooring which will not be stamped out most of us have heard and seen them at some time or other and i hear and see them very plainly tonight poor dead wife i wonder if there are any doors in the land where you have gone through which you can creep out to look at me tonight i hope that there are none death must indeed be a hell if the dead can see and feel and take measure of the forgetful faithlessness of their beloved well i will go to bed and try to get a little rest i am not so young or so strong as i was and this wedding wears me out i wish that the whole thing were done or had never been begun    what was that it was not the wind for it never makes that sound here and it was not the rain since the rain has ceased its surging for a moment nor was it the howling of a dog for i keep none it was more like the crying of a womans voice but what woman can be abroad on such a night or at such an hourhalfpast one in the morning  there it is againa dreadful sound it makes the blood turn chill and yet has something familiar about it it is a womans voice calling round the house there she is at the window now and rattling it and great heavens she is calling me  frank frank frank she calls  i strive to stir and unshutter that window but before i can get there she is knocking and calling at another  gone again with her dreadful wail of frank frank now i hear her at the front door and half mad with a horrible fear i run down the long dark hall and unbar it there is nothing therenothing but the wild rush of the wind and the drip of the rain from the portico but i can hear the wailing voice going round the house past the patch of shrubbery i close the door and listen there she has got through the little yard and is at the back door now whoever it is she must know the way about the house along the hall i go again through a swing door through the servants hall stumbling down some steps into the kitchen where the embers of the fire are still alive in the grate diffusing a little warmth and light into the dense gloom  whoever it is at the door is knocking now with her clenched hand against the hard wood and it is wonderful though she knocks so low how the sound echoes through the empty kitchens        there i stood and hesitated trembling in every limb i dared not open the door no words of mine can convey the sense of utter desolation that overpowered me i felt as though i were the only living man in the whole world  frank frank cries the voice with the dreadful familiar ring in it open the door i am so cold i have so little time  my heart stood still and yet my hands were constrained to obey slowly slowly i lifted the latch and unbarred the door and as i did so a great rush of air snatched it from my hands and swept it wide the black clouds had broken a little overhead and there was a patch of blue rainwashed sky with just a star or two glimmering in it fitfully for a moment i could only see this bit of sky but by degrees i made out the accustomed outline of the great trees swinging furiously against it and the rigid line of the coping of the garden wall beneath them then a whirling leaf hit me smartly on the face and instinctively i dropped my eyes on to something that as yet i could not distinguishsomething small and black and wet  what are you i gasped somehow i seemed to feel that it was not a personi could not say who are you  dont you know me wailed the voice with the faroff familiar ring about it and i maynt come in and show myself i havent the time you were so long opening the door frank and i am so coldoh so bitterly cold look there the moon is coming out and you will be able to see me i suppose that you long to see me as i have longed to see you  as the figure spoke or rather wailed a moonbeam struggled through the watery air and fell on it it was short and shrunken the figure of a tiny woman also it was dressed in black and wore a black covering over the whole head shrouding it after the fashion of a bridal veil from every part of this veil and dress the water fell in heavy drops  the figure bore a small basket on her left arm and her handsuch a poor thin little handgleamed white in the moonlight i noticed that on the third finger was a red line showing that a weddingring had once been there the other hand was stretched towards me as though in entreaty  all this i saw in an instant as it were and as i saw it horror seemed to grip me by the throat as though it were a living thing for as the voice had been familiar so was the form familiar though the churchyard had received it long years ago i could not speaki could not even move  oh dont you know me yet wailed the voice and i have come from so far to see you and i cannot stop look look and she began to pluck feverishly with her poor thin hand at the black veil that enshrouded her at last it came off and as in a dream i saw what in a dim frozen way i had expected to seethe white face and pale yellow hair of my dead wife unable to speak or to stir i gazed and gazed there was no mistake about it it was she ay even as i had last seen her white with the whiteness of death with purple circles round her eyes and the gravecloth yet beneath her chin only her eyes were wide open and fixed upon my face and a lock of the soft yellow hair had broken loose and the wind tossed it  you know me now frankdont you frank it has been so hard to come to see you and so cold but you are going to be married tomorrow frank and i promisedoh a long time agoto think of you when you were going to be married wherever i was and i have kept my promise and i have come from where i am and brought a present with me it was bitter to die so young i was so young to die and leave you but i had to go take ittake it be quick i cannot stay any longer i could not give you my life frank so i have brought you my deathtake it  the figure thrust the basket into my hand and as it did so the rain came up again and began to obscure the moonlight  i must go i must go went on the dreadful familiar voice in a cry of despair oh why were you so long opening the door i wanted to talk to you before you married annie and now i shall never see you againnever never never i have lost you for ever ever ever    as the last wailing notes died away the wind came down with a rush and a whirl and the sweep as of a thousand wings and threw me back into the house bringing the door to with a crash after me  i staggered into the kitchen the basket in my hand and set it on the table just then some embers of the fire fell in and a faint little flame rose and glimmered on the bright dishes on the dresser even revealing a tin candlestick with a box of matches by it i was wellnigh mad with the darkness and fear and seizing the matches i struck one and held it to the candle presently it caught and i glanced round the room it was just as usual just as the servants had left it and above the mantelpiece the eightday clock ticked away solemnly while i looked at it it struck two and in a dim fashion i was thankful for its friendly sound  then i looked at the basket it was of very fine white plaited work with black bands running up it and a chequered blackandwhite handle i knew it well i have never seen another like it i bought it years ago at madeira and gave it to my poor wife ultimately it was washed overboard in a gale in the irish channel i remember that it was full of newspapers and library books and i had to pay for them many and many is the time that i have seen that identical basket standing there on that very kitchen table for my dear wife always used it to put flowers in and the shortest cut from that part of the garden where her roses grew was through the kitchen she used to gather the flowers and then come in and place her basket on the table just where it stood now and order the dinner  all this passed through my mind in a few seconds as i stood there with the candle in my hand feeling indeed half dead and yet with my mind painfully alive i began to wonder if i had gone asleep and was the victim of a nightmare no such thing i wish it had only been a nightmare a mouse ran out along the dresser and jumped on to the floor making quite a crash in the silence  what was in the basket i feared to look and yet some power within me forced me to it i drew near to the table and stood for a moment listening to the sound of my own heart then i stretched out my hand and slowly raised the lid of the basket  i could not give you my life so i have brought you my death those were her words what could she meanwhat could it all mean i must know or i would go mad there it lay whatever it was wrapped up in linen  ah heaven help me it was a small bleached human skull    a dream after all only a dream by the fire but what a dream and i am to be married tomorrow  can i be married tomorrow      barbara who came back    chapter i  the rectory blind  this is the tale of barbara barbara who came back to save a soul alive    the reverend septimus walrond was returning from a professional visit to a distant cottage of his remote and straggling parish upon the coast of east anglia his errand had been sad to baptise the dying infant of a fisherman which just as the rate was finished wailed once feebly and expired in his arms the reverend septimus was weeping over the sorrows of the world tears ran down his white but rounded face for he was stout of habit and fell upon his clerical coat that was green with age and threadbare with use although the evening was so cold he held his broadbrimmed hat in his hand and the wind from the moaning sea tossed his snowwhite hair he was talking to himself as was his fashion on these lonely walks  i think that fresh milk would have saved that child he said but how was poor thomas to buy fresh milk at fourpence a quart laid up for three months as he has been and with six children how was he to buy fresh milk i ought to have given it to him i could have done without these new boots till spring damp feet dont matter to an old man but i thought of my own comfortthe son that doth so easily beset meand so many to clothe and feed at home and poor barbara my darling barbara hanging between life and death  he sobbed and wiped away his tears with the back of his hand then began to pray still aloud  o god of pity in the name of the loving and merciful christ help me and poor thomas in our troubles  i ought to have put thomass name firstmy selfishness again he ejaculated then went on  give consolation to thomas who loved his baby and if it pleases thee in thy infinite wisdom and foresight spare my dearest barbaras life that she may live out her days upon the earth and perhaps in her turn give life to others i know i should not ask it i know it is better that she should go and be with thee in the immortal home thou hast prepared for us unhappy suffering creatures yetpity my poor human weaknessi do ask it or if thou decreest otherwise then take me also o god for i can bear no more four children gone i can bear no more o god  he sobbed again and wiped away another tear then muttered  my selfishness always my selfishness with six remaining to be looked after that is counting barbara if she still lives i dare to ask to be relieved of the burdens of the flesh pitiful christ visit not my wickedness on me or on others and o thou that didst raise the daughter of jairus save my sweet barbara and comfort the heart of poor thomas i will have faith i will have faith  he thrust his hat upon his head pulling it down over his ears because of the rough wind and walked forward quite jauntily for a few yards  what a comfort these new boots are he said if i had stepped into that pool with the old ones my left foot would be wet through now let me thank god for these new boots oh how can i when i remember that the price of them should have been spent in milk for the poor baby if i were really a christian i ought to take them off and walk barefoot as the old pilgrims used to do they say it is healthy and i tried to think so because it is cheap though i am sure that this was the beginning of poor little cicelys last illness with her broken chilblains she could not stand the snow at any rate the chill struck upwards well she has been in bliss three years three whole years and how thankful i ought to be for that how glad she will be to see barbara too if it pleases god in his mercy to take barbara she always was her favourite sister i ought to remember that i ought to remember that what i lose here i gain there that my store is always growing in heaven but i cant for i am a man still oh curse it all i cant and like job i wish id never been born job got a new family and was content but thats their eastern way its different with us englishmen  he stumbled on for a hundred yards or more vacuously almost drunkenly for the hideous agony that he was enduring half paralysed his brain and by its very excess was bringing him some temporary relief he looked at the raging sea to his right and in a vague fashion wished that it had swallowed him he looked at the kind earth of the ploughed field to his left and wished vividly for the idea was more familiar that six feet of it lay above him then he remembered that just beyond that sandheap he had found a plovers nest with two eggs in it fifty years ago when he was a boy and had taken one egg and left the other or rather had restored it because the old bird screamed so pitifully about him in some strange manner that little longforgotten act of righteousness brought a glow of comfort to his tormented spirit perhaps god would deal so by him  in its way the evening was very beautiful the cold november day was dying into night clear clear was the sky save for some black and heavy snow clouds that floated on it driven before the easterly wind that piped through the sere grasses and blew the plovers over him as though they were dead leaves where the sun had vanished long bars of purple lay above the horizon to his excited fancy they looked like the gateway of another and a better world set as the old egyptians dreamed above the uttermost pylons of the west what lay there beyond the sun oh what lay beyond the sun perhaps even now barbara knew  a figure appeared standing upon a sand dune between the pathway and the sea septimus was shortsighted and could not tell who it was but in this place at this hour doubtless it must be a parishioner perhaps one waiting to see him upon some important matter he must forget his private griefs he must strive to steady his shaken mind and attend to his duties he drew himself together and walked on briskly  i wish i had not been obliged to give away jack he said he was a great companion and somehow i always met people with more confidence when he was with me he seemed to take away my shyness but the license was sevenandsixpence and i havent got sevenandsixpence also he has an excellent home with that stuffy old woman if a dull one for he must miss his walk oh its you anthony what are you doing here at this time of night your father told me you had a bad cold and theres so much sickness about you should be careful anthony you know youre not too strong none of you arnotts are well i suppose you are shooting and most young men will risk a great deal in order to kill gods other creatures  the person addressed a tall broadshouldered rather pale young man of about twentyone remarkable for his large brown eyes and a certain sweet expression which contrasted somewhat oddly with the general manliness of his appearance lifted his cap and answered  no mr walrond i am not shooting tonight in fact i was waiting here to meet you  what for anthony nothing wrong up at the hall i hope  no mr walrond why should there be anything wrong there  i dont know i am sure only as a rule people dont wait for the parson unless there is something amiss and there seems to be so much misfortune in this parish just now well what is it my boy  i want to know about barbara mr walrond they tell me she is very bad but i cant get anything definite from the others i mean from her sisters they dont seem to be sure and the doctor wouldnt say when i asked him  the reverend septimus looked at anthony and anthony looked at the reverend septimus and in that look they learned to understand each other the agony that was eating out this poor fathers heart was not peculiar to him another shared it in what he would have called his wicked selfishness the reverend septimus felt almost grateful for this sudden revelation if it is a comfort to share our joys it is a still greater comfort to share our torments  walk on with me anthony he said i must hurry i have every reason to hurry had it not been a matter of duty i would not have left the house but so to speak a clergyman has many children he cannot prefer one before the other  yes yes said anthony but what about barbara oh please tell me at once  i cant tell you anthony because i dont know from here to the crest of gunters hill and he pointed to an eminence in front of them is a mile and a quarter when we get to the crest of gunters hill perhaps we shall know i left home two hours ago and then barbara lay almost at the point of death insensible  insensible muttered anthony oh my god insensible  yes went on the clergyman in a voice of patient resignation i dont understand much about such things but the inflammation appears to have culminated that way now either she will never wake again or if she wakes she may live at least that is what they tell me but they may be wrong i have so often known doctors to be wrong  they walked on together in silence twenty yards or more then he added as though speaking to himself  when we reach the top of gunters hill perhaps we shall learn we can see her window from there and if she had passed away i bade them pull the blind down if she was about the same to pull it half down and if she were really better to leave it quite up i have done that for two nights now so that i might have a little time to prepare myself it is a good plan though very trying to a fathers heart yesterday i stood for quite a while with my eyes fixed upon the ground not daring to look and learn the truth  anthony groaned and once more the old man went on  she is a very unselfish girl barbara or perhaps i should say was perhaps i should say was that is how she caught this horrible inflammation three weeks ago she and her sister janey went for a long walk to the ness totooh i forget why they went well it came on to pour with rain and just as they had started for home fortunately or rather unfortunately old stevens the farmer overtook them on his way back from market and offered them a lift they got into the cart and barbara took off the mackintosh that her aunt gave her last christmasit is the only one in the house since such things are too costly for me to buyand put it over janey who had a cold it was quite unnecessary for janey was warmly wrapped up while barbara had nothing under the mackintosh except a summer dress that is how she caught the chill  anthony made no comment and again they walked forward without speaking perhaps for a quarter of a mile then the horror of the suspense became intolerable to him without a word he dashed forward sped down the slope and up that of the opposing gunters hill more swiftly perhaps than he had ever run before although he was a very quick runner  hes gone murmured septimus i wonder why i suppose that i walk too slowly for him i cannot walk so fast as i used to do and he felt the wind cold  then he dismissed the matter from his halfdazed mind and stumbled on wearily muttering his disjointed prayers  thus in due course he began to climb the little slope of gunters hill the sun had set but there was still a red glow in the sky and against this glow he perceived the tall figure of anthony standing quite still when he was about a hundred yards away the figure suddenly collapsed as a man does if he is shot the reverend septimus put his hand to his heart and caught his breath  i know what that means he said he was watching the window and they have just pulled down the blind i suppose he must be fond of her and itaffects him oh if i were younger i think this would kill me but thank god as one draws near the end of the road the feet harden one does not feel the thorns so much the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blblyes i will say itblessed be the name of the lord i should remember that she is so much better where she is that this is a very hard world indeed sometimes i think it is not a world but a hell oh barbara my sweet barbara and he struggled forward blindly beating at the rough wind with his hands as though it were a visible foe and so at last came to the crest of the hill where anthony arnott lay prone upon his face  so sure was septimus of the cause of his collapse that he did not even trouble to look at the rectory windows in the hollow near the church two hundred yards or so away he only looked at anthony saying  poor lad poor lad i wonder how i shall get him home i must fetch some help  as he spoke anthony sat up and said you see you see  see what  the blind it is quite up when i got here it was half down then someone pulled it up thats what finished me i felt as though i had been hit on the head with a stick  the reverend septimus stared then suddenly sank to his knees and returned thanks in his simple fashion  dont let us be too certain anthony he exclaimed at length there may be a mistake or perhaps this is only a respite which will prolong the suspense often such things happen to torment us i mean that they are gods way of trying and purifying our poor sinful hearts    chapter ii  the new year feast  barbara did not die on the contrary barbara got quite well again but her recovery was so slow that anthony only saw her once before he was obliged to return to college this was on new years day when mr walrond asked him to dinner to meet barbara who was coming down for the first time needless to say he went taking with him a large bunch of violets which he had grown in a frame at the hall especially for barbara indeed she had already received many of those violets through the agency of her numerous younger sisters  the rectory dinner was at one oclock and the feast could not be called sumptuous it consisted of a piece of beef that known as the aitchbone which is perhaps the cheapest that the butcher supplies when the amount of eating is taken into consideration one roast duck a large pekin the near year offering of the farmer stevens and a plum pudding somewhat pallid in appearance these dainties with late apples and plenty of cold water made up the best dinner that the walrond family had eaten for many a day  the rectory diningroom was a long narrow chamber of dilapidated appearance since between meals it served as a schoolroom also a deal bookcase in the corner held some tattered educational works and the walls that once had been painted blue but now were faded in patches to a sickly green were adorned only with four texts illuminated by barbara these texts had evidently served as targets for moistened paper pellets some of which still stuck upon their surface  anthony arrived a little late since the picking of the violets had taken longer than he anticipated and as there was no one to open the front door walked straight into the diningroom in the doorway he collided with the little maidofallwork a redelbowed girl of singularly plain appearance who having deposited the beef upon the table was rushing back for the duck accompanied by two of the young walronds who were assisting with the vegetables the maid recoiling sat down with a bump on one of the wooden chairs and the walrond girls a merry goodlooking unkempt crew no boy had put in an appearance in all that family burst into screams of laughter anthony apologised profusely the maid ejaculating that she didnt mind not she jumped up and ran for the duck and the reverend septimus a very different septimus to him whom we met a month or so before seizing his hand shook it warmly calling out  julia my dear never mind that beef i havent said grace yet heres anthony  glad to see him i am sure said mrs walrond her eyes still fixed upon the beef which was obviously burnt at one corner then with a shrug for she was accustomed to such accidents she rose to greet him  mrs walrond was a tall and extremely goodlooking lady of about fiftyfive darkeyed and bright complexioned whose chestnut hair was scarcely touched with grey notwithstanding all the troubles and hardships that she had endured her countenance was serene and even happy for she was blessed with a good heart a lively faith in providence and a wellregulated mind looking at her it was easy to see whence barbara and her other daughters inherited their beauty and air of breeding  how are you anthony she went on one eye still fixed upon the burnt beef it is good of you to come though you are late which i suppose is why the girl has burnt the meat  not a bit called out one of the children it was janey it is very good of us to have him when theres only one duck anthony you mustnt eat duck as we dont often get one and you have hundreds  not i dear i hate ducks he relied automatically for his eyes were seeking the face of barbara  barbara was seated in the wooden armchair with a cushion on it near the fire of driftwood advantages that were accorded to her in honour of her still being an invalid even to a stranger she would have looked extraordinarily sweet with her large and rather plaintive violet eyes over which the long black lashes curved her waving chestnut hair parted in the middle and growing somewhat low upon her forehead her tall figure very thin just now and her lovely shelllike complexion heightened by a blush  to anthony she seemed a very angel an angel returned from the shores of death for his adoration and delight oh if things had gone the other wayif there had been no sweet barbara seated in that wooden chair the thought gripped his heart with a hand of ice he felt as he had felt when he looked at the windowplace from the crest of gunters hill but she had come back and he was sure that they were each others for life and yet and yet life must end one day and then what once more that hand of ice dragged at his heart strings  in a moment it was all over and mr walrond was speaking  why dont you bid barbara goodday anthony he asked dont you think she looks well considering we do better than you in fact he added glancing at his face which had suddenly grown pale almost grey  hes going to give barbara the violets and doesnt know how to do it piped the irrepressible janey anthony why dont you ever bring us violets even when we have the whooping cough  because the smell of them is bad for delicate throats he answered and without a word handed the sweetscented flowers to barbara  she took them also without a word but not without a look pinned a few to her dress and reaching a cracked vase from the mantelpiece disposed of the rest of them there till she could remove them to her own room then mr walrond began to say grace and the difficulties of that meeting were over  anthony sat by barbara his chair was rickety one of the legs being much in need of repair the driftwood fire that burned brightly about two feet away grilled his spine for no screen was available and he nearly choked himself with a piece of very hot and hard potato yet to tell the truth never before did he share in such a delightful meal for soon when the clamour of the girls swelled loud and long and the attention of mr and mrs walrond was entirely occupied with the burnt beef and the large duck that absolutely refused to part with its limbs he found himself almost as much alone with barbara as though they had been together on the wide seashore  you are really getting quite well he asked  yes i think so then after a pause and with a glance from the violet eyes are you glad  you know i am glad you know that if you haddied i should have died too  nonsense said the curved lips but they trembled and the violet eyes were aswim with tears then a little catch of the throat and almost in a whisper anthony father told me about you and the windowblind andoh i dont know how to thank you but i want to say something if you wont laugh just at that time i seemed to come up out of some blackness and began to dream of you i dreamed that i was sinking back into the blackness but you caught me by the hand and lifted me quite out of it then we floated away together for ever and for ever and for ever for though sometimes i lost you we always met again then i woke up and knew that i wasnt going to die thats all  what a beautiful dream began anthony but at that moment pausing from her labours at the beef mrs walrond said  barbara eat your duck before it grows cold you know the doctor said you must take plenty of nourishment  i am going to mother answered barbara i feel dreadfully hungry and really she did her gentle heart having fed full of a sudden her body seemed to need no nourishment  dear me said mr walrond pausing from his labours and viewing the remains of the duck disconsolately for he did not see what portion of its gaunt skeleton was going to furnish him with dinner and duck was one of his weaknesses dear me theres a dreadful smell of burning in this room do you think it can be the beef my love  of course it is not the beef replied mrs walrond rather sharply the beef is beautifully done  oh ejaculated one of the girls who had got the calcined bit why mother you said it was burnt yourself  never mind what i said replied mrs walrond severely especially as i was mistaken it is very rude of your father to make remarks about the meat  well something is burning my love  janey who was sitting next to anthony paused from her meal to sniff then exclaimed in a voice of delight  oh it is anthonys coat tails just look they are turning quite brown why anthony you must be as beautifully done as the beef if you can sit there and say nothing you are a christian martyr wasted thats all  anthony sprang up murmuring that he thought there was something wrong behind which on examination there proved to be the end of it was that the chairs were all pushed downwards with the result that for the rest of that meal there was a fiery gulf fixed between him and barbara which made further confidences impossible so he had to talk of other matters of these as it chanced he had something to say  a letter had arrived that morning from his elder brother george who was an officer in a line regiment it had been written in the trenches before sebastopol for these events took place in the midvictorian period towards the end of the crimean war or rather the letter had been begun in the trenches and finished in the military hospital whither george had been conveyed suffering from fever and severe chill which seemed to be somewhat contradictory terms though doubtless they were in fact compatible enough still he wrote a very interesting letter which after the pudding had been consumed to the last spoonful anthony read aloud while the girls ate apples and cracked nuts with their teeth  dear me george seems to be very unwell said mrs walrond  yes answered anthony i am afraid he is one of the medical officers whom my father knows who is working in that hospital says they mean to send him home as soon as he can bear the journey though he doesnt think it will be just at present  this sounded depressing but mr walrond found that it had a bright side  at any rate he wont be shot like so many poor fellows also he has been in several of the big battles and will be promoted i look upon him as a made man hell soon shake off his cold in his native air  and we shall have a real wounded hero in the village said one of the girls  he isnt a wounded hero answered janey hes only got a chill  well thats as bad as wounded dear and i am sure he would have been wounded if he could and so on  when are you going back to cambridge anthony asked mrs walrond presently  tomorrow morning i am sorry to say he answered and barbaras face fell at his words you see i go up for my degree this summer term and my father is very anxious that i should take high honours in mathematics he says that it will give me a better standing in the bar so i must begin work at once with a tutor before term for theres no one near here who can help me  no said mr walrond if it had been classics now with a little refurbishing perhaps i might but mathematics are beyond me  barbara should teach him suggested one of the little girls slyly shes splendid at rule of three  which is more than you are said mrs walrond in severe tones who always make thirteen out of five and seven barbara love you are looking very tired all this noise is too much for you you must go and lie down at once in your own room no not on the sofa in your own room now say goodbye to anthony and go  so barbara who was really tired though with a happy weariness did as she was bid her hand met anthonys and lingered there for a little her violet eyes met his brown eyes and lingered there a little her lips spoke some few words of commonplace farewell then staying a moment to take the violets from the cracked vase and another moment to kiss her father as she passed him she walked or rather glided from the room with the graceful movement that was peculiar to her and lo at once for anthony it became a very emptiness moreover he grew aware of the hardness of his wooden seat and that the noise of the girls was making his head ache so presently he too rose and departed    chapter iii  aunt maria  six months or so had gone by and summer reigned royally at eastwich for thus was the parish named of which the reverend septimus walrond had spiritual charge the heath was a blaze of gold the cut hay smelt sweetly in the fields the sea sparkled like one vast sapphire the larks beneath the sun and the nightingales beneath the moon sang their hearts out on gunters hill and all the land was full of life and sound and perfume  on one particularly beautiful evening after partaking of a meal called high tea barbara quite strong again now and blooming like the wild rose upon her breast set out alone upon a walk her errand was to the cottage of that very fisherman whose child her father had baptised on the night when her life trembled in the balance having accomplished this she turned homewards lost in reverie events having happened at the rectory which gave her cause for thought when she had gone a little way some instinct led her to look up about fifty yards away a man was walking towards her to all appearance also lost in reverie even at that distance and in the uncertain evening light she knew well enough that this was anthony her heart leapt at the sight of him and her cheeks seemed to catch the hue of the wild rose on her bosom then she straightened her dress a little and walked on  in less than a minute they had met  i heard where you had gone and came to meet you he said awkwardly how well you are looking barbara how well and he had meant to add beautiful but his tongue stumbled at the word and what he said was brown  if i were an indian i suppose i should thank you for the compliment anthony but as it is i dont know but how well you are looking how well and by comparisonfat  then they both laughed and he explained at length how he had been able to get home two days earlier than he expected also that he had taken his degree with even higher honours than he hoped  i am so glad she said earnestly  and so am i i mean glad that you are glad you see if it hadnt been for you i should never have done so well but because i thought you would be glad i worked like anything  you should have thought of what your father would feel not ofofwell it has all ended as it should so we neednt argue how is your brother george she went on cutting short the answer that was rising to his lips i suppose i should call him captain arnott now for i hear he has been promoted we havent seen him since he came home last week from some hospital in the south of england they say  anthonys face grew serious  i dont know i dont quite like the look of him and he coughs such a lot it seems as though he could not shake off that chill he got in the trenches thats why he hasnt been to call at the rectory  i hope this beautiful weather will cure him barbara replied rather doubtfully for she had heard a bad report of george arnotts health then to change the subject she added do you know we had a visitor yesterday aunt maria in the flesh in a great deal of flesh as janey says  do you mean lady thompson  she nodded  aunt thompson and her footman and her pug dog thank goodness she only stayed to tea as she had a ten mile drive back to her hotel as it was lots of things happened  what happened  well first when she got out of the carriage covered with jet anchor chainsfor you know uncle samuel died only three months ago and left her all his moneyshe caught sight of our heads staring at her out of the drawingroom window and asked father if he kept a girls school then she made mother cry by remarking that she ought to be thankful to providence for having taken to its bosom the four of us who died young you know she has no children herself and so cant feel about them also father was furious because she told him that at least half of us should have been boys he turned quite pink and said  i have been taught lady thompson that these are matters which god almighty keeps in his own hands and to him i must refer you  good gracious dont get angry she answered if you clergymen can crossexamine your maker i am not in that position besides they are all very goodlooking girls who may find husbands if they ever see a man so things might have been worse  then she made remarks about the tea for uncle samuel was a teamerchant and lastly that wicked janey sent the footman to take the pug dog to walk past the butchers shop where the fighting terrier lives you can guess the rest  was the pug killed asked anthony  no though the poor thing came back in a bad way i never knew before that a pugs tail was so long when it is quite uncurled but the footman looked almost worse for he got notice on the spot you see he went into the red dragon and left the pug outside  and here endeth aunt maria and all her works said anthony who wanted to talk of other things  no not quite  he looked at her for there was meaning in her voice  in fact she went on so far as im concerned it ought to run here beginneth aunt maria you see i have got to go and live with her tomorrow  anthony stopped and looked at her  what the devil do you mean he asked  what i say she took a fancy to me and she wants a companionsomeone to do her errands and read to her at night and look after the pug dog and so forth and she will pay me thirty pounds a year with my board and dresses and with gathering emphasis we cannot afford to offend her who have half lived upon her alms and old clothes for so many years and in short dad and my mother thought it best that i should go since joyce can take my place and at any rate it will be a mouth less to feed at home so i am going tomorrow morning by the carriers cart  going gasped anthony where to  to london first then to paris then to italy to winter at rome and then goodness knows where you see my aunt maria has wanted to travel all her life but uncle samuel who was born in putney feared the sea and lived and died in putney in the very house in which he was born now aunt maria wants a change and means to have it  then anthony broke out  damn the old woman why cant she take her change in italy or wherever she wishes and leave you alone  anthony said barbara in a scandalised voice what do you mean anthony by using such dreadful language about my aunt  what do i mean well this with the recklessness of despair if you want to know i mean that i cant bear your going away  if my parents began barbara steadily  what have your parents to do with it im not your parents im your  barbara looked at him in remonstrance  old friend played together in childhood you know the kind of thing in short i dont want you to go to italy with lady thompson i want you to stop here  why anthony i thought you told me you were going to live in chambers in london and read for the bar  well london isnt italy and one doesnt eat dinners at lincolns inn all the year round one comes home sometimes and heaven knows whom youll meet in those places or what tricks that horrible old aunt of yours will be playing with you oh its wicked how can you desert your poor father and mother in this way to say nothing of your sisters i never thought you were so hardhearted  anthony said barbara in a gentle voice do you know what we have got to live on in good years it comes to about 150 pounds but once when my father got into that lawsuit over the dog that was supposed to kill the sheep it went down to 70 pounds that was the winter when two of the little ones died for want of proper foodnothing elseand i remember that the rest of us had to walk barefoot in the mud and snow because there was no money to buy us boots and only some of us could go out at once because we had no cloaks to put on well all this may happen again and so anthony do you think that i should be right to throw away thirty pounds a year and to make a quarrel with my aunt who is rich and kindhearted although very overbearing and the only friend we have if my father died anthony or even was taken ill and he is not very strong what would become of us unless aunt thompson chose to help we should all have to go to the workhouse for girls who have not been specially trained can earn nothing except perhaps as domestic servants if they are strong enough i dont want to go away and read to aunt maria and take the pug dog out walking although it is true i should like to see italy but i mustcant you understandi must so please reproach me no more for it is hard to bearespecially from you  stop for gods sake stop said anthony i am a brute to have spoken like that and im helpless thats the worst of it oh my darling dont you understand dont you understand  no answered barbara shaking her head and beginning to cry  that i love you that i have always loved you and that i always shall love you untiluntilthe moon ceases to shine and he pointed to that orb which had appeared above the sea  they say that it is dead already and no doubt will come to an end like everything else remarked barbara seeking to gain time  then for a while she sought nothing more who found herself lost in her lovers arms    so there they plighted their troth that was they swore more enduring than the moon for indeed they so believed  nothing shall part us except death he said  why should death part us she answered looking him bravely in the eyes i mean to live beyond death and while i live and wherever i live death shall not part us if youll be true to me  ill not fail in that he answered    and so their souls melted into rapture and were lifted up beyond the world the song of the nightingales was heavenly music in their ears and the moons silver rays upon the sea were the road by which their linked souls travelled to the throne of him who had lit their lamp of love and there made petition that through all lifes accidents and deaths darkness it might burn eternally  for the love of these two was deep and faithful and already seemed to them as though it were a thing they had lost awhile and found once more a very precious jewel that from the beginning had shone upon their breasts a guidingstar to light them to that end which is the dawn of endlessness  who will not smile at such thoughts as these  the way of the man with the maid and the way of the maid with the man and the moon to light them and the birds to sing the epithalamium of their hearts and the great sea to murmur of eternity in their opened ears nature at her sweet work beneath the gentle nightwho is there that will not say that it was nothing more    well let their story answer    chapter iv  a year later  something over a year had gone by and barbara returned from her foreign travels sat in the drawingroom of lady thompsons house in russell square  that year had made much difference in her for the sweet country girl now of full age had blossomed into the beautiful young woman of the world she had wintered in rome and studied its antiquities and art she had learned some french and italian for nothing was grudged to her in the way of masters and worked at music for which she had a natural taste she had seen a good deal of society also for lady thompson was at heart proud of her beautiful niece and spared no expense to bring her into contact with such people as she considered she should know  thus it came about that the fine apartment they occupied in rome had many visitors among these was a certain secretary of legation the hon charles erskine russell who it was expected would in the course of nature succeed to a peerage he was a very agreeable as well as an accomplished and wealthy man andhe fell in love with barbara with the cleverness of her sex she managed to put him off and to avoid any actual proposal before they left for switzerland in the early summer thither happily he could not follow them since his official duties prevented him from leaving the embassy lady thompson was much annoyed at what she considered his bad conduct and said as much to barbara  her niece listened but did not discuss the matter with the result that lady thompsons opinion of the hon charles russell was confirmed was it not clear that there had been no proposal although it was equally clear that he ought to have proposed poor barbara perhaps this was the only act of deception of which she was ever guilty  so things went on until the previous day the monday after their arrival in london when most unhappily lady thompson went out to lunch and met the hon charles russell who was on leave in england  next morning while barbara was engaged in arranging some flowers in the drawingroom who should be shown in but mr russell in her alarm she dropped a bowl and broke it a sign that he evidently considered hopeful setting it down to the emotion which his sudden presence caused to emotion it was due indeed but not of a kind he would have wished recovering herself barbara shook his hand and then told the servant who was picking up the pieces of the bowl to inform her ladyship of the arrival of this morning caller  the man bowed and departed and as he went barbara noticed an ominous twinkle in the pleasant blue eyes of the hon charles russell  the rest of the interview may be summed up in a few words mr russell was eloquent passionate and convincing he assured barbara that she was the only woman he had ever loved with such force and conviction that in the end she almost believed him but this belief if it existed did not in the least shake her absolutely definite determination to have nothing whatsoever to do with her wouldbe lover  not until she had told him so six times however did he consent to believe her for indeed he had been led to expect a very different answer  i suppose you care for someone else he said at last  yes said barbara whose back metaphorically was against the wall  somebody much moresuitable  no said barbara he is poor and not distinguished and has all his way to make in the world  he might change his mind ordie  if so i should not change mine said barbara very likely i shall not marry him but i shall not marry anyone else  in heavens name why not  because it would be a sacrilege against heaven  then at last mr russell understood  allow me to offer you my good wishes and to assure you of my earnest and unalterable respect he said in a somewhat broken voice and taking her hand he touched it lightly with his lips turned and departed out of barbaras sight and life    ten minutes later lady thompson arrived and her coming was like to that of a thunderstorm she shut the door locked it and sat down in an armchair in solemn lurid silence then with one swift flash the storm broke  what is this i hear from mr russell  i am sure i dont know what you have heard from mr russell answered barbara faintly  perhaps but you know very well what there was to hear you wicked ungrateful girl  wicked murmured barbara ungrateful  yes it is wicked to lead a man on and then reject him as though he wererubbish and it is ungrateful to throw away the chances that a kind aunt and providence put in your way what have you against him  nothing at all i think him very nice  lady thompsons brow lightened if she thought him very nice all might yet be well perhaps this refusal was nothing but nonsensical modesty mr russell being a gentleman had not told her everything  then i say you shall marry him  and i say aunt that i will not and cannot  why have you been secretly converted to the church of rome and are you going into a nunnery or is thereanother man  yes aunt  where is he said lady thompson looking about her as though she expected to find him hidden under the furniture and how did you manage to become entangled with him you sly girl under my very nose and who is he one of those bowing and scraping italians i suppose who think youll get my money tell me the truth at once  he is somebody you have never seen aunt one of the arnotts down at home  oh that captain well i believe they have a decent property about 2000 pounds a year but all in land which sir samuel never held by of course it is nothing like the russell match which would have made a peeress of you some day and given you a great position meanwhile but i suppose we must be thankful for small mercies  it is not captain arnott it is his younger brother anthony  anthony anthony that youth who is reading for the bar why the property is all entailed and he will scarcely have a halfpenny for his mother brought no money to the arnotts oh this is too much to throw up mr russell for an anthony are you engaged to him with your parents consent may i ask and if so why was the matter concealed from me who would certainly have declined to drag an entangled young woman about the world  i am not engaged but my father and mother know that we are attached to each other it happened the day after you came to eastwich or they would have told you my father made me promise that we would not correspond while i was away as he thought that we were too young to bind ourselves to each other especially as anthony has no present prospects or means to support a wife  i am glad they had so much sense it is more than might have been expected of my sister after her own performance for which doubtless she is sorry enough now like you she might have married a title instead of a curate and beggary  i am quite sure that my mother is not sorry aunt replied barbara whose spirit was rising i know that she is a very happy woman  look here barbara lets come to the point will you give up this mooncalf business of yours or not  it is not a mooncalf business whatever that may be and i will not give it up  very well then i cant make you as you are of age but i have done with you you will go to your room and stop there and tomorrow morning you will return to your parents to whom i will write at once you have betrayed my hospitality and presumed upon my kindness after all the things i have given you too and her eyes fixed themselves upon a pearl necklace that barbara was wearing for lady thompson could be generous when she was in the mood  barbara unfastened the necklace and offered it to her aunt without a word  nonsense said lady thompson do you think i want to rob you of your trinkets because i happen to have given them to you keep them they may be useful one day when you have a husband and a family and no money pearls may pay the butcher and the rent  thank you for all your kindness aunt and goodbye i am sorry that i am not able to do as you wish about marriage but after all a womans life is her own  thats just what it isnt and never has been a womans life is her husbands and her childrens and thats whybut it is no use arguing you have taken your own line perhaps you are right god knows at any rate it isnt mine so we had better part still i rather admire your courage i wonder what this young fellow is like for whose sake you are prepared to lose so much more than you think maybe for i had grown fond of you well goodbye ill see about your getting off there dont think that i bear malice although i am so angry with you write to me when you get into a tight place and rising she kissed her rather roughly but not without affection and flung out of the room like one who feared to trust herself there any longer    on the evening of the following day barbara emerging from the carriers cart at the blacksmiths corner at eastwich was met by a riotous throng of five energetic young sisters who nearly devoured her with kisses so happy was that greeting indeed that in it she almost forgot her sorrows in truth as she reflected why should she be sorry at all she was clear of a suitor whom she did not wish to marry and of an aunt whose very kindness was oppressive and whose temper was terrible she had fifty pounds in her pocket and a good stock of clothes to say nothing of the pearls and other jewellery wealth indeed if measured by the walrond standard her beloved sisters were evidently in the best of health and spirits also as she thought betterlooking than any girls she had seen since she bade them farewell her father and mother were as they told her well and delighted at her return and lastly as she had already gathered anthony either was or was about to be at the hall why then should she be sorry why indeed should she not rejoice and thank god for these good things  on that evening however when supper was done she had a somewhat serious interview with her father and mother who sat on either side of her each of them holding one of her hands for they could scarcely bear her out of their sight she had told all the tale of the hon charles russell and of her violent dismissal by her aunt of which story they were not entirely ignorant for lady thompson had already advised them of these events by letter  the reverend septimus shook his head sadly he was not a worldlyminded man still to have a presumptive peer for a soninlaw who would doubtless also become an ambassador was a prospect that at heart he relinquished with regret also this young arnott business seemed very vague and unsatisfactory and there were the other girls and their future to be considered no wonder then that he shook his kindly grey head and looked somewhat depressed  but his wife took another line  septimus she said in these matters a woman must judge by her own heart and you see barbara is a woman now once you remember i had to face something of the same sort and i do not think dear notwithstanding all our troubles that either of us have regretted our decision  then they both rose and solemnly kissed each other over barbaras head    chapter v  wedded  next day oh joy of joys barbara and anthony met once more after some fifteen months of separation anthony was now in his twentyfourth year a fine young man with wellcut features brown eyes and a pleasant smile muscularly too he was very strong as was shown by his athletic record at cambridge whether his strength extended to his constitution was another matter mrs walrond noticing his unvarying colour which she thought unduly high and the transparent character of his skin spoke to her husband upon the matter  in his turn septimus spoke to the old local doctor who shrugged his shoulders and remarked that the arnotts had been delicate for generations lungy he called it noticing that mr walrond looked serious and knowing something of how matters stood between anthony and barbara he hastened to add that so far as he knew there was no cause for alarm and that if he were moderately careful he thought that anthony would live to eighty  but it is otherwise with his brother he added significantly and for the matter of that with the old man also  then he went away and there was something in the manner of his going which seemed to suggest that he did not wish to continue the conversation  from anthony however barbara soon learned the truth as to his brother his lungs were gone for the chill he took in the crimea had settled on them and now there was left to him but a little time to live this was sad news and marred the happiness of their meeting since both of them were far too unworldly to consider its effect upon their own prospects or that it would make easy that which had hitherto seemed impossible  are you nursing him she asked  yes more or less i took him to the south of england for two months but it did no good  i am glad the thing is not catching she remarked glancing at him  oh no he replied carelessly i never heard that it was catching though some people say it runs in families i hope not i am sure as the poor old chap insists upon my sleeping in his room whenever i am at home as we used to do when we were boys  then their talk wandered elsewhere for they had so much to say to each other that it seemed doubtful if they would ever get to the end of it all anthony was particularly anxious to learn what blessed circumstance had caused barbaras sudden reappearance at eastwich she fenced for a while then told him all the truth  so you gave up this brilliant marriage for me a fellow with scarcely a halfpenny and a very few prospects he exclaimed staring at her  of course what would you have expected me to domarry one man while i love another as for the rest it must take its chance and while the words were on her lips for the first time it came into barbaras mind that perhaps anthony had no need to trouble about his worldly fortunes for if it were indeed true that captain arnott was doomed who else would succeed to the estate  i think you are an angel he said still overcome by this wondrous instance of fidelity and of courage in the face of lady thompsons anger  if i had done anything else i think anthony that you might very well have called mewhatever is the reverse of an angel  and thus the links of their perfect love were drawn even closer than before    only three days later mr walrond was summoned hastily to the hall when he returned from his ministrations it was to announce in a sad voice that captain arnott was sinking fast before the following morning he was dead  a month or so after the grave had closed over captain arnott the engagement of anthony and barbara was announced formally and by the express wish of mr arnott the old gentleman had for years been partially paralysed and in a delicate state of health which the sad loss of his elder son had done much to render worse he sent for barbara whom he had known from her childhood and told her that the sooner she and anthony were married the better he would be pleased  you see my dear he added i do not wish the old name to die out after we have been in this place for three hundred years and you walronds are a healthy stock which is more than we can say now worn out i suppose worn out in fact he went on looking at her sharply it is for you to consider whether you care to take the risks of coming into this family for whatever the doctors may or may not say i think it my duty to tell you straight out that in my opinion there is some risk  if so i do not fear it mr arnott and i hope you will not put any such idea into anthonys head if you do he might refuse to marry me and that would break my heart  no i dare say you do not fear it but there are otherwell things must take their course if we were always thinking of the future no one would dare to stir  then he told her that when first he heard of their mutual attachment he had been much disturbed as he did not see how they were to marry  but poor georges death has changed all that he said since now anthony will get the estate which is practically the only property we have and it ought always to produce enough to keep you going and to maintain the place in a modest way  lastly he presented her with a valuable set of diamonds that had belonged to his mother saying he might not be alive to do so when the time of her marriage came and dismissed her with his blessing  in due course all these tidings including that of the diamonds came to the ears of aunt thompson and wondrously softened that ladys anger indeed she wrote to barbara in very affectionate terms to wish her every happiness and say how glad she was to hear that she was settling herself so well in life she added that she should make a point of being present at the wedding a postscript informed her that mr russell was about to be married to an italian countess a widow  barbaras wedding was fixed for october at the beginning of that month however anthony was seized with some unaccountable kind of illness in which coughing played a considerable part so severe were its effects that it was thought desirable to postpone the ceremony the doctor ordered him away for a change of air on the morning of his departure he spoke seriously to barbara  i dont know what is the matter with me he said and i dont think it is very much at present but dear i have a kind of presentiment that i am going to become an invalid my strength is nothing like what it was and at times it fails me in a most unaccountable manner barbara it breaks my heart to say it but i doubt whether you ought to marry me  if you were going to be a permanent invalid which i do not believe for one moment answered barbara steadily you would want a nurse and who could nurse you so well as your wife therefore unless you had ceased to care for me i should certainly marry you  then as still he seemed to hesitate she flung her arms about him and kissed him which was an argument that he lacked strength to resist  a day or two afterwards her father also spoke to barbara  i dont like this illness of anthonys my dear the doctor does not seem to understand it or at any rate so he pretends and says he has no doubt it will pass off but i cannot help remembering the case of his brother george also that of his mother before him in short barbara do you thinkwell that it would be wise to marry him i know that to break it off would be dreadful but you see health is so very important  barbara turned on her father almost fiercely  whose health she asked if you mean mine it is in no danger and if it were i should care nothing what good would health be to me if i lost anthony who is more to me than life but if you mean his health then the greatest happiness i can have is to nurse him  yes yes i understand dear but you see there might beothers  if so father they must run their risks as we do that is if there are any risks for them to run which i doubt  i dare say you are quite right dear indeed i feel almost sure that you are right only i thought it my duty to mention the matter which i hope you will forgive me for having done and now i may tell you i have a letter from anthony saying that he is ever so much better and asking if the fifteenth of november will suit us for the wedding    on the fifteenth of november accordingly anthony and barbara were made man and wife by the brides father with the assistance of the clergyman of the next parish owing to the recent death of the bridegrooms brother and the condition of mr arnotts health the wedding was extremely quiet still in its own way it was as charming as it was happy all her five sisters acted as barbaras bridesmaids and many gathered in that church said they were the most beautiful bevy of maidens that ever had been seen but if so barbara outshone them all perhaps because of her jewels and fine clothes and the radiance on her lovely face  anthony who seemed to be quite well again also looked extremely handsome while aunt thompson who by now had put off her mourning shone in that dim church as the sun shines through a morning mist  in short all went as merrily as it should save that the brides mother seemed depressed and wept a little  this said her sister to someone in a loud voice was in her opinion nothing short of wicked what business she asked has a woman with six portionless daughters to cry because one of them is making a good marriage though it is true she added dropping her voice to a confidential whisper that had barbara chosen she might have made a better one yes i dont mind telling you that she might have been a peeress instead of the wife of a mere country squire  in truth mrs walrond was ill at ease about this marriage why she did not know something in her heart seemed to tell her that her dear daughters happiness would not be of long continuance bearing in mind his family history she feared for anthonys health indeed she feared a hundred things that she was quite unable to define however at the little breakfast which followed she seemed quite to recover her spirits and laughed as merrily as anyone at the speech which lady thompson insisted upon making in which she described barbara as her darling beautiful and most accomplished niece who indeed was almost her daughter    chapter vi  parted  hard indeed would it be to find a happier marriage than that of anthony and barbara they adored each other never a shadow came between them almost might it be said that their thoughts were one thought and their hearts one heart it is common to hear of twin souls but how often are they to be met with in the actual experience of life here however they really might be found or so it would seem had they been one ancient entity divided long ago by the working of fate and now brought together once more through the power of an overmastering attraction their union could not have been more complete to the eye of the observer and indeed to their own eyes it showed neither seam nor flaw they were one and indivisible  about such happiness as this there is something alarming something ominous mrs walrond felt it from the first and they the two persons concerned felt it also  our joy frightens me said anthony to barbara one day i feel like that persian monarch who threw his most treasured ring into the sea because he was too fortunate you remember the sea refused the offering for the royal cook found it in the mouth of a fish  then dear he was doubly fortunate for he made his sacrifice and kept his ring  anthony seeing that barbara had never heard the story and its ending did not tell it to her but she read something of what was passing in his mind as very often she had the power to do  dearest she said earnestly i know what you think you think that such happiness as ours will not be allowed to last for long that something evil will overtake us well it may be so but if it is at least we shall have had the happiness which having been will remain for ever a part of you a part of me a temple of our love not built with hands in which we shall offer thanks eternally here andbeyond and she nodded towards the glory of the sunset sky then turned and kissed him  as it chanced that cruel devouring sea which rages at the feet of all mankind was destined ere long to take the offering that was most precious to these two only this was flung to its waters not by their hands but by that of fate nor did it return to them again    after their marriage anthony and barbara hired a charming little georgian house at chelsea near to the river the drawback to the dwelling was that it stood quite close to a place of public entertainment called the gardens very well known in those days as the nightly haunt of persons who were not always as respectable as they might have been during their sojourn in london they never entered these gardens but often in the summer evenings they passed them when out for the walks which they took together since anthony spent most of his days at the temple studying law in the chambers of a leading barrister thus their somewhat fantastic gateway became impressed upon barbaras mind as did the character of the people who frequented them as however their proximity reduced the rent of their own and neighbouring houses by about onehalf personally they were grateful to these gardens since the noise of the bands and the dancing did not trouble them much and those who danced could always be avoided  when they had been married nearly a year a little daughter was born to them a sweet baby with violet eyes like to those of barbara now indeed their bliss was complete but it was not fated that it should remain since the hungry sea took its sacrifice the summer was very hot in london and many infants sickened there of some infantile complaint among them their own child like hundreds of others it died when only a few months old and left them desolate  perhaps anthony was the more crushed of the two since here barbaras vivid faith came to her aid  we have only lost her for a little while she said choking back her tears as she laid some flowers on the little grave we shall find her again i know that we shall find her again and meanwhile she will be happier than she could have been with us in this sad world  then they walked back home pushing their way through the painted crowds that were gathering at the gates of the gardens and listening to the strains of the gay music that jarred upon their ears    in due course having been called to the bar anthony entered the chambers of an eminent common law leader although his prospects were now good and he was ere long likely to be independent of the profession he was anxious to follow it and make a name and fortune for himself this indeed he would have found little difficulty in doing since soon he showed that he had studied to good purpose moreover his gifts were decidedly forensic he spoke well and without nervousness his memory was accurate and his mind logical moreover he had something of that imaginative and sympathetic power which brings an advocate success with juries  already he had been entrusted with a few cases which he held as devil for somebody else when two events happened which between them brought his career as a lawyer to an end in the november after the death of their baby his father suddenly died on receiving the news of his fatal illness anthony hurried to eastwich without even returning home to fetch a warm coat and as a result took a severe cold during the winter following the funeral this cold settled on his lungs at last towards the spring the crisis came he was taken seriously ill and on his partial recovery several doctors held a consultation over him their verdict was that he must give up his profession which fortunately now he was in a position to do live in the country and as much in the open air as possible spending the worst months of the winter either in the south of england or in some warmer land these grave and learned men told him outright that his lungs were seriously attacked and that he must choose between following their advice and a speedy departure from the world  anthony would have defied them for that was his nature he wished to go on with his work and take the risk but barbara persuaded him to obedience she said she agreed with him that the matter of his health was greatly exaggerated at the same time she pointed out that as they were now very well off she saw no reason why he should continue to slave at a profession which might or might not bring him an adequate return fifteen or twenty years later she added that personally she detested london and would like nothing better than to live at eastwich near her own people also she showed him that his rather extensive estate needed personal attention and could be much improved in value if he were there to care for it  the end may be guessed anthony gave up the bar and the house in chelsea after staying at torquay for a few of the winter months where his health improved enormously they moved to eastwich during the following may here their welcome was warm indeed not only from the rectory party who rejoiced to have barbara back among them but from the entire neighbourhood including the tenants and labourers on the property  the ensuing summer was one of the happiest of their married life anthony became so much better that barbara began to believe he had thrown off his lung weakness certain repairs and rearrangements of their old elizabethan house agreeably occupied their time and to crown all on christmas eve barbara gave birth to a son an extraordinarily fine and vigorous child redhaired blueeyed and so far as could be seen at that early age entirely unlike either of his parents  the old doctor who ushered him into the world remarked that he had never seen a more splendid and perfect boy nor one who appeared to possess a robuster constitution  in due course mr walrond christened him by the name of anthony after his father and a dinner was given to the tenants and labourers in honour of the event  that same month there being a dearth of suitable men with an adequate knowledge of the law anthony who already was a magistrate though so young was elected a deputychairman of quarter sessions for his county this local honour pleased him very much since now he knew that his legal education would not be wasted and that he would have an opportunity of turning it to use as a judge of minor cases  yet this grateful and conciliatory appointment in the end brought him evil and not good the first quarter sessions at which he was called upon to preside in one of the courts fell in february when he ought to have been out of the east of england the calendar was heavy and anthony acquitted himself very well in the trial of some difficult cases earning the compliments of all concerned but on leaving the hot court after a long day he caught a heavy cold which awoke his latent complaint and from that time forward he began to go down hill  still watched fought against by barbara its progress was slow the winter months they spent in warmer climates only residing in eastwich from may to november during the summer anthony occupied himself on matters connected with the estate and principally with the cultivation of the home farm indeed as time went on and increasing weakness forced him to withdraw himself more and more from the world and its affairs the interests of this farm loomed ever larger in his eyes as largely indeed as though he depended upon it alone for his daily bread moreover it brought him into touch with nature and now that they were so near to parting his friendship with her grew very close  this was one of his troubles that when he died and he knew that before very long he must die even if he continued to live in some other form he must bid farewell to the nature that he knew  of course there was much of her her cruel side that he would rejoice to lose he could scarcely conceive a future existence framed upon those lines of struggle which in its working involves pain and cruelty and death putting aside sport and its pleasures which he had abandoned because of the suffering and extinction entailed upon the shot or hunted creatures to him it seemed inexpressibly sad that even his honest farming operations at least where the beasts were concerned should always culminate in death why should the faithful horse be knocked on the head when it grew old or the poor cow go to the butcher as a reward for its long career of usefulness and profit  what relentless power had thus decreed in any higher life surely this decree would be rescinded and of that side of nature he had seen more than enough upon the earth it was her gentler and harmless aspects from which he did not wish to partfrom the flower and the fruit from the springing blade and the ripened corn from the beauty that brooded over sea and land from the glory of the spreading firmament alive with light and the winds that blew beneath it and the rains that washed the face of earth from the majestic passage of the glittering stars shedding their sweet influences through the night to bid farewell to such things as these must to his mind indeed be terrible  once he said as much to barbara who thought a while and answered him  why should we be taken beyond all things if seems scarcely reasonable i know we have not much to go on but did not the christ speak of drinking the fruit of the vine new with you in my fathers kingdom therefore surely there must be a growing plant that produces the fruit and a process directed by intelligence that turns it into wine there must be husbandmen or farmers there must be mansions or abiding places also for they are spoken of and flowers and all things that are beautiful and useful a new earth indeed but not one so different to the old as to be utterly unfamiliar  anthony said no more of the matter at this time but it must have remained in his mind at any rate a month or two later when he woke up one morning he said to barbara  will you laugh very much if i tell you of a dream that came to me last nightif it was a dream for i seemed to be still awake  why should i laugh at your dream she asked kissing him i often think that there is as much truth in dreams as in anything else tell it to me  i dreamed that i saw a mighty landscape which i knew was not of the earth it came to me like a picture and a great stillness brooded over it at the back of this landscape stood a towering cliff of stern rock thousands of feet high set at intervals along the edge of the cliff were golden figures mighty and immovable whether they were living guards or only statues i do not know for i never came near to them here and there miles apart streams from the lands beyond poured over the edge of the cliff in huge cascades of foam that became raging torrents when they reached its lowest slopes one of these rivers fed a lake which lay in a chasm on the slopes and from either end of this lake poured two rivers which seemed to me about twenty miles apart as we should judge they ran through groves of cedars and large groups of forest trees not unlike to enormous oaks and pines and yet not the same  one river that to the right if i looked towards the lake was very broad so broad that after it reached the plain and flowed slowly great ships could have sailed upon it the other that to the left was smaller and more rapid but it also wandered away across the plain till my sight could follow it no farther i observed that the broad righthand river evidently inundated its banks in seasons of flood much as the nile does and that all along those banks were fields filled with rich crops of what sort i do not know the plain itself which i take it was a kind of delta the gift of the great river was limitless it stretched on and on broken only by forests along the edges of which moved many animals  when first i saw this landscape it was suffused with a sweet and pearly light that came not from sun or moon or stars but from a luminous body in shape like a folded fan of which the handle rested on the earth by degrees this fan began to open i suppose that it was the hour of dawn its ribs of gorgeous light spread themselves from one side of heaven to the other and were joined together by webs of a thousand colours of such stuff as the rainbow only a hundred times more beautiful the reflection from these rainbow webs lay upon the earth divided by and sometimes mingled with those from the bars of light and made it glorious  all these things i saw from an eminence on which i stood that rose between the rivers at the head of the plain at length overcome by the splendour drunk as it were with beauty i turned to look behind me and there quite close in the midst of stately gardens with terraces and trees and fountains and banks of flowers i saw a house andnow indeed you will laughfor so far as i can recollect it in general style it was not unlike our own that is to say its architecture seemed to be more or less elizabethan if one who was acquainted with elizabethan buildings had gone to that land and built a house from memory but with more beautiful materials he might have produced such a one as i imagined in my dream  presently from the door of the house emerged two figures one of these was my brother george and the other barbara was our baby grown to a little fairhaired child the child perceived me first and ran to me through the flowers it leapt into my arms and kissed me then my brother came and saidi do not mean he spoke but his meaning was conveyed to me  you see we are making your home ready we hope that you will like it when you come but if not you can change it as you wish  then i woke up or went to sleepi do not know which    barbara made light of anthonys dream which seemed to her to be after all but a reflection or an echo of earthly things tricked out with some bizarre imagination was not this obvious the house a vague replica of his own house the river something copied from the nile delta and all the waterfalls niagara on a larger scale the great trees doubtless their counterparts grew in america the brother and the babewould he not naturally be thinking of his brother and his babe the thing stood selfconvicted echo echo echo flung back in mockery of our agonised pleadings from the cliffs of the beyond  and yet this dream haunted her especially as it returned to him more than once always with a few added details they often talked of this supernatural landscape and of the great radiant fan which closed at night and opened itself by day wherewith it was illuminated barbara thought it strange that anthony should have imagined so splendid a thing and yet why should he not have done so if she could picture it in her own mind why should he not be able to originate it in his  she told him all this only avoiding allusions to the child the baby barbara whom they had lost for of this child although she longed to ask him details as to her supposed appearance she could not bring herself to speak supposing that he were right supposing that their daughter was really growing up yonder towards some celestial womanhood and waiting for him and waiting for her the mother upon whose breast she had lain the poor bereaved mother oh then would not all be worth while  anthony listened and said that he agreed with her as a lawyer he had analysed the dream and found in it nothing at all nothing more for instance than on analysis is to be found in any and every religion  and yet he added with that pleasant smile of his which was beginning to grow so painfully sweet and plaintive in its character and yet it is very odd how real that landscape and that house are becoming to me do you know barbara that the other night i seemed to be sitting in it in a great cool room looking out at the river and the vast fertile plain then you came in my dear clad in a beautiful robe embroidered with violets yes you came in glancing round you timidly like one who had lost her way and saw me and cried aloud    towards the end anthony grew worse with a dreadful swiftness he was to have gone abroad as usual that winter but when the time came his state was such that the doctors shrugged their shoulders and said that he might as well stop at home in comfort  up to the middle of october he managed to get out upon the farm on fine days to see to the drilling of the wheat and so forth one rather rough afternoon he went out thus not because he wished to but for the sake of his spaniel dog nell which bothered him to come into the fresh air not finding something that he sought he was drawn far afield and caught in a tempest of rain and wind through which he must struggle home barbara who growing anxious had gone to seek him found him leaning against an oak unable to speak with a little stream of blood trickling from the corner of his mouth indeed it was the dog which seemed distressed that discovered her and led her to him  this was anthonys last outing but he lived till christmas eve his sons eighth birthday that morning the boy was brought into his room to receive some present that his father had procured for him and warned that he must be very quiet quiet however he would not be his tumultuous health and strength seemed to forbid it he racketed about the room teasing the spaniel which lay by the side of the bed until the patient beast growled at him and even bit or pretended to bite him thereon he set up such a yell of pain or anger or both that his father struggled from the bed to see what was the matter and so brought on the haemorrhage which caused his death  i am afraid you will have trouble with that child barbara he gasped shortly before the end he seems to be different from either of us but he is our son and i know that you will do your best for him i leave him in your keeping good night dearest i want to go to sleep    then he went to sleep and barbaras heart broke    chapter vii  barbaras sin  the months following anthonys death were to barbara as a bad dream like one in a dream she saw that open wintry grave beneath the tall church tower about whose battlements the windblown rooks wheeled on their homeward way she noted a little yellow aconite that had opened its bloom prematurely in the shadow of the wall and the sight of it brought her some kind of comfort he had loved aconites and planted many of them though because of his winter absences years had gone by since he had seen one with his eyes at any rate in england that this flower among them all should bloom on that day and in that place seemed to her a message and a consolation the only one that she could find  his sad office over her father accompanied her home pouring into her ear the words of faith and hope that he was accustomed to use to those broken by bereavement and with him came her mother but soon she thanked them gently and bade them leave her to herself then they brought her son to her thinking that the sight of him would thaw her heart for a while the child was quiet and subdued for there was that about his mothers face which awed him at last weary of being still he swung round on his heel after a fashion that he had and said  cook says that now father is dead im master here and everyone will have to do what i tell them  barbara lifted her head and looked at him and something in her fawnlike eyes a mute reproach pierced to the boys heart at any rate he began to whimper and left the room  there was little in the remark which was such as a vulgar servant might well make thoughtlessly yet it brought home to barbara the grim fact of her loss more completely perhaps than anything had done her beloved husband was dead of no more account in the world than those who had passed from it at eastwich a thousand years ago he was dead and soon would be forgotten by all save her and she was alone in her heart utterly alone    the summer came and everyone grew cheerful aunt thompson arrived at the hall to stay and urged barbara to put away past things and resign herself to the will of providenceas she had done in the case of the departed samuel  after all she said it might have been worse you might have been called upon to nurse an invalid for twenty years and when at last he went have found the best part of your life gone as i did and she sighed heavily as it is you still look quite a girl having kept your figure so well you are comfortably off and have a good position and in short there is no knowing what may happen in the future you must come up and stay with me this winter dear instead of poking yourself away in this damp old house where everybody seems to die of consumption really it is a sort of family vault and if you stop here long enough you will catch something too  barbara thanked her with a sad little smile and answered that she would think over her kind invitation and write to her later but in the end she never went to london at least not to stay perhaps it reminded her too vividly of her life there with anthony at eastwich she could bear such memories but for some unexplained reason it was otherwise in london  indeed in the course of time her aunt gave up the attempt to persuade her and devoted herself to forwarding the fortunes of her other pretty nieces barbaras sisters two of whom it should be said already she had settled comfortably in life also she took a fancy to the boy in whose rough energetic nature she found something akin to her own  i am sick of women she said it is a comfort to have to do with a male thing  so it came about that after he went to school young anthony spent a large share of his holidays at his greataunts london house it may be added that he got no good from these visits since lady thompson spoilt him and let him have his way in everything also she gave him more money than a boy ought to have as a result or partly so barbara found that her son grew more and more uncontrollable he mixed with grooms and low characters and when checked flew into fits of passion which frightened her  oddly enough during these paroxysms which were generally followed by two or three days of persistent sulking the only person who seemed to have any control over him was a certain underhousemaid named bess cotton the daughter of a small farmer in the neighbourhood this girl who was only about three years older than anthony was remarkable for her handsome appearance and vigour of body and mind her hair and large eyes were so dark that probably the local belief that she had gipsy or other foreign blood in her veins was true her complexion however was purely english and her character had all the coarseness of those who have lived for generations in the fens whence her father came uncontrolled by higher influences such as the fellowship of gentlebred and educated folk  bess was an excellent and capable servant one moreover who soon obtained a sort of mastery in the household on a certain occasion the young squire as they called him was in one of the worst of his rages having been forbidden by his mother to go to a coursing meeting which he wished to attend in this state he shut himself up in the library swearing that he would do a mischief to anyone who came near him a promise which being very strong for his years he was quite capable of keeping the manservant was told to go in and bring him out but hung back  bless you said bess i aint afraid and without hesitation walked into the room and shut the door behind her  barbara listening afar off heard a shout of get out followed by a fearful crash and trembled for all violence was abominable to her nature  he will injure that poor girl she said to herself and rose proposing to enter the library and face her son  as she hurried down the long elizabethan corridor however she heard another sound that came to her through an open window that of anthony laughing in his jolliest and most uproarious manner and of the housemaid bess laughing with him she stayed where she was and listened bess had left the library and was coming across the courtyard where one of the other servants met her and asked some question that barbara did not catch the answer in besss ringing voice was clear enough  lord she said they always gave me the wild colts to break upon the farm it is a matter of eye and handling thats all he nearly got me with that plaster thing so i went for him and boxed his ears till he was dazed then i kissed him afterwards till he laughed and hell never be any more trouble at least with me that mother of his dont know how to handle him shes another breed  yes said the questioner the mistress is a lady she is and gentle like the squire whos gone but how did they get such a one as master anthony  dont know replied bess but father says that when he was a boy in the fens theyd have told that the fairy folk changed him at birth anyway i like him well enough for he suits me  barbara went back to her sittingroom where not long afterwards the boy came to her as he entered the doorway she noted how handsome he looked with his massive head and squarejawed face and how utterly unlike any arnott or walrond known to her personally or by tradition had he been a changeling such as the girl bess spoke of he could not have seemed more different  he came and stood before her his hands in his pockets and a smile upon his face for he could smile very pleasantly when he chose  well anthony she said what is it  nothing mother dear except that i have come to beg your pardon you were quite right about the coursing meeting they are a low lot and i oughtnt to mix with them but i had bets on some of the dogs and wanted to go awfully then when you said i mustnt i lost my temper  that was very evident anthony  yes mother i felt as though i could have killed someone i did try to kill bess with that bust of plato but she dodged like a cat and the thing smashed against the wall then she came for me straight and gave me what i deserved for she was too many for me and presently all my rage went and i found that i was laughing while she tidied my clothes i wish you could do the same mother  do you anthony well i cannot  i know where did i get my temper from mother not from you or my father from all i have heard and remember of him  your grandfather would say it was from the devil anthony  yes and perhaps he is right only then it is rather hard luck on me isnt it i cant help itit comes  then make it go anthony you are to be confirmed soon change your heart  ill try but mother dear though i am so bad to you you are the only one who will ever change me when that wildcat of a girl got the better of me just now it was you i thought of not her if i lost you i dont know what would become of me  we have to stand or fall alone anthony  perhaps mother i dont know i am not old enough still dont leave me alone for if you do then i am sure which i shall do and bending down he kissed her and left the room  after this scene anthonys behaviour improved very much his reports from school were good for he was quick and clever and his great skill in athletics made him a favourite also his grandfather who prepared him for confirmation announced that the lads nature seemed to have softened  so things remained for some time to be accurate for just so long as the girl bess was a servant at the hall  anthony might talk about his mothers influence over him and without doubt when he was in his normal state this was considerable also it served to prevent him from breaking out but when he did break out bess catton alone could deal with him naturally it would be thought that there was some mutual attraction between these young people yet this was not so at any rate on the part of the girl who had been overheard to tell anthony to his face that she hated the sight of him and would cut him to ribbons if she were his mother  at any rate there were others or one other of whom bess did not hate the sight and in the end her behaviour caused such scandal that barbara was obliged to send her out of the house  all right maam she said ill go and be glad of a change you may ring your own bullcalf now and i wish you joy of the job since theres none but me that can lead him  a few days later anthony returned from school with him came a letter from the head master who wrote that he did not wish to make any scandal and therefore had not expelled the boy still he would be obliged if his mother would refrain from sending him back as he did not consider him a suitable member of a public school he suggested in the lads own interest that it might be wise to place him in some establishment where a speciality was made of the training of unruly youths he added that he wrote this with the more regret since anthonys father and grandfather had been scholars at  in their day and her son possessed no mean intellectual abilities this would be shown by the fact that he was at the head of his class and might doubtless under other circumstances have risen to a high place in the sixth form  then followed the details of his misdoings of which one need only be mentioned he had fought another boy who it may be added was older than himself and beaten him but the matter did not end there since after his adversary had given up the fight anthony flew at him and maltreated him so ferociously before they could be separated that for a while the poor lad was actually in danger of collapse  when reproached he expressed no penitence but said only that he wished that he had killed him this he repeated to his mothers face moreover he was furious when he found that bess catton had been sent away and demanded her return when told that this was impossible he announced quietly that he would make the place a hell and kept his word  for a year or more before this date barbara had not been well she suffered from persistent colds which she was unable to shake off and with these came great depression of spirit now in her misery the poor woman went to her room and falling on her knees prayed with all her heart that she might die the burden laid upon her was more than she could bear only one consolation could she find that her beloved husband had not lived to share it for she knew it would have crushed him as it crushed her  her father was now very old and so feeble that everyone screened him from trouble so far as might be but this particular trouble could not be hid and barbara told him all  do not give way my dearest daughter he said and above all do not seek to fly from your trial which doubtless is sent to you for some good purpose troubles that we strive to escape nearly always recoil upon our heads whereas if they are faced often they melt away if you remain in the world to watch and help him your sons nature bad as it seems to be may yet alter for after all i know that he loves you but if you give up and leave the world who can tell what will happen to him when he is quite uncontrolled and in possession of his fortune  barbara recognised the truth of her fathers words and while he lived tried to act up to them but as it happened mr walrond did not live long for one evening he was found dead in the church whither he often went to pray  about this time the doctors told barbara that her condition of health was somewhat serious it seemed that her lungs also showed signs of being affected perhaps she had contracted the disease from her husband and now that she was so broken in spirit it asserted itself they added however that if she took certain precautions and above all went away from eastwich there was every reason to hope that she would quite recover her health  in the end barbara did not go away at the time anthony was being instructed by a tutor who resided at the hall to prepare him for the university and ultimately for the army needless to say she was employed continually in trying to compose the differences between him and this tutor how then could she go away and leave that poor gentleman and her old mother who when she was not staying with one of her other married daughters now made her home at the hall  thus she argued to herself but the truth was that she did not wish to go her dearest associations were in the churchyard yonder the churchyard where she hoped ere long she would be laid she hated life she sought and craved for death this was her sin  night by night she lay awake and thought of anthony her darling her beloved she remembered that dream of his about a home that awaited him in another world and she loved to fancy him as dwelling in that place of peace and making ready for her coming  nobody thought of him now except herself and his old dog nell the dog thought of him she was sure for it would sleep beneath his empty bed and at times sit up look at it and whine then it would come and rest its head upon her as she slept and she would wake to find it looking at her with a question in its eyes one night in the darkness it did this then left her and broke into a joyous whimpering such as it used to make when its master was going to take it out she even heard it jumping up as though to paw at him and wondered dreamily what it could mean  when she woke in the morning she saw the poor beast lying stiff and cold upon the bed that had been anthonys and though she wept over it her tears were perhaps those of envy rather than of sorrow for she was sure that it had found anthony    more and more barbara threw out her soul towards anthony across the void of nothingness she sent it travelling nor did it return with empty hands something of anthony had greeted it though she could not remember the greeting had spoken with it though she could not interpret the words of this at least she was sure she had been near to anthony  once she seemed to see him in the infinite infinite distance millions of miles away the sky opened as it were there in the opening was anthony talking with one whom she knew for their daughter the baby that had died talking of her in a minute they were gone but she had seen them she was sure that she had seen them and the knowledge warmed her heart  so there was no error the bible was true more or less faith was not built on running water or on sand life was not a mere hellish mockery where tiaras turned to crowns of thorn and joy was but an inch rule by which to measure the alps of human pain life was a door a gateway the door dreadful the gate perilous if you will but beyond it lay no dream no empty blackness beyond it stretched the promised land peopled with the lost who soon would be the found    barbaras last illness was rapid when she began to go she went swiftly  cant you save her asked her son of one of the doctors  the disease has gone too far he answered moreover it is impossible to save one who seeks to die  why does she seek to die blurted anthony glaring at him  perhaps young gentleman you are in a better position to answer that question than i am replied the doctor who knew of anthonys cruel conduct to his mother and had reproached him with it not once but on several occasions  you mean that i have killed her said anthony savagely  no replied the doctor she is dying of tuberculosis of the lungs what were the primary causes which induced that disease i cannot be sure all i said was that she appears to welcome it or rather its issue and i will add this on my own account that when she does die the world will lose one of the sweetest women that ever walked upon it good morning  i know what he means said anthony to himself as he watched the retreating form he means that i have murdered her and perhaps i have she is sick of me and wants to get back to my father who was so different thats why she wont go on living when she might she is committing suicideof a holy sort well what made me a brute and her an angel and when shes gone how will the brute get on without the angel why should i be filled with fury and wickedness and she of whom i was born with sweetness and light let god or the devil answer that if they can my mother oh my mother and this violent sinister youth hid his face in his hands and wept    barbara sank down and down into a very whirlpool of nothingness bending over it as it were she saw the face of her aged mother the faces of some of her dear sisters the face of the kindly doctor and lastly the agonised face of her handsome son  mother dont leave me mother mother for gods sake come back to me mother or we shall never meet again come back to save me    these were the last words that barbara heard    chapter viii  the atonement  now these are the things that seemed to happen to barbara after her earthly death or rather some of the things for most of them have faded away and been lost to her mortal memory  consciousness returned to her but at first it was consciousness in an utter dark everywhere was blackness and in it she was quite alone the whole universe seemed to centre in her solitary soul still she felt no fear only a kind of wonder at this infinite blank through which she was being borne for millions and millions of miles  lights began to shine in the blackness like to those of passing ships upon a midnight sea now she was at rest and the rest was long and sweet every fear and sad thought every sensation of pain or discomfort left her peace flowed into her  presently she became aware of a weight upon her knee and wondered by what it could be caused for it reminded her of something became aware also that there was light about her at length her eyes opened and she perceived the light though dimly and that it was different to any she had known purer more radiant she perceived also that she lay upon a low couch and that the weight upon her knee was caused by something shaped like the head of a dog nay it was the head of a dog and one she knew well anthonys dog that had died upon his bed now she was sure that she dreamed and in her dream she tried to speak to the dog the words that her mind formed were  nell is that you nell but she could not utter them  still they were answered for it appeared to her that the dog thought and that she could read its thought which was  yes it is i who though but a dog having been the last to leave you am allowed to be the first to greet you and it lifted its head and looked at her with eyes full of a wonderful love  her heart went out towards the faithful beast in a kind of rapture and her intelligence formed another question it was  where am i and if you a creature are here where are the others  be patient i only watch you till they come was the answer  till they come till who come she murmured  something within told her to inquire no more but oh was it possible was the earth dream coming true  a long while went by she looked about her and understood that she was lying in a great and beautiful room beneath a dome which seemed to be fashioned of translucent ivory or alabaster at the end of the room were curtains woven of some glittering stuff that gave out light at length these curtains were drawn and through them bearing a cup in her hand passed a shape like to that of a mortal woman only so radiant that barbara knew that had she been alive with the old life she would have felt afraid  this shape also was clad in garments that gave out light and in its hair were jewelled flowers it glided to her side and looked at her with loving mysterious eyes then it held the cup to her lips and said or rather thought for the speech of that land declared itself in thought and vision  drink of this new wine  she drank of the wine and a wonderful life fell upon her like a glory  who are you o vision she asked and by way of answer there rose up within her a picture of herself barbara leaning over a cot and looking at the white face of a dead child in a certain room in london then she knew that this was her daughter and stretched out her arms towards her and received her in her arms  presently she looked again and there around the bed appeared four other shapes of beauty  you have forgotten us barbara said one of them but we are your sisters who died in infancy  for the third time she looked and behold kneeling at her side just as he had been found kneeling in the church was her adored father grown more young once more she looked and last of all breathing ineffable love came her lost darling anthony himself  from heart to heart flashed their swift thoughts like lightnings from cloud to cloud till all her being was a very sea of joy now the great room was full of presences and now the curtains were gone and all space beyond was full of presences and from that glorious company of a sudden there arose a song of welcome and beneath the burden of its sweetness she swooned to sleep    barbara dwelt in joy with those she loved and learned many things she learned that this sweet new life of hers was what she had fashioned on the earth with her prayers and strivings that the seeds of love and suffering sown down in the worlds rank soil had here blossomed to this perfect flower now she knew what was meant by the saying that the kingdom of heaven is within you and by the other saying that as man sows so shall he reap she learned that in this world beyond the world and that yet itself was but a rung in the ladder of many universes up which ladder all souls must climb to the ultimate judgment there was sorrow as well as bliss there were both suffering and delight  here the sinful were brought face to face with the naked horror of their sins and from it fled wailing and aghast here the cruel the covetous the lustful and the liar were as creatures dragged from black caverns of darkness into the burning light of day these yearned back to their darkness and attained sometimes to other coverings of a mortal flesh or to some land of which she had no knowledge for such was their fate if in them there was no spark of repentant spirit that in this new world could be fanned to flame  upwards or downwards such is the law of the universe in which nothing can stand still up from the earth which barbara had left came the spirit shape of all that lived and could die even to that of the flower but down to the earth it seemed that much of it was whirled again to ascend once more in an age to come since though the stream of life pulses continually forward it has its backwash and its eddies  barbara learned that though it is blessed to die young and sinless like to that glorious child of hers with whom she walked in this heavenly creation and whose task it was to instruct her in its simpler mysteries to live and to repent is yet more blessed in this life or in that all have sinned but not all have repented and therefore it appeared to barbara again and again such must know the burden of the flesh  also she saw many wonders and learned many secrets of that vast spiritual universe into which this world of ours pours itself day by day but if she remembers anything of these she cannot tell them  oh happy was her life with anthony for there though now sex as we know it had ceased to be spirit grew ever closer to spirit and as below they dreamed and hoped their union had indeed become an altar on which loves perfect fire flamed an offering to heaven happy too was her communion with those other souls that had been mingled in her lot and with many more whom she had known aforetime and elsewhere and long forgotten for barbara learned that life is an ancient story of which we spell out the chapters one by one    yet amidst all this joy and all the blessed labours of a hallowed world in which idleness was not known nor any weariness in welldoing a certain shadow met barbara whichever way she turned  what is it asked anthony who felt her trouble  our son she answered and showed him all the tale or so much of it as he did not know ending and i chose to leave him that i might take my chance of finding you i died when i might have lived on if i had so willed that is my sin and it haunts me  we are not the parents of his soul which is as ancient as our own barbara  no but for a while it was given into my hand and i deserted it and now i am afraid how can i tell what has chanced to the soul of this son of ours here there is no time i know not if i bade it farewell yesterday or ten thousand years ago long long since it may have passed through this world where it would seem we dwell only with those whom we seek or who seek us or it may abide upon the earth and there grow foul and hateful let us search out the truth anthony there are those who can open its gates to us if the aim be pure and good  after i died barbara i strove to learn how things went with you and strove in vain  not altogether anthony for sometimes you were very near to me or so i dreamed moreover the case was different  those who search sometimes find more than they seek barbara  doubtless still it is laid on me something drives me on    so by the means appointed they sought to know the truth as to this son of theirs and it was decreed that the truth should be known to them  in a dream a vision or perchance in truthwhich they never knewthey were drawn to the world that they had left and the reek of its sins and miseries pierced them like a spear  they stood in the streets of london near to a certain fantastic gateway that was familiar to them the gateway of the gardens from within came sounds of music and revelling for the season was that of summer a woman descended from a carriage she was finely dressed dark and handsome barbara knew her at once for the girl bess catton who alone could control her son in his rages and whom she had dismissed for her bad conduct she entered the place and they entered with her although she saw them not bess sat down and presently a man whom she seemed to know drew out of the throng and spoke to her he was a tall man of middle age with heavy eyes looking into his heart they saw that it was stained with evil the soul within him lay asleep wrapped round with the webs of sin this man said  we are going to have a merry supper bess come and join us  id like to well enough she answered for im tired of my grand life its too respectable but suppose that anthony came along hes my lawful spouse you know we had words and i told him where i was going  oh well risk your anthony forget your marriage ring and have a taste of the good old times  all right im not afraid of anthony never was but others are well its your lookout  she went with the man to a pavilion where food was served and accompanied him to a room separated by curtains from the main hall it had open windows which looked out on to the illuminated garden and the dancing in this room seated round a table was a company of women gaudily dressed and painted and with them were men one of these was a mere boy now being drawn into evil for the first time and barbara grieved for him  these welcomed the woman bess and her companion noisily and made room for them in seats near to the window then the meal began a costly meal at which not much was eaten but a great deal was drunk the revellers grew excited with wine they made jests and told doubtful stories  barbaras son anthony entered unobserved and stood with his back against the curtains he was a man now tall powerful and in his way handsome with hair of a chestnut red just then he who had brought bess to the supper threw his arm about her and kissed her whereat she laughed and the others laughed also  anthony sprang forward the table was overthrown he seized the man and shook him then he struck him in the face and hurled him through the open window to the path below for a few seconds the man lay there then rose and ran till presently he vanished beneath the shadow of some trees there was tumult and confusion in the room servants rushed in and one of the men he who seemed to be the host talked with them and offered them money the woman bess began to revile her husband  he took her by the arm and said  will you follow that fellow through the window or will you come with me  glancing at him she saw something in his face that made her silent then they went away together    the scene changed barbara knew that now she saw her aunt thompsons london house in that drawingroom where she had parted from mr russell her son and his wife stood face to face  how dare you she gasped through her set lips glaring at him with fierce eyes  how dare you he answered did i marry you for this i have given you everything my name the wealth my old aunt left to me you you the peasants child the evil woman whom i tried to lift up because i loved you from the first  then you were a fool for your pains for such as i cant be lifted up  and you he went on unheeding go back to your mire and the herd of your fellowswine you ask me how i dare go on with these ways and i tell you ill dare a good deal more before ive done ill be rid of you if i must break your neck and hang for it  you cant be rid of me im your lawful wife and you can prove nothing against me since i married do you think i want to be such a one as that mother of yours to have children and mope myself to the grave  youd best leave my mother out of it or by the devil that made you ill send you after her keep her name off your vile lips  why should i what good did she ever do you she pretended to be such a saint but she hated you and small wonder seeing what you were why she even died to be rid of you oh i know all about it and you told me as much yourself if my child is ever born i hope for your sake it will be such another as you are or as i am you can take your choice and with a glare of hate she rushed from the room  on a table near the fireplace stood spirits the maddened husband went to them filled a tumbler half full with brandy added a little water and drank it off  he poured more brandy into the glass and began to think to barbara his mind was as an open book and she read what was passing there what she saw were such thoughts as these my only comfort and yet till within two years ago whatever else i did i never touched drink i swore to my mother that i never would and had she been alive today but bess always liked her glass and drinking alone is no company ah if my mother had lived everything would have been different for i outgrew the bad fit and might have become quite a decent fellow but then i met bess again by chance and she had the old hold on me and there was none to keep me back and she knew how to play her fish until i married her the old aunt never found it out if she had i shouldnt have 8000 pounds a year today i lied to her about that and i wonder what she thinks of me now if she can think where she is gone i wonder what my mother thinks also and my father who was a good man by all accounts though nobody seems to remember much about him supposing that they could see me now supposing that they could have been at that supper party and witnessed the conjugal interview between me and the female creature who is my legal wife what would they think well they are dead and cant for the dead dont come back the dead are just a few double handfuls of dirt no more and since no doubt i shall join them before very long i thank god for it or rather i would if there were a god to thank heres to the company of the dead who will never hear or see or feel anything more from everlasting to everlasting amen  then he drank off the second half tumbler of brandy hid his face in his hands and began to sob muttering  mother why did you leave me oh mother come back to me mother and save my soul from hell    barbara and anthony awoke from their dream of the dreadful earth and looked into each others hearts  it is true said their hearts which could not lie and with those words all the glory of their state faded to a grey nothingness  you have seen and heard said barbara it was my sin which has brought this misery on our son who had i lived on might have been saved now through me he is lost who step by step of his own will must travel downwards to the last depth and thence perhaps never be raised again this is the thing that i have done yes i whom blind judges in the world held to be good  i have seen and heard he answered and joy has departed from me yet what wrong have you worked who did not know  come my father called barbara to that spirit who in the flesh had been named septimus walrond come you who are holy and pray that light may be given to us  so he came and prayed and from the heavens above fell a vision in answer to his prayer the vision was that of the fate of the soul of the son of anthony and barbara through a thousand thousand ages that were to come and it was a dreadful fate  pray again my father said barbara and ask if it may be changed  so the spirit of septimus walrond prayed and the spirits of his daughters and of the daughter of anthony and barbara prayed with him together they kneeled and prayed to the glory that shone above  there came another vision that of a little child leading a man by the hand and the child was barbara and the man was he who had been her son by a long and difficult pathupwards ever upwardsshe led him and the end of that path was not seen  then these spirits prayed that the meaning of this vision might be made more clear but to that prayer there came no answer    barbara went apart into a wilderness where thorns grew and there endured the agony of temptation on the one hand lay the pure life of joy which like the difficult path that had been shown to her led upwards ever upwards to yet greater joy shared with those she loved on the other hand lay the seething hell of earth to be once more endured through many mortal years anda soul to save alive none might counsel her none might direct her she must choose and choose alone not in fear of punishment for this was not possible to her not in hope of glory for that she must inherit but only for the hopes sake that she mightsave a soul alive  out of her deep hearts infinite love and charity thus she chose in atonement of her mortal sin and as she chose the great arc of heaven above her that had been grey and silent burst to splendour and to song    so barbara for a while bade farewell to those who loved her bade farewell to anthony her hearts heart once more alone utterly alone she laid her on the couch in the great chamber with the translucent dome and thence her spirit was whirled back through nothingness to the hell of earth there to be born again in the child of the evil woman that it might save a soul alive    thus did the sweet and holy barbarabarbara who came backin atonement of her sin  for her reward as she fights on in hope she has memory and such visions as are written here    the end
