5051560	the three partners  by bret harte     prologue   the sun was going down on the black spur range the red light it had kindled there was still eating its way along the serried crest showing through gaps in the ranks of pines etching out the interstices of broken boughs fading away and then flashing suddenly out again like sparks in burntup paper then the night wind swept down the whole mountain side and began its usual struggle with the shadows upclimbing from the valley only to lose itself in the end and be absorbed in the allconquering darkness yet for some time the pines on the long slope of heavy tree hill murmured and protested with swaying arms but as the shadows stole upwards and cabin after cabin and tunnel after tunnel were swallowed up a complete silence followed only the sky remained visiblea vast concave mirror of dull steel in which the stars did not seem to be set but only reflected  a single cabin door on the crest of heavy tree hill had remained open to the wind and darkness then it was slowly shut by an invisible figure afterwards revealed by the embers of the fire it was stirring at first only this figure brooding over the hearth was shown but as the flames leaped up two other figures could be seen sitting motionless before it when the door was shut they acknowledged that interruption by slightly changing their position the one who had risen to shut the door sank back into an invisible seat but the attitude of each man was one of profound reflection or reserve and apparently upon some common subject which made them respect each others silence however this was at last broken by a laugh it was a boyish laugh and came from the youngest of the party the two others turned their profiles and glanced inquiringly towards him but did not speak  i was thinking he began in apologetic explanation how mighty queer it was that while we were working like niggers on grub wages without the ghost of a chance of making a strike how we used to sit here night after night and flapdoodle and speculate about what wed do if we ever did make one and now great scott that we have made it and are just wallowing in gold here we are sitting as glum and silent as if wed had a washout why lord i remember one nightnot so long ago eitherthat you two quarreled over the swell hotel you were going to stop at in frisco and whether you wouldnt strike straight out for london and rome and paris or go away to japan and china and round by india and the red sea  no we didnt quarrel over it said one of the figures gently there was only a little discussion  yes but you did though returned the young fellow mischievously and you told stacy there that wed better learn something of the world before we tried to buy it or even hire it and that it was just as well to get the hayseed out of our hair and the slumgullion off our boots before we mixed in polite society  well i dont see whats the matter with that sentiment now returned the second speaker goodhumoredly only he added gravely we didnt quarrelgod forbid  there was something in the speakers tone which seemed to touch a common chord in their natures and this was voiced by barker with sudden and almost pathetic earnestness i tell you what boys we ought to swear here tonight to always stand by each otherin luck and out of it we ought to hold ourselves always at each others call we ought to have a kind of password or signal you know by which we could summon each other at any time from any quarter of the globe  come off the roof barker murmured stacy without lifting his eyes from the fire but demorest smiled and glanced tolerantly at the younger man  yes but look here stacy continued barker comrades like us in the old days used to do that in times of trouble and adventures why shouldnt we do it in our luck  theres a good deal in that barker boy said demorest though as a general thing passwords butter no parsnips and the ordinary everyday single yelp from a wolf brings the whole pack together for business about as quick as a password but you cling to that sentiment and put it away with your golddust in your belt  what i like about barker is his commodiousness said stacy here he is the only man among us that has his future fixed and his preemption lines laid out and registered hes already got a girl that hes going to marry and settle down with on the strength of his luck and id like to know what kitty carter when shes mrs barker would say to her husband being signaled for from asia or africa i dont seem to see her tumbling to any password and when he and she go into a new partnership i reckon shell let the old one slide  thats just where youre wrong said barker with quickly rising color shes the sweetest girl in the world and shed be sure to understand our feelings why she thinks everything of you two she was just eager for you to get this claim which has put us where we are when i held back and if it hadnt been for her by jove we wouldnt have had it  that was only because she cared for you returned stacy with a halfyawn and now that youve got your share she isnt going to take a breathless interest in us and by the way id rather youd remind us that we owe our luck to her than that she should ever remind you of it  what do you mean said barker quickly but demorest here rose lazily and throwing a gigantic shadow on the wall stood between the two with his back to the fire he means he said slowly that youre talking rot and so is he however as yours comes from the heart and his from the head i prefer yours but youre both making me tired lets have a fresh deal  nobody ever dreamed of contradicting demorest nevertheless barker persisted eagerly but isnt it better for us to look at this cheerfully and happily all round theres nothing criminal in our having made a strike it seems to me boys that of all ways of making money its the squarest and most level nobody is the poorer for it our luck brings no misfortune to others the gold was put there ages ago for anybody to find we found it it hasnt been tarnished by mans touch before i dont know how it strikes you boys but it seems to me that of all gifts that are going it is the straightest for whether we deserve it or not it comes to us firsthandfrom god  the two men glanced quickly at the speaker whose face flushed and then smiled embarrassedly as if ashamed of the enthusiasm into which he had been betrayed but demorest did not smile and stacys eyes shone in the firelight as he said languidly i never heard that prospecting was a religious occupation before but i shouldnt wonder if youre right barker boy so lets liquor up  nevertheless he did not move nor did the others the fire leaped higher bringing out the rude rafters and sternly economic details of the rough cabin and making the occupants in their seats before the fire look gigantic by contrast  who shut the door said demorest after a pause  i did said barker i reckoned it was getting cold  better open it again now that the fires blazing it will light the way if any of the men from below want to drop in this evening  stacy stared at his companion i thought that it was understood that we were giving them that dinner at boomville tomorrow night so that we might have the last evening here by ourselves in peace and quietness  yes but if any one did want to come it would seem churlish to shut him out said demorest  i reckon youre feeling very much as i am said stacy that this good fortune is rather crowding to us three alone for myself i know he continued with a backward glance towards a blanketed covered pile in the corner of the cabin that i feel rather oppressed byby its specific gravity i calculateand sort of crampy and twitchy in the legs as if i ought to lite out and do something and yet it holds me here all the same i doubt if anybody will come upexcept from curiosity our luck has made them rather sore down the hill for all theyre coming to the dinner tomorrow  thats only human nature said demorest  but said barker eagerly what does it mean why only this afternoon when i was passing the old kentuck tunnel where those marshalls have been grubbing along for four years without making a single strike i felt ashamed to look at them and as they barely nodded to me i slinked by as if i had done them an injury i dont understand it  it somehow does not seem to square with this gift of god idea of yours does it said stacy but well open the door and give them a show  as he did so it seemed as if the night were their only guest and had been waiting on the threshold to now enter bodily and pervade all things with its presence with that cool fragrant inflow of air they breathed freely the red edge had gone from black spur but it was even more clearly defined against the sky in its towering blackness the sky itself had grown lighter although the stars still seemed mere reflections of the solitary pinpoints of light scattered along the concave valley below mingling with the cooler restful air of the summit yet penetratingly distinct from it arose the stimulating breath of the pines below still hot and panting from the daylong sun the silence was intense the faroff barking of a dog on the invisible riverbar nearly a mile beneath them came to them like a sound in a dream they had risen and standing in the doorway by common consent turned their faces to the east it was the frequent attitude of the homeremembering miner and it gave him the crowning glory of the view for beyond the pinehearsed summits rarely seen except against the evening sky lay a thin white cloud like a dropped portion of the milky way faint with an indescribable pallor remote yet distinct enough to assert itself above and beyond all surrounding objects it was always there it was the snowline of the sierras  they turned away and silently reseated themselves the same thought in the minds of each here was something they could not take away something to be left forever and irretrievably behindleft with the healthy life they had been leading the cheerful endeavor the undying hopefulness which it had fostered and blessed was what they were taking away worth it and oddly enough frank and outspoken as they had always been to each other that common thought remained unuttered even barker was silent perhaps he was also thinking of kitty  suddenly two figures appeared in the very doorway of the cabin the effect was startling upon the partners who had only just reseated themselves and for a moment they had forgotten that the narrow band of light which shot forth from the open door rendered the darkness on either side of it more impenetrable and that out of this darkness although themselves guided by the light the figures had just emerged yet one was familiar enough it was the hill drunkard dick hall or as he was called whiskey dick or indicated still more succinctly by the hill humorists alky hall  everybody had seen that sodden puffy but goodhumored face everybody had felt the fiery exhalations of that enormous red beard which always seemed to be kept in a state of moist unkempt luxuriance by liquor everybody knew the absurd dignity of manner and attempted precision of statement with which he was wont to disguise his frequent excesses very few however knew or cared to know the pathetic weariness and chilling horror that sometimes looked out of those bloodshot eyes  he was evidently equally unprepared for the three silent seated figures before the door and for a moment looked at them blankly with the doubts of a frequently deceived perception was he sure that they were quite real he had not dared to look at his companion for verification but smiled vaguely  goodevening said demorest pleasantly  whiskey dicks face brightened goodevenin goodevenin yourselves boysand see how you like it lemme interdrush my ole frien william j steptoe of red gulch stepshosteptoeis shtayish stay he stopped hiccupped waved his hand gravely and with an air of reproachful dignity concluded sojourning for the present on the bar we wish to offer our congrashulashen and felishfelish he paused again and leaning against the doorpost added severely itations  his companion however laughed coarsely and pushing past dick entered the cabin he was a short powerful man with a closely cropped crust of beard and hair that seemed to adhere to his round head like moss or lichen he cast a glancefurtive rather than curious around the cabin and said with a familiarity that had not even good humor to excuse it so youre the gay galoots whove made the big strike thought id meander up the hill with this old bloat alky and drop in to see the show and here you are feeling your oats eh and not caring any particular gd dn if school keeps or not  show mr steptoethe whiskey said demorest to stacy then quietly addressing dick but ignoring steptoe as completely as steptoe had ignored his unfortunate companion he said you quite startled us at first we did not see you come up the trail  no we came up the back trail to please steptoe who wanted to see round the cabin said dick glancing nervously yet with a forced indifference towards the whiskey which stacy was offering to the stranger  what yer gettin off there said steptoe facing dick almost brutally you know your tangled legs wouldnt take you straight up the trail and you had to make a circumbendibus gosh if you hadnt scented this licker at the top youd have never found it  no matter im glad you did find it dick said demorest and i hope youll find the liquor good enough to pay you for the trouble  barker stared at demorest this extraordinary tolerance of the drunkard was something new in his partner but at a glance from demorest he led dick to the demijohn and tin cup which stood on a table in the corner and in another moment dick had forgotten his companions rudeness  demorest remained by the door looking out into the darkness  well said steptoe putting down his emptied cup trot out your strike i reckon our eyes are strong enough to bear it now stacy drew the blanket from the vague pile that stood in the corner and discovered a deep tin prospectingpan it was heaped with several large fragments of quartz at first the marble whiteness of the quartz and the glittering crystals of mica in its veins were the most noticeable but as they drew closer they could see the dull yellow of gold filling the decomposed and honeycombed portion of the rock as if still liquid and molten the eyes of the party sparkled like the micaeven those of barker and stacy who were already familiar with the treasure  which is the richest chunk asked steptoe in a thickening voice  stacy pointed it out  why its smaller than the others  heft it in your hand said barker with boyish enthusiasm  the short thick fingers of steptoe grasped it with a certain aquiline suggestion his whole arm strained over it until his face grew purple but he could not lift it  thar useter be a little game in the frisco mint said dick restored to fluency by his liquor when thar war ladies visiting it and that was to offer to give em any of those little boxes of gold coin that contained five thousand dollars ef they would kindly lift it from the counter and take it away it wasnt no bigger than one of these chunks but jiminy you oughter have seed them gals grip and heave on it and then hev to give it up you see they didnt know anything about the pacihic the speshif he stopped with great dignity and added with painful precision the specific gravity of gold  dry up said steptoe roughly then turning to stacy he said abruptly but wheres the rest of it youve got more than that  we sent it to boomville this morning you see weve sold out our claim to a company who take it up tomorrow and put up a mill and stamps in fact its under their charge now theyve got a gang of men on the claim already  and what mout ye hev got for it if its a fair question said steptoe with a forced smile  stacy smiled also i dont know that its a business question he said  five hundred thousand dollars said demorest abruptly from the doorway and a treble interest  the eyes of the two men met there was no mistaking the dull fire of envy in steptoes glance but demorest received it with a certain cold curiosity and turned away as the sound of arriving voices came from without  five hundred thousands a big figger said steptoe with a coarse laugh and i dont wonder it makes you feel so dd sassy but it was a fair question  unfortunately it here occurred to the whiskeystimulated brain of dick that the friend he had introduced was being treated with scant courtesy and he forgot his own treatment by steptoe leaning against the wall he waved a dignified rebuke im sashified my ole frien is akshuated by only businesh principles he paused recollected himself and added with great precision when i say he himself has a valuable claim in red gulch and to my shertain knowledge has received offersi have said enough  the laugh that broke from stacy and barker to whom the infelicitous reputation of red gulch was notorious did not allay steptoes irritation he darted a vindictive glance at the unfortunate dick but joined in the laugh and what was ye goin to do with that he said pointing to the treasure  oh were taking that with us theres a chunk for each of us as a memento we cast lots for the choice and demorest wonthat one which you couldnt lift with one hand you know said stacy  oh couldnt i i reckon you aint goin to give me the same chance that they did at the mint eh  although the remark was accompanied with his usual coarse familiar laugh there was a look in his eye so inconsequent in its significance that stacy would have made some reply but at this moment demorest reentered the cabin ushering in a half dozen miners from the bar below they were although youngish men some of the older locators in the vicinity yet through years of seclusion and uneventful labors they had acquired a certain childish simplicity of thought and manner that was alternately amusing and pathetic they had never intruded upon the reserve of the three partners of heavy tree hill before nothing but an infantine curiosity a shy recognition of the partners courtesy in inviting them with the whole population of heavy tree to the dinner the next day and the nevertoberesisted temptation of an evening of free liquor and forgetfulness of the past had brought them there now among them and yet not of them was a young man who although speaking english without accent was distinctly of a different nationality and race this with a certain neatness of dress and artificial suavity of address had gained him the nickname of the count and frenchy although he was really of flemish extraction he was the union ditch companys agent on the bar by virtue of his knowledge of languages  barker uttered an exclamation of pleasure when he saw him himself the incarnation of naturalness he had always secretly admired this young foreigner with his lacquered smoothness although a vague consciousness that neither stacy nor demorest shared his feelings had restricted their acquaintance nevertheless he was proud now to see the bow with which paul van loo entered the cabin as if it were a drawingroom and perhaps did not reflect upon that want of real feeling in an act which made the others uncomfortable  the slight awkwardness their entrance produced however was quickly forgotten when the blanket was again lifted from the pan of treasure singularly enough too the same feverish light came into the eyes of each as they all gathered around this yellow shrine even the polite paul rudely elbowed his way between the others though his artificial pardon seemed to barker to condone this act of brutal instinct but it was more instructive to observe the manner in which the older locators received this confirmation of the fickle fortune that had overlooked their weary labors and years of waiting to lavish her favors on the new and inexperienced amateurs yet as they turned their dazzled eyes upon the three partners there was no envy or malice in their depths no reproach on their lips no insincerity in their wondering satisfaction rather there was a touching almost childlike resumption of hope as they gazed at this conclusive evidence of natures bounty the gold had been therethey had only missed it and if there more could be found was it not a proof of the richness of heavy tree hill so strongly was this reflected on their faces that a casual observer contrasting them with the thoughtful countenances of the real owners would have thought them the lucky ones it touched barkers quick sympathies it puzzled stacy it made demorest more serious it aroused steptoes active contempt whiskey dick alone remained stolid and impassive in a desperate attempt to pull himself once more together eventually he succeeded even to the ambitious achievement of mounting a chair and lifting his tin cup with a dangerously unsteady hand which did not however affect his precision of utterance and said  order gentlemen well drink success toto  the next strike said barker leaping impetuously on another chair and beaming upon the old locatorsand may it come to those who have so long deserved it  his sincere and generous enthusiasm seemed to break the spell of silence that had fallen upon them other toasts quickly followed in the general good feeling barker attached himself to van loo with his usual boyish effusion and in a burst of confidence imparted the secret of his engagement to kitty carter van loo listened with polite attention formal congratulations but inscrutable eyes that occasionally wandered to stacy and again to the treasure a slight chill of disappointment came over barkers quick sensitiveness perhaps his enthusiasm had bored this superior man of the world perhaps his confidences were in bad taste with a new sense of his inexperience he turned sadly away van loo took that opportunity to approach stacy  whats all this i hear of barker being engaged to miss carter he said with a faintly superior smile is it really true  yes why shouldnt it be returned stacy bluntly  van loo was instantly deprecating and smiling why not of course but isnt it sudden  they have known each other ever since hes been on heavy tree hill responded stacy  ah yes true said van loo but now  wellhes got money enough to marry and hes going to marry  rather young isnt he said van loo still deprecatingly and shes got nothing used to wait on the table at her fathers hotel in boomville didnt she  yes what of that we all know it  of course its an excellent thing for herand her father hell have a rich soninlaw about two hundred thousand is his share isnt it i suppose old carter is delighted  stacy had thought this before but did not care to have it corroborated by this superfine young foreigner and i dont reckon that barker is offended if he is he said curtly as he turned away nevertheless he felt irritated that one of the three superior partners of heavy tree hill should be thought a dupe  suddenly the conversation dropped the laughter ceased every one turned round and by a common instinct looked towards the door from the obscurity of the hill slope below came a wonderful tenor voice modulated by distance and spiritualized by the darkness       when at some future day      i shall be far away      thou wilt be weeping      thy lone watch keeping  the men looked at one another thats jack hamlin they said whats he doing here  the wolves are gathering around fresh meat said steptoe with his coarse laugh and a glance at the treasure didnt ye know he came over from red dog yesterday  well give jack a fair show and his own game said one of the old locators and hed clean out that pile afore sunrise  and lose it next day added another  but never turn a hair or change a muscle in either case said a third lord ive heard him sing away just like that when hes been leaving the board with five thousand dollars in his pocket or going away stripped of his last red cent  van loo who had been listening with a peculiar smile here said in his most deprecating manner yes but did you never consider the influence that such a man has on the hardworking tunnelmen who are ready to gamble their whole weeks earnings to him perhaps not but i know the difficulties of getting the ditch rates from these men when he has been in camp  he glanced around him with some importance but only a laugh followed his speech come frenchy said an old locator you only say that because your little brother wanted to play with jack like a grown man and when jack ordered him off the board and he became sassy jack scooted him outer the saloon  van loos face reddened with an anger that had the apparent effect of removing every trace of his former polished repose and leaving only a hard outline beneath at which demorest interfered  i cant say that i see much difference in gambling by putting money into a hole in the ground and expecting to take more from it than by putting it on a card for the same purpose  here the ravishing tenor voice which had been approaching ceased and was succeeded by a heartbreaking and equally melodious whistling to finish the bar of the singers song and the next moment jack hamlin appeared in the doorway  whatever was his present financial condition in perfect selfpossession and charming sangfroid he fully bore out his previous description he was as clean and refreshing looking as a madronotree in the dustblown forest an odor of scented soap and freshly ironed linen was wafted from him there was scarcely a crease in his white waistcoat nor a speck upon his varnished shoes he might have been an auditor of the previous conversation so quickly and completely did he seem to take in the whole situation at a glance perhaps there was an extra tilt to his blackribboned panama hat and a certain dancing devilry in his brown eyeswhich might also have been an answer to adverse criticism  when i his truth to prove would trifle with my love he warbled in general continuance from the doorway then dropping cheerfully into speech he added well boys i am here to welcome the little stranger and to trust that the family are doing as well as can be expected ah there it is bless it he went on walking leisurely to the treasure triplets tooand plump at that have you had em weighed  frankness was an essential quality of heavy tree hill we were just saying jack said an old locator that giving you a fair show and your own game you could manage to get away with that pile before daybreak  and im just thinking said jack cheerfully that there were some of you here that could do that without any such useless preliminary his brown eyes rested for a moment on steptoe but turning quite abruptly to van loo he held out his hand startled and embarrassed before the others the young man at last advanced his when jack coolly put his own as if forgetfully in his pocket i thought you might like to know what that little brother of yours is doing he said to van loo yet looking at steptoe i found him wandering about the hill here quite drunk  i have repeatedly warned himbegan van loo reddening  against bad companyi know suggested jack gayly yet in spite of all that i think he owes some of his liquor to steptoe yonder  i never supposed the fool would get drunk over a glass of whiskey offered in fun said steptoe harshly yet evidently quite as much disconcerted as angry  the trouble with steptoe said hamlin thoughtfully spanning his slim waist with both hands as he looked down at his polished shoes is that he has such a softhearted liking for all weaknesses always wanting to protect chaps that cant look after themselves whether its whiskey dick there when he has a pull on or some nigger when hes made a little strike or that straying lamb of van loos when hes puppy drunk but youre wrong about me boys you cant draw me in any game tonight this is one of my nights off which i devote exclusively to contemplation and song but he added suddenly turning to his three hosts with a bewildering and fascinating change of expression i couldnt resist coming up here to see you and your pile even if i never saw the one or the other before and am not likely to see either again i believe in luck and it comes a mighty sight oftener than a fellow thinks it does but it doesnt come to stay so id advise you to keep your eyes skinned and hang on to it while its with you like grim death so long  resisting all attempts of his hostswho had apparently fallen as suddenly and unaccountably under the magic of his mannerto detain him longer he stepped lightly away his voice presently rising again in melody as he descended the hill nor was it at all remarkable that the others apparently drawn by the same inevitable magnetism were impelled to follow him naturally joining their voices with his leaving steptoe and van loo so markedly behind them alone that they were compelled at last in sheer embarrassment to close up the rear of the procession in another moment the cabin and the three partners again relapsed into the peace and quiet of the night with the dying away of the last voices on the hillside the old solitude reasserted itself  but since the irruption of the strangers they had lost their former sluggish contemplation and now busied themselves in preparation for their early departure from the cabin the next morning they had arranged to spend the following day and night at boomville and carters hotel where they were to give their farewell dinner to heavy tree hill they talked but little together since the rebuff his enthusiastic confidences had received from van loo barker had been grave and thoughtful and stacy with the irritating recollection of van loos criticisms in his mind had refrained from his usual rallying of barker oddly enough they spoke chiefly of jack hamlintill then personally a stranger to them on account of his infelix reputationand even the critical demorest expressed a wish they had known him before but you never know the real value of anything until youre quitting it or its quitting you he added sententiously  barker and stacy both stared at their companion it was unlike demorest to regret anythingparticularly a mere social diversion  they say remarked stacy that if you had known jack hamlin earlier and professionally a great deal of real value would have quitted you before he did  dont repeat that rot flung out by men who have played jacks game and lost returned demorest derisively id rather trust him thanhe stopped glanced at the meditative barker and then concluded abruptly the whole caboodle of his critics  they were silent for a few moments and then seemed to have fallen into their former dreamy mood as they relapsed into their old seats again at last stacy drew a long breath i wish we had sent those nuggets off with the others this morning  why said demorest suddenly  why well dn it all they kind of oppress me dont you see i seem to feel em here on my chestall the three returned stacy only half jocularly its their dd specific gravity i suppose i dont like the idea of sleeping in the same room with em theyre altogether too much for us three men to be left alone with  you dont mean that you think that anybody would attemptsaid demorest  stacy curled a fighting lip rather superciliously no i dont think thati rather wish i did its the blessed chunks of solid gold that seem to have got us fast dont you know and are going to stick to us for good or ill a sort of frankenstein monster that weve picked out of a hole from below  i know just what stacy means said barker breathlessly rounding his gray eyes ive felt it too couldnt we make a sort of cache of itbury it just outside the cabin for tonight it would be sort of putting it back into its old place you know for the time being it might like it  the other two laughed rather rough on providence barker boy said stacy handing back the heavensent gift so soon besides whats to keep any prospector from coming along and making a strike of it you know thats mining lawif you havent preempted the spot as a claim  but barker was too staggered by this material statement to make any reply and demorest arose and i feel that youd both better be turning in as weve got to get up early he went to the corner of the cabin and threw the blanket back over the pan and its treasure there thatll keep the chunks from getting up to ride astride of you like a nightmare he shut the door and gave a momentary glance at its cheap hinges and the absence of bolt or bar stacy caught his eye well miss this security in san franciscoperhaps even in boomville he sighed  it was scarcely ten oclock but stacy and barker had begun to undress themselves with intervals of yawning and desultory talk barker continuing an amusing story with one stocking off and his trousers hanging on his arm until at last both men were snugly curled up in their respective bunks presently stacys voice came from under the blankets  hallo arent you going to turn in too  not yet said demorest from his chair before the fire you see its the last night in the old shanty and i reckon ill see the rest of it out  thats so said the impulsive barker struggling violently with his blankets i tell you what boys we just ought to make a watchnight of ita regular vigil you knowuntil twelve at least hold on ill get up too but here demorest arose caught his youthful partners bare foot which went searching painfully for the ground in one hand tucked it back under the blankets and heaping them on the top of him patted the bulk with an authoritative paternal air  youll just say your prayers and go to sleep sonny youll want to be fresh as a daisy to appear before miss kitty tomorrow early and you can keep your vigils for tomorrow night after dinner in the back drawingroom i said goodnight and i mean it  protesting feebly barker finally yielded in a nestling shiver and a sudden silence demorest walked back to his chair a prolonged snore came from stacys bunk then everything was quiet demorest stirred up the fire cast a huge root upon it and leaning back in his chair sat with halfclosed eyes and dreamed  it was an old dream that for the past three years had come to him daily sometimes even overtaking him under the shade of a buckeye in his noontide rest on his claima dream that had never yet failed to wait for him at night by the fireside when his partners were at rest a dream of the past but so real that it always made the present seem the dream through which he was moving towards some sure awakening  it was not strange that it should come to him tonight as it had often come before slowly shaping itself out of the obscurity as the vision of a fair young girl seated in one of the empty chairs before him always the same pretty childlike face fraught with a halffrightened halfwondering trouble always the same slender graceful figure but always glimmering in diamonds and satin or spiritual in lace and pearls against his own rude and sordid surroundings always silent with parted lips until the night wind smote some chord of recollection and then mingled a remembered voice with his own for at those times he seemed to speak also albeit with closed lips and an utterance inaudible to all but her  well he said sadly  well the voice repeated like a gentle echo blending with his own  you know it all now he went on you know that it has come at lastall that i had worked for prayed for all that would have made us happy here all that would have saved you to me has come at last and all too late  too late echoed the voice with his  you remember he went on the last day we were together you remember your friends and family would have you give me upa penniless man you remember when they reproached you with my poverty and told you that it was only your wealth that i was seeking that i then determined to go away and never to return to claim you until that reproach could be removed you remember dearest how you clung to me and bade me stay with you even fly with you but not to leave you alone with them you wore the same dress that day darling your eyes had the same wondering childlike fear and trouble in them your jewels glittered on you as you trembled and i refused in my pride or rather in my weakness and cowardice i refused i came away and broke my heart among these rocks and ledges yet grew strong and you my love you sheltered and guarded by those you loved youhe stopped and buried his face in his hands the night wind breathed down the chimney and from the stirred ashes on the hearth came the soft whisper i died  and then he went on i cared for nothing sometimes my heart awoke for this young partner of mine in his innocent trustful love for a girl that even in her humble station was far beyond his hopes and i pitied myself in him home fortune friends i no longer cared forall were forgotten and now they are returning to meonly that i may see the hollowness and vanity of them and taste the bitterness for which i have sacrificed you and here on this last night of my exile i am confronted with only the jealousy the doubt the meanness and selfishness that is to come too late too late  the wondering troubled eyes that had looked into his here appeared to clear and brighten with a sweet prescience was it the wind moaning in the chimney that seemed to whisper to him too late beloved for me but not for you i died but love still lives be happy philip and in your happiness i too may live again  he started in the flickering firelight the chair was empty the wind that had swept down the chimney had stirred the ashes with a sound like the passage of a rustling skirt there was a chill in the air and a smell like that of opened earth a nervous shiver passed over him then he sat upright there was no mistake it was no superstitious fancy but a faint damp current of air was actually flowing across his feet towards the fireplace he was about to rise when he stopped suddenly and became motionless  he was actively conscious now of a strange sound which had affected him even in the preoccupation of his vision it was a gentle brushing of some yielding substance like that made by a soft broom on sand or the sweep of a gown but to his mountain ears attuned to every woodland sound it was not like the gnawing of gopher or squirrel the scratching of wildcat nor the hairy rubbing of bear nor was it human the long deep respirations of his sleeping companions were distinct from that monotonous sound he could not even tell if it were in the cabin or without suddenly his eye fell upon the pile in the corner the blanket that covered the treasure was actually moving  he rose quickly but silently alert selfcontained and menacing for this dreamer this bereaved man this scornful philosopher of riches had disappeared with that midnight trespass upon the sacred treasure the movement of the blanket ceased the soft swishing sound recommenced he drew a glittering bowieknife from his bootleg and in three noiseless strides was beside the pile there he saw what he fully expected to seea narrow horizontal gap between the log walls of the cabin and the adobe floor slowly widening and deepening by the burrowing of unseen hands from without the cold outer air which he had felt before was now plainly flowing into the heated cabin through the opening the swishing sound recommenced and stopped then the four fingers of a hand palm downwards were cautiously introduced between the bottom log and the denuded floor upon that intruding hand the bowieknife of demorest descended like a flash of lightning there was no outcry even in that supreme moment demorest felt a pang of admiration for the stoicism of the unseen trespasser but the maimed hand was quickly withdrawn and as quickly demorest rushed to the door and dashed into the outer darkness  for an instant he was dazed and bewildered by the sudden change but the next moment he saw a dodging doubling figure running before him and threw himself upon it in the shock both men fell but even in that contact demorest felt the tangled beard and alcoholic fumes of whiskey dick and felt also that the hands which were thrown up against his breast the palms turned outward with the instinctive movement of a timid defenseless man were unstained with soil or blood with an oath he threw the drunkard from him and dashed to the rear of the cabin but too late there indeed was the scattered earth there the widened burrow as it had been excavated apparently by that mutilated handbut nothing else  he turned back to whiskey dick but the miserable man although still retaining a look of dazed terror in his eyes had recovered his feet in a kind of angry confidence and a forced sense of injury what did demorest mean by attacking innoshent gentlemen on the trail outside his cabin yes outside his cabin he would swear it  what were you doing here at midnight demanded demorest  what was he doing what was any gentleman doing he wasnt any mollycoddle to go to bed at ten oclock what was he doing wellhed been with men who didnt shut their doors and turn the boys out just in the shank of the evening he wasnt any barker to be wetnursed by demorest  some one else was here said demorest sternly with his eyes fixed on whiskey dick the dull glaze which seemed to veil the outer world from the drunkards pupils shifted suddenly with such a look of direct horror that demorest was fain to turn away his own but the veil mercifully returned and with it dicks workedup sense of injury nobody was therenot a shole did demorest think if there had been any of his friends there they would have stood by like dogsh and seen him insulted  demorest turned away and reentered the cabin as dick lurched heavily forward still muttering down the trail the excitement over a sickening repugnance to the whole incident took the place of demorests resentment and indignation there had been a cowardly attempt to rob them of their miserable treasure he had met it and frustrated it in almost as brutal a fashion the gold was already tarnished with blood to his surprise yet relief he found his partners unconscious of the outrage still sleeping with the physical immobility of overexcited and tired men should he awaken them no he should have to awaken also their suspicions and desire for revenge there was no danger of a further attack there was no fear that the culprit would disclose himself and tomorrow they would be far away let oblivion rest upon that nights stain on the honor of heavy tree hill  he rolled a small barrel before the opening smoothed the dislodged earth replaced the pan with its treasure and trusted that in the bustle of the early morning departure his partners might not notice any change stopping before the bunk of stacy he glanced at the sleeping man he was lying on his back but breathing heavily and his hands were moving towards his chest as if indeed his strange fancy of the golden incubus were being realized demorest would have wakened him but presently with a sigh of relief the sleeper turned over on his side it was pleasanter to look at barker whose damp curls were matted over his smooth boyish forehead and whose lips were parted in a smile under the silken wings of his brown mustache he too seemed to be trying to speak and remembering some previous revelations which had amused them demorest leaned over him fraternally with an answering smile waiting for the beloved ones name to pass the young mans lips but he only murmured threehundredthousand dollars the elder man turned away with a grave face the influence of the treasure was paramount  when he had placed one of the chairs against the unprotected door at an angle which would prevent any easy or noiseless intrusion demorest threw himself on his bunk without undressing and turned his face towards the single window of the cabin that looked towards the east he did not apprehend another covert attempt against the gold he did not fear a robbery with force and arms although he was satisfied that there was more than one concerned in it but this he attributed only to the encumbering weight of their expected booty he simply waited for the dawn it was some time before his eyes were greeted with the vague opaline brightness of the firmament which meant the vanishing of the pallid snowline before the coming day a bird twittered on the roof the air was chill he drew his blanket around him then he closed his eyes he fancied only for a moment but when he opened them the door was standing open in the strong daylight he sprang to his feet but the next moment he saw it was only stacy who had passed out and was returning fully dressed bringing water from the spring to fill the kettle but stacys face was so grave that recalling his disturbed sleep demorest laughingly inquired if he had been haunted by the treasure but to his surprise stacy put down the kettle and with a hurried glance at the still sleeping barker said in a low voice  i want you to do something for me without asking why later i will tell you  demorest looked at him fixedly what is it he said  the packmules will be here in a few moments dont wait to close up or put away anything here but clap that gold in the saddlebags and take barker with you and lite out for boomville at once i will overtake you later  is there no time to discuss this asked demorest  no said stacy bluntly call me a crank say im in a blue funkhis compressed lips and sharp black eyes did not lend themselves much to that hypothesisonly get out of this with that stuff and take barker with you im not responsible for myself while its here  demorest knew stacy to be combative but practical if he had not been assured of his partners last night slumbers he might have thought he knew of the attempt or if he had discovered the turnedup ground in the rear of the cabin his curiosity would have demanded an explanation demorest paused only for a moment and said very well i will go  good ill rouse out barker but not a word to himexcept that he must go  the rousing out of barker consisted of stacys lifting that young gentleman bodily from his bunk and standing him upright in the open doorway but barker was accustomed to this spartan process and after a moments balancing with closed lids like an unwrapped mummy he sat down in the doorway and began to dress he at first demurred to their departure except all togetherit was so unfraternal but eventually he allowed himself to be persuaded out of it and into his clothes for barker had also had his visions in the night one of which was that they should build a beautiful villa on the site of the old cabin and solemnly agree to come every year and pass a week in it together i thought at first he said sliding along the floor in search of different articles of his dress or stopping gravely to catch them as they were thrown to him by his partners that wed have it at boomville as being handier to get there but ive concluded wed better have it here a little higher up the hill where it could be seen over the whole black spur range when we werent here we could use it as a hut of refuge for brokendown or washedout miners or weary travelers like those hospices in the alps you know and have somebody to keep it for us you see ive thought even of that and van loo is the very man to take charge of it for us you see hes got such good manners and speaks two languages lord if a german or frenchman came along poor and distressed van loo would just chip in his own language see youve got to think of all these details you see boys and we might call it the rest of the three partners or three partners rest  and you might begin by giving us one said stacy dry up and drink your coffee  ill draw out the plans ive got it all in my head continued the enthusiastic barker unheeding the interruption ill just run out and take a look at the site its only right back of the cabin but here stacy caught him by his dangling belt as he was flying out of the door with one boot on and thrust him down in a chair with a tin cup of coffee in his hand  keep the plans in your head barker boy said demorest for here are the pack mules and packer this was quite enough to divert the impressionable young man who speedily finished his dressing as a mule bearing a large packsaddle and two enormous saddlebags or pouches drove up before the door led by a muleteer on a small horse the transfer of the treasure to the saddlebags was quickly made by their united efforts as the first rays of the sun were beginning to paint the hillside shading his keen eyes with his hand stacy stood in the doorway and handed demorest the two rifles demorest hesitated hadnt you better keep one he said looking in his partners eyes with his first challenge of curiosity the sun seemed to put a humorous twinkle into stacys glance as he returned not much and youd better take my revolver with you too im feeling a little better now he said looking at the saddlebags but im not fit to be trusted yet with carnal weapons when the other mule comes and is packed ill overtake you on the horse  a little more satisfied although still wondering and perplexed demorest shouldered one rifle and with barker who was carrying the other followed the muleteer and his equipage down the trail for a while he was a little ashamed of his part in this unusual spectacle of two armed men convoying a laden mule in broad daylight but luckily it was too early for the bar miners to be going to work and as the tunnelmen were now at breakfast the trail was free of wayfarers at the point where it crossed the main road demorest however saw steptoe and whiskey dick emerge from the thicket apparently in earnest conversation demorest felt his repugnance and halfrestrained suspicions suddenly return yet he did not wish to betray them before barker nor was he willing in case of an emergency to allow the young man to be entirely unprepared calling him to follow he ran quickly ahead of the laden mule and was relieved to find that looking back his companion had brought his rifle to a ready through some instinctive feeling of defense as steptoe and whiskey dick a moment later discovering them were evidently surprised there seemed however to be no reason for fearing an outbreak suddenly at a whisper from steptoe he and whiskey dick both threw up their hands and stood still on the trail a few yards from them in a burlesque of the usual recognized attitude of helplessness while a hoarse laugh broke from steptoe  dd if we didnt think you were roadagents but we see youre only guarding your treasure rather fancy style for heavy tree hill aint it things must be gettin rough up thar to hev to take out your guns like that  demorest had looked keenly at the four hands thus exhibited and was more concerned that they bore no trace of wounds or mutilation than at the insult of the speech particularly as he had a distinct impression that the action was intended to show him the futility of his suspicions  i am glad to see that if you havent any arms in your hands youre not incapable of handling them said demorest coolly as he passed by them and again fell into the rear of the muleteer  but barker had thought the incident very funny and laughed effusively at whiskey dick i didnt know that steptoe was up to that kind of fun he said and i suppose we did look rather rough with these guns as we ran on ahead of the mule but then you know that when you called to me i really thought you were in for a shindy all the same whiskey dick did that hands up to perfection how he managed it i dont know but his knees seemed to knock together as if he was in a real funk  demorest had thought so too but he made no reply how far that miserable drunkard was a forced or willing accomplice of the events of last night was part of a question that had become more and more repugnant to him as he was leaving the scene of it forever it had come upon him desecrating the dream he had dreamt that last night and turning its hopeful climax to bitterness small wonder that barker walking by his side had his quick sympathies aroused and as he saw that shadow which they were all familiar with but had never sought to penetrate fall upon his companions handsome face even his youthful spirits yielded to it they were both relieved when the clatter of hoofs behind them as they reached the valley announced the approach of stacy i started with the second mule and the last load soon after you left he explained and have just passed them i thought it better to join you and let the other load follow nobody will interfere with that  then you are satisfied said demorest regarding him steadfastly  you bet look  he turned in his saddle and pointed to the crest of the hill they had just descended above the pines circling the lower slope above the bare ledges of rock and outcrop a column of thick black smoke was rising straight as a spire in the windless air  thats the old shanty passing away said stacy complacently i reckon there wont be much left of it before we get to boomville  demorest and barker stared you fired it said barker trembling with excitement  yes said stacy i couldnt bear to leave the old rookery for coyotes and wildcats to gather in so i touched her off before i left  butsaid barker  but repeated stacy composedly hallo whats the matter with that new plan of the rest that youre going to build eh you dont want them both  and you did this rather than leave the dear old cabin to strangers said barker with kindling eyes stacy i didnt think you had that poetry in you  theres heaps in me barker boy that you dont know and i dont exactly sabe myself  only continued the young fellow eagerly we ought to have all been there we ought to have made a solemn rite of it you knowa kind of sacrifice we ought to have poured a kind of libation on the ground  i did sprinkle a little kerosene over it i think returned stacy just to help things along but if you want to see her flaming barker you just run back to that last corner on the road beyond the big red wood thats the spot for a view  as barkeralways devoted to a spectacleswiftly disappeared the two men faced each other well what does it all mean said demorest gravely  it means old man said stacy suddenly that if we hadnt had nigger luck the same blind luck that sent us that strike you and i and that barker over there would have been swirling in that smoke up to the sky about two hours ago he stopped and added in a lower but earnest voice look here phil when i went out to fetch water this morning i smelt something queer i went round to the back of the cabin and found a hole dug under the floor and piled against the corner wall a lot of brushwood and a can of kerosene some of the kerosene had been already poured on the brush everything was ready to light and only my coming out an hour earlier had frightened the devils away the idea was to set the place on fire suffocate us in the smoke of the kerosene poured into the hole and then to rush in and grab the treasure it was a systematic plan  no said demorest quietly  no repeated stacy i told you i saw the whole thing and took away the kerosene which i hid and after you had gone used it to fire the cabin with to see if the ones i suspected would gather to watch their work  it was no part of their first plan said demorest which was only robbery listen he hurriedly recounted his experience of the preceding night to the astonished stacy no the fire was an afterthought and revenge he added sternly  but you say you cut the robber in the hand there would be no difficulty in identifying him by that  i wounded only a hand said demorest but there was a head in that attempt that i never saw he then revealed his own halfsuspicions but how they were apparently refuted by the bravado of steptoe and whiskey dick  then that was the reason they didnt gather at the fire said stacy quickly  ah said demorest then you too suspected them  stacy hesitated and then said abruptly yes  demorest was silent for a moment  why didnt you tell me this this morning he said gently  stacy pointed to the distant barker i didnt want you to tell him i thought it better for one partner to keep a secret from two than for the two to keep it from one why didnt you tell me of your experience last night  i am afraid it was for the same reason said demorest with a faint smile and it sometimes seems to me jim that we ought to imitate barkers frankness in our dread of tainting him with our own knowledge of evil we are sending him out into the world very poorly equipped for all his three hundred thousand dollars  i reckon youre right said stacy briefly extending his hand shake on that  the two men grasped each others hands  and hes no fool either continued demorest when we met steptoe on the road without a word from me he closed up alongside with his hand on the lock of his rifle and i hadnt the heart to praise him or laugh it off  nevertheless they were both silent as the object of their criticism bounded down the trail towards them he had seen the funeral pyre it was awfully sad it was awfully lovely but there was something grand in it who could have thought stacy could be so poetic but he wanted to tell them something else that was mighty pretty  what was it said demorest  well said barker dont laugh but you know that jack hamlin well boys hes been hovering around us on his mustang keeping us and that packmule in sight ever since we left sometimes hes on a side trail off to the right sometimes off to the left but always at the same distance i didnt like to tell you boys for i thought youd laugh at me but i think you know hes taken a sort of shine to us since he dropped in last night and i fancy you see hes sort of hanging round to see that we get along all right id have pointed him out before only i reckoned you and stacy would say he was making up to us for our money  and wed have been wrong barker boy said stacy with a heartiness that surprised demorest for i reckon your instincts the right one  there he is now said the gratified barker just abreast of us on the cutoff he started just after we did and hes got a horse that could have brought him into boomville hours ago its just his kindness  he pointed to a distant fringe of buckeye from which jack hamlin had just emerged although evidently holding in a powerful mustang nothing could be more unconscious and utterly indifferent than his attitude he did not seem to know of the proximity of any other traveler and to care less his handsome head was slightly thrown back as if he was caroling after his usual fashion but the distance was too great to make his melody audible to them or to allow barkers shout of invitation to reach him suddenly he lowered his tightened rein the mustang sprang forward and with a flash of silver spurs and bridle fripperies he had disappeared but as the trail he was pursuing crossed theirs a mile beyond it seemed quite possible that they should again meet him  they were now fairly into the boomville valley and were entering a narrow arroyo bordered with dusky willows which effectually excluded the view on either side it was the bed of a mountain torrent that in winter descended the hillside over the trail by which they had just come but was now sunk into the thirsty plain between banks that varied from two to five feet in height the muleteer had advanced into the narrow channel when he suddenly cast a hurried glance behind him uttered a madre de dios and backed his mule and his precious freight against the bank the sound of hoofs on the trail in their rear had caught his quicker ear and as the three partners turned they beheld three horsemen thundering down the hill towards them they were apparently mexican vaqueros of the usual common swarthy type their faces made still darker by the black silk handkerchief tied round their heads under their stiff sombreros either they were unable or unwilling to restrain their horses in their headlong speed and a collision in that narrow passage was imminent but suddenly before reaching its entrance they diverged with a volley of oaths and dashing along the left bank of the arroyo disappeared in the intervening willows divided between relief at their escape and indignation at what seemed to be a drunken feastday freak of these roystering vaqueros the little party reformed when a cry from barker arrested them he had just perceived a horseman motionless in the arroyo who although unnoticed by them had evidently been seen by the mexicans he had apparently leaped into it from the bank and had halted as if to witness this singular incident as the clatter of the vaqueros hoofs died away he lightly leaped the bank again and disappeared but in that single glimpse of him they recognized jack hamlin when they reached the spot where he had halted they could see that he must have approached it from the trail where they had previously seen him but which they now found crossed it at right angles barker was right he had really kept them at easy distance the whole length of the journey  but they were now reaching its end when they issued at last from the arroyo they came upon the outskirts of boomville and the great stageroad indeed the six horses of the pioneer coach were just panting along the last half mile of the steep upgrade as they approached they halted mechanically as the heavy vehicle swayed and creaked by them in their ordinary working dress sunburnt with exposure covered with dust and carrying their rifles still in their hands they perhaps presented a sufficiently characteristic appearance to draw a few facessome of them pretty and intelligentto the windows of the coach as it passed the sensitive barker was quickest to feel that resentment with which the pioneer usually met the wideeyed criticism of the eastern tourist or greenhorn and reddened under the bold scrutiny of a pair of black inquisitive eyes behind an eyeglass that annoyance was communicated though in a lesser degree even to the bearded demorest and stacy it was an unexpected contact with that great world in which they were so soon to enter they felt ashamed of their appearance and yet ashamed of that feeling they felt a secret satisfaction when barker said theyd open their eyes wider if they knew what was in that packsaddle and yet they corrected him for what they were pleased to call his snobbishness they hurried a little faster as the road became more frequented as if eager to shorten their distance to clean clothes and civilization  only demorest began to linger in the rear this contact with the stagecoach had again brought him face to face with his buried past he felt his old dream revive and occasionally turned to look back upon the dark outlines of black spur under whose shadow it had returned so often and wondered if he had left it there forever and it were now slowly exhaling with the thinned and dying smoke of their burning cabin  his companions knowing his silent moods had preceded him at some distance when he heard the soft sound of ambling hoofs on the thick dust and suddenly the light touch of jack hamlins gauntlet on his shoulder the mustang jack bestrode was reeking with grime and sweat but jack himself was as immaculate and fresh as ever with a delightful affectation of embarrassment and timidity he began flicking the side buttons of his velvet vaquero trousers with the thong of his riata i reckoned to sling a word along with you before you went he said looking down but im so shy that i couldnt do it in company so i thought id get it off on you while you were alone  weve seen you once or twice before this morning said demorest pleasantly and we were sorry you didnt join us  i reckon i might have said jack gayly if my horse had only made up his mind whether he was a bird or a squirrel and hadnt been so various and promiscuous about whether he wanted to climb a tree or fly hes not a bad horse for a mexican plug only when he thinks there is any devilment around he wants to wade in and take a hand however i reckoned to see the last of you and your pile into boomville and i did when i meet three fellows like you that are clean white all through i sort of cotton to em even if im a little of a brunette myself and ive got something to give you  he took from a fold of his scarlet sash a small parcel neatly folded in white paper as fresh and spotless as himself holding it in his fingers he went on i happened to be at heavy tree hill early this morning before sunup in the darkness i struck your cabin and i reckoni struck somebody else at first i thought it was one of you chaps down on your knees praying at the rear of the cabin but the way the fellow lit out when he smelt me coming made me think it wasnt entirely fasting and prayer however i went to the rear of the cabin and then i reckoned some kind friend had been bringing you kindlings and firewood for your early breakfast but that didnt satisfy me so i knelt down as he had knelt and then i sawwell mr demorest i reckon i saw just what you have seen but even then i wasnt quite satisfied for that man had been grubbing round as if searching for something so i searched tooand i found it ive got it here im going to give it to you for it may some day come in handy and you wont find anything like it among the folks where youre going its something unique as those fineartcollecting sharps in frisco saysomething quite matchless unless you try to match it one day yourself dont open the paper until i run on and say so long to your partners goodby  he grasped demorests hand and then dropped the little packet into his palm and ambled away towards stacy and barker holding the packet in his hand with an amused yet puzzled smile demorest watched the gambler give stacys hand a hearty farewell shake and a supplementary slap on the back to the delighted barker and then vanish in a flash of red sash and silver buttons at which demorest walking slowly towards his partners opened the packet and stood suddenly still it contained the dried and bloodless second finger of a human hand cut off at the first joint  for an instant he held it at arms length as if about to cast it away then he grimly replaced it in the paper put it carefully in his pocket and silently walked after his companions     chapter i   a strong southwester was beating against the windows and doors of stacys bank in san francisco and spreading a film of rain between the regular splendors of its mahogany counters and sprucely dressed clerks and the usual passing pedestrian for stacys new bankinghouse had long since received the epithet of palatial from an enthusiastic local press fresh from the opening luncheon in its richly decorated directors rooms and it was said that once a homely wouldbe depositor from one horse gulch was so cowed by its magnificence that his heart failed him at the last moment and mumbling an apology to the elegant receiving teller fled with his greasy chamois pouch of golddust to deposit his treasure in the dingy mint around the corner perhaps there was something of this feeling mingled with a certain simpleminded fascination in the hesitation of a stranger of a higher class who entered the bank that rainy morning and finally tendered his card to the important negro messenger  the card preceded him through noiselessly swinging doors and across heavily carpeted passages until it reached the inner core of mr james stacys private offices and was respectfully laid before him he was not alone at his side in an attitude of polite and studied expectancy stood a correctlooking young man for whom mr stacy was evidently writing a memorandum the stranger glanced furtively at the card with a curiosity hardly in keeping with his suggested good breeding but stacy did not look at it until he had finished his memorandum  there he said with business decision you can tell your people that if we carry their new debentures over our limit we will expect a larger margin ditches are not what they were three years ago when miners were willing to waste their money over your rates they dont gamble that way any more and your company ought to know it and not gamble themselves over that prospect he handed the paper to the stranger who bowed over it with studied politeness and backed towards the door stacy took up the waiting card read it said to the messenger show him in and in the same breath turned to his guest i say van loo its george barker you know him  yes said van loo with a polite hesitation as he halted at the door he wasi thinkerin your employ at heavy tree hill  nonsense he was my partner and you must have known him since at boomville come he got forty shares of ditch stockthrough youat 110 which were worth about 80 somebody must have made money enough by it to remember him  i was only speaking of him socially said van loo with a deprecating smile you know he married a young womanthe hotelkeepers daughter who used to wait at the tableand after my mother and sister came out to keep house for me at boomville it was quite impossible for me to see much of him for he seldom went out without his wife you know  yes said stacy dryly i think you didnt like his marriage but im glad your disinclination to see him isnt on account of that deal in stocks  oh no said van loo goodby  but unfortunately in the next passage he came upon barker who with a cry of unfeigned pleasure none the less sincere that he was feeling a little alien in these impressive surroundings recognized him nothing could exceed van loos protest of delight at the meeting nothing his equal desolation at the fact that he was hastening to another engagement but your old partner he added with a smile is waiting for you he has just received your card and i should be only keeping you from him so glad to see you youre looking so well goodby goodby  reassured barker no longer hesitated but dashed with his old impetuousness into his former partners room stacy already deeply absorbed in other business was sitting with his back towards him and barkers arms were actually encircling his neck before the astonished and halfangry man looked up but when his eyes met the laughing gray ones of barker above him he gently disengaged himself with a quick return of the caress rose shut the door of an inner office and returning pushed barker into an armchair in quite the old suppressive fashion of former days yes it was the same stacy that barker looked at albeit his brown beard was now closely cropped around his determined mouth and jaw in a kind of grave decorum and his energetic limbs already attuned to the rigor of clothes of fashionable cut and still more rigorous sombreness of color  barker boy he began with the familiar twinkle in his keen eyes which the younger partner remembered i dont encourage stag dancing among my young men during bank hours and youll please to remember that we are not on heavy tree hill  where broke in barker enthusiastically we were only overlooked by the black spur range and the sierran snowline where the nearest voice that came to you was quarter of a mile away as the crow flies and nearly a mile by the trail  and was generally an oath said stacy but youre in san francisco now where are you stopping he took up a pencil and held it over a memorandum pad awaitingly  at the brook house its  hold on brook house stacy repeated as he jotted it down and for how long  oh a day or two you see kitty  stacy checked him with a movement of his pencil in the air and then wrote down day or two wife with you  yes and oh stacy our boy ah he went on with a laugh knocking aside the remonstrating pencil you must listen hes just the sweetest knowingest little chap living do you know what were going to christen him well hell be stacy demorest barker good names arent they and then it perpetuates the dear old friendship  stacy picked up the pencil again wrote wife and child s d b and leaned back in his chair now barker he said briefly im coming to dine with you tonight at 730 sharp then well talk heavy tree hill wife baby and s d b but here im all for business have you any with me  barker who was easily amused had extracted a certain entertainment out of stacys memorandum but he straightened himself with a look of eager confidence and said certainly thats just what it isbusiness lord stacy im all business now im in everything and i bank with you though perhaps you dont know it its in your branch at marysville i didnt want to say anything about it to you before but lord you dont suppose that id bank anywhere else while you are in the businesschecks dividends and all that but in this matter i felt you knew old chap i didnt want to talk to a banker nor to a bank but to jim stacy my old partner  barker said stacy curtly how much money are you short of  at this direct question barkers always quick color rose but with an equally quick smile he said i dont know yet that im short at all  but i do  look here jim why im just overloaded with shares and stocks said barker smiling  not one of which you could realize on without sacrifice barker three years ago you had three hundred thousand dollars put to your account at san francisco  yes said barker with a quiet reminiscent laugh i remember i wanted to draw it out in one check to see how it would look  and youve drawn out all in three years and it looks dd bad  how did you know it asked barker his face beaming only with admiration of his companions omniscience  how did i know it retorted stacy i know you and i know the kind of people who have unloaded to you  come stacy said barker ive only invested in shares and stocks like everybody else and then only on the best advice i could get like van loos for instancethat man who was here just now the new manager of the empire ditch company and carters my own kittys father and when i was offered fifty thousand wide west extensions and was hesitating over it he told me you were in it tooand that was enough for me to buy it  yes but we didnt go into it at his figures  no said barker with an eager smile but you sold at his figures for i knew that when i found that you my old partner was in it dont you see i preferred to buy it through your bank and did at 110 of course you wouldnt have sold it at that figure if it wasnt worth it then and neither i nor you are to blame if it dropped the next week to 60 dont you see  stacys eyes hardened for a moment as he looked keenly into his former partners bright gray ones but there was no trace of irony in barkers on the contrary a slight shade of sadness came over them no he said reflectively i dont think ive ever been foolish or followed out my own ideas except once and that was extravagant i admit that was my idea of building a kind of refuge you know on the site of our old cabin where poor miners and playedout prospectors waiting for a strike could stay without paying anything well i sunk twenty thousand dollars in that and might have lost more only carterkittys fatherpersuaded mehes an awful clever old fellowinto turning it into a kind of branch hotel of boomville while using it as a hotel to take poor chaps who couldnt pay at half prices or quarter prices privately dont you see so as to spare their prideawfully pretty wasnt itand make the hotel profit by it  well said stacy as barker paused  they didnt come said barker  but he added eagerly it shows that things were better than i had imagined only the others did not come either  and you lost your twenty thousand dollars said stacy curtly  fifty thousand said barker for of course it had to be a larger hotel than the other and i think that carter wouldnt have gone into it except to save me from losing money  and yet made you lose fifty thousand instead of twenty for i dont suppose he advanced anything  he gave his time and experience said barker simply  i dont think it worth thirty thousand dollars said stacy dryly but all this doesnt tell me what your business is with me today  no said barker brightening up but it is business you know something in the old styleas between partner and partnerand thats why i came to you and not to the banker and it all comes out of something that demorest once told us so you see its all us three again well you know of course that the excelsior ditch company have abandoned the bar and heavy tree hill it didnt pay  yes nor does the company pay any dividends now you ought to know with fifty thousand of their stock on your hands  barker laughed but listen i found that i could buy up their whole plant and all the ditching along the black spur range for ten thousand dollars  and great scott you dont think of taking up their business said stacy aghast  barker laughed more heartily no not their business but i remember that once demorest told us in the dear old days that it cost nearly as much to make a water ditch as a railroad in the way of surveying and engineering and levels you know and heres the plant for a railroad dont you see  but a railroad from black spur to heavy tree hillwhats the good of that  why black spur will be in the line of the new divide railroad theyre trying to get a bill for in the legislature  an infamous piece of wildcat jobbing that will never pass said stacy decisively  they said because it was that it would pass said barker simply they say that watsons bank is in it and is bound to get it through and as that is a rival bank of yours dont you see i thought that if we could get something real good or valuable out of itsomething that would do the black spur goodit would be all right  and was your business to consult me about it said stacy bluntly  no said barker its too late to consult you now though i wish i had ive given my word to take it and i cant back out but i havent the ten thousand dollars and i came to you  stacy slowly settled himself back in his chair and put both hands in his pockets not a cent barker not a cent  im not asking it of the bank said barker with a smile for i could have gone to the bank for it but as this was something between us i am asking you stacy as my old partner  and i am answering you barker as your old partner but also as the partner of a hundred other men who have even a greater right to ask me and my answer is not a cent  barker looked at him with a pale astonished face and slightly parted lips stacy rose thrust his hands deeper in his pockets and standing before him went on  now look here its time you should understand me and yourself three years ago when our partnership was dissolved by accident or mutual consent we will say we started afresh each on our own hook through foolishness and bad advice you have in those three years hopelessly involved yourself as you never would have done had we been partners and yet in your difficulty you ask me and my new partners to help you out of a difficulty in which they have no concern  your new partners stammered barker  yes my new partners for every man who has a share or a deposit or an interest or a dollar in this bank is my partnereven you with your securities at the branch are one and you may say that in this i am protecting you against yourself  but you have moneyyou have private means  none to speculate with as you wish me toon account of my position none to give away foolishly as you expect me toon account of precedent and example i am a soulless machine taking care of capital intrusted to me and my brains but decidedly not to my heart nor my sentiment so my answer is not a cent  barkers face had changed his color had come back but with an older expression presently however his beaming smile returned with the additional suggestion of an affectionate toleration which puzzled stacy  i believe youre right old chap he said extending his hand to the banker and i wish i had talked to you before but its too late now and ive given my word  your word said stacy have you no written agreement  no my word was accepted he blushed slightly as if conscious of a great weakness  but that isnt legal nor business and you couldnt even hold the ditch company to it if they chose to back out  but i dont think they will said barker simply and you see my word wasnt given entirely to them i bought the thing through my wifes cousin henry spring a broker and he makes something by it from the company on commission and i cant go back on him what did you say  stacy had only groaned through his set teeth nothing he said briefly except that im coming as i said before to dine with you tonight but no more business ive enough of that with others and there are some waiting for me in the outer office now  barker rose at once but with the same affectionate smile and tender gravity of countenance and laid his hand caressingly on stacys shoulder its like you to give up so much of your time to me and my foolishness and be so frank with me and i know its mighty rough on you to have to be a mere machine instead of jim stacy dont you bother about me ill sell some of my wide west extension and pull the thing through myself its all right but im sorry for you old chap he glanced around the room at the walls and rich paneling and added i suppose thats what you have to pay for all this sort of thing  before stacy could reply a waiting visitor was announced for the second time and barker with another handshake and a reassuring smile to his old partner passed into the hall as if the onus of any infelicity in the interview was upon himself alone but stacy did not seem to be in a particularly accessible mood to the new caller who in his turn appeared to be slightly irritated by having been kept waiting over some irksome business you dont seem to follow me he said to stacy after reciting his business perplexity cant you suggest something  well why dont you get hold of one of your board of directors said stacy abstractedly theres captain drummond you and he are old friends you were comrades in the mexican war werent you  that be dd said his visitor bitterly all his interests are the other way and in a trade of this kind you know stacy that a man would sacrifice his own brother do you suppose that hed let up on a sure thing that hes got just because he and i fought side by side at cerro gordo come what are you giving us youre the last man i ever expected to hear that kind of flapdoodle from if its because your bank has got some other interest and you cant advise me why dont you say so nevertheless in spite of stacys abrupt disclaimer he left a few minutes later half convinced that stacys lukewarmness was due to some adverse influence other callers were almost as quickly disposed of and at the end of an hour stacy found himself again alone  but not apparently in a very satisfied mood after a few moments of purely mechanical memorandamaking he rose abruptly and opened a small drawer in a cabinet from which he took a letter still in its envelope it bore a foreign postmark glancing over it hastily his eyes at last became fixed on a concluding paragraph i hope wrote his correspondent that even in the rush of your big business you will sometimes look after barker not that i think the dear old chap will ever go wrongindeed i often wish i was as certain of myself as of him and his insight but i am afraid we were more inclined to be merely amused and tolerant of his wonderful trust and simplicity than to really understand it for his own good and ours i know you did not like his marriage and were inclined to believe he was the victim of a rather unscrupulous father and a foolish unequal girl but are you satisfied that he would have been the happier without it or lived his perfect life under other and what you may think wiser conditions if he wrote the poetry that he lives everybody would think him wonderful for being what he is we never give him sufficient credit stacy smiled grimly and penciled on his memorandum he wants it to the amount of ten thousand dollars anyhow continued the writer look after him jim for his sake your sake and the sake ofphil demorest  stacy put the letter back in its envelope and tossing it grimly aside went on with his calculations presently he stopped restored the letter to his cabinet and rang a bell on his table send mr north here he said to the negro messenger in a few moments his chief bookkeeper appeared in the doorway  turn to the branch ledger and bring me a statement of mr george barkers account  he was here a moment ago said north essaying a confidential look towards his chief  i know it said stacy coolly without looking up  hes been running a good deal on wildcat lately suggested north  i asked for his account and not your opinion of it said stacy shortly  the subordinate withdrew somewhat abashed but still curious and returned presently with a ledger which he laid before his chief stacy ran his eyes over the list of barkers securities it seemed to him that all the wildest schemes of the past year stared him in the face his finger however stopped on the wide west extension mr barker will be wanting to sell some of this stock what is it quoted at now  sixty  but i would prefer that mr barker should not offer in the open market at present give him seventy for itprivate sale that will be ten thousand dollars paid to his credit advise the branch of this at once and to keep the transaction quiet  yes sir responded the clerk as he moved towards the door but he hesitated and with another essay at confidence said insinuatingly i always thought sir that wide west would recover  stacy perhaps not displeased to find what had evidently passed in his subordinates mind looked at him and said dryly then i would advise you also to keep that opinion to yourself but clever as he was he had not anticipated the result mr north though a trusted employee was human on arriving in the outer office he beckoned to one of the lounging brokers and in a low voice said ill take two shares of wide west if you can get it cheap  the brokers face became alert and eager yes but i say is anything up  im not here to give the business of the bank away retorted north severely take the order or leave it  the man hurried away having thus vindicated his humanity by also passing the snub he had received from stacy to an inferior he turned away to carry out his masters instructions yet secure in the belief that he had profited by his superior discernment of the real reason of that masters singular conduct but when he returned to the private room in hopes of further revelations mr stacy was closeted with another financial magnate and had apparently divested his mind of the whole affair     chapter ii   when george barker returned to the outer ward of the financial stronghold he had penetrated with its curving sweep of counters brass railings and wirework screens defended by the spruce clerks behind them he was again impressed with the position of the man he had just quitted and for a moment hesitated with an inclination to go back it was with no idea of making a further appeal to his old comrade butwhat would have been odd in any other nature but hishe was affected by a sense that he might have been unfair and selfish in his manner to the man panoplied by these defenses and who was in a measure forced to be a part of them he would like to have returned and condoled with him the clerks who were heartlessly familiar with the anxious bearing of the men who sought interviews with their chief both before and after smiled with the whispered conviction that the fresh and ingenuous young stranger had been chucked like others until they met his kindly tolerant and even superior eyes and were puzzled meanwhile barker who had that sublime natural quality of abstraction over small impertinences which is more exasperating than studied indifference after his brief hesitation passed out unconcernedly through the swinging mahogany doors into the blowy street here the wind and rain revived him the bank and its curt refusal were forgotten he walked onward with only a smiling memory of his partner as in the old days he remembered how stacy had burned down their old cabin rather than have it fall into sordid or unworthy handsthis stacy who was now condemned to sink his impulses and become a mere machine he had never known stacys real motive for that actboth demorest and stacy had kept their knowledge of the attempted robbery from their younger partnerit always seemed to him to be a precious revelation of stacys inner nature facing the wind and rain he recalled how stacy though never so enthusiastic about his marriage as demorest had taken up van loo sharply for some foolish sneer about his own youthfulness he was affectionately tolerant of even stacys dislike to his wifes relations for stacy did not know them as he did indeed barker whose own father and mother had died in his infancy had accepted his wifes relations with a loving trust and confidence that was supreme from the fact that he had never known any other  at last he reached his hotel it was a new one the latest creation of a feverish progress in hotelbuilding which had covered five years and as many squares with large showy erections utterly beyond the needs of the community yet each superior in size and adornment to its predecessor it struck him as being the one evidence of an abiding faith in the future of the metropolis that he had seen in nothing else as he entered its frescoed hall that afternoon he was suddenly reminded by its challenging opulency of the bank he had just quitted without knowing that the bank had really furnished its capital and its original design the gilded barrooms flashing with mirrors and cut glass the saloons with their desert expanse of turkey carpet and oasis of clustered divans and gilded tables the great diningroom with porphyry columns and walls and ceilings shining with allegoryall these things which had attracted his youthful wonder without distracting his correct simplicity of taste he now began to comprehend it was the banks money at work in the clatter of dishes in the diningroom he even seemed to hear again the chinking of coin  it was a short cut to his apartments to pass through a smaller public sittingroom popularly known as flirtation camp where eight or ten couples generally found refuge on chairs and settees by the windows half concealed by heavy curtains but the occupants were by no means youthful spinsters or bachelors they were generally married women guests of the hotel receiving other peoples husbands whose wives were in the states or responsible middleaged leaders of the town in the elaborate toilettes of the women as compared with the less formal business suits of the men there was an odd mingling of the social attitude with perhaps more mysterious confidences the idle gossip about them had never affected barker rather he had that innate respect for the secrets of others which is as inseparable from simplicity as it is from high breeding and he scarcely glanced at the different couples in his progress through the room he did not even notice a rather striking and handsome woman who surrounded by two or three admirers yet looked up at barker as he passed with selfconscious lids as if seeking a return of her glance but he moved on abstractedly and only stopped when he suddenly saw the familiar skirt of his wife at a further window and halted before it  oh its you said mrs barker with a halfnervous halfimpatient laugh why i thought youd certainly stay half the afternoon with your old partner considering that you havent met for three years  there was no doubt she had thought so there was equally no doubt that the conversation she was carrying on with her companiona goodlooking portly business manwas effectually interrupted but barker did not notice it captain heath my husband she went on carelessly rising and smoothing her skirts the captain who had risen too bowed vaguely at the introduction but barker extended his hand frankly i found stacy busy he said in answer to his wife but he is coming to dine with us tonight  if you mean jim stacy the banker said captain heath brightening into greater ease hes the busiest man in california ive seen men standing in a queue outside his door as in the old days at the postoffice and he only gives you five minutes and no extension so you and he were partners once he said looking curiously at the still youthful barker  but it was mrs barker who answered oh yes and always such good friends i was awfully jealous of him nevertheless she did not respond to the affectionate protest in barkers eyes nor to the laugh of captain heath but glanced indifferently around the room as if to leave further conversation to the two men it was possible that she was beginning to feel that captain heath was as de trop now as her husband had been a moment before standing there however between them both idly tracing a pattern on the carpet with the toe of her slipper she looked prettier than she had ever looked as kitty carter her slight figure was more fully developed that artificial severity covering a natural virgin coyness with which she used to wait at table in her fathers hotel at boomville had gone and was replaced by a satisfied consciousness of her power to please her glance was freer but not as frank as in those days her dress was undoubtedly richer and more stylish yet barkers loyal heart often reverted fondly to the chintz gown coquettishly frilled apron and spotless cuffs and collar in which she had handed him his coffee with a faint color that left his own face crimson  captain heaths tact being equal to her indifference he had excused himself although he was becoming interested in this youthful husband but mrs barker after having asserted her husbands distinction as the equal friend of the millionaire was by no means willing that the captain should be further interested in barker for himself alone and did not urge him to stay as he departed she turned to her husband and indicating the group he had passed the moment before said  that horrid woman has been staring at us all the time i dont see what you see in her to admire  poor barkers admiration had been limited to a few words of civility in the enforced contact of that huge caravansary and in his quiet youthful recognition of her striking personality but he was just then too preoccupied with his interview with stacy to reply and perhaps he did not quite understand his wife it was odd how many things he did not quite understand now about kitty but that he knew must be his fault but mrs barker apparently did not require after the fashion of her sex a reply for the next moment as they moved towards their rooms she said impatiently well you dont tell what stacy said did you get the money  i grieve to say that this soul of truth and frankness liedonly to his wife perhaps he considered it only lying to himself a thing of which he was at times miserably conscious it wasnt necessary dear he said he advised me to sell my securities in the bank and if you only knew how dreadfully busy he is  mrs barker curled her pretty lip it doesnt take very long to lend ten thousand dollars she said but thats what i always tell you you have about made me sick by singing the praises of those wonderful partners of yours and here you ask a favor of one of them and he tells you to sell your securities and you know and he knows theyre worth next to nothing  you dont understand dearbegan barker  i understand that youve given your word to poor harry said mrs barker in pretty indignation whos responsible for the ditch purchase  and i shall keep it i always do said barker very quietly but with that same singular expression of face that had puzzled stacy but mrs barker who perhaps knew her husband better said in an altered voice  but how can you dear  if im short a thousand or two ill ask your father  mrs barker was silent fathers so very much harried now george why dont you simply throw the whole thing up  but ive given my word to your cousin henry  yes but only your word there was no written agreement and you couldnt even hold him to it  barker opened his frank eyes in astonishment her own cousin too and they were stacys very words  besides added mrs barker audaciously he could get rid of it elsewhere he had another offer but he thought yours the best so dont be silly  by this time they had reached their rooms barker apparently dismissing the subject from his mind with characteristic buoyancy turned into the bedroom and walked smilingly towards a small crib which stood in the corner why hes gone he said in some dismay  well said mrs barker a little impatiently you didnt expect me to take him into the public parlor where i was seeing visitors did you i sent him out with the nurse into the lower hall to play with the other children  a shade momentarily passed over barkers face he always looked forward to meeting the child when he came back he had a belief based on no grounds whatever that the little creature understood him and he had a fathers doubt of the wholesomeness of other peoples children who were born into the world indiscriminately and not under the exceptional conditions of his own ill go and fetch him he said  you havent told me anything about your interview what you did and what your good friend stacy said said mrs barker dropping languidly into a chair and really if you are simply running away again after that child i might just as well have asked captain heath to stay longer  oh as to stacy said barker dropping beside her and taking her hand well dear he was awfully busy you know and shut up in the innermost office like the agate in one of the japanese nests of boxes but he continued brightening up just the same dear old jim stacy of heavy tree hill when i first knew you lord dear how it all came back to me that day i proposed to you in the belief that i was unexpectedly rich and even bought a claim for the boys on the strength of it and how i came back to them to find that they had made a big strike on the very claim lord i remember how i was so afraid to tell them about youand how they guessed itthat dear old stacy one of the first  yes said mrs barker and i hope your friend stacy remembered that but for me when you found out that you were not rich youd have given up the claim but that i really deceived my own father to make you keep it ive often worried over that george she said pensively turning a diamond bracelet around her pretty wrist although i never said anything about it  but kitty darling said barker grasping his wifes hand i gave my note for it you know you said that was bargain enough and i had better wait until the note was due and until i found i couldnt pay before i gave up the claim it was very clever of you and the boys all said so too but you never deceived your father dear he said looking at her gravely for i should have told him everything  of course if you look at it in that way said his wife languidly its nothing only i think it ought to be remembered when people go about saying papa ruined you with his hotel schemes  who dares say that said barker indignantly  well if they dont say it they look it said mrs barker with a toss of her pretty head and i believe thats at the bottom of stacys refusal  but he never said a word kitty said barker flushing  there dont excite yourself george said mrs barker resignedly but go for the baby i know youre dying to go and i suppose its time norah brought it upstairs  at any other time barker would have lingered with explanations but just then a deeper sense than usual of some misunderstanding made him anxious to shorten this domestic colloquy he rose pressed his wifes hand and went out but yet he was not entirely satisfied with himself for leaving her i suppose it isnt right my going off as soon as i come in he murmured reproachfully to himself but i think she wants the baby back as much as i only womanlike she didnt care to let me know it  he reached the lower hall which he knew was a favorite promenade for the nurses who were gathered at the farther end where a large window looked upon montgomery street but norah the irish nurse was not among them he passed through several corridors in his search but in vain at last worried and a little anxious he turned to regain his rooms through the long saloon where he had found his wife previously it was deserted now the last caller had lefteven frivolity had its prescribed limits he was consequently startled by a gentle murmur from one of the heavily curtained window recesses it was a womans voicelow sweet caressing and filled with an almost pathetic tenderness and it was followed by a distinct gurgling satisfied crow  barker turned instantly in that direction a step brought him to the curtain where a singular spectacle presented itself  seated on a lounge completely absorbed and possessed by her treasure was the horrid woman whom his wife had indicated only a little while ago holding a babykittys sacred babyin her wanton lap the child was feebly grasping the end of the slender jeweled necklace which the woman held temptingly dangling from a thin white jeweled finger above it but its eyes were beaming with an intense delight as if trying to respond to the deep concentrated love in the handsome face that was bent above it  at the sudden intrusion of barker she looked up there was a faint rise in her color but no loss of sellpossession  please dont scold the nurse she said nor say anything to mrs barker it is all my fault i thought that both the nurse and child looked dreadfully bored with each other and i borrowed the little fellow for a while to try and amuse him at least i havent made him cry have i dear the last epithet it is needless to say was addressed to the little creature in her lap but in its tender modulation it touched the fathers quick sympathies as if he had shared it with the child you see she said softly disengaging the baby fingers from her necklace that our sex is not the only one tempted by jewelry and glitter  barker hesitated the madonnalike devotion of a moment ago was gone it was only the woman of the world who laughingly looked up at him nevertheless he was touched have youeverhad a child mrs horncastle he asked gently and hesitatingly he had a vague recollection that she passed for a widow and in his simple eyes all women were virgins or married saints  no she said abruptly then she added with a laugh or perhaps i should not admire them so much i suppose its the same feeling bachelors have for other peoples wives but i know youre dying to take that boy from me take him then and dont be ashamed to carry him yourself just because im here you know you would delight to do it if i werent  barker bent over the silken lap in which the child was comfortably nestling and in that attitude had a faint consciousness that mrs horncastle was mischievously breathing into his curls a silent laugh barker lifted his firstborn with proud skillfulness but that sagacious infant evidently knew when he was comfortable and in a paroxysm of objection caught his fathers curls with one fist while with the other he grasped mrs horncastles brown braids and brought their heads into contact upon which humorous situation norah the nurse entered  its all right norah said mrs horncastle laughing as she disengaged herself from the linking child mr barker has claimed the baby and has agreed to forgive you and me and say nothing to mrs barker norah with the inscrutable criticism of her sex on her sex thought it extremely probable and halted with exasperating discretion there continued mrs horncastle playfully evading the childs further advances go with papa thats a dear mr barker prefers to carry him back norah  but said the ingenuous and persistent barker still lingering in hopes of recalling the womans previous expression you do love children and you think him a bright little chap for his age  yes said mrs horncastle putting back her loosened braid so round and fat and soft and such a discriminating eye for jewelry really you ought to get a necklace like mine for mrs barkerit would please both you know she moved slowly away the united efforts of norah and barker scarcely sufficing to restrain the struggling child from leaping after her as she turned at the door and blew him a kiss  when barker regained his room he found that mrs barker had dismissed stacy from her mind except so far as to invoke norahs aid in laying out her smartest gown for dinner but why take all this trouble dear said her simpleminded husband we are going to dine in a private room so that we can talk over old times all by ourselves and any dress would suit him and lord dear he added with a quick brightening at the fancy if you could only just rig yourself up in that pretty lilac gown you used to wear at boomvilleit would be too killing and just like old times i put it away myself in one of our trunksi couldnt bear to leave it behind i know just where it is illbut mrs barkers restraining scorn withheld him  george barker if you think i am going to let you throw away and utterly waste mr stacy on us alone in a private room with closed doorsand i dare say youd like to sit in your dressinggown and slippersyou are entirely mistaken i know what is due not to your old partner but to the great mr stacy the financier and i know what is due from him to us no we dine in the great diningroom publicly and if possible at the very next table to those stuckup peterburys and their eastern friends including that horrid woman which im sure ought to satisfy you then you can talk as much as you like and as loud as you like about old timesand the louder and the more the betterbut i dont think hell like it  but the baby expostulated barker stacys just wild to see himand we cant bring him down to the tablethough we might he added momentarily brightening  after dinner said mrs barker severely we will walk through the big drawingrooms and then mr stacy may come upstairs and see him in his crib but not before and now george i do wish that tonight for once you would not wear a turndown collar and that you would go to the barbers and have him cut your hair and smooth out the curls and for heavens sake let him put some wax or gum or something on your mustache and twist it up on your cheek like captain heaths for it positively droops over your mouth like a girls ringlet its quite enough for me to hear people talk of your inexperience but really i dont want you to look as if i had run away with a pretty schoolboy and considering the size of that child its positively disgraceful and one thing more george when im talking to anybody please dont sit opposite to me beaming with delight and your mouth open and dont roar if by chance i say something funny andwhatever you dodont make eyes at me in company whenever i happen to allude to you as i did before captain heath it is positively too ridiculous  nothing could exceed the laughing good humor with which her husband received these cautions nor the evident sincerity with which he promised amendment equally sincere was he though a little more thoughtful in his severe selfexamination of his deficiencies when later he seated himself at the window with one hand softly encompassing his childs chubby fist in the crib beside him and in the instinctive fashion of all loneliness looked out of the window the southern trades were whipping the waves of the distant bay and harbor into yeasty crests sheets of rain swept the sidewalks with the regularity of a fusillade against which a few pedestrians struggled with flapping waterproofs and slanting umbrellas he could look along the deserted length of montgomery street to the heights of telegraph hill and its longdisused semaphore it seemed lonelier to him than the milelong sweep of heavy tree hill writhing against the mountain wind and its aeolian song he had never felt so lonely there in his rigid selfexamination he thought kitty right in protesting against the effect of his youthfulness and optimism yet he was also right in being himself there is an egoism in the highest simplicity and barker while willing to believe in others methods never abandoned his own aims he was right in loving kitty as he did he knew that she was better and more lovable than she could believe herself to be but he was willing to believe it pained and discomposed her if he showed it before company he would not have her change even this peculiarityit was part of herselfno more than he would have changed himself and behind what he had conceived was her clear practical common sense all this time had been her belief that she had deceived her father poor dear dear kitty and she had suffered because stupid people had conceived that her father had led him away in selfish speculations as if hebarkerwould not have first discovered it and as if anybodyeven dear kitty herselfwas responsible for his convictions and actions but himself nevertheless this gentle egotist was unusually serious and when the child awoke at last and with a fretful start and vacant eyes pushed his caressing hand away he felt lonelier than before it was with a slight sense of humiliation too that he saw it stretch its hands to the mere hireling norah who had never given it the love that he had seen even in the frivolous mrs horncastles eyes later when his wife came in looking very pretty in her elaborate dinner toilette he had the same conflicting emotions he knew that they had already passed that phase of their married life when she no longer dressed to please him and that the dictates of fashion or the rivalry of another woman she held superior to his tastes yet he did not blame her but he was a little surprised to see that her dress was copied from one of mrs horncastles most striking ones and that it did not suit her that which adorned the maturer woman did not agree with the demure and slightly austere prettiness of the young wife  but barker forgot all this when stacyreserved and somewhat severelooking in evening dressarrived with business punctuality he fancied that his old partner received the announcement that they would dine in the public room with something of surprise and he saw him glance keenly at kitty in her fine array as if he had suspected it was her choice and understood her motives indeed the young husband had found himself somewhat nervous in regard to stacys estimate of kitty he was conscious that she was not looking and acting like the old kitty that stacy had known it did not enter his honest heart that stacy had perhaps not appreciated her then and that her present quality might accord more with his worldly tastes and experience it was therefore with a kind of timid delight that he saw stacy apparently enter into her mood and with a still more timorous amusement to notice that he seemed to sympathize not only with her but with her halfrallying halfserious attitude towards his barkers inexperience and simplicity he was glad that she had made a friend of stacy even in this way stacy would understand as he did her pretty willfulness at last she would understand what a true friend stacy was to him it was with unfeigned satisfaction that he followed them in to dinner as she leaned upon his guests arm chatting confidentially he was only uneasy because her manner had a slight ostentation  the entrance of the little party produced a quick sensation throughout the diningroom whispers passed from table to table all heads were turned towards the great financier as towards a magnet a few guests even shamelessly faced round in their chairs as he passed mrs barker was pink pretty and voluble with excitement stacy had a slight mask of reserve barker was the only one natural and unconscious  as the dinner progressed barker found that there was little chance for him to invoke his old partners memories of the past he found however that stacy had received a letter from demorest and that he was coming home from europe his letters were still sad they both agreed upon that and then for the first time that day stacy looked intently at barker with the look that he had often worn on heavy tree hill  then you think it is the same old trouble that worries him said barker in an awed and sympathetic voice  i believe it is said stacy with an equal feeling mrs barker pricked up her pretty ears her husbands ready sympathy was familiar enough but that this cold practical stacy should be moved at anything piqued her curiosity  and you believe that he has never got over it continued barker  he had one chance but he threw it away said stacy energetically if instead of going off to europe by himself to brood over it he had joined me in business hed have been another man  but not demorest said barker quickly  what dreadful secret is this about demorest said mrs barker petulantly is he ill  both men were silent by their old common instinct but it was stacy who said no in a way that put any further questioning at an end and barker was grateful and for the moment disloyal to his kitty  it was with delight that mrs barker had seen that the attention of the next table was directed to them and that even mrs horncastle had glanced from time to time at stacy but she was not prepared for the evident equal effect that mrs horncastle had created upon stacy his cold face warmed his critical eye softened he asked her name mrs barker was voluble prejudiced and it seemed misinformed  i know it all said stacy with didactic emphasis her husband was as bad as they make them when her life had become intolerable with him he tried to make it shameful without him by abandoning her she could get a divorce a dozen times over but she wont  i suppose thats what makes her so very attractive to gentlemen said mrs barker ironically  i have never seen her before continued stacy with business precision although i and two other men are guardians of her property and have saved it from the clutches of her husband they told me she was handsomeand so she is  pleased with the sudden human weakness of stacy barker glanced at his wife for sympathy but she was looking studiously another way and the young husbands eyes still full of his gratification fell upon mrs horncastles she looked away with a bright color whereupon the sanguine barkerperfectly convinced that she returned stacys admirationwas seized with one of his old boyish dreams of the future and saw stacy happily united to her and was only recalled to the dinner before him by its end then stacy duly promenaded the great saloon with mrs barker on his arm visited the baby in her apartments and took an easy leave but he grasped barkers hand before parting in quite his old fashion and said come to lunch with me at the bank any day and well talk of phil demorest and left barker as happy as if the appointment were to confer the favor he had that morning refused but mrs barker who had overheard was more dubious  you dont suppose he asks you to talk with you about demorest and his stupid secret do you she said scornfully  perhaps not only about that said barker glad that she had not demanded the secret  well returned mrs barker as she turned away he might just as well lunch here and talk about herand see her too  meantime stacy had dropped into his club only a few squares distant his appearance created the same interest that it had produced at the hotel but with less reserve among his fellow members  have you heard the news said a dozen voices stacy had not he had been dining out  that infernal swindle of a divide railroad has passed the legislature  stacy instantly remembered barkers absurd belief in it and his reasons he smiled and said carelessly are you quite sure its a swindle  there was a dead silence at the coolness of the man who had been most outspoken against it  but said a voice hesitatingly you know it goes nowhere and to no purpose  but that does not prevent it now that its a fact from going anywhere and to some purpose said stacy turning away he passed into the readingroom quietly but in an instant turned and quickly descended by another staircase into the hall hurriedly put on his overcoat and slipping out was a moment later reentering the hotel here he hastily summoned barker who came down flushed and excited laying his hand on barkers arm in his old dominant way he said  dont delay a single hour but get a written agreement for that ditch property  barker smiled but i have got it this afternoon  then you know ejaculated stacy in surprise  i only know said barker coloring that you said i could back out of it if it wasnt signed and thats what kitty said too and i thought it looked awfully mean for me to hold a man to that kind of a bargain and soyou wont be mad old fellow will youi thought id put it beyond any question of my own good faith by having it in black and white he stopped laughing and blushing but still earnest and sincere you dont think me a fool do you he said pathetically  stacy smiled grimly i think barker boy that if you go to the branch youll have no difficulty in paying for the ditch property goodnight  in a few moments he was back at the club again before any one knew he had even left the building as he again reentered the smokingroom he found the members still in eager discussion about the new railroad one was saying if they could get an extension and carry the road through heavy tree hill to boomville theyd be all right  i quite agree with you said stacy     chapter iii   the swaying creaking boomville coach had at last reached the level ridge and sank forward upon its springs with a sigh of relief and the slow precipitation of the red dust which had hung in clouds around it the whole coach inside and out was covered with this impalpable powder it had poured into the windows that gaped widely in the insufferable heat it lay thick upon the novel read by the passenger who had for the third or fourth time during the ascent made a gutter of the halfopened book and blown the dust away in a single puff like the smoke from a pistol it lay in folds and creases over the yellow silk duster of the handsome woman on the back seat and when she endeavored to shake it off enveloped her in a reddish nimbus it grimed the handkerchiefs of others and left sanguinary streaks on their mopped foreheads but as the coach had slowly climbed the summit the sun was also sinking behind the black spur range and with its ultimate disappearance a delicious coolness spread itself like a wave across the ridge the passengers drew a long breath the reader closed his book the lady lifted the edge of her veil and delicately wiped her forehead over which a few damp tendrils of hair were clinging even a distinguishedlooking man who had sat as impenetrable and remote as a statue in one of the front seats moved and turned his abstracted face to the window his deeply tanned cheek and clearly cut features harmonized with the red dust that lay in the curves of his brown linen dustcloak and completed his resemblance to a bronze figure yet it was demorest changed only in coloring now as five years ago his abstraction had a certain quality which the most familiar stranger shrank from disturbing but in the general relaxation of relief the novelreader addressed him  well we aint far from boomville now and its all downgrade the rest of the way i reckon youll be as glad to get a wash up and a shake as the rest of us  i am afraid i wont have so early an opportunity said demorest with a faint grave smile for i get off at the crossroad to heavy tree hill  heavy tree hill repeated the other in surprise you aint goin to heavy tree hill why you might have gone there direct by railroad and have been there four hours ago you know theres a branch from the divide railroad goes there straight to the hotel at hymettus  where said demorest with a puzzled smile  hymettus thats the fancy name theyve given to the wateringplace on the slope but i reckon youre a stranger here  for five years said demorest i fancy ive heard of the railroad although i prefer to go to heavy tree this way but i never heard of a wateringplace there before  why its the biggest boom of the year folks that are tired of the fogs of frisco and the heat of sacramento all go there its four thousand feet up with a hotel like saratoga dancing and a band plays every night and it all sprang out of the divide railroad and a crank named george barker who bought up some old ditch property and ran a branch line along its levels and made a junction with the divide you can come all the way from frisco or sacramento by rail its a mighty big thing  yet said demorest with some animation you call the man who originated this success a crank i should say he was a genius  the other passenger shook his head all sheer nigger luck he bought the ditch plant afore there was a ghost of a chance for the divide railroad just out o pure dd foolishness he expected so little from it that he hadnt even got the agreement done in writin and hadnt paid for it when the divide railroad passed the legislature as it never oughter done for you see the blamedest curous thing about the whole affair was that this straw road of a divide all pure wildcat was only gotten up to frighten the pacific railroad sharps into buying it up and the road that nobody ever calculated would ever have a rail of it laid was pushed on as soon as folks knew that the ditch plant had been bought up for they thought there was a big thing behind it even the hotel was at first simply a kind of genteel almshouse that this yer barker had built for brokendown miners  nevertheless continued demorest smiling you admit that it is a great success  yes said the other a little irritated by some complacency in demorests smile but the success isnt hisn fools has ideas and wise men profit by them for that hotel now has jim stacys bank behind it and is even a kind of country branch of the brook house in frisco barkers out of it i reckon anyhow he couldnt run a hotel for all that his wifeshe thats one of the big frisco swells nowused to help serve in her fathers no sir its just a fools luck gettin the first taste and leavin the rest to others  im not sure that its the worst kind of luck returned demorest with persistent gravity and i suppose hes satisfied with it but so heterodox an opinion only irritated his antagonist the more especially as he noticed that the handsome woman in the back seat appeared to be interested in the conversation and even sympathetic with demorest the man was in the main a goodnatured fellow and loyal to his friends but this did not preclude any virulent criticism of others and for a moment he hated this bronzefaced stranger and even saw blemishes in the handsome womans beauty that may be your idea of an eastern man he said bluntly but i kin tell ye that californy aint run on those lines no sir nevertheless his curiosity got the better of his ill humor and as the coach at last pulled up at the crossroad for demorest to descend he smiled affably at his departing companion  you allowed just now that youd bin five years away whar mout ye have bin  in europe said demorest pleasantly  i reckoned ez much returned his interrogator smiling significantly at the other passengers but in what place  oh many said demorest smiling also  but what place war ye last livin at  well said demorest descending the steps but lingering for a moment with his hand on the door of the coach oddly enough now you remind me of itat hymettus  he closed the door and the coach rolled on the passenger reddened glanced indignantly after the departing figure of demorest and suspiciously at the others the lady was looking from the window with a faint smile on her face  he might hev given me a civil answer muttered the passenger and resumed his novel  when the coach drew up before carters hotel the lady got down and the curiosity of her susceptible companions was gratified to the extent of learning from the register that her name was horncastle  she was shown to a private sittingroom which chanced to be the one which had belonged to mrs barker in the days of her maidenhood and was the sacred impenetrable bower to which she retired when her daily duties of waiting upon her fathers guests were over but the breath of custom had passed through it since then and but little remained of its former maiden glories except a few schoolgirl crayon drawings on the wall and an unrecognizable portrait of herself in oil done by a wandering artist and still preserved as a receipt for his unpaid bill of these facts mrs horncastle knew nothing she was evidently preoccupied and after she had removed her outer duster and entered the room she glanced at the clock on the mantelshelf and threw herself with an air of resigned abstraction in an armchair in the corner her travelingdress although unostentatious was tasteful and wellfitting a slight pallor from her fatiguing journey and perhaps from some absorbing thought made her beauty still more striking she gave even an air of elegance to the faded worn adornments of the room which it is to be feared it never possessed in miss kittys occupancy again she glanced at the clock there was a tap at the door  come in  the door opened to a chinese servant bearing a piece of torn paper with a name written on it in lieu of a card  mrs horncastle took it glanced at the name and handed the paper back  there must be some mistake she said it do not know mr steptoe  no but you know me all the same said a voice from the doorway as a man entered coolly took the chinese servant by the elbows and thrust him into the passage closing the door upon him steptoe and horncastle are the same man only i prefer to call myself steptoe here and i see youre down on the register as horncastle well its plucky of you and its not a bad name to keep you might be thankful that i have always left it to you and if i call myself steptoe here its a good blind against any of your swell friends knowing you met your husband here  in the halfscornful halfresigned look she had given him when he entered there was no doubt that she recognized him as the man she had come to see he had changed little in the five years that had elapsed since he entered the three partners cabin at heavy tree hill his short hair and beard still clung to his head like curled moss or the crisp flocculence of astrakhan he was dressed more pretentiously but still gave the same idea of vulgar strength she listened to him without emotion but said with even a deepening of scorn in her manner  what new shame is this  nothing new he replied only five years ago i was livin over on the bar at heavy tree hill under the name of steptoe and folks here might recognize me i was here when your particular friend jim stacy who only knew me as steptoe and doesnt know me as horncastle your husbandfor all hes bound up my property for youmade his big strike with his two partners i was in his cabin that very night and drank his whiskey oh im all right there i left everything all right behind meonly its just as well he doesnt know im horncastle and as the boy happened to be there with mehe stopped and looked at her significantly  the expression of her face changed eagerness anxiety and even fear came into it in turn but always mingling with some scorn that dominated her the boy she said in a voice that had changed too well what about him you promised to tell me allall  wheres the money he said husband and wife are one i know he went on with a coarse laugh but i dont trust myself in these matters  she took from a travelingreticule that lay beside her a roll of notes and a chamois leather bag of coin and laid them on the table before him he examined both carefully  all right he said i see youve got the checks made out to bearer your heads level conny pity you and me cant agree  i went to the bank across the way as soon as i arrived she said with contemptuous directness i told them i was going over to hymettus and might want money  he dropped into a chair before her with his broad heavy hands upon his knees and looked at her with an equal though baser contempt for his was mingled with a certain pride of mastery and possession  and of course youll go to hymettus and cut a splurge as you always do the beautiful mrs horncastle the helpless victim of a wretched dissipated disgraced gambling husband so dreadfully sad you know and so interesting could get a divorce from the brute if she wanted but wont on account of her religious scruples and so while the brute is gambling swindling disgracing himself and dodging a shot here and a lynch committee there two or three hundred miles away youre splurging round in firstclass hotels and wateringplaces doing the injured and abused and run after by a lot of men who are ready to take my place and maybe some of my reputation along with it  stop she said suddenly in a voice that made the glass chandelier ring he had risen too with a quick uneasy glance towards the door but her outbreak passed as suddenly and sinking back into her chair she said with her previous scornful resignation never mind go on you know youre lying  he sat down again and looked at her critically yes as far as youre concerned i was lying i know your style but as you know too that id kill you and the first man i suspected and there aint a judge or a jury in all californy that wouldnt let me go free for it and even consider too that it had wiped off the whole slate agin meits to my credit  i know what you men call chivalry she said coldly but i did not come here to buy a knowledge of that so now about the child she ended abruptly leaning forward again with the same look of eager solicitude in her eyes  well about the childour childthough perhaps i prefer to say my child he began with a certain brutal frankness ill tell you but first i dont want you to talk about buying your information of me if i havent told you anything before its because i didnt think you oughter know if i didnt trust the child to you its because i didnt think you could go shashaying about with a child that was three years old when ihe stopped and wiped his mouth with the back of his handmade an honest woman of youi think thats what they call it  but she said eagerly ignoring the insult i could have hidden it where no one but myself would have known it i could have sent it to school and visited it as a relation  yes he said curtly like all women and then blurted it out some day and made it worse  but she said desperately even then suppose i had been willing to take the shame of it i have taken more  but i didnt intend that you should he said roughly  you are very careful of my reputation she returned scornfully  not by a dd sight he burst out but i care for his im not goin to let any man call him a bastard  callous as she had become even under this last cruel blow she could not but see something in his coarse eyes she had never seen before could not but hear something in his brutal voice she had never heard before was it possible that somewhere in the depths of his sordid nature he had his own contemptible sense of honor a hysterical feeling came over her hitherto passive disgust and scorn but it disappeared with his next sentence in a haze of anxiety no he said hoarsely he had enough wrong done him already  what do you mean she said imploringly or are you again lying you said four years ago that he had got into trouble that was your excuse for keeping him from me or was that a lie too  his manner changed and softened but not for any pity for his companion but rather from some change in his own feelings oh that he said with a rough laugh that was only a kind o trouble any sassy kid like him was likely to get into you aint got no call to hear that for he added with a momentary return to his previous manner the wrong that was done him is my lookout you want to know what i did with him how hes been looked arter and where he is you want the worth of your money thats square enough but first i want you to know though you maynt believe it that every red cent youve given me tonight goes to him and dont you forget it  for all his vulgar frankness she knew he had lied to her many times beforemaliciously wantonly complacently but never evasively yet there was again that something in his manner which told her he was now telling the truth  well he began settling himself back in his chair i told you i brought him to heavy tree hill after i left you i wasnt going to trust him to no school he knew enough for me but when i left those parts where nobody knew you and got a little nearer frisco where people might have known us both i thought it better not to travel round with a kid o that size as his father so i got a young fellow here to pass him off as his little brother and look after him and board him and i paid him a big price for it too you bet you wouldnt think it was a man whos now swelling around here the top o the pile that ever took money from a brute like me and for such schoolmaster work too but he did and his name was van loo a clerk of the ditch company  van loo said the woman with a movement of disgust that man  whats the matter with van loo he said with a coarse laugh enjoying his wifes discomfiture he speaks french and spanish and you oughter hear the kid roll off the lingo hes got from him hes got style and knows how to dress and you ought to see the kid bow and scrape and how he carries himself now van loo wasnt exactly my style and i reckon i dont hanker after him much but he served my purpose  and this man knowsshe said with a shudder  he knows steptoe and the boy but he dont know horncastle nor you dont you be skeert hes the last man in the world who would hanker to see me or the kid again or would dare to say that he ever had lord id like to see his fastidious mug if me and eddy walked in upon him and his hightoned mother and sister some arternoon he threw himself back and laughed a derisive spasmodic choking laugh which was so far from being genial that it even seemed to indicate a lively appreciation of pain in others rather than of pleasure in himself he had often laughed at her in the same way  and where is he now she said with a compressed lip  at school where i dont tell you you know why but hes looked after by me and dd well looked after too  she hesitated composed her face with an effort parted her lips and looked out of the window into the gathering darkness then after a moment she said slowly yet with a certain precision  and his mother do you ever talk to him of her doesdoes he ever speak of me  what do you think he said comfortably changing his position in the chair and trying to read her face in the shadow come now you dont know eh wellno no you understand no hes my friendmine hes stood by me through thick and thin run at my heels when everybody else fled me dodged vigilance committees with me laid out in the brush with me with his hand in mine when the sheriffs deputies were huntin me shut his jaw close when if he squealed hed have been called another victim of the brute horncastle and been as petted and canoodled as you  it would have been difficult for any one but the woman who knew the man before her to have separated his brutish delight in paining her from another feeling she had never dreamt him capable ofan intense and fierce pride in his affection for his child and it was the more hopeless to her that it was not the mere sentiment of reciprocation but the material instinct of paternity in its most animal form and it seemed horrible to her that the only outcome of what had been her own wild youthful passion for this brute was this love for the flesh of her flesh for she was more and more conscious as he spoke that her yearning for the boy was the yearning of an equally dumb and unreasoning maternity they had met again as animalsin fear contempt and anger of each other but the animal had triumphed in both  when she spoke again it was as the woman of the worldthe woman who had laughed two years ago at the irrepressible barker its a new thing she said languidly turning her rings on her fingers to see you in the role of a doting father and may i ask how long you have had this amiable weakness and how long it is to last  to her surprise and the keen retaliating delight of her sex a conscious flush covered his face to the crisp edges of his black and matted beard for a moment she hoped that he had lied but to her greater surprise he stammered in equal frankness its growed upon me for the last five yearsever since i was alone with him he stopped cleared his throat and then standing up before her said in his former voice but with a more settled and intense deliberation you wanter know how long it will last do ye well you know your special friend jim stacythe big millionairethe great jim of the stock exchangethe man that pinches the money market of californy between his finger and thumb and makes it squeal in new yorkthe man who shakes the stock market when he sneezes well it will go on until that man is a beggar until he has to borrow a dime for his breakfast and slump out of his lunch with a cents worth of rat poison or a bullet in his head itll go on until his old partnerthat softy george barkercomes to the bottom of his dd fool luck and is a pennyaliner for the papers and a hangerround at free lunches and his scatterbrained wife runs away with another man itll go on until the hightoned demorest the last of those three little tin gods of heavy tree hill will have to climb down and will know what i feel and what hes made me feel and will wish himself in hell before he ever made the big strike on heavy tree thats me you hear me im shoutin itll last till then it may be next week next month next year but itll come and when it does come youll see me and eddy just waltzin in and takin the chief seats in the synagogue and youll have a free pass to the show  either he was too intoxicated with his vengeful vision or the shadows of the room had deepened but he did not see the quick flush that had risen to his wifes face with this allusion to barker nor the aftersettling of her handsome features into a dogged determination equal to his own his blind fury against the three partners did not touch her curiosity she was only struck with the evident depth of his emotion he had never been a braggart his hostility had always been lazy and cynical remembering this she had a faint stirring of respect for the undoubted courage and consciousness of strength shown in this wild but singlehanded crusade against wealth and power rather perhaps it seemed to her to condone her own weakness in her youthful and inexplicable passion for him no wonder she had submitted  then you have nothing more to tell me she said after a pause rising and going towards the mantel  you neednt light up for me he returned rising also i am going unless he added with his coarse laugh you think it wouldnt look well for mrs horncastle to have been sitting in the dark witha stranger he paused as she contemptuously put down the candlestick and threw the unlit match into the grate no ive nothing more to tell hes a fancylooking pup youd take him for twentyone though hes only sixteencleanlimbed and perfectbut for one thinghe stopped he met her quick look of interrogation however with a lowering silence that nevertheless changed again as he surveyed her erect figure by the faint light of the window with a sardonic smile he favors you i think and in all but one thing too  and that she queried coldly as he seemed to hesitate  he aint ashamed of me he returned with a laugh  the door closed behind him she heard his heavy step descend the creaking stairs he was gone she went to the window and threw it open as if to get rid of the atmosphere charged with his presencea presence still so potent that she now knew that for the last five minutes she had been to her horror struggling against its magnetism she even recoiled now at the thought of her child as if in these new confidences over it it had revived the old intimacy in this link of their common flesh she looked down from her window on the square shoulders thick throat and crisp matted hair of her husband as he vanished in the darkness and drew a breath of freedoma freedom not so much from him as from her own weakness that he was bearing away with him into the exonerating night  she shut the window and sank down in her chair again but in the encompassing and compassionate obscurity of the room and this was the man she had loved and for whom she had wrecked her young life or was it love and if not how was she better than he worse for he was more loyal to that passion that had brought them together and its responsibilities than she was she had suffered the perils and pangs of maternity and yet had only the mere animal yearning for her offspring while he had taken over the toil and duty and even the devotion of parentage himself but then she remembered also how he had fascinated hera simple schoolgirlby his sheer domineering strength and how the objections of her parents to this coarse and common man had forced her into a clandestine intimacy that ended in her complete subjection to him she remembered the birth of an infant whose concealment from her parents and friends was compassed by his low cunning she remembered the late atonement of marriage preferred by the man she had already begun to loathe and fear and who she now believed was eager only for her inheritance she remembered her abject compliance through the greater fear of the world the stormy scenes that followed their illomened union her final abandonment of her husband and the efforts of her friends and family who had rescued the last of her property from him she was glad she remembered it she dwelt upon it upon his cruelty his coarseness and vulgarity until she saw as she honestly believed the hidden springs of his affection for their child it was his child in nature however it might have favored her in looks it was his own brutal self he was worshiping in his brutal progeny how else could it have ignored herits own mother she never doubted the truth of what he had told hershe had seen it in his own triumphant eyes and yet she would have made a kind mother she remembered with a smile and a slight rising of color the affection of barkers baby for her she remembered with a deepening of that color the thrill of satisfaction she had felt in her husbands fulmination against mrs barker and more than all she felt in his blind and foolish hatred of barker himself a delicious condonation of the strange feeling that had sprung up in her heart for barkers simple straightforward nature how could he understand how could they understand by the plural she meant mrs barker and horncastle a character so innately noble in her strange attraction towards him she had felt a charming sense of what she believed was a superior and even matronly protection in the utter isolation of her life nowand with her husbands foolish abuse of him ringing in her earsit seemed a sacred duty she had lost a son providence had sent her an ideal friend to replace him and this was quite consistent too with a faint smile that began to play about her mouth as she recalled some instances of barkers delightful and irresistible youthfulness  there was a clatter of hoofs and the sound of many voices from the street mrs horncastle knew it was the down coach changing horses it would be off again in a few moments and no doubt bearing her husband away with it a new feeling of relief came over her as she at last heard the warning all aboard and the great vehicle clattered and rolled into the darkness trailing its burning lights across her walls and ceiling but now she heard steps on the staircase a pause before her room a whisper of voices the opening of the door the rustle of a skirt and a little feminine cry of protest as a man apparently tried to follow the figure into the room no no i tell you no remonstrated the womans voice in a hurried whisper it wont do everybody knows me here you must not come in now you must wait to be announced by the servant hush go  there was a slight struggle the sound of a kiss and the woman succeeded in finally shutting the door then she walked slowly but with a certain familiarity towards the mantel struck a match and lit the candle the light shone upon the bright eyes and slightly flushed face of mrs barker but the motionless woman in the chair had recognized her voice and the voice of her companion at once and then their eyes met  mrs barker drew back but did not utter a cry mrs horncastle with eyes even brighter than her companions smiled the red deepened in mrs barkers cheek  this is my room she said indignantly with a sweeping gesture around the walls  i should judge so said mrs horncastle following the gesture but she added quietly they put me into it it appears however they did not expect you  mrs barker saw her mistake no no she said apologetically of course not then she added with nervous volubility sitting down and tugging at her gloves you see i just ran down from marysville to take a look at my fathers old house on my way to hymettus i hope i havent disturbed you perhaps she said with sudden eagerness you were asleep when i came in  no said mrs horncastle i was not sleeping nor dreaming i heard you come in  some of these men are such idiots said mrs barker with a halfhysterical laugh they seem to think if a woman accepts the least courtesy from them theyve a right to be familiar but i fancy that fellow was a little astonished when i shut the door in his face  i fancy he was returned mrs horncastle dryly but i shouldnt call mr van loo an idiot he has the reputation of being a cautious business man  mrs barker bit her lip her companion had been recognized she rose with a slight flirt of her skirt i suppose i must go and get a room there was nobody in the office when i came everything is badly managed here since my father took away the best servants to hymettus she moved with affected carelessness towards the door when mrs horncastle without rising from her seat said  why not stay here  mrs barker brightened for a moment oh she said with polite deprecation i couldnt think of turning you out  i dont intend you shall said mrs horncastle we will stay here together until you go with me to hymettus or until mr van loo leaves the hotel he will hardly attempt to come in here again if i remain  mrs barker with a halflaugh sat down irresolutely mrs horncastle gazed at her curiously she was evidently a novice in this sort of thing but strange to sayand i leave the ethics of this for the sex to settlethe fact did not soften mrs horncastles heart nor in the least qualify her attitude towards the younger woman after an awkward pause mrs barker rose again well its very good of you andandill just run out and wash my hands and get the dust off me and come back  no mrs barker said mrs horncastle rising and approaching her you will first wash your hands of this mr van loo and get some of the dust of the rendezvous off you before you do anything else you can do it by simply telling him should you meet him in the hall that i was sitting here when he came in and heard everything depend upon it he wont trouble you again  but mrs barker though inexperienced in love was a good fighter the best of the sex are she dropped into the rockingchair and began rocking backwards and forwards while still tugging at her gloves and said in a gradually warming voice i certainly shall not magnify mr van loos silliness to that importance and i have yet to learn what you mean by talking about a rendezvous and i want to know she continued suddenly stopping her rocking and tilting the rockers impertinently behind her as with her elbows squared on the chair arms she tilted her own face defiantly up into mrs horncastles how a woman in your positionwho doesnt live with her husbanddares to talk to me  there was a lull before the storm mrs horncastle approached nearer and laying her hand on the back of the chair leaned over her and with a white face and a metallic ring in her voice said it is just because i am a woman in my position that i do it is because i dont live with my husband that i can tell you what it will be when you no longer live with yourswhich will be the inevitable result of what you are now doing it is because i was in this position that the very man who is pursuing you because he thinks you are discontented with your husband once thought he could pursue me because i had left mine you are here with him alone without the knowledge of your husband call it folly caprice vanity or what you like it can have but one endto put you in my place at last to be considered the fair game afterwards for any man who may succeed him you can test him and the truth of what i say by telling him now that i heard all  suppose he doesnt care what you have heard said mrs barker sharply suppose he says nobody would believe you if telling is your game suppose he is a friend of my husband and he thinks him a much better guardian of my reputation than a woman like you suppose he should be the first one to tell my husband of the foul slander invented by you  for an instant mrs horncastle was taken aback by the audacity of the woman before her she knew the simple confidence and boyish trust of barker in his wife in spite of their sometimes strained relations and she knew how difficult it would be to shake it and she had no idea of betraying mrs barkers secret to him though she had made this scene in his interest she had wished to save mrs barker from a compromising situation even if there was a certain vindictiveness in her exposing her to herself yet she knew it was quite possible now if mrs barker had immediate access to her husband that she would convince him of her perfect innocence nevertheless she had still great confidence in van loos fear of scandal and his utter unmanliness she knew he was not in love with mrs barker and this puzzled her when she considered the evident risk he was running now her face however betrayed nothing she drew back from mrs barker and with an indifferent and graceful gesture towards the door said as she leaned against the mantel go then and see this muchabused gentleman and then go together with him and make peace with your husbandeven on those terms if i have saved you from the consequences of your folly i shall be willing to bear even his blame  whatever i do said mrs barker rising hotly i shall not stay here any longer to be insulted she flounced out of the room and swept down the staircase into the office here she found an overworked clerk and with crimson cheeks and flashing eyes wanted to know why in her own fathers hotel she had found her own sittingroom engaged and had been obliged to wait half an hour before she could be shown into a decent apartment to remove her hat and cloak in and how it was that even the gentleman who had kindly escorted her had evidently been unable to procure her any assistance she said this in a somewhat high voice which might have reached the ears of that gentleman had he been in the vicinity but he was not and she was forced to meet the somewhat dazed apologies of the clerk alone and to accompany the chambermaid to a room only a few paces distant from the one she had quitted here she hastily removed her outer duster and hat washed her hands and consulted her excited face in the mirror with the door ajar and an ear sensitively attuned to any step in the corridor but all this was effected so rapidly that she was at last obliged to sit down in a chair near the halfopened door and wait she waited five minutestenbut still no footstep then she went out into the corridor and listened and then smoothing her face she slipped downstairs past the door of that hateful room and reappeared before the clerk with a smiling but somewhat pale and languid face she had found the room very comfortable but it was doubtful whether she would stay over night or go on to hymettus had anybody been inquiring for her she expected to meet friends no and her escortthe gentleman who came with herwas possibly in the billiardroom or the bar  oh no he was gone said the clerk  gone echoed mrs barker impossible he washe was here only a moment ago  the clerk rang a bell sharply the stableman appeared  that tall smoothfaced man in a high hat who came with the lady said the clerk severely and conciselydidnt you tell me he was gone  yes sir said the stableman  are you sure interrupted mrs barker with a dazzling smile that however masked a sudden tightening round her heart  quite sure miss said the stableman for he was in the yard when steptoe came after missing the coach he wanted a buggy to take him over to the divide we hadnt one so he went over to the other stables and he didnt come back so i reckon hes gone i remember it because steptoe came by a minute after hed gone in another buggy and as he was going to the divide too i wondered why the gentleman hadnt gone with him  and he left no message for me he said nothing asked mrs barker quite breathless but still smiling  he said nothin to me but isnt that steptoe over there when steptoe came in and i remember he said it kinder suddentas if he was reminded o suthin hed forgot and then he asked for a buggy ye see miss added the man with a certain rough consideration for her disappointment thats mebbe why he clean forgot to leave a message  mrs barker turned away and ascended the stairs selfishness is quick to recognize selfishness and she saw in a flash the reason of van loos abandonment of her some fear of discovery had alarmed him perhaps steptoe knew her husband perhaps he had heard of mrs horncastles possession of the sittingroom perhapsfor she had not seen him since their playful struggle at the doorhe had recognized the woman who was there and the selfish coward had run away yes mrs horncastle was right she had been only a miserable dupe  her cheeks blazed as she entered the room she had just quitted and threw herself in a chair by the window she bit her lip as she remembered how for the last three months she had been slowly yielding to van loos cautious but insinuating solicitation from a flirtation in the san francisco hotel to a clandestine meeting in the street from a ride in the suburbs to a supper in a fast restaurant after the theatre other women did it who were fashionable and rich as van loo had pointed out to her other fashionable women also gambled in stocks and had their private broker in a charley or a jack why should not mrs barker have business with a paul van loo particularly as this fast craze permitted secret meetingsfor business of this kind could not be conducted in public and permitted the fair gambler to call at private offices without fear and without reproach mrs barkers vanity mrs barkers love of ceremony and form mrs barkers snobbishness were flattered by the attentions of this polished gentleman with a foreign name which even had the flavor of nobility who never picked up her fan and handed it to her without bowing and always rose when she entered the room mrs barkers scant schoolgirl knowledge was touched by this gentleman who spoke french fluently and delicately explained to her the libretto of a risky opera bouffe and now she had finally yielded to a meeting out of san franciscoand an ostensible visitstill as a speculatorto one or two mining districtswith her broker this was the boldest of her stepsan original idea of the fashionable van loowhich no doubt in time would become a craze too but it was a long stepand there was a streak of rustic decorum in mrs barkers naturethe instinct that made kitty carter keep a perfectly secluded and distinct sittingroom in the days when she served her fathers gueststhat now had impelled her to make it a proviso that the first step of her journey should be from her old home in her fathers hotel it was this instinct of the proprieties that had revived in her suddenly at the door of the old sittingroom  then a new phase of the situation flashed upon her it was hard for her vanity to accept van loos desertion as voluntary and final what if that hateful woman had lured him away by some trick or artfully designed message she was capable of such meanness to insure the fulfillment of her prophecy or more dreadful thought what if she had some hold on his affectionsshe had said that he had pursued her or more infamous still there were some secret understanding between them and that shemrs barkerwas the dupe of them both what was she doing in the hotel at such a moment what was her story of going to hymettus but a lie as transparent as her own the tortures of jealousy which is as often the incentive as it is the result of passion began to rack her she had probably yet known no real passion for this man but with the thought of his abandoning her and the conception of his faithlessness came the wish to hold and keep him that was dangerously near it what if he were even then in that room the room where she had said she would not stay to be insulted and they thus secured against her intrusion were laughing at her now she half rose at the thought but a sound of a horses hoofs in the stableyard arrested her she ran to the window which gave upon it and crouching down beside it listened eagerly the clatter of hoofs ceased the stableman was talking to some one suddenly she heard the stableman say mrs barker is here her heart leapedvan loo had returned  but here the voice of the other man which she had not yet heard arose for the first time clear and distinct are you quite sure i didnt know she left san francisco  the room reeled around her the voice was george barkers her husband very well he continued you neednt put up my horse for the night i may take her back a little later in the buggy  in another moment she had swept down the passage and burst into the other room mrs horncastle was sitting by the table with a book in her hand she started as the halfmaddened woman closed the door locked it behind her and cast herself on her knees at her feet  my husband is here she gasped what shall i do in heavens name help me  is van loo still here said mrs horncastle quickly  no gone he went when i came  mrs horncastle caught her hand and looked intently into her frightened face then what have you to fear from your husband she said abruptly  you dont understand he didnt know i was here he thought me in san francisco  does he know it now  yes i heard the stableman tell him couldnt you say i came here with you that we were here together that it was just a little freak of ours oh do  mrs horncastle thought a moment yes she said well see him here together  oh no no said mrs barker suddenly clinging to her dress and looking fearfully towards the door i couldnt couldnt see him now say im sick tired out gone to my room  but youll have to see him later said mrs horncastle wonderingly  yes but he may go first i heard him tell them not to put up his horse  good said mrs horncastle suddenly go to your room and lock the door and ill come to you later stop would mr barker be likely to disturb you if i told him you would like to be alone  no he never does i often tell him that  mrs horncastle smiled faintly come quick then she said for he may come here first  opening the door she passed into the halfdark and empty hall now run she heard the quick rustle of mrs barkers skirt die away in the distance the opening and shutting of a doorsilenceand then turned back into her own room  she was none too soon presently she heard barkers voice saying thank you i can find the way his still buoyant step on the staircase and then saw his brown curls rising above the railing the light streaming through the open door of the sitting room into the halflit hall had partially dazzled him and already bewildered he was still more dazzled at the unexpected apparition of the smiling face and bright eyes of mrs horncastle standing in the doorway  you have fairly caught us she said with charming composure but i had half a mind to let you wander round the hotel a little longer come in barker followed her in mechanically and she closed the door now sit down she said gayly and tell me how you knew we were here and what you mean by surprising us at this hour  barkers ready color always rose on meeting mrs horncastle for whom he entertained a respectful admiration not without some fear of her worldly superiority he flushed bowed and stared somewhat blankly around the room at the familiar walls at the chair from which mrs horncastle had just risen and finally at his wifes glove which mrs horncastle had a moment before ostentatiously thrown on the table seeing which she pounced upon it with assumed archness and pretended to conceal it  i had no idea my wife was here he said at last and i was quite surprised when the man told me for she had not written to me about it as his face was brightening she for the first time noticed that his frank gray eyes had an abstracted look and there was a faint line of contraction on his youthful forehead still less he added did i look for the pleasure of meeting you for i only came here to inquire about my old partner demorest who arrived from europe a few days ago and who should have reached hymettus early this afternoon but now i hear he came all the way by coach instead of by rail and got off at the crossroad and we must have passed each other on the different trails so my journey would have gone for nothing only that i now shall have the pleasure of going back with you and kitty it will be a lovely drive by moonlight  relieved by this revelation it was easy work for mrs horncastle to launch out into a playful tantalizing wittybut i grieve to say entirely imaginativeaccount of her escapade with mrs barker how left alone at the san francisco hotel while their gentlemen friends were enjoying themselves at hymettus they resolved upon a little trip partly for the purpose of looking into some small investments of their own and partly for the fun of the thing what funny experiences they had how in particular one horrid inquisitive vulgar wretch had been boring a european fellow passenger who was going to hymettus finally asking him where he had come from last and when he answered hymettus thought the man was insulting him  but interrupted the laughing barker that passenger may have been demorest who has just come from greece and surely kitty would have recognized him  mrs horncastle instantly saw her blunder and not only retrieved it but turned it to account ah yes but by that time poor kitty unused to long journeys and the heat was utterly fagged out was asleep and perfectly unrecognizable in veils and dusters on the back seat of the coach and this brought her to the pointwhich was that she was sorry to say on arriving the poor child was nearly wild with a headache from fatigue and had gone to bed and she had promised not to disturb her  the undisguised amusement mingled with relief that had overspread barkers face during this lively recital might have pricked the conscience of mrs horncastle but for some reason i fear it did not but it emboldened her to go on i said i promised her that i would see she wasnt disturbed but of course now that you her husband have come if  not for worlds interrupted barker earnestly i know poor kittys headaches and i never disturb her poor child except when im thoughtless and here one of the most thoughtful men in the world in his sensitive consideration of others beamed at her with such frank and wonderful eyes that the arch hypocrite before him with difficulty suppressed a hysterical desire to laugh and felt the conscious blood flush her to the root of her hair you know he went on with a sigh half of relief and half of reminiscence that i often think im a great bother to a clearheaded sensible girl like kitty she knows people so much better than i do shes wonderfully equipped for the world and you see im only lucky as everybody says and i dare say part of my luck was to have got her im very glad shes a friend of yours you know for somehow i fancied always that you were not interested in her or that you didnt understand each other until now its odd that nice women dont always like nice women isnt it im glad she was with you i was quite startled to learn she was here and couldnt make it out i thought at first she might have got anxious about our little sta who is with me and the nurse at hymettus but im glad it was only a lark i shouldnt wonder he added with a laugh although she always declares she isnt one of those doting idiotic mothers that she found it a little dull without the boy for all she thought it was better for me to take him somewhere for a change of air  the situation was becoming more difficult for mrs horncastle than she had conceived there had been a certain excitement in its first direct appeal to her tact and courage and even she believed an unselfish desire to save the relations between husband and wife if she could but she had not calculated upon his unconscious revelations nor upon their effect upon herself she had concluded to believe that kitty had in a moment of folly lent herself to this harebrained escapade but it now might be possible that it had been deliberately planned kitty had sent her husband and child away three weeks before had she told the whole truth how long had this been going on and if the soulless van loo had deserted her now was it not perhaps the miserable ending of an intrigue rather than its beginning had she been as great a dupe of this woman as the husband before her a new and double consciousness came over her that for a moment prevented her from meeting his honest eyes she felt the shame of being an accomplice mingled with a fierce joy at the idea of a climax that might separate him from his wife forever  luckily he did not notice it but with a continued sense of relief threw himself back in his chair and glancing familiarly round the walls broke into his youthful laugh lord how i remember this room in the old days it was kittys own private sittingroom you know and i used to think it looked just as fresh and pretty as she i used to think her crayon drawing wonderful and still more wonderful that she should have that unnecessary talent when it was quite enough for her to be just kitty you know dont you how you feel at those times when youre quite happy in being inferiorhe stopped a moment with a sudden recollection that mrs horncastles marriage had been notoriously unhappy i mean he went on with a shy little laugh and an innocent attempt at gallantry which the very directness of his simple nature made atrociously obviousi mean what youve made lots of young fellows feel there used to be a picture of colonel brigg on the mantelpiece in full uniform and signed by himself for kitty and lord how jealous i was of it for kitty never took presents from gentlemen and nobody even was allowed in here though she helped her father all over the hotel she was awfully strict in those days he interpolated with a thoughtful look and a halfsigh but then she wasnt married i proposed to her in this very room lord i remember how frightened i was he stopped for an instant and then said with a certain timidity do you mind my telling you something about it  mrs horncastle was hardly prepared to hear these ingenuous domestic details but she smiled vaguely although she could not suppress a somewhat impatient movement with her hands even barker noticed it but to her surprise moved a little nearer to her and in a halfentreating way said i hope i dont bore you but its something confidential do you know that she first refused me  mrs horncastle smiled but could not resist a slight toss of her head i believe they all do when they are sure of a man  no said barker eagerly you dont understand i proposed to her because i thought i was rich in a foolish moment i thought i had discovered that some old stocks i had had acquired a fabulous value she believed it too but because she thought i was now a rich man and she only a poor girla mere servant to her fathers guestsshe refused me refused me because she thought i might regret it in the future because she would not have it said that she had taken advantage of my proposal only when i was rich enough to make it  well said mrs horncastle incredulously gazing straight before her and then  in about an hour i discovered my error that my stocks were worthless that i was still a poor man i thought it only honest to return to her and tell her even though i had no hope and then she pitied me and cried and accepted me i tell it to you as her friend he drew a little nearer and quite fraternally laid his hand upon her own i know you wont betray me though you may think it wrong for me to have told it but i wanted you to know how good she was and true  for a moment mrs horncastle was amazed and discomfited although she saw with the inscrutable instinct of her sex no inconsistency between the kitty of those days and the kitty now shamefully hiding from her husband in the same hotel no doubt kitty had some good reason for her chivalrous act but she could see the unmistakable effect of that act upon the more logically reasoning husband and that it might lead him to be more merciful to the later wrong and there was a keener irony that his first movement of unconscious kindliness towards her was the outcome of his affection for his undeserving wife  you said just now she was more practical than you she said dryly apart from this evidence of it what other reasons have you for thinking so do you refer to her independence or her dealings in the stock market she added with a laugh  no said barker seriously for i do not think her quite practical there indeed im afraid she is about as bad as i am but im glad you have spoken for i can now talk confidentially with you and as you and she are both in the same ventures perhaps she will feel less compunction in hearing from youas your own opinionwhat i have to tell you than if i spoke to her myself i am afraid she trusts implicitly to van loos judgment as her broker i believe he is strictly honorable but the general opinion of his business insight is not high theyperhaps i ought to say hehave been at least so unlucky that they might have learned prudence the loss of twenty thousand dollars in three months  twenty thousand echoed mrs horncastle  yes why you knew that it was in the mine you and she visited or perhaps he added hastily as he flushed at his indiscretion she didnt tell you that  but mrs horncastle as hastily said yesyesof course only i had forgotten the amount and he continued  that loss would have frightened any man but you women are more daring only van loo ought to have withdrawn dont you think so of course i couldnt say anything to him without seeming to condemn my own wife i couldnt say anything to her because its her own money  i didnt know that mrs barker had any money of her own said mrs horncastle  well i gave it to her said barker with sublime simplicity and that would make it all the worse for me to speak about it  mrs horncastle was silent a new theory flashed upon her which seemed to reconcile all the previous inconsistencies of the situation van loo under the guise of a lover was really possessing himself of mrs barkers money this accounted for the risks he was running in this escapade which were so incongruous to the rascals nature he was calculating that the scandal of an intrigue would relieve him of the perils of criminal defalcation it was compatible with kittys innocence though it did not relieve her vanity of the part it played in this despicable comedy of passion all that mrs horncastle thought of now was the effect of its eventful revelation upon the man before her of course he would overlook his wifes trustfulness and business ignoranceit would seem so like his own unselfish faith that was the fault of all unselfish goodness it even took the color of adjacent evil without altering the nature of either mrs horncastle set her teeth tightly together but her beautiful mouth smiled upon barker though her eyes were bent upon the tablecloth before her  i shall do all i can to impress your views upon her she said at last though i fear they will have little weight if given as my own and you overrate my general influence with her  her handsome head drooped in such a thoughtful humility that barker instinctively drew nearer to her besides she had not lifted her dark lashes for some moments and he had the still youthful habit of looking frankly into the eyes of those he addressed  no he said eagerly how could i she could not help but love you and do as you would wish i cant tell you how glad and relieved i am to find that you and she have become such friends you know i always thought you beautiful i always thought you so cleveri was even a little frightened of you but i never until now knew you were so good no stop yes i did know it do you remember once in san francisco when i found you with sta in your lap in the drawingroom i knew it then you tried to make me think it was a whimthe fancy of a bored and worried woman but i knew better and i knew what you were thinking then shall i tell you  as her eyes were still cast down although her mouth was still smiling in his endeavors to look into them his face was quite near hers he fancied that it bore the look she had worn once before  you were thinking he said in a voice which had grown suddenly quite hesitating and tremuloushe did not know whythat the poor little baby was quite friendless and alone you were pitying ityou know you werebecause there was no one to give it the loving care that was its due and because it was intrusted to that hired nurse in that great hotel you were thinking how you would love it if it were yours and how cruel it was that love was sent without an object to waste itself upon you were i saw it in your face  she suddenly lifted her eyes and looked full into his with a look that held and possessed him for a moment his whole soul seemed to tremble on the verge of their lustrous depths and he drew back dizzy and frightened what he saw there he never clearly knew but whatever it was it seemed to suddenly change his relations to her to the room to his wife to the world without it was a glimpse of a world of which he knew nothing he had looked frankly and admiringly into the eyes of other pretty women he had even gazed into her own before but never with this feeling a sudden sense that what he had seen there he had himself evoked that it was an answer to some question he had scarcely yet formulated and that they were both now linked by an understanding and consciousness that was irretrievable came over him he rose awkwardly and went to the window she rose also but more leisurely and easily moved one of the books on the table smoothed out her skirts and changed her seat to a little sofa it is the woman who always comes out of these crucial moments unruffled  i suppose you will be glad to see your friend mr demorest when you go back she said pleasantly for of course he will be at hymettus awaiting you  he turned eagerly as he always did at the name but even then he felt that demorest was no longer of such importance to him he felt too that he was not yet quite sure of his voice or even what to say as he hesitated she went on half playfully it seems hard that you had to come all the way here on such a bootless errand you havent even seen your wife yet  the mention of his wife recalled him to himself oddly enough when demorests name had failed but very differently out of his whirling consciousness came the instinctive feeling that he could not see her now he turned crossed the room sat down on the sofa beside mrs horncastle and without however looking at her said with his eyes on the floor no and ive been thinking that its hardly worth while to disturb her so early tomorrow as i should have to go so i think its a good deal better to let her have a good nights rest remain here quietly with you tomorrow until the stage leaves and that both of you come over together my horse is still saddled and i will be back at hymettus before demorest has gone to bed  he was obliged to look up at her as he rose mrs horncastle was sitting erect beautiful and dazzling as even he had never seen her before for his resolution had suddenly lifted a great weight from her shouldersthe dangerous meeting of husband and wife the next morning and its results whatever they might be had been quietly averted she felt too a halffrightened joy even in the constrained manner in which he had imparted his determination that frankness which even she had sometimes found so crushing was gone  i really think you are quite right she said rising also and besides you see it will give me a chance to talk to her as you wished  to talk to her as i wished echoed barker abstractedly  yes about van loo you know said mrs horncastle smiling  oh certainlyabout van loo of course he returned hurriedly  and then said mrs horncastle brightly ill tell her stay she interrupted herself hurriedly why need i say anything about your having been here at all it might only annoy her as you yourself suggest she stopped breathlessly with parted lips  why indeed said barker vaguely yet all this was so unlike his usual truthfulness that he slightly hesitated  besides continued mrs horncastle noticing it you know you can always tell her later if necessary and she added with a charming mischievousness as she didnt tell you she was coming i really dont see why you are bound to tell her that you were here  the sophistry pleased barker even though it put him into a certain retaliating attitude towards his wife which he was not aware of feeling but as mrs horncastle put it it was only a playful attitude  certainly he said dont say anything about it  he moved to the door with his soft broadbrimmed hat swinging between his fingers she noticed for the first time that he looked taller in his long black serape and ridingboots and oddly enough much more like the hero of an amorous tryst than van loo i know she said brightly you are eager to get back to your old friend and it would be selfish for me to try to keep you longer you have had a stupid evening but you have made it pleasant to me by telling me what you thought of me and before you go i want you to believe that i shall try to keep that good opinion she spoke frankly in contrast to the slight worldly constraint of barkers manner it seemed as if they had changed characters and then she extended her hand  with a low bow and without looking up he took it again their pulses seemed to leap together with one accord and the same mysterious understanding he could not tell if he had unconsciously pressed her hand or if she had returned the pressure but when their hands unclasped it seemed as if it were the division of one flesh and spirit  she remained standing by the open door until his footsteps passed down the staircase then she suddenly closed and locked the door with an instinct that mrs barker might at once return now that he was gone and she wished to be a moment alone to recover herself but she presently opened it again and listened there was a noise in the courtyard but it sounded like the rattle of wheels more than the clatter of a horseman then she was overcomea sudden sense of pity for the unfortunate woman still hiding from her husbandand felt a momentary chivalrous exaltation of spirit certainly she had done good to that wretched kitty perhaps she had earned the epithet that barker had applied to her perhaps that was the meaning of all this happiness to her and the result was to be only the happiness and reconciliation of the wife and husband this was to be her reward i grieve to say that the tears had come into her beautiful eyes at this satisfactory conclusion but she dashed them away and ran out into the hall it was quite dark but there was a faint glimmer on the opposite wall as if the door of mrs barkers bedroom were ajar to an eager listener she flew towards the glimmer and pushed the door open the room was empty empty of mrs barker empty of her dressingbox her reticule and shawl she was gone  still mrs horncastle lingered the woman might have got frightened and retreated to some further room at the opening of the door and the coming out of her husband she walked along the passage calling her name softly she even penetrated the dreary halflit public parlor expecting to find her crouching there then a sudden wild idea took possession of her the miserable wife had repented of her act and of her concealment and had crept downstairs to await her husband in the office she had told him some new lie had begged him to take her with him and barker of course had assented yes she now knew why she had heard the rattling wheels instead of the clattering hoofs she had listened for they had gone together as he first proposed in the buggy  she ran swiftly down the stairs and entered the office the overworked clerk was busy and querulously curt these women were always asking such idiotic questions yes mr barker had just gone  with mrs barker in the buggy asked mrs horncastle  no as he cameon horseback mrs barker left half an hour ago  alone  this was apparently too much for the longsuffering clerk he lifted his eyes to the ceiling and then with painful precision and accenting every word with his pencil on the desk before him said deliberately mrs george barkerleftherewith herescorttheman shewasalwaysaskingforinthebuggyat exactly935 and he plunged into his work again  mrs horncastle turned ran up the staircase reentered the sittingroom and slamming the door behind her halted in the centre of the room panting erect beautiful and menacing and she was alone in this empty roomthis deserted hotel from this very room her husband had left her with a brutality on his lips from this room the fool and liar she had tried to warn had gone to her ruin with a swindling hypocrite and from this room the only man in the world she ever cared for had gone forth bewildered wronged and abused and she knew now she could have kept and comforted him     chapter iv   when philip demorest left the stagecoach at the crossroads he turned into the only wayside house the blacksmiths shop and declaring his intention of walking over to hymettus asked permission to leave his handbag and wraps until they could be sent after him the blacksmith was surprised that this likely mannered distinguishedlooking city man should walk eight miles when he could ride and tried to dissuade him offering his own buggy but he was still more surprised when demorest laying aside his duster took off his coat and slinging it on his arm prepared to set forth with the goodhumored assurance that he would do the distance in a couple of hours and get in in time for supper i wouldnt be too sure of that said the blacksmith grimly or even of getting a room theyre a stuckup lot over there and they aint goin to hump themselves over a chap who comes traipsin along the road like any tramp with nary baggage but demorest laughingly accepted the risk and taking his stout stick in one hand pressed a gold coin into the blacksmiths palm which was however declined with such reddening promptness that demorest as promptly reddened and apologized the habits of european travel had been still strong on him and he felt a slight patriotic thrill as he said with a grave smile thank you then and thank you still more for reminding me that i am among my own people and stepped lightly out into the road  the air was still deliciously cool but warmer currents from the heated pines began to alternate with the wind from the summit he found himself sometimes walking through a stratum of hot air which seemed to exhale from the wood itself while his head and breast were swept by the mountain breeze he felt the old intoxication of the balmyscented air again and the five years of care and hopelessness laid upon his shoulders since he had last breathed its fragrance slipped from them like a burden there had been but little change here perhaps the road was wider and the dust lay thicker but the great pines still mounted in serried ranks on the slopes as before with no gaps in their unending files here was the spot where the stagecoach had passed them that eventful morning when they were coming out of their camplife into the world of civilization a little further back the spot where jack hamlin had forced upon him that grim memento of the attempted robbery of their cabin which he had kept ever since he half smiled again at the superstitious interest that had made him keep it with the intention of some day returning to bury it with all recollections of the deed under the site of the old cabin as he went on in the vivifying influence of the air and scene new life seemed to course through his veins his step seemed to grow as elastic as in the old days of their bitter but hopeful struggle for fortune when he had gayly returned from his weekly tramp to boomville laden with the scant provision procured by their scant earnings and dying credit those were the days when her living image still inspired his heart with faith and hope when everything was yet possible to youth and love and before the irony of fate had given him fortune with one hand only to withdraw her with the other it was strange and cruel that coming back from his quest of rest and forgetfulness he should find only these youthful and sanguine dreams revive with his reviving vigor he walked on more hurriedly as if to escape them and was glad to be diverted by one or two carryalls and charabancs filled with gayly dressed pleasure partiesevidently visitors to hymettuswhich passed him on the road here were the first signs of change he recalled the train of packmules of the old days the file of poleandbasket carrying chinese the squaw with the papoose strapped to her shoulder or the wandering and footsore prospector who were the only wayfarers he used to meet he contrasted their halts and friendly greetings with the insolent curiosity or undisguised contempt of the carriage folk and smiled as he thought of the warning of the blacksmith but this did not long divert him he found himself again returning to his previous thought indeed the face of a young girl in one of the carriages had quite startled him with its resemblance to an old memory of his lost love as he saw herher frail pale elegance encompassed in laces as she leaned back in her drive through fifth avenue with eyes that lit up and became transfigured only as he passed he tried to think of his useless quest in search of her last restingplace abroad how he had been baffled by the opposition of her surviving relations already incensed by the thought that her decline had been the effect of her hopeless passion he tried to recall the few frigid lines that reconveyed to him the last letter he had sent her with the announcement of her death and the hope that his persecutions would now cease a wild idea had sometimes come to him out of the very insufficiency of his knowledge of this climax but he had always put it aside as a precursor of that madness which might end his ceaseless thought and now it was returning to him here thousands of miles away from where she was peacefully sleeping and even filling him with the vigor of youthful hope  the brief mountain twilight was giving way now to the radiance of the rising moon he endeavored to fix his thoughts upon his partners who were to meet him at hymettus after these long years of separation  hymettus he recalled now the odd coincidence that he had mischievously used as a gag to his questioning fellow traveler but now he had really come from a villa near athens to find his old house thus classically rechristened after it and thought of it with a gravity he had not felt before he wondered who had named it there was no suggestion of the soft sensuous elegance of the land he had left in those great heroics of nature before him those enormous trees were no woods for fauns or dryads they had their own godlike majesty of bulk and height and as he at last climbed the summit and saw the darkhelmeted head of black spur before him and beyond it the pallid spiritual cloud of the sierras he did not think of olympus yet for a moment he was startled as he turned to the right by the doriccolumned facade of a temple painted by the moonbeams and framed in an opening of the dark woods before him it was not until he had reached it that he saw that it was the new wooden postoffice of heavy tree hill  and now the buildings of the new settlement began to faintly appear but the obscurity of the shadow and the equally disturbing unreality of the moonlight confused him in his attempts to recognize the old landmarks a broad and wellkept winding road had taken the place of the old steep but direct trail to his cabin he had walked for some moments in uncertainty when a sudden sweep of the road brought the full crest of the hill above and before him crowned with a tiara of lights overtopping a long base of flashing windows that was all that was left of heavy tree hill the old foreground of buckeye and odorous ceanothus was gone even the great grove of pines behind it had vanished  there was already a stir of life in the road and he could see figures moving slowly along a kind of sterile formal terrace spread with a few dreary marble vases and plaster statues which had replaced the natural slope and the great quartz buttresses of outcrop that supported it presently he entered a gate and soon found himself in the carriage drive leading to the hotel veranda a number of fair promenaders were facing the keen mountain night wind in wraps and furs demorest had replaced his coat but his boots were red with dust and as he ascended the steps he could see that he was eyed with some superciliousness by the guests and with considerable suspicion by the servants one of the latter was approaching him with an insolent smile when a figure darted from the vestibule and brushing the waiter aside seized demorests two hands in his and held him at arms length  demorest old man  stacy old chap  but wheres your team ive had all the spare hostlers and hallboys listening for you at the gate and wheres barker when he found youd given the deadcut to the railroadhis railroad you knowhe loped over to boomville after you  demorest briefly explained that he had walked by the old road and probably missed him but by this time the waiters crushed by the spectacle of this travelworn strangers affectionate reception by the great financial magnate were wildly applying their brushes and handkerchiefs to his trousers and boots until stacy again swept them away  get off all of you now phil you come with me the house is full but ive made the manager give you a ladys drawingroom suite when you telegraphed youd meet us here there was no chance to get anything else its really mrs van loos family suite but they were sent for to go to marysville yesterday and so well run you in for the night  butprotested demorest  nonsense said stacy dragging him away well pay for it and i reckon the old lady wont object to taking her share of the damage either or she isnt van loos mother come  demorest felt himself hurried forward by the energetic stacy preceded by the obsequious manager through a corridor to a handsomely furnished suite into whose bathroom stacy incontinently thrust him  there wash up and by the time youre ready barker ought to be back and well have supper its waiting for us in the other room  but how about barker the dear boy persisted demorest holding open the door tell me is he well and happy  about as well as we all are said stacy quickly yet with a certain dry significance never mind now wait until you see him  the door closed when demorest had finished washing and wiped away the last red stain of the mountain road he found stacy seated by the window of the larger sittingroom in the centre a table was spread for supper a bright fire of hickory logs burnt on a marble hearth between two large windows that gave upon the distant outline of black spur as stacy turned towards him by the light of the shaded lamp and flickering fire demorest had a good look at the face of his old friend and partner it was as keen and energetic as ever with perhaps an even more hawklike activity visible in the eye and nostril but it was more thoughtful and reticent in the lines of the mouth under the closely clipped beard and mustache and when he looked up at first there were two deep lines or furrows across his low broad forehead demorest fancied too that there was a little of the old fighting look in his eye but it softened quickly as his friend approached and he burst out with his curt but honest singlesyllabled laugh ha you look a little less like a roving apache than you did when you came i really thought the waiters were going to chuck you and you are tanned darned if you dont look like the profile stamped on a continental penny but heres luck and a welcome back old man  demorest passed his arm around the neck of his seated partner and grasping his upraised hand said looking down with a smile and now about barker  oh parker dn him hes the same unshakable unchangeable ungrowupable barker with the devils own luck too waltzing into risks and waltzing out of em with fads enough to put him in the insane asylum if people did not prefer to keep him out of it to help em always believing in everybody until they actually believe in themselves and shake him and hes got a wife thats making a fool of herself and i shouldnt wonder in timeof him  demorest pressed his hand over his partners mouth come jim you know you never really liked that marriage simply because you thought that old man carter made a good thing of it and you never seem to have taken into consideration the happiness barker got out of it for he did love the girl and he still is happy is he not he added quickly as stacy uttered a grunt  as happy as a man can be who has his child here with a nurse while his wife is gallivanting in san francisco and throwing her moneyand lord knows what elseaway at the bidding of a smoothtongued shady operator  does he complain of it asked demorest  not he the fool trusts her said stacy curtly  demorest laughed that is happiness come jim dont let us begrudge him that but ive heard that his affairs have again prospered  he built this railroad and this hotel the bank owns both now he didnt care to keep money in them after they were a success said he wasnt an engineer nor a hotelkeeper and drew it out to find something new but here he comes he added as a horseman dashed into the drive before the hotel question him yourself you know you and he always get along best without me  in another moment barker had burst into the room and in his first tempestuous greeting of demorest the latter saw little change in his younger partner as he held him at arms length to look at him why barker boy you havent got a bit older since the day whenyou rememberyou went over to boomville to cash your bonds and then came back and burst upon us like this to tell us you were a beggar  yes laughed barker and all the while you fellows were holding four aces up your sleeve in the shape of the big strike  and you georgy old boy returned demorest swinging barkers two hands backwards and forwards were holding a royal flush up yours in the shape of your engagement to kitty  the fresh color died out of barkers cheek even while the frank laugh was still on his mouth he turned his face for a moment towards the window and a swift and almost involuntary glance passed between the others but he almost as quickly turned his glistening eyes back to demorest again and said eagerly yes dear kitty you shall see her and the baby tomorrow  then they fell upon the supper with the appetites of the past and for some moments they all talked eagerly and even noisily together all at the same time with even the spirits of the past they recalled every detail of their old life eagerly and impetuously recounted the old struggles hopes and disappointments gave the strange importance of schoolboys to unimportant events and a mystic meaning to a shibboleth of their own roared over old jokes with a delight they had never since given to new reawakened idiotic nicknames and bywords with intense enjoyment grew grave anxious and agonized over forgotten names trifling dates useless distances ineffective records and feeble chronicles of their domestic economy it was the thoughtful and melancholy demorest who remembered the exact color and price paid for a certain shirt bought from a greaser peddler amidst the envy of his companions it was the financial magnate stacy who could inform them what were the exact days they had saleratus bread and when flapjacks it was the thoughtless and mercurial barker who recalled with unheardof accuracy amidst the applause of the others the full name of the indian squaw who assisted at their washing even then they were almost feverishly loath to leave the subject as if the past at least was secure to them still and they were even doubtful of their own free and full accord in the present then they slipped rather reluctantly into their later experiences but with scarcely the same freedom or spontaneity and it was noticeable that these records were elicited from barker by stacy or from stacy by barker for the information of demorest often with chaffing and only under goodhumored protest tell demorest how you broke the copper ring from the admiring barker or tell demorest how your dd foolishness in buying up the right and plant of the ditch company got you control of the railroad from the mischievous stacy were challenges in point presently they left the table and to the astonishment of the waiters who removed the cloth common brierwood pipes thoughtfully provided by barker in commemoration of the past were lit and they ranged themselves in armchairs before the fire quite unconsciously in their old attitudes the two windows on either side of the hearth gave them the same view that the open door of the old cabin had made familiar to them the leaguelong valley below the shadowy bulk of the black spur rising in the distance and still more remote the pallid snowline that soared even beyond its crest  as in the old time they were for many moments silent and then as in the old time it was the irrepressible barker who broke the silence but stacy does not tell you anything about his friend the beautiful mrs horncastle you know hes the guardian of one of the finest women in californiaa woman as noble and generous as she is handsome and think of it hes protecting her from her brute of a husband and looking after her property isnt it good and chivalrous of him  the irrepressible laughter of the two men brought only wonder and reproachful indignation into the widely opened eyes of barker he was perfectly sincere he had been thinking of stacys admiration for mrs horncastle in his ride from boomville and strange to say yet characteristic of his nature it was equally the natural outcome of his interview with her and the singular effect she had upon him that he barker thoroughly sympathized with her only convinced him that stacy must feel the same for her and that no doubt she must respond to him equally and how noble it was in his old partner with his advantages of position in the world and his protecting relations to her not to avail himself of this influence upon her generous nature if he himselfa married man and the husband of kittywas so conscious of her charm how much greater it must be to the free and inexperienced stacy  the italics were in barkers thought for in those matters he felt that stacy and even demorest occupied in other things had not his knowledge there was no idea or consciousness of heroically sacrificing himself or mrs horncastle in this i am afraid there was not even an idea of a superior morality in himself in giving up the possibility of loving her ever since stacy had first seen her he had fancied that stacy liked herindeed kitty fancied it tooand it seemed almost providential now that he should know how to assist his old partner to happiness for it was inconceivable that stacy should not be able to rescue this woman from her shameful bonds or that she should not consent to it through his barkers arguments and entreaties to a champion of dames this seemed only right and proper in his unfailing optimism he translated stacys laugh as embarrassment and demorests as only ignorance of the real question but demorest had noticed if he had not that stacys laugh was a little nervously prolonged for a man of his temperament and that he had cast a very keen glance at barker a messenger arriving with a telegram brought from boomville called stacy momentarily away and barker was not slow to take advantage of his absence  i wish phil he said hitching his chair closer to demorest that you would think seriously of this matter and try to persuade stacywho i believe is more interested in mrs horncastle than he cares to showto put a little of that determination in love that he has shown in business shes an awfully fine woman and in every way suited to him and he is letting an absurd sense of pride and honor keep him from influencing her to get rid of her impossible husband theres no reason continued barker in a burst of enthusiastic simplicity that because she has found some one she likes better and who would treat her better that she should continue to stick to that beast whom all california would gladly see her divorced from i never could understand that kind of argument could you  demorest looked at his companions glowing cheek and kindling eye with a smile a good deal depends upon the side from which you argue but frankly barker boy though i think i know you in all your phases i am not prepared yet to accept you as a matchmaker however ill think it over and find out something more of this from your goddess who seems to have bewitched you both but what does mistress kitty say to your admiration  barkers face clouded but instantly brightened oh theyre the best of friends theyre quite like us you know even to larks they have together he stopped and colored at his slip but demorest who had noticed his change of expression was more concerned at the look of half incredulity and half suspicion with which stacy who had reentered the room in time to hear barkers speech was regarding his unconscious younger partner  i didnt know that mrs horncastle and mrs barker were such friends he said dryly as he sat down again but his face presently became so abstracted that demorest said gayly  well jim im glad im not a napoleon of finance i couldnt stand it to have my privacy or my relaxation broken in upon at any moment as yours was just now what confounded somersault in stocks has put that face on you  stacy looked up quickly with his brief laugh im afraid youd be none the wiser if i told you that was a pony express messenger from new york you remember how barker that night of the strike when we were sitting together here or very near here proposed that we ought to have a password or a symbol to call us together in case of emergency for each others help well let us say i have two partners one in europe and one in new york that was my password  and i hope no more serious than ours added demorest  stacy laughed his short laugh nevertheless the conversation dragged again the feverish gayety of the early part of the evening was gone and they seemed to be suffering from the reaction they fell into their old attitudes looking from the firelight to the distant bulk of black spur without a word the occasional sound of the voices of promenaders on the veranda at last ceased there was the noise of the shutting of heavy doors below and barker rose  youll excuse me boys but i must go and say goodnight to little sta and see that hes all right i havent seen him since i got back butto demorestyoull see him tomorrow when kitty comes it is as much as my life is worth to show him before she certifies him as being presentable he paused and then added dont wait up you fellows for me sometimes the little chap wont let me go its as if he thought now kittys away i was all he had but ill be up early in the morning and see you i dare say you and stacy have a heap to say to each other on business and you wont miss me so ill say goodnight he laughed lightly pressed the hands of his partners in his usual hearty fashion and went out of the room leaving the gloom a little deeper than before it was so unusual for barker to be the first to leave anybody or anything in trouble that they both noticed it but for that said demorest turning to stacy as the door closed i should say the dear fellow was absolutely unchanged but he seemed a little anxious tonight  i shouldnt wonder hes got two women on his mindas if one was not enough  i dont understand you say his wife is foolish and this other  never mind that now interrupted stacy getting up and putting down his pipe lets talk a little business that other stuff will keep  by all means said demorest with a smile settling down into his chair a little wearily however i forgot business and i forgot my dear jim to congratulate you ive heard all about you even in new york youre the man who according to everybody now holds the finances of the pacific slope in his hands and he added leaning affectionately towards his old partner i dont know any one better equipped in honesty straightforwardness and courage for such a responsibility than you  i only wish said stacy looking thoughtfully at demorest that i didnt hold nearly a million of your money included in the finances of the pacific slope  why said the smiling demorest as long as i am satisfied  because i am not if youre satisfied im a wretched idiot and not fit for my position now look here phil when you wrote me to sell out your shares in the wheat trust i was a little staggered i knew your gait my boy and i knew too that while you didnt know enough to trust your own opinions or feeling you knew too much to trust any ones opinion that wasnt firstclass so i reckoned you had the straight tip but i didnt see it now i ought not to have been staggered if i was fit for your confidence or if i was staggered i ought to have had enough confidence in myself not to mind you see  i admit your logic old man said demorest with an amused face but i dont see your premises when did i tell you to sell out  two days ago you wrote just after you arrived  i have never written to you since i arrived i only telegraphed to you to know where we should meet and received your message to come here  you never wrote me from san francisco  never  stacy looked concernedly at his friend was he in his right mind he had heard of cases where melancholy brooding on a fixed idea had affected the memory he took from his pocket a lettercase and selecting a letter handed it to demorest without speaking  demorest glanced at it turned it over read its contents and in a grave voice said there is something wrong here it is like my handwriting but i never wrote the letter nor has it been in my hand before  stacy sprang to his side then its a forgery  wait a moment demorest who although very grave was the more collected of the two went to a writingdesk selected a sheet of paper and took up a pen now he said dictate that letter to me  stacy began demorests pen rapidly following him  dear jimon receipt of this get rid of my wheat trust shares at whatever figure you can from the way things pointed in new york  stop interrupted demorest  well said stacy impatiently  now my dear jim said demorest plaintively when did you ever know me to write such a sentence as the way things pointed  let me finish reading said stacy this literary sensitiveness at such a moment seemed little short of puerility to the man of business  from the way things pointed in new york continued stacy and from private advices received this seems to be the only prudent course before the feathers begin to fly longing to see you again and the dear old stampingground at heavy tree love to barker has the dear old boy been at any fresh crank lately  yours phil demorest  the dictation and copy finished together demorest laid the freshly written sheet beside the letter stacy had produced they were very much alike and yet quite distinct from each other only the signature seemed identical  thats the invariable mistake with the forger said demorest he always forgets that signatures ought to be identical with the text rather than with each other  but stacy did not seem to hear this or require further proof his face was quite gray and his lips compressed until lost in his closely set beard as he gazed fixedly out of the window for the first time really concerned and touched demorest laid his hand gently on his shoulder  tell me jim how much does this mean to you apart from me dont think of me  i dont know yet said stacy slowly thats the trouble and i wont know until i know whos at the bottom of it does anybody know of your affairs with me  no one  no confidential friend eh  none  no one who has access to your secrets nonowoman excuse me phil he said as a peculiar look passed over demorests face but this is business  no he returned with that gentleness that used to frighten them in the old days its ignorance you fellows always say cherchez la femme when you cant say anything else come now he went on more brightly look at the letter heres a man commercially educated for he has used the usual business formulas on receipt of this and advices received which i wont merely say i dont use but which few but commercial men use next heres a man who uses slang not only ineptly but artificially to give the letter the easy familiar turn it hasnt from beginning to end i need only say my dear stacy that i dont write slang to you but that nobody who understands slang ever writes it in that way and then the knowledge of my opinion of barker is such as might be gained from the reading of my letters by a person who couldnt comprehend my feelings now let me play inquisitor for a few moments has anybody access to my letters to you  no one i keep them locked up in a cabinet i only make memorandums of your instructions which i give to my clerks but never your letters  but your clerks sometimes see you make memorandums from them  yes but none of them have the ability to do this sort of thing nor the opportunity of profiting by it  has any womannow this is not retaliation my dear jim for i fancy i detect a womans cleverness and a womans stupidity in this forgeryany access to your secrets or my letters a womans villainy is always effective for the moment but always defective when probed  the look of scorn which passed over stacys face was quite as distinct as demorests previous protest as he said contemptuously im not such a fool as to mix up petticoats with my business whatever i do  well one thing more i have told you that in my opinion the forger has a commercial education or style that he doesnt know me nor barker and dont understand slang now i have to add what must have occurred to you jim that the forger is either a coward or his object is not altogether mercenary for the same ability displayed in this letter would on the signature alonehad it been on a check or drafthave drawn from your bank twenty times the amount concerned now what is the actual loss by this forgery  very little for youve got a good price for your stocks considering the depreciation in realizing suddenly on so large an amount i told my broker to sell slowly and in small quantities to avoid a panic but the real loss is the control of the stock  but the amount i had was not enough to affect that said demorest  no but i was carrying a large amount myself and together we controlled the market and now i have unloaded too  you sold out and with your doubts said demorest  thats just it said stacy looking steadily at his companions face because i had doubts and it wont do for me to have them i ought either to have disobeyed your letter and kept your stock and my own or have done just what i did i might have hedged on my own stock but i dont believe in hedging there is no middle course to a man in my business if he wants to keep at the top no great success no great power was ever created by it  demorest smiled yet you accept the alternative also which is ruin  precisely said stacy when you returned the other day you were bound to find me what i was or a beggar but nothing between however he added this has nothing to do with the forgery or he smiled grimly everything to do with it hush barker is coming  there was a quick step along the corridor approaching the room the next moment the door flew open to the bounding step and laughing face of barker whatever of thoughtfulness or despondency he had carried from the room with him was completely gone with his amazing buoyancy and power of reaction he was there again in his usual frank cheerful simplicity  i thought id come in and say goodnight he began with a laugh i got sta asleep after some high jinks we had together and then i reckoned it wasnt the square thing to leave just you two together the first night you came and i remembered i had some business to talk over too so i thought id chip in again and take a hand its only the shank of the evening yet he continued gayly and we ought to sit up at least long enough to see the old snowline vanish as we did in old times but i say he added suddenly as he glanced from the one to the other youve been having it pretty strong already why you both look as you did that night the backwater of the south fork came into our cabin whats up  nothing said demorest hastily as he caught a glance of stacys impatient face only all business is serious barker boy though you dont seem to feel it so  i reckon youre right there said barker with a chuckle people always laugh of course when i talk business so it might make it a little livelier for you and more of a change if i chipped in now only i dont know which youll do hand me a pipe well he continued filling the pipe demorest shoved towards him you see i was in sacramento yesterday and i went into van loos branch office as i heard he was there and i wanted to find out something about kittys investments which i dont think hes managing exactly right he wasnt there however but as i was waiting i heard his clerks talk about a drop in the wheat trust and that there was a lot of it put upon the market they seemed to think that something had happened and it was going down still further now i knew it was your pet scheme and that phil had a lot of shares in it too so i just slipped out and went to a brokers and told him to buy all he could of it and by jove i was a little taken aback when i found what i was in for for everybody seemed to have unloaded and i found i hadnt money enough to pay margins but i knew that demorest was here and i reckoned on his seeing me through he stopped and colored but added hopefully i reckon im safe anyway for just as the thing was over those same clerks of van loos came bounding into the office to buy up everything and offered to take it off my hands and pay the margins  and you said both men eagerly and in a breath  barker stared at them and reddened and paled by turns i held on he stammered you see boys  both men had caught him by the arms how much have you got they said shaking him as if to precipitate the answer  its a heap said barker its a ghastly lot now i think of it im afraid im in for fifty thousand if a cent  to his infinite astonishment and delight he was alternately hugged and tossed backwards and forwards between the two men quite in the fashion of the old days breathless but laughing he at length gasped out what does it all mean  tell him everything jimeverything said demorest quickly  stacy briefly related the story of the forgery and then laid the letter and its copy before him but barker only read the forgery  how could you stacyone of the three partners of heavy treebe deceived dont you see its phils handwritingbut it isnt phil  but have you any idea who it is said stacy  not me said barker with widely opened eyes you see it must be somebody whom we are familiar with i cant imagine such a scoundrel  how did you know that demorest had stock asked stacy  he told me in one of his letters and advised me to go into it but just then kitty wanted money i think and i didnt go in  i remember it struck in demorest but surely it was no secret my name would be on the transfer books for any one to see  not so said stacy quickly you were one of the original shareholders there was no transfer and the books as well as the shares of the company were in my hands  and your clerks added demorest  stacy was silent after a pause he asked did anybody ever see that letter barker  no one but myself and kitty  and would she be likely to talk of it continued stacy  of course not why should she whom could she talk to yet he stopped suddenly and then with his characteristic reaction added with a laugh why no certainly not  of course everybody knew that you had bought the shares at sacramento  yes why you know i told you the van loo clerks came to me and wanted to take it off my hands  yes i remember the van loo clerks they knew it of course said stacy with a grim smile well boys he said with sudden alacrity im going to turn in for by sunup tomorrow i must be on my way to catch the first train at the divide for frisco well hunt this thing down together for i reckon were all concerned in it he added looking at the others and once more were partners as in the old times let us even say that ive given barkers signal or password he added with a laugh and well stick together barker boy he went on grasping his younger partners hand your instinct has saved us this time dd if i dont sometimes think it better than any other mans sabe only he dropped his voice slightly i wish you had it in other things than finance phil ive a word to say to you alone before i go i may want you to follow me  but what can i do said barker eagerly youre not going to leave me out  youve done quite enough for us old man said stacy laying his hand on barkers shoulder and it may be for us to do something for you trot off to bed now like a good boy ill keep you posted when the time comes  shoving the protesting and leavetaking barker with paternal familiarity from the room he closed the door and faced demorest  hes the best fellow in the world said stacy quietly and has saved the situation but we mustnt trust too much to him for the presentnot even seem to  nonsense man said demorest impatiently youre letting your prejudices go too far do you mean to say that you suspect his wife  dn his wife said stacy almost savagely leave her out of this its van loo that i suspect it was van loo who i knew was behind it who expected to profit by it and now we have lost him  but how said demorest astonished  how repeated stacy impatiently you know what barker said van loo either through stupidity fright or the wish to get the lowest prices was too late to buy up the market if he had we might have openly declared the forgery and if it was known that he or his friends had profited by it even if we could not have proven his actual complicity we could at least have made it too hot for him in california but said stacy looking intently at his friend do you know how the case stands now  well said demorest a little uneasily under his friends keen eyes weve lost that chance but weve kept control of the stock  you think so well let me tell you how the case stands and the price we pay for it said stacy deliberately as he folded his arms and gazed at demorest you and i well known as old friends and former partners for no apparent reasonfor we cannot prove the forgery nowhave thrown upon the market all our stock with the usual effect of depreciating it another old friend and former partner has bought it in and sent up the price a common trick a vulgar trick but not a trick worthy of james stacy or stacys bank  but why not simply declare the forgery without making any specific charge against van loo  do you imagine phil that any man would believe it and the story of a providentially appointed friend like barker who saved us from loss why all california from cape mendocino to los angeles would roar with laughter over it no we must swallow it and the reputation of jockeying with the wheat trust too that trusts as good as done for for the present now you know why i didnt want poor barker to know it nor have much to do with our search for the forger  it would break the dear fellows heart if he knew it said demorest  well its to save him from having his heart broken further that i intend to find out this forger said stacy grimly goodnight phil ill telegraph to you when i want you and then come  with another grip of the hand he left demorest to his thoughts in the first excitement of meeting his old partners and in the later discovery of the forgery demorest had been diverted from his old sorrow and for the time had forgotten it in sympathetic interest with the present but to his horror when alone again he found that interest growing as remote and vapid as the stories they had laughed over at the table and even the excitement of the forged letter and its consequences began to be as unreal as impotent as shadowy as the memory of the attempted robbery in the old cabin on that very spot he was ashamed of that selfishness which still made him cling to this past so much his own that he knew it debarred him from the human sympathy of his comrades and even barker in whose courtship and marriage he had tried to resuscitate his youthful emotions and condone his selfish errorseven the suggestion of his unhappiness only touched him vaguely he would no longer be a slave to the past or the memory that had deluded him a few hours ago he walked to the window alas there was the same prospect that had looked upon his dreams had lent itself to his old visions there was the eternal outline of the hills there rose the steadfast pines there was no change in them it was this surrounding constancy of nature that had affected him he turned away and entered the bedroom here he suddenly remembered that the mother of this vague enemy van loofor his feeling towards him was still vague as few men really hate the personality they dont knowhad only momentarily vacated it and to his distaste of his own intrusion was now added the profound irony of his sleeping in the same bed lately occupied by the mother of the man who was suspected of having forged his name he smiled faintly and looked around the apartment it was handsomely furnished and although it still had much of the characterlessness of the hotel room it was distinctly flavored by its last occupant and still brightened by that mysterious instinct of the sex which is inevitable where a man would have simply left his forgotten slippers or collars there was a glass of still unfaded flowers the cold marble top of the dressingtable was littered with a few linen and silk toilet covers and on the mantelshelf was a sheaf of photographs he walked towards them mechanically glanced at them abstractedly and then stopped suddenly with a beating heart before him was the picture of his past the photograph of the one woman who had filled his life  he cast a hurried glance around the room as if he half expected to see the original start up before him and then eagerly seized it and hurried with it to the light yes yes it was sheshe as she had lived in his actual memory she as she had lived in his dream he saw her sweet eyes but the frightened innocent trouble had passed from them there was the sensitive elegance of her graceful figure in evening dress but the figure was fuller and maturer could he be mistaken by some wonderful resemblance acting upon his too willing brain he turned the photograph over no there on the other side written in her own childlike hand endeared and familiar to his recollection was her own name and the date it was surely she  how did it come there did the van loos know her it was taken in venice there was the address of the photographers the van loos were foreigners he remembered they had traveled perhaps had met her there in 1858 that was the date in her handwriting that was the date on the photographers address1858 suddenly he laid the photograph down took with trembling fingers a lettercase from his pocket opened it and laid his last letter to her indorsed with the cruel announcement of her death before him on the table he passed his hand across his forehead and opened the letter it was dated 1856 the photograph must have been taken two years after her alleged death  he examined it again eagerly fixedly tremblingly a wild impulse to summon barker or stacy on the spot was restrained with difficulty and only when he remembered that they could not help him then he began to oscillate between a joy and a new fear which now for the first time began to dawn upon him if the news of her death had been a fiendish trick of her relations why had she never sought him it was not ill health restraint nor fear there was nothing but happiness and the strength of youth and beauty in that face and figure he had not disappeared from the world he was known of men more his memorable good fortune must have reached her ears had he wasted all these miserable years to find himself abandoned forgotten perhaps even a dupe for the first time the sting of jealousy entered his soul perhaps unconsciously to himself his strange and varying feelings that afternoon had been the gathering climax of his mental condition at all events in the sudden revulsion there was a shaking off of his apathetic thought there was activity even if it was the activity of pain here was a mystery to be solved a secret to be discovered a past wrong to be exposed an enemy or perhaps even a faithless love to be punished perhaps he had even saved his reason at the expense of his love he quickly replaced the photograph on the mantelshelf returned the letter carefully to his pocketbookno longer a souvenir of the past but a proof of treacheryand began to mechanically undress himself he was quite calm now and went to bed with a strange sense of relief and slept as he had not slept since he was a boy  the whole hotel had sunk to rest by this time and then began the usual slow nightly invasion and investment of it by nature for all its broad verandas and glaring terraces its long ranges of windows and glittering crest of cupola and tower it gradually succumbed to the more potent influences around it and became their sport and playground the mountain breezes from the distant summit swept down upon its flimsy structure shook the great glass windows as with a strong hand and sent the balm of bay and spruce through every chink and cranny in the great hall and corridors the carpets billowed with the intruding blast along the floors there was the murmur of the pines in the passages and the damp odor of leaves in the diningroom there was the cry of night birds in the creaking cupola and the swift rush of dark wings past bedroom windows lissome shapes crept along the terraces between the stolid wooden statues or bolder scampered the whole length of the great veranda in the lulling of the wind the breath of the woods was everywhere even the aroma of swelling sapas if the ghastly stumps on the deforested slope behind the hotel were bleeding afresh in the dewless nightstung the eyes and nostrils of the sleepers  it was perhaps from such cause as this that barker was awakened suddenly by the voice of the boy from the crib beside him crying mamma mamma taking the child in his arms he comforted him saying she would come that morning and showed him the faint dawn already veiling with color the ghostly pallor of the sierras as they looked at it a great star shot forth from its brethren and fell it did not fall perpendicularly but seemed for some seconds to slip along the slopes of black spur gleaming through the trees like a chariot of fire it pleased the child to say that it was the light of mammas buggy that was fetching her home and it pleased the father to encourage the boys fancy and talking thus in confidential whispers they fell asleep once more the fatherhimself a child in so many thingsholding the smaller and frailer hand in his  they did not know that on the other side of the divide the wife and mother scared doubting and desperate by the side of her scared doubting and desperate accomplice was flying down the slope on her nightlong road to ruin still less did they know that with the early singing birds a careless horseman emerging from the trail as the duststained buggy dashed past him glanced at it with a puzzled air uttered a quiet whistle of surprise and then wheeling his horse gayly cantered after it     chapter v   in the exercise of his arduous profession jack hamlin had sat up all night in the magnolia saloon of the divide and as it was rather early to go to bed he had after his usual habit shaken off the sedentary attitude and prepared himself for sleep by a fierce preliminary gallop in the woods besides he had been a large winner and on those occasions he generally isolated himself from his companions to avoid foolish altercations with inexperienced players even in fighting jack was fastidious and did not like to have his stomach for a real difficulty distended and vitiated by small preliminary indulgences  he was just emerging from the wood into the highroad when a buggy dashed past him containing a man and a woman the woman wore a thick veil the man was almost undistinguishable from dust the glimpse was momentary but dislike has a keen eye and in that glimpse mr hamlin recognized van loo the situation was equally clear the bent heads and averted faces the dust collected in the heedlessness of haste the early hourindicating a nightlong flightall made it plain to him that van loo was running away with some woman mr hamlin had no moral scruples but he had the ethics of a sportsman which he knew mr van loo was not whether the woman was an innocent schoolgirl or an actress he was satisfied that van loo was doing a mean thing meanly mr hamlin also had a taste for mischief and whether the woman was or was not fair game he knew that for his purposes van loo was with the greatest cheerfulness in the world he wheeled his horse and cantered after them  they were evidently making for the divide and a fresh horse or to take the coach due an hour later it was mr hamlins present object to circumvent this and therefore it was quite in his way to return incidentally however the superior speed of his horse gave him the opportunity of frequently lunging towards them at a furious pace which had the effect of frantically increasing their own speed when he would pull up with a silent laugh before he was fairly discovered and allow the sound of his rapid horses hoofs to die out in this way he amused himself until the straggling town of the divide came in sight when putting his spurs to his horse again he managed under pretense of the animal becoming ungovernable to twice cross the bows of the fugitives compelling them to slacken speed at the second of these passages van loo apparently lost prudence and slashing out with his whip the lash caught slightly on the counter of hamlins horse mr hamlin instantly acknowledged it by lifting his hat gravely and speeded on to the hotel arriving at the steps and throwing himself from the saddle exactly as the buggy drove up with characteristic audacity he actually assisted the frightened and eager woman to alight and run into the hotel but in this action her veil was accidentally lifted mr hamlin instantly recognized the pretty woman who had been pointed out to him in san francisco as mrs barker the wife of one of the partners whose fortunes had interested him five years ago it struck him that this was an additional reason for his interference on barkers account although personally he could not conceive why a man should ever try to prevent a woman from running away from him but then mr hamlins personal experiences had been quite the other way  it was enough however to cause him to lay his hand lightly on van loos arm as the latter leaping down was about to follow mrs barker into the hotel youll have time enough now said hamlin  time for what said van loo savagely  time to apologize for having cut my horse with your whip said jack sweetly we dont want to quarrel before a woman  ive no time for fooling said van loo endeavoring to pass  but jacks hand had slipped to van loos wrist although he still smiled cheerfully ah then you did mean it and you propose to give me satisfaction  van loo paled slightly he knew jacks reputation as a duelist but he was desperate you see my position he said hurriedly im in a hurry i have a lady with me no man of honor  you do me wrong interrupted jack with a pained expressionyou do indeed you are in a hurrywell i have plenty of time if you cannot attend to me now why i will be glad to accompany you and the lady to the next station of course he added with a smile at a proper distance and without interfering with the lady whom i am pleased to recognize as the wife of an old friend it would be more sociable perhaps if we had some general conversation on the road it would prevent her being alarmed i might even be of some use to you if we are overtaken by her husband on the road for instance i should certainly claim the right to have the first shot at you boy he called to the hostler just sponge out panchos mouth will you to be ready when the buggy goes and loosening his grip of van loos wrist he turned away as the other quickly entered the hotel  but mr van loo did not immediately seek mrs barker he had already some experience of that ladys nerves and irascibility on the drive and had begun to see his error in taking so dangerous an impediment to his flight from the country and another idea had come to him he had already effected his purpose of compromising her with him in that flight but it was still known only to few if he left her behind for the foolish doting husband would not that devoted man take her back to avoid a scandal and even forbear to pursue him for his financial irregularities what were twenty thousand dollars of mrs barkers money to the scandal of mrs barkers elopement again the failure to realize the forgery had left him safe and barker was sufficiently potent with the bank and demorest to hush up that also hamlin was now the only obstacle to his flight but even he would scarcely pursue him if mrs barker were left behind and it would be easier to elude him if he did  in his preoccupation van loo did not see that he had entered the barroom but finding himself there he moved towards the bar a glass of spirits would revive him as he drank it he saw that the room was full of rough men apparently miners or packerssome of them mexican with here and there a kanaka or australian two men more ostentatiously clad though apparently on equal terms with the others were standing in the corner with their backs towards him from the general silence as he entered he imagined that he had been the subject of conversation and that his altercation with hamlin had been overheard suddenly one of the two men turned and approached him to his consternation he recognized steptoesteptoe whom he had not seen for five years until last night when he had avoided him in the courtyard of the boomville hotel his first instinct was to retreat but it was too late and the spirits had warmed him into temporary recklessness  you aint goin to be backed down by a shortcard gambler are yer said steptoe with coarse familiarity  i have a lady with me and am pressed for time said van loo quickly he knows it otherwise he would not have dared  well look here said steptoe roughly i aint particularly sweet on you as you know but i and these gentlemen he added glancing around the room aint particularly sweet on mr jack hamlin neither and we kalkilate to stand by you if you say so now i reckon you want to get away with the woman and the quicker the better as youre afraid therell be somebody after you afore long thats the way it pans out dont it well when youre ready to go and you just tip us the wink well get in a circle round jack and cover him and if he starts after you well send him on a little longer journeyeh boys  the men muttered their approval and one or two drew their revolvers from their belts van loos heart which had leaped at first at this proposal of help sank at this failure of his little plan of abandoning mrs barker he hesitated and then stammered thank you haste is everything with us now but i shouldnt mind leaving the lady among chivalrous gentlemen like yourselves for a few hours only until i could communicate with my friends and return to properly chastise this scoundrel  steptoe drew in his breath with a slight whistle and gazed at van loo he instantly understood him but the plea did not suit steptoe who for purposes of his own wished to put mrs barker beyond her husbands possible reach he smiled grimly i think youd better take the woman with you he said i dont think he added in a lower voice that the boys would like your leaving her theyre very hightoned they are he concluded ironically  then said van loo with another desperate idea could you not let us have saddlehorses instead of the buggy we could travel faster and in the event of pursuit and anything happening to me he added loftily she at least could escape her pursuers vengeance  this suited steptoe equally well as long as the guilty couple fled together and in the presence of witnesses but he was not deceived by van loos heroic suggestion of selfsacrifice quite right he said sarcastically it shall be done and ive no doubt one of you will escape ill send the horses round to the back door and keep the buggy in front that will keep jack there toowith the boys handy  but mr hamlin had quite as accurate an idea of mr van loos methods and of his own standing with steptoes gang of roughs as mr steptoe himself more than that he also had a hold on a smaller but more devoted and loyal following than steptoes the employees and hostlers of the hotel worshiped him a single word of inquiry revealed to him the fact that the buggy was not going on but that mr van loo and mrs barker wereon two horses a temporary sidesaddle having been constructed out of a mules packtree at which mr hamlin with his usual audacity walked into the barroom and going to the bar leaned carelessly against it then turning to the lowering faces around him he said with a flash of his white teeth well boys im calculating to leave the divide in a few minutes to follow some friends in the buggy and it seems to me only the square thing to stand the liquor for the crowd without prejudice to any feeling or roughness there may be against me everybody who knows me knows that im generally there when the band plays and im pretty sure to turn up for that sort of thing so youll just consider that ive had a good game on the divide and im reckoning its only fair to leave a little of it behind me here to sweeten the pot until i call again i only ask you gentlemen to drink success to my friends in the buggy as early and as often as you can he flung two gold pieces on the counter and paused smiling  he was right in his conjecture even the men who would have willingly held him up a moment after at the bidding of steptoe saw no reason for declining a free drink without prejudice and it was a part of the irony of the situation that steptoe and van loo were also obliged to participate to keep in with their partisans it was however an opportune diversion to van loo who managed to get nearer the door leading to the back entrance of the hotel and to mr jack hamlin who was watching him as the men closed up to the bar  the toast was drunk with acclamation followed by another and yet another steptoe and van loo who had kept their heads cool were both wondering if hamlins intention were to intoxicate and incapacitate the crowd at the crucial moment and steptoe smiled grimly over his superior knowledge of their alcoholic capacity but suddenly there was the greater diversion of a shout from the road the oncoming of a cloud of red dust and the halt of another vehicle before the door this time it was no jaded single horse and duststained buggy but a double team of four spirited trotters whose coats were scarcely turned with foam before a light station wagon containing a single man but that man was instantly recognized by every one of the outside loungers and stableboys as well as the staring crowd within the saloon it was james stacy the millionaire and banker no one but himself knew that he had covered half the distance of a nightlong ride from boomville in two hours but before they could voice their astonishment stacy had thrown a letter to the obsequious landlord and then gathering up the reins had sped away to the railroad station half a mile distant  looks as if the boss of creation was in a hurry said one of the eager gazers in the doorway somebody goin to get smashed sure  more like as if he was just humpin himself to keep from getting smashed said steptoe the bank hasnt got over the effect of their smart deal in the wheat trust everything they had in their hands tumbled yesterday in sacramento men like me and you aint goin to trust their money to be jockeyed with in that style nobody but a man with a swelled head like stacy would have even dared to try it on and now by gd hes got to pay for it  the harsh exultant tone of the speaker showed that he had quite forgotten van loo and hamlin in his superior hatred of the millionaire and both men noticed it van loo edged still nearer to the door as steptoe continued ever since he made that big strike on heavy tree five years ago the country hasnt been big enough to hold him but mark my words gentlemen the time aint far off when hell find a twofoot ditch again and a pick and grub wages room enough and to spare for him and his kind of cattle  youre not drinking said jack hamlin cheerfully  steptoe turned towards the bar and then started wheres van loo he demanded of jack sharply  jack jerked his thumb over his shoulder gone to hurry up his girl i reckon i calculate he aint got much time to fool away here  steptoe glanced suspiciously at jack but at the same moment they were all startledeven jack himselfat the apparition of mrs barker passing hurriedly along the veranda before the windows in the direction of the still waiting buggy dn it said steptoe in a fierce whisper to the man next him tell her not thereat the back door but before the messenger reached the door there was a sudden rattle of wheels and with one accord all except hamlin rushed to the veranda only to see mrs barker driving rapidly away alone steptoe turned back into the room but jack also had disappeared  for in the confusion created at the sight of mrs barker he had slipped to the back door and found as he suspected only one horse and that with a sidesaddle on his intuitions were right van loo when he disappeared from the saloon had instantly fled taking the other horse and abandoning the woman to her fate jack as instantly leaped upon the remaining saddle and dashed after him presently he caught a glimpse of the fugitive in the distance heard the halfangry halfironical shouts of the crowd at the back door and as he reached the hilltop saw with a mingling of satisfaction and perplexity mrs barker on the other road still driving frantically in the direction of the railroad station at which mr hamlin halted threw away his encumbering saddle and good rider that he was remounted the horse barebacked but for his blanketpad and thrusting his knees in the loose girths again dashed forwardswith such good results that as van loo galloped up to the stagecoach office at the next station and was about to enter the waiting coach for marysville the soft hand of mr hamlin was laid on his shoulder  i told you said jack blandly that i had plenty of time i would have been here before and even overtaken you only you had the better horse and the only saddle  van loo recoiled but he was now desperate and reckless beckoning jack out of earshot of the other passengers he said with tightened lips why do you follow me what is your purpose in coming here  i thought said hamlin dryly that i was to have the pleasure of getting satisfaction from you for the insult you gave me  well and if i apologize for it what then he said quickly  hamlin looked at him quietly well i think i also said something about the lady being the wife of a friend of mine  and i have left her behind her husband can take her back without disgrace for no one knows of her flight but you and me do you think your shooting me will save her it will spread the scandal far and wide for i warn you that as i have apologized for what you choose to call my personal insult unless you murder me in cold blood without witness i shall let them know the reason of your quarrel and i can tell you more if you only succeed in stopping me here and make me lose my chance of getting away the scandal to your friend will be greater still  mr hamlin looked at van loo curiously there was a certain amount of conviction in what he said he had never met this kind of creature before he had surpassed even hamlins first intuition of his character he amused and interested him but mr hamlin was also a man of the world and knew that van loos reasoning might be good he put his hands in his pockets and said gravely what is your little game  van loo had been seized with another inspiration of desperation steptoe had been partly responsible for this situation van loo knew that jack and steptoe were not friends he had certain secrets of steptoes that might be of importance to jack why should he not try to make friends with this powerful freelance and halfoutlaw  its a game he said significantly that might be of interest to your friends to hear  hamlin took his hands out of his pockets turned on his heel and said come with me  but i must go by that coach now said van loo desperately orive told you what would happen  come with me said jack coolly if im satisfied with what you tell me ill put you down at the next station an hour before that coach gets there  you swear it said van loo hesitatingly  ive said it returned jack come and van loo followed mr hamlin into the station hotel     chapter vi   the abrupt disappearance of jack hamlin and the strange lady and gentleman visitor was scarcely noticed by the other guests of the divide house and beyond the circle of steptoe and his friends who were a distinct party and strangers to the town there was no excitement indeed the hotel proprietor might have confounded them together and perhaps van loo was not far wrong in his belief that their identity had not been suspected nor were steptoes followers very much concerned in an episode in which they had taken part only at the suggestion of their leader and which had terminated so tamely that they would have liked a row in which jack hamlin would have been incidentally forced to disgorge his winnings there was no doubt but that their interference was asked solely to gratify some personal spite of steptoes against van loo was equally plain to them there was some grumbling and outspoken criticism of his methods  this was later made more obvious by the arrival of another guest for whom steptoe and his party were evidently waiting he was a short stout man whose heavy red beard was trimmed a little more carefully than when he was first known to steptoe as alky hall the drunkard of heavy tree hill his dress too exhibited a marked improvement in quality and style although still characterized in the waist and chest by the unbuttoned freedom of portly and slovenly middle age civilization had restricted his potations or limited them to certain festivals known as sprees and his face was less puffy and sodden but with the accession of sobriety he had lost his good humor and had the irritability and intolerance of virtuous restraint  ye neednt ladle out any of your fortyrod whiskey to me he said querulously to steptoe as he filed out with the rest of the party through the barroom into the adjacent apartment i want to keep my head level till our business is over and i reckon it wouldnt hurt you and your gang to do the same theyre less likely to blab and there are few doors that whiskey wont unlock he added as steptoe turned the key in the door after the party had entered  the room had evidently been used for meetings of directors or political caucuses and was roughly furnished with notched and whittled armchairs and a single long deal table on which were ink and pens the men sat down around it with a halfembarrassed halfcontemptuous attitude of formality their bent brows and isolated looks showing little community of sentiment and scarcely an attempt to veil that individual selfishness that was prominent still less was there any essay of companionship or sympathy in the manner of steptoe as he suddenly rapped on the table with his knuckles  gentlemen he said with a certain deliberation of utterance as if he enjoyed his own coarse directness i reckon you all have a sort of general idea what you were picked up for or you wouldnt be here but you may or may not know that for the present you are honest hardworking minersthe backbone of the state of californyand that you have formed yourselves into a company called the blue jay and youve settled yourselves on the bar below heavy tree hill on a deserted claim of the marshall brothers not half a mile from where the big strike was made five years ago thats what you are gentlemen thats what youll continue to be until the jobs finished and he added with a sudden dominance that they all felt the man who forgets it will have to reckon with me now he continued resuming his former ironical manner now what are the cold facts of the case the marshalls worked this claim ever since 49 and never got anything out of it then they dropped off or died out leaving only one brother tom marshall to work what was left of it well a few days ago he found indications of a big lead in the rock and instead of rushin out and yellin like an honest man and callin in the boys to drink he sneaks off to frisco and goes to the bank to get em to take a hand in it well you know when jim stacy takes a hand in anything its both hands and the bank wouldnt see it until he promised to guarantee possession of the whole abandoned claimdips spurs and anglesand let them work the whole thing which the dd fool did and the bank agreed to send an expert down there tomorrow to report but while he was away some one on our side who was an expert also got wind of it and made an examination all by himself and found it was a vein sure enough and a big thing and some one else on our side found out too all that marshall had promised the bank and what the bank had promised him now gentlemen when the bank sends down that expert tomorrow i expect that he will find you in possession of every part of the deserted claim except the spot where tom is still working  and what good is that to us asked one of the men contemptuously  good repeated steptoe harshly well if youre not as dd a fool as marshall youll see that if he has struck a lead or vein its bound to run across our claims and whats to keep us from sinking for it as long as marshall hasnt worked the other claims for years nor preempted them for this lead  whatll keep him from preempting now  our possession  but if he can prove that the brothers left their claims to him to keep hell just send the sheriff and his posse down upon us persisted the first speaker  it will take him three months to do that by law and the sheriff and his posse cant do it before as long as were in peaceable possession of it and by the time that expert and marshall return theyll find us in peaceful possession unless were such blasted fools as to stay talking about it here  but whats to prevent marshall from getting a gang of his own to drive us off  now your talkin and not yelpin said steptoe with slow insolence dd if i didnt begin to think you kalkilated i was goin to employ you as lawyers nothing is to prevent him from gettin up his gang and we hope hell do it for you see it puts us both on the same level before the law for were both breakin it and we kalkilate that were as good as any roughs they can pick up at heavy tree  i reckon ye can count us in said half a dozen voices eagerly  but whats the job goin to pay us persisted a sydney man an arter weve beat off this other gang are we going to scrub along on grub wages until were yanked out by processsarvers three months later if thats the ticket im not in it i arent no by quartz miner  we aint going to do no more mining there than the bank said steptoe fiercely and the bank aint going to wait no three months for the end of the lawsuit theyll float the stock of that mine for a couple of millions and get out of it with a million before a month and theyll have to buy us off to do that what theyll pay will depend upon the lead but we dont move off those claims for less than five thousand dollars which will be two hundred and fifty dollars to each man but said steptoe in a lower but perfectly distinct voice if there should be a rowand they begin itand in the scuffle tom marshall their only witness should happen to get in the way of a revolver or have his head caved in there might be some difficulty in their holdin any of the mine against honest hardworking miners in possession you hear me  there was a breathless silence for the moment and a slight movement of the men in their chairs but never in fear or protest every one had heard the speaker distinctly and every man distinctly understood him some of them were criminals one or two had already the stain of blood on their hands but even the most timid who at other times might have shrunk from suggested assassination saw in the speakers words only the fair removal of a natural enemy  all right boys im ready to wade in at once why aint we on the road now we might have been but for foolin our time away on that man van loo  van loo repeated hall eagerlyvan loo was he here  yes said steptoe shortly administering a kick under the table to hall as he had no wish to revive the previous irritability of his comrades hes gone but turning to the others youd have had to wait for mr halls arrival anyhow and now youve got your order you can start go in two parties by different roads and meet on the other side of the hotel at hymettus ill be there before you pick up some shovels and drills as you go remember youre honest miners but dont forget your shootinirons for all that now scatter  it was well that they did vacating the room more cheerfully and sympathetically than they had entered it or halls manifest disturbance over van loos visit would have been noticed when the last man had disappeared hall turned quickly to steptoe well what did he say where has he gone  dont know said steptoe with uneasy curtness he was running away with a womanwell mrs barker if you want to know he added with rising anger the wife of one of those cursed partners jack hamlin was here and was jockeying to stop him and interfered but what the devil has that job to do with our job he was losing his temper everything seemed to turn upon this infernal van loo  he wasnt running away with mrs barker gasped hallit was with her money and the fear of being connected with the wheat trust swindle which he organized and with our money which i lent him for the same purpose and he knows all about that job for i wanted to get him to go into it with us your name and mine aint any too sweetsmelling for the bank and we ought to have a middleman who knows business to arrange with them the bank darent object to him for theyve employed him in even shadier transactions than this when they didnt wish to appear i knew he was in difficulties along with mrs barkers speculations but i never thought him up to this and he added with sudden desperation you trusted him too  in an instant steptoe caught the frightened man by the shoulders and was bearing him down on the table are you a traitor a liar or a besotted fool he said hoarsely speak when and where did i trust him  you said in your notei wastohelp him gasped hall  my note repeated steptoe releasing hall with astonished eyes  yes said hall tremblingly searching in his vest pocket i brought it with me it isnt much of a note but theres your signature plain enough  he handed steptoe a torn piece of paper folded in a threecornered shape steptoe opened it he instantly recognized the paper on which he had written his name and sent up to his wife at the boomville hotel but added to it in apparently the same hand in smaller characters were the words help van loo all you can  the blood rushed into his face but he quickly collected himself and said hurriedly all right i had forgotten it let the dd sneak go weve got whats a thousand times better in this claim at marshalls and its well that he isnt in it to scoop the lions share only we must not waste time getting there now you go there first and at once and set those rascals to work ill follow you before marshall comes up get ill settle up here  his face darkened once more as hall hurried away leaving him alone he drew out the piece of paper from his pocket and stared at it again yes it was the one he had sent to his wife how did van loo get hold of it was he at the hotel that night had he picked it up in the hall or passage when the servant dropped it when hall handed him the paper and he first recognized it a fiendish thought followed by a spasm of more fiendish rage had sent the blood to his face but his crude common sense quickly dismissed that suggestion of his wifes complicity with van loo but had she seen him passing through the hotel that night and had sought to draw from him some knowledge of his early intercourse with the child and confessed everything and even produced the paper with his signature as a proof of identity women had been known to do such desperate things perhaps she disbelieved her sons aversion to her and was trying to sound van loo as for the forged words by van loo and the use he had put them to he cared little he believed the man was capable of forgery indeed he suddenly remembered that in the old days his son had spoken innocently but admiringly of van loos wonderful chirographical powers and his faculty of imitating the writings of others and how he had even offered to teach him a new and exasperating thought came into his feverish consciousness what if van loo in teaching the boy had even made use of him as an innocent accomplice to cover up his own tricks the suggestion was no question of moral ethics to steptoe nor of his sons possible contamination although since the night of the big strike he had held different views it was simply a fierce selfish jealousy that another might have profited by the lads helplessness and inexperience he had been tormented by this jealousy before in his sons liking for van loo he had at first encouraged his admiration and imitative regard for this smooth swindlers graces and accomplishments which though he scorned them himself he was after the common parental infatuation willing that the boy should profit by incapable through his own consciousness of distinguishing between van loos superficial polish and the true breeding of a gentleman he had only looked upon it as an equipment for his son which might be serviceable to himself he had told his wife the truth when he informed her of van loos fears of being reminded of their former intimacy but he had not told her how its discontinuance after they had left heavy tree hill had affected her son and how he still cherished his old admiration for that specious rascal nor had he told her how this had stung him through his own selfish greed of the boys affection yet now that it was possible that she had met van loo that evening she might have become aware of van loos power over her child how she would exult for all her pretended hatred of van loo how perhaps they had plotted together how van loo might have become aware of the place where his son was kept and have been bribed by the mother to tell her he stopped in a whirl of giddy fancies his strong common sense in all other things had been hitherto proof against such idle dreams or suggestions but the very strength of his parental love and jealousy had awakened in him at last the terrors of imagination  his first impulse had been to seek his wife regardless of discovery or consequences at hymettus where she had said she was going it was on his way to the rendezvous at marshalls claim but this he as instantly set aside it was his son he must find she might not confess or might deceive himthe boy would not and if his fears were correct she could be arraigned afterwards it was possible for him to reach the little mission church and school secluded in a remote valley by the old franciscan fathers where he had placed the boy for the last few years unknown to his wife it would be a long ride but he could still reach heavy tree hill afterwards before marshall and the expert arrived and he had a feeling he had never felt before on the eve of a desperate adventurethat he must see the boy first he remembered how the child had often accompanied him in his flight and how he had gained strength and it seemed to him a kind of luck from the touch of that small hand in his surely it was necessary now that at least his mind should be at rest regarding him on the eve of an affair of this moment perhaps he might never see him again at any other time and under the influence of any other emotion he would have scorned such a sentimentalismhe who had never troubled himself either with preparation for the future or consideration for the past but at that moment he felt both he drew a long breath he could catch the next train to the three boulders and ride thence to san felipe he hurriedly left the room settled with the landlord and galloped to the station by the irony of circumstances the only horse available for that purpose was mr hamlins own  by two oclock he was at the three boulders where he got a fast horse and galloped into san felipe by four as he descended the last slope through the fastnesses of pines towards the little valley overlooked in its remoteness and purely pastoral simplicity by the goldseeking immigrantsits seclusion as one of the furthest northern californian missions still preserved through its insignificance and the efforts of the remaining brotherhood who used it as an infirmary and a school for the few remaining spanish familieshe remembered how he once blundered upon it with the boy while hotly pursued by a hue and cry from one of the larger towns and how he found sanctuary there he remembered how when the pursuit was over he had placed the boy there under the padres charge he had lied to his wife regarding the whereabouts of her son but he had spoken truly regarding his free expenditure for the boys maintenance and the good fathers had accepted equally for the childs sake as for the churchs sake the generous restitution which this coarse powerful ruffianly looking father was apparently seeking to make he was quite aware of it at the time and had equally accepted it with grim cynicism but it now came back to him with a new and smarting significance might they too not succeed in weaning the boys affection from him or if the mother had interfered would they not side with her in claiming an equal right he had sometimes laughed to himself over the security of this hidingplace so unknown and so unlikely to be discovered by her yet within easy reach of her friends and his enemies he now ground his teeth over the mistake which his doting desire to keep his son accessible to him had caused him to make he put spurs to his horse dashed down the little narrow illpaved street through the deserted plaza and pulled up in a cloud of dust before the only remaining tower with its cracked belfry of the halfruined mission church a new dormitory and schoolbuilding had been extended from its walls but in a subdued harmonious modest way quite unlike the usual glaring whitepine glories of provincial towns steptoe laughed to himself bitterly some of his money had gone in it  he seized the horsehair rope dangling from a bell by the wall and rang it sharply a softfooted priest appearedfather dominico eddy horncastle ah yes eddy dear child is gone  gone shouted steptoe in a voice that startled the padre where when with whom  pardon senor but for a timeonly a pasear to the next village it is his saints dayhe has halfholiday he is a good boy it is a little pleasure for him and for us  oh said steptoe softened into a rough apology i forgot all right has he had any visitors latelylady for instance  father dominico cast a look half of fright half of reproval upon his guest  a lady here  in his relief steptoe burst into a coarse laugh of course you see i forgot that too i was thinking of one of his woman folks you knowrelativesaunts was there any other visitor  only one ah we know the senors rules regarding his son  one repeated steptoe who was it  oh quite an hidalgoan old friend of the childsmost polite most accomplished fluent in spanish perfect in deportment the senor horncastle surely could find nothing to object to father pedro was charmed with him a man of affairs and yet a good catholic too it was a senor van loodon paul the boy called him and they talked of the boys studies in the old days as ifindeed but for the stranger being a caballero and man of the worldas if he had been his teacher  it was a proof of the intensity of the fathers feelings that they had passed beyond the power of his usual coarse brutal expression and he only stared at the priest with a dull red face in which the blood seemed to have stagnated presently he said thickly when did he come  a few days ago  which way did eddy go  to browns mills scarcely a league away he will be hereeven nowon the instant but the senor will come into the refectory and take some of the old mission wine from the catalan grape planted one hundred and fifty years ago until the dear child returns he will be so happy  no im in a hurry i will go on and meet him he took off his hat mopped his crisp wet hair with his handkerchief and in a thick slow impeded voice more suggestive than the outburst he restrained said and as long as my son remains here that man van loo must not pass this gate speak to him or even see him you hear me see to it you and all the others see to it i say orhe stopped abruptly clapped his hat on the swollen veins of his forehead turned quickly passed out without another word through the archway into the road and before the good priest could cross himself or recover from his astonishment the thud of his horses hoofs came from the dusty road  it was ten minutes before his face resumed its usual color but in that ten minutes as if some of the struggle of his rider had passed into him his horse was sweating with exhaustion and fear for in that ten minutes in this new imagination with which he was cursed he had killed both van loo and his son and burned the refectory over the heads of the treacherous priests then quite himself again a voice came to him from the rocky trail above the road with the hail of father he started quickly as a lad of fifteen or sixteen came bounding down the hillside and ran towards him  you passed me and i called to you but you did not seem to hear said the boy breathlessly then i ran after you have you been to the mission  steptoe looked at him quite as breathlessly but from a deeper emotion he was even at first sight a handsome lad glowing with youth and the excitement of his run and as the father looked at him he could see the likeness to his mother in his clearcut features and even a resemblance to himself in his square compact chest and shoulders and crisp black curls a thrill of purely animal paternity passed over him the fierce joy of his flesh over his own flesh his own son by god they could not take that from him they might plot swindle fawn cheat lie and steal away his affections but there he was plain to all eyes his own son his very son  come here he said in a singular halfweary and halfprotesting voice which the boy instantly recognized as his fathers accents of affection  the boy hesitated as he stood on the edge of the road and pointed with mingled mischief and fastidiousness to the depths of impalpable red dust that lay between him and the horseman steptoe saw that he was very smartly attired in holiday guise with white duck trousers and patent leather shoes and after the spanish fashion wore black kid gloves he certainly was a bit of a dandy as he had said the fathers whole face changed as he wheeled and came before the lad who lifted up his arms expectantly they had often ridden together on the same horse  no rides today in that toggery eddy he said in the same voice but ill get down and well go and sit somewhere under a tree and have some talk ive got a bit of a job thats hurrying me and i cant waste time  not one of your old jobs father i thought you had quite given that up  the boy spoke more carelessly than reproachfully or even wonderingly yet as he dismounted and tethered his horse steptoe answered evasively its a big thing sonny maybe well make our eternal fortune and then well light out from this hole and have a gay time elsewhere come along  he took the boys gloved right hand in his own powerful grasp and together they clambered up the steep hillside to a rocky ledge on which a fallen pine from above had crashed snapped itself in twain and then left its withered crown to hang half down the slope while the other half rested on the ledge on this they sat looking down upon the road and the tethered horse a gentle breeze moved the treetops above their heads and the westering sun played hideandseek with the shifting shadows the boys face was quick and alert with all that moved round him but without thought the fathers face was heavy except for the eyes that were fixed upon his son  van loo came to the mission he said suddenly  the boys eyes glittered quickly like a steel that pierced the fathers heart oh he said simply then it was the padre told you  how did he know you were here asked steptoe  i dont know said the boy quietly i think he said something but ive forgotten it but it was mighty good of him to come for i thought you know that he did not care to see me after heavy tree and that hed gone back on us  what did he tell you continued steptoe did he talk of me or of your mother  no said the boy but without any show of interest or sympathy we talked mostly about old times  tell me about those old times eddy you never told me anything about them  the boy momentarily arrested more by something in the tone of his fathers voicea weakness he had never noticed beforethan by any suggestion of his words said with a laugh oh only about what we used to do when i was very little and used to call myself his little brotherdont you remember long before the big strike on heavy tree they were gay times we had then  and how he used to teach you to imitate other peoples handwriting said steptoe  what made you think of that pop said the boy with a slight wonder in his eyes why thats the very thing we did talk about  but you didnt do it again you aint done it since said steptoe quickly  lord no said the boy contemptuously there aint no chance now and there wouldnt be any fun in it it isnt like the old times when him and me were all alone and we used to write letters as coming from other people to all the boys round heavy tree and the bar and sometimes as far as boomville to get them to do things and theyd think the letters were real and theyd do em and thered be the biggest kind of a row and nobody ever knew who did it  steptoe stared at this flesh of his own flesh half in relief half in frightened admiration sitting astride the log his elbows on his knees and his gloved hands supporting his round cheeks the boys handsome face became illuminated with an impish devilry which the father had never seen before with dancing eyes he went on it was one of those very games we played so long ago that he wanted to see me about and wanted me to keep mum about for some of the folks that he played it on were around here now it was a game we got off on one of the big strike partners long before the strike ill tell you dad for you know what happened afterwards and youll be glad well that partnerdemorestwas a kind of silly you remembera sort of miss nancyish fellowalways gloomy and lovesick after his girl in the states well wed written lots of letters to girls from their chaps before and got lots of fun out of it but we had even a better show for a game here for it happened that van loo knew all about the girlthings that even the mans own partners didnt for van loos mother was a sort of a friend of the girls family and traveled about with her and knew that the girl was spoony over this demorest and that they corresponded so knowing that van loo was employed at heavy tree she wrote to him to find out all about demorest and how to stop their foolish nonsense for the girls parents didnt want her to marry a brokendown miner like him so we thought wed do it our own way and write a letter to her as if it was from him dont you see i wanted to make him call her awful names and say that he hated her that he was a murderer and a horsethief and that he had killed a policeman and that he was thinking of becoming a digger injin and having a digger squaw for a wife which he liked better than her lord dad you ought to have seen what stuff i made up the boy burst into a shrill halffeminine laugh and steptoe catching the infection laughed loudly in his own coarse brutal fashion  for some moments they sat there looking in each others faces shaking with sympathetic emotion the father forgetting the purpose of his coming there his rage over van loos visit and even the rendezvous to which his horse in the road below was waiting to bring him the son forgetting their retreat from heavy tree hill and his shameful vagabond wanderings with that father in the years that followed the sinking sun stared blankly in their faces the protecting pines above them moved by a stronger gust shook a few cones upon them an enormous crow mockingly repeated the fathers coarse laugh and a squirrel scampered away from the strangely assorted pair as steptoe wiping his eyes and forehead with his pockethandkerchief said  and did you send it  oh van loo thought it too strong said that those sort of lovesick fools made more fuss over little things than they did over big things and he sort of toned it down and fixed it up himself but it told for there were never any more letters in the postoffice in her handwriting and there wasnt any posted to her in his  they both laughed again and then steptoe rose i must be getting along he said looking curiously at the boy ive got to catch a train at three boulders station  three boulders repeated the boy im going there too on friday to meet father cipriano  i reckon my work will be all done by friday said steptoe musingly standing thus holding his boys hand he was thinking that the real fight at marshalls would not take place at once for it might take a day or two for marshall to gather forces but he only pressed his sons hand gently  i wish you would sometimes take me with you as you used to said the boy curiously im bigger now and wouldnt be in your way  steptoe looked at the boy with a choking sense of satisfaction and pride but he said no and then suddenly with simulated humor dont you be taken in by any letters from me such as you and van loo used to write you hear  the boy laughed  and continued steptoe if anybody says i sent for you dont you believe them  no said the boy smiling  and dont you even believe im dead till you see me so you understand by the way father pedro has some money of mine kept for you now hurry back to school and say you met me but that i was in a great hurry i reckon i may have been rather rough to the priests  they had reached the lower road again and steptoe silently unhitched his horse goodby he said as he laid his hand on the boys arm  goodby dad  he mounted his horse slowly well he said smilingly looking down the road you aint got anything more to say to me have you  no dad  nothin you want  nothin dad  all right goodby  he put spurs to his horse and cantered down the road without looking back the boy watched him with idle curiosity until he disappeared from sight and then went on his way whistling and striking off the heads of the wayside weeds with his walkingstick     chapter vii   the sun arose so brightly over hymettus on the morning after the meeting of the three partners that it was small wonder that barkers impressionable nature quickly responded to it and without awakening the still sleeping child he dressed hurriedly and was the first to greet it in the keen air of the slope behind the hotel to his pantheistic spirit it had always seemed as natural for him to early welcome his returning brothers of the woods and hills as to say goodmorning to his fellow mortals and in the joy of seeing black spur rising again to his level in the distance before him he doffed his hat to it with a return of his old boyish habit laid his arm caressingly around the great girth of the nearest pine clapped his hands to the scampering squirrels in his path and whistled to the dipping jays in this way he quite forgot the more serious affairs of the preceding night or rather saw them only in the gilding of the morning until looking up he perceived the tall figure of demorest approaching him and then it struck him with his first glance at his old partners face that his usual suave gentle melancholy had been succeeded by a critical cynicism of look and a restrained bitterness of accent barkers loyal heart smote him for his own selfishness demorest had been hard hit by the discovery of the forgery and stacys concern in it and had doubtless passed a restless night while he barker had forgotten all about it i thought of knocking at your door as i passed he said with sympathetic apology but i was afraid i might disturb you isnt it glorious here quite like the old hill look at that lizard he hasnt moved since he first saw me do you remember the one who used to steal our sugar and then stiffen himself into stone on the edge of the bowl until he looked like an ornamental handle to it he continued rebounding again into spirits  barker said demorest abruptly what sort of woman is this mrs van loo whose rooms i occupy  oh said barker with optimistic innocence a most proper woman old chap whitehaired welldressed with a little foreign accent and a still more foreign courtesy why you dont suppose wed  but what is she like said demorest impatiently  well said barker thoughtfully shes the kind of woman who might be van loos mother i suppose  you mean the mother of a forger and a swindler asked demorest sharply  there are no mothers of swindlers and forgers said barker gravely in the way you mean its only those poor devils he said pointing nevertheless with a certain admiration to a circling sparrowhawk above him who have inherited instincts what i mean is that she might be van loos mother because he didnt select her  where did she come from and how long has she been here asked demorest  she came from abroad i believe and she came here just after you left van loo after he became secretary of the ditch company sent for her and her daughter to keep house for him but youll see her today or tomorrow probably when she returns ill introduce you shell be rather glad to meet some one from abroad and all the more if he happens to be rich and distinguished and eligible for her daughter he stopped suddenly in his smile remembering demorests lifelong secret but to his surprise his companions face instead of darkening as it was wont to do at any such allusion brightened suddenly with a singular excitement as he answered dryly ah well if the girl is pretty who knows  indeed his spirits seemed to have returned with strange vivacity as they walked back to the hotel and he asked many other questions regarding mrs van loo and her daughter and particularly if the daughter had also been abroad when they reached the veranda they found a few early risers eagerly reading the sacramento papers which had just arrived or in little knots discussing the news indeed they would probably have stopped barker and his companion had not barker anxious to relieve his friends curiosity hurried with him at once to the managers office  can you tell me exactly when you expect mrs van loo to return asked barker quickly  the manager with difficulty detached himself from the newspaper which he too was anxiously perusing and said with a peculiar smile well no she was to return today but if youre wanting to keep her rooms i should say there wouldnt be any trouble about it as shell hardly be coming back here now shes rather high and mighty in style i know and a determined sort of critter but i reckon she and her daughter wouldnt care much to be waltzing round in public after what has happened  i dont understand you said demorest impatiently what has happened  havent you heard the news said the manager in surprise its in all the sacramento papers van loo is a defaulterhas hypothecated everything he had and skedaddled  barker started he was not thinking of the loss of his wifes moneyonly of her disappointment and mortification over it poor girl perhaps she was also worrying over his resentmentas if she did not know him he would go to her at once at boomville then he remembered that she was coming with mrs horncastle and might be already on her way here by rail or coach and he would miss her demorest in the meantime had seized a paper and was intently reading it  theres bad news too for your friend your old partner said the manager half sympathetically half interrogatively there has been a drop out in everything the bank is carrying and everybody is unloading two firms failed in frisco yesterday that were carrying things for the bank and have thrown everything back on it there was an awful panic last night and they say none of the big speculators know where they stand three of our best customers in the hotel rushed off to the bay this morning but stacy himself started before daylight and got the through night express to stop for him on the divide on signal shall i send any telegrams that may come to your room  demorest knew that the manager suspected him of being interested in the bank and understood the purport of the question he answered with calm surprise that he was expecting no telegrams and added but if mrs van loo returns i beg you to at once let me know and taking barkers arm he went in to breakfast seated by themselves demorest looked at his companion im afraid barker boy that this thing is more serious to jim than we expected last night or than he cared to tell us and you old man i fear are hurt a little by van loos flight he had some money of your wifes hadnt he  barker who knew that the bulk of demorests fortune was in stacys hands was touched at this proof of his unselfish thought and answered with equal unselfishness that he was concerned only by the fear of mrs barkers disappointment why lord phil whether shes lost or saved her money its nothing to me i gave it to her to do what she liked with it but im afraid shell be worrying over what i think of itas if she did not know me and im half a mind if it were not for missing her to go over to boomville where shes stopping  i thought you said she was in san francisco said demorest abstractedly  barker colored yes he answered quickly but ive heard since that she stopped at boomville on the way  then dont let me keep you here returned demorest for if jim telegraphs to me i shall start for san francisco at once and i rather think he will i did not like to say so before those panicmongers outside who are stampeding everything so run along barker boy and ease your mind about the wife we may have other things to think about soon  thus adjured barker rose from his halffinished breakfast and slipped away yet he was not quite certain what to do his wife must have heard the news at boomville as quickly as he had and if so would be on her way with mrs horncastle or she might be waiting for himknowing too that he had heard the newsin fear and trembling for it was barkers custom to endow all those he cared for with his own sensitiveness and it was not like him to reflect that the woman who had so recklessly speculated against his opinion would scarcely fear his reproaches in her defeat in the fullness of his heart he telegraphed to her in case she had not yet left boomville all right have heard news understand perfectly dont worry come to me then he left the hotel by the stable entrance in order to evade the guests who had congregated on the veranda and made his way to a little wooded crest which he knew commanded a view of the two roads from boomville here he determined to wait and intercept her before she reached the hotel he knew that many of the guests were aware of his wifes speculations with van loo and that he was her broker he wished to spare her running the gauntlet of their curious stares and comments as she drove up alone as he was climbing the slope the coach from sacramento dashed past him on the road below but he knew that it had changed horses at boomville at four oclock and that his tired wife would not have availed herself of it at that hour particularly as she could not have yet received the fateful news he threw himself under a large pine and watched the stagecoach disappear as it swept round into the courtyard of the hotel  he sat there for some moments with his eyes bent upon the two forks of the red road that diverged below him but which appeared to become whiter and more dazzling as he searched their distance there was nothing to be seen except an occasional puff of dust which eventually revealed a horseman or a long trailing cloud out of which a solitary mule one of a packtrain of six or eight would momentarily emerge and be lost again then he suddenly heard his name called and looking up saw mrs horncastle who had halted a few paces from him between two columns of the longdrawn aisle of pines  in that mysterious halflight she seemed such a beautiful and goddesslike figure that his consciousness at first was unable to grasp anything else she was always wonderfully well dressed but the warmth and seclusion of this mountain morning had enabled her to wear a light gown of some delicate fabric which set off the grace of her figure and even pardoned the rural coquetry of a silken sash around her still slender waist an open white parasol thrown over her shoulder made a nimbus for her charming head and the thick coils of hair under her laceedged hat he had never seen her look so beautiful before and that thought was so plainly in his frank face and eyes as he sprang to his feet that it brought a slight rise of color to her own cheek  i saw you climbing up here as i passed in the coach a few minutes ago she said with a smile and as soon as i had shaken the dust off i followed you  wheres kitty he stammered  the color faded from her face as it had come and a shade of something like reproach crept into her dark eyes and whatever it had been her purpose to say or however carefully she might have prepared herself for this interview she was evidently taken aback by the sudden directness of the inquiry barker saw this as quickly and as quickly referred it to his own rudeness his whole soul rushed in apology to his face as he said oh forgive me i was anxious about kitty indeed i had thought of coming again to boomville for youve heard the news of course van loo is a defaulter and has run away with the poor childs money  mrs horncastle had heard the news at the hotel she paused a moment to collect herself and then said slowly and tentatively with a watchful intensity in her eyes mrs barker went i think to the divide  but she was instantly interrupted by the eager barker i see i thought of that at once she went directly to the companys offices to see if she could save anything from the wreck before she saw me it was like her poor girl and youyou he went on eagerly his whole face beaming with gratitudeyou out of your goodness came here to tell me he held out both hands and took hers in his  for a moment mrs horncastle was speechless and vacillating she had often noticed before that it was part of the irony of the creation of such a simple nature as barkers that he was not only open to deceit but absolutely seemed to invite it instead of making others franker people were inclined to rebuke his credulity by restraint and equivocation on their own part but the evasion thus offered to her although only temporary was a temptation she could not resist and it prolonged an interview that a ruthless revelation of the truth might have shortened  she did not tell me she was going there she replied still evasively and indeed she added with a burst of candor still more dangerous i only learned it from the hotel clerk after she was gone but i want to talk to you about her relations to van loo she said with a return of her former intensity of gaze and i thought we would be less subject to interruption here than at the hotel only i suppose everybody knows this place and any of those flirting couples are likely to come here besides she added with a little halfhysterical laugh and a slight shiver as she looked up at the high interlacing boughs above her head its as public as the aisles of a church and really one feels as if one were speaking out in meeting isnt there some other spot a little more secluded where we could sit down she went on as she poked her parasol into the usual black gunpowdery deposit of earth which mingled with the carpet of pineneedles beneath her feet and not get all sticky and dirty  barkers eyes sparkled i know every foot of this hill mrs horncastle he said and if you will follow me ill take you to one of the loveliest nooks you ever dreamed of its an old indian spring now forgotten and i think known only to me and the birds its not more than ten minutes from here onlyhe hesitated as he caught sight of the smart french bronze buckled shoe and silken ankle which mrs horncastles gathering up of her dainty skirts around her had disclosedit may be a little rough and dusty going to your feet  but mrs horncastle pointed out that she had already irretrievably ruined her shoes and stockings in climbing up to himalthough barker could really distinguish no diminution of their freshnessand that she might as well go on whereat they both passed down the long aisle of slope to a little hollow of manzanita which again opened to a view of black spur but left the hotel hidden  what time did kitty go began barker eagerly when they were half down the slope  but here mrs horncastles foot slipped upon the glassy pineneedles and not only stopped an answer but obliged barker to give all his attention to keep his companion from falling again until they reached the open then came the plunge through the manzanita thicket then a cool wade through waistdeep ferns and then they emerged holding each others hand breathless and panting before the spring  it did not belie his enthusiastic description a triangular hollow niched in a shelf of the mountainside narrowed to a point from which the overflow of the spring percolated through a fringe of alder to fall in what seemed from the valley to be a green furrow down the whole length of the mountainside overhung by pines above which met and mingled with the willows that everywhere fringed it it made the one cooling shade in the whole basking expanse of the mountain and yet was penetrated throughout by the intoxicating spice of the heated pines flowering reeds and long lush grasses drew a magic circle round an open bowllike pool in the centre that was always replenished to the slow murmur of an unseen rivulet that trickled from a whitequartz cavern in the mountainside like a vein opened in its flank shadows of timid wings crossed it quick rustlings disturbed the reeds but nothing more it was silent but breathing it was hidden to everything but the sky and the illimitable distance  they threaded their way around it on the spongy carpet covered by delicate lacelike vines that seemed to caress rather than trammel their moving feet until they reached an open space before the pool it was cushioned and matted with disintegrated pine bark and here they sat down mrs horncastle furled her parasol and laid it aside raised both hands to the back of her head and took two hatpins out which she placed in her smiling mouth removed her hat stuck the hatpins in it and handed it to barker who gently placed it on the top of a tall reed where during the rest of that momentous meeting it swung and drooped like a flower removed her gloves slowly drank still smilingly and gratefully nearly a wineglassful of the water which barker brought her in the green twisted chalice of a lily leaf looked the picture of happiness and then burst into tears  barker was astounded dismayed even terrorstricken mrs horncastle crying mrs horncastle the imperious the collected the coldly critical the cynical smiling woman of the world actually crying other women might crykitty had cried oftenbut mrs horncastle yet there she was sobbing actually sobbing like a schoolgirl her beautiful shoulders rising and falling with her grief crying unmistakably through her long white fingers through a lace pockethandkerchief which she had hurriedly produced and shaken from behind her like a conjurers trick her beautiful eyes a thousand times more lustrous for the sparkling beads that brimmed her lashes and welled over like the pool before her  dont mind me she murmured behind her handkerchief its very foolish i know i was nervousworried i suppose ill be better in a moment dont notice me please  but barker had drawn beside her and was trying after the fashion of his sex to take her handkerchief away in apparently the firm belief that this action would stop her tears but tell me what it is do mrs horncastle please he pleaded in his boyish fashion is it anything i can do only say the word only tell me something  but he had succeeded in partially removing the handkerchief and so caught a glimpse of her wet eyes in which a faint smile struggled out like sunshine through rain but they clouded again although she didnt cry and her breath came and went with the action of a sob and her hands still remained against her flushed face  i was only going to talk to you of kitty sobbut i suppose im weak soband such a fool sob and i got to thinking of myself and my own sorrows when i ought to be thinking only of you and kitty  never mind kitty said barker impulsively tell me about yourselfyour own sorrows i am a brute to have bothered you about her at such a moment and now until you have told me what is paining you so i shall not let you speak of her he was perfectly sincere what were kittys possible and easy tears over the loss of her money to the unknown agony that could wrench a sob from a woman like this dear mrs horncastle he went on as breathlessly think of me now not as kittys husband but as your true friend yes as your best and truest friend and speak to me as you would speak to him  you will be my friend she said suddenly and passionately grasping his hand my best and truest friend and if i tell you alleverything you will not cast me from you and hate me  barker felt the same thrill from her warm hand slowly possess his whole being as it had the evening before but this time he was prepared and answered the grasp and her eyes together as he said breathlessly i will bei am your friend  she withdrew her hand and passed it over her eyes after a moment she caught his hand again and holding it tightly as if she feared he might fly from her bit her lip and then slowly without looking at him said i lied to you about myself and kitty that night i did not come with her i came alone and secretly to boomville to seeto see the man who is my husband  your husband said barker in surprise he had believed with the rest of the world that there had been no communication between them for years yet so intense was his interest in her that he did not notice that this revelation was leaving now no excuse for his wifes presence at boomville  mrs horncastle went on with dogged bitterness yes my husband i went to him to beg and bribe him to let me see my child yes my child she said frantically tightening her hold upon his hand for i lied to you when i once told you i had none i had a child and more than that a child who at his birth i did not dare to openly claim  she stopped breathlessly stared at his face with her former intensity as if she would pluck the thought that followed from his brain but he only moved closer to her passed his arm over her shoulders with a movement so natural and protecting that it had a certain dignity in it and looking down upon her bent head with eyes brimming with sympathy whispered poor poor child  whereat mrs horncastle again burst into tears and then with her head half drawn towards his shoulder she told him allall that had passed between her and her husbandeven all that they had then but hinted at it was as if she felt she could now for the first time voice all these terrible memories of the past which had come back to her last night when her husband had left her she concealed nothing she veiled nothing there were intervals when her tears no longer flowed and a cruel hardness and return of her old imperiousness of voice and manner took their place as if she was doing a rigid penance and took a bitter satisfaction in laying bare her whole soul to him i never had a friend she whispered there were women who persecuted me with their jealous sneers there were men who persecuted me with their selfish affections when i first saw you you seemed something so apart and different from all other men that although i scarcely knew you i wanted to tell you even then all that i have told you now i wanted you to be my friend something told me that you couldthat you could separate me from my past that you could tell me what to do that you could make me think as you thought see life as you saw it and trust always to some goodness in people as you did and in this faith i thought that you would understand me now and even forgive me all  she made a slight movement as if to disengage his arm and possibly to look into his eyes which she knew instinctively were bent upon her downcast head but he only held her the more tightly until her cheek was close against his breast what could i do she murmured a man in sorrow and trouble may go to a woman for sympathy and support and the world will not gainsay or misunderstand him but a womanweaker more helpless credulous ignorant and craving for lightmust not in her agony go to a man for succor and sympathy  why should she not burst out barker passionately releasing her in his attempt to gaze into her face what man dare refuse her  not that she said slowly but with still averted eyes but because the world would say she loved him  and what should she care for the opinion of a world that stands aside and lets her suffer why should she heed its wretched babble he went on in flashing indignation  because she said faintly lifting her moist eyes and moist and parted lips towards himbecause it would be true  there was a silence so profound that even the spring seemed to withhold its song as their eyes and lips met when the spring recommenced its murmur and they could hear the droning of a bee above them and the rustling of the reed she was murmuring too with her face against his breast you did not think it strange that i should follow youthat i should risk everything to tell you what i have told you before i told you anything else you will never hate me for it george  there was another silence still more prolonged and when he looked again into the flushed face and glistening eyes he was saying i have always loved you i know now i loved you from the first from the day when i leaned over you to take little sta from your lap and saw your tenderness for him in your eyes i could have kissed you then dearest as i do now  and she said when she had gained her smiling breath again you will always remember george that you told me this before i told you anything of her  her of whom dearest he asked leaning over her tenderly  of kittyof your wife she said impatiently as she drew back shyly with her former intense gaze  he did not seem to grasp her meaning but said gravely let us not talk of her now later we shall have much to say of her for he added quietly you know i must tell her all  the color faded from her cheek tell her all she repeated vacantly then suddenly she turned upon him eagerly and said but what if she is gone  gone he repeated  yes gone what if she has run away with van loo what if she has disgraced you and her child  what do you mean he said seizing both her hands and gazing at her fixedly  i mean she said with a halffrightened eagerness that she has already gone with van loo george george she burst out suddenly and passionately falling upon her knees before him do you think that i would have followed you here and told you what i did if i thought that she had now the slightest claim upon your love or honor dont you understand me i came to tell you of her flight to boomville with that man how i accidentally intercepted them there how i tried to save her from him and even lied to you to try to save her from your indignation but how she deceived me as she has you and even escaped and joined her lover while you were with me i came to tell you that and nothing more george i swear it but when you were kind to me and pitied me i was madwild i wanted to win you first out of your own love i wanted you to respond to mine before you knew your wife was faithless yet i would have saved her if i could listen george a moment more before you speak  then she hurriedly told him all the whole story of his wifes dishonor from her entrance into the sittingroom with van loo her later appeal for concealment from her husbands unexpected presence to the use she made of that concealment to fly with her lover she spared no detail and even repeated the insult mrs barker had cast upon her with the triumphant reproach that her husband would not believe her perhaps she added bitterly you may not believe me now i could even stand that from you george if it could make you happier but you would still have to believe it from others the people at the boomville hotel saw them leave it together  i do believe you he said slowly but with downcast eyes and if i did not love you before you told me this i could love you now for the part you have taken buthe stopped  you love her still she burst out and i might have known it perhaps she went on distractedly you love her the more that you have lost her it is the way of menand women  if i had loved her truly said barker lifting his frank eyes to hers i could not have touched your lips i could not even have wished toas i did three years agoas i did last night then i feared it was my weakness now i know it was my love i have thought of it ever since even while waiting my wifes return here knowing that i did not and never could have loved her but for that very reason i must try to save her for her own sake if i cannot save her for mine and if i fail dearest it shall not be said that we climbed to happiness over her back bent with the burden of her shame if i loved you and told you so thinking her still guiltless and innocent how could i profit now by her fault  mrs horncastle saw too late her mistake then you would take her back she said frenziedly  to my homewhich is hersyes to my heartno she never was there  and i said mrs horncastle with a quivering lipwhere do i go when you have settled this back to my past again back to my husbandless childless life  she was turning away but barker caught her in his arms again no he said his whole face suddenly radiating with hope and youthful enthusiasm no kitty will help us we will tell her all you do not know her dearest as i dohow good and kind she is in spite of all we will appeal to her she will devise some means by which without the scandal of a divorce she and i may be separated she will take dear little sta with herit is only right poor girl but she will let me come and see him she will be a sister to us dearest courage all will come right yet trust to me  an hysterical laugh came to mrs horncastles lips and then stopped for as she looked up at him in his supreme hopefulness his divine confidence in himself and othersat his handsome face beaming with love and happiness and his clear gray eyes glittering with an almost spiritual prescienceshe woman of the world and bitter experience and perfectly cognizant of her own and kittys possibilities was nevertheless completely carried away by her lovers optimism for of all optimism that of love is the most convincing dear boyfor he was but a boy in experienceonly his love for her could work this magic so she gave him kiss for kiss largely believing largely hoping that mrs barker was in love with van loo and would not return and in this hope an invincible belief in the folly of her own sex soothed and sustained her  we must go now dearest said barker pointing to the sun already near the meridian three hours had fled they knew not how i will bring you back to the hill again but there we had better separate you taking your way alone to the hotel as you came and i will go a little way on the road to the divide and return later keep your own counsel about kitty for her sake and ours perhaps no one else may know the truth yet with a farewell kiss they plunged again hand in hand through the cool bracken and again through the hot manzanita bushes and so parted on the hilltop as they had never parted before leaving their whole world behind them  barker walked slowly along the road under the flickering shade of wayside sycamore his sensitive face also alternating with his thought in lights and shadows presently there crept towards him out of the distance a halting vacillating deviating buggy trailing a cloud of dust after it like a broken wing as it came nearer he could see that the horse was spent and exhausted and that the buggys sole occupanta womanwas equally exhausted in her monotonous attempt to urge it forward with whip and reins that rose and fell at intervals with feeble reiteration then he stepped out of the shadow and stood in the middle of the sunlit road to await it for he recognized his wife  the buggy came nearer and then the most exquisite pang he had ever felt before at his wifes hands shot through him for as she recognized him she made a wild but impotent attempt to dash past him and then as suddenly pulled up in the ditch  he went up to her she was dirty she was disheveled she was haggard she was plain there were rings of dust round her tearswept eyes and smudges of dustdried perspiration over her fair cheek he thought of the beauty freshness and elegance of the woman he had just left and an infinite pity swept the soul of this weakminded gentleman he ran towards her and tenderly lifting her in her shamestained garments from the buggy said hurriedly i know it all poor kitty you heard the news of van loos flight and you ran over to the divide to try and save some of your money why didnt you wait why didnt you tell me  there was no mistaking the reality of his words the genuine pity and tenderness of his action but the woman saw before her only the familiar dupe of her life and felt an infinite relief mingled with a certain contempt for his weakness and anger at her previous fears of him  you might have driven over then yourself she said in a high querulous voice if you knew it so well and have spared me this horrid dirty filthy hopeless expedition for i have not saved anythingthere and i have had all this disgusting bother  for an instant he was sorely tempted to lift his eyes to her face but he checked himself then he gently took her dustcoat from her shoulders and shook it out wiped the dust from her face and eyes with his own handkerchief held her hat and blew the dust from it with a vivid memory of performing the same service for mrs horncastle only an hour before while she arranged her hair and then lifting her again into the buggy said quietly as he took his seat beside her and grasped the reins  i will drive you to the hotel by way of the stables and you can go at once to your room and change your clothes you are tired you are nervous and worried and want rest dont tell me anything now until you feel quite yourself again  he whipped up the horse who recognizing another hand at the reins lunged forward in a final effort and in a few minutes they were at the hotel  as mrs horncastle sat at luncheon in the great diningroom a little pale and abstracted she saw mrs barker sweep confidently into the room fresh rosy and in a new and ravishing toilette with a swift glance of conscious power towards the other guests she walked towards mrs horncastle ah here you are dear she said in a voice that could easily reach all ears and youve arrived only a little before me after all and ive had such an awful drive to the divide and only think poor george telegraphed to me at boomville not to worry and his dispatch has only just come back here  and with a glance of complacency she laid barkers gentle and forgiving dispatch before the astonished mrs horncastle     chapter viii   as the day advanced the excitement over the financial crisis increased at hymettus until in spite of its remote and peaceful isolation it seemed to throb through all its verandas and corridors with some pulsation from the outer world besides the letters and dispatches brought by hurried messengers and by coach from the divide there was a crowd of guests and servants around the branch telegraph at the new heavy tree postoffice which was constantly augmenting added to the natural anxiety of the deeply interested was the stimulated fever of the few who wished to be in the fashion it was early rumored that a heavy operator a guest of the hotel who was also a director in the telegraph company had bought up the wires for his sole use that the dispatches were doctored in his interests as a bear and there was wild talk of lynching by the indignant mob passengers from sacramento san francisco and marysville brought incredible news and the wildest sensations firm after firm had failed in the great cities old established houses that dated back to the spring of 49 and had weathered the fires and inundations of their perilous californian infancy collapsed before this mysterious invisible impalpable breath of panic companies rooted in respectability and sneered at for oldfashioned ways were discovered to have shamelessly speculated with trusts an eminent deacon and pillar of the church was found dead in his room with a bullet in his heart and a damning confession on the desk before him foreign bankers were sending their gold out of the country government would be appealed to to open the vaults of the mint there would be an embargo on all bullion shipment nothing was too wild or preposterous to be repeated or credited  and with this fever of sordid passion the summer temperature had increased for the last two weeks the thermometer had stood abnormally high during the daylong sunshine and the metallic dust in the roads over mineral ranges pricked the skin like redhot needles in the deepest woods the aromatic sap stood in beads on felled logs and splintered treeshafts even the mountain night breeze failed to cool these baked and heated fastnesses there were ominous clouds of smoke by day that were pillars of fire by night along the distant valleys some of the nearer crests were etched against the midnight sky by dull red creeping lines like a dying firework the great hotel itself creaked and crackled and warped though all its painted blistered and veneered expanse and was filled with the stifling breath of desiccation the stucco cracked and crumbled away from the cornices there were yawning gaps in the boarded floors beneath the turkey carpets plateglass windows became hopelessly fixed in their warped and twisted sashes and added to the heat there was a warm incense of pine sap in the diningroom that flavored all the cuisine and yet the babble of stocks and shares went on and people pricked their ears over their soup to catch the gossip of the last arrival  demorest loathing it all in his newfound bitterness was nevertheless impatient in his inaction and was eagerly awaiting a telegram from stacy barker had disappeared since luncheon suddenly there was a commotion on the veranda as a carriage drove up with a handsome grayhaired woman in the buzzing of voices around him demorest heard the name of mrs van loo in further comments made in more smothered accents he heard that van loo had been stopped at canyon station but that no warrant had yet been issued against him that it was generally believed that the bank dared not hold him that others openly averred that he had been used as a scapegoat to avert suspicion from higher guilt and certainly mrs van loos calm confident air seemed to corroborate these assertions  he was still wondering if the strange coincidence which had brought both mother and son into his own life was not merely a fancy as far as she was concerned when a waiter brought a message from mrs van loo that she would be glad to see him for a few moments in her room last night he could scarcely have restrained his eagerness to meet her and elucidate the mystery of the photograph now he was conscious of an equally strong revulsion of feeling and a dull premonition of evil however it was no doubt possible that the man had told her of his previous inquiries and she had merely acknowledged them by that message  demorest found mrs van loo in the private sittingroom where he and his old partners had supped on the preceding night she received him with unmistakable courtesy and even a certain dignity that might or might not have been assumed he had no difficulty in recognizing the sons mechanical politeness in the first but he was puzzled at the second  the manager of this hotel she began with a foreigners precision of english has just told me that you were at present occupying my rooms at his invitation but that you wished to see me at once on my return and i believe that i was not wrong in apprehending that you preferred to hear my wishes from my own lips rather than from an innkeeper i had intended to keep these rooms for some weeks but unfortunately for me though fortunately for you the present terrible financial crisis which has most unjustly brought my son into such scandalous prominence will oblige me to return to san francisco until his reputation is fully cleared of these foul aspersions i shall only ask you to allow me the undisturbed possession of these rooms for a couple of hours until i can pack my trunks and gather up a few souvenirs that i almost always keep with me  pray consider that your wishes are my own in respect to that my dear madam returned demorest gravely and that indeed i protested against even this temporary intrusion upon your apartments but i confess that now that you have spoken of your souvenirs i have the greatest curiosity about one of them and that even my object in seeking this interview was to gratify it it is in regard to a photograph which i saw on the chimneypiece in your bedroom which i think i recognized as that of some one whom i formerly knew  there was a sudden look of sharp suspicion and even hard aggressiveness that quite changed the ladys face as he mentioned the word souvenir but it quickly changed to a smile as she put up her fan with a gesture of arch deprecation and said  ah i see of course a ladys photograph  the reply irritated demorest more than that he felt a sudden sense of the absolute sentimentality of his request and the consciousness that he was about to invite the familiar confidence of this strange womanwhose son had forged his namein regard to her  it was a venetian picture he began and stopped a singular disgust keeping him from voicing the name  but mrs van loo was less reticent oh you mean my dearest frienda lovely picture and you know her why yes surely you are the mr demorest whoof course that old loveaffair well you are a marvel five years ago at least and you have not forgotten i really must write and tell her  write and tell her then it was all a lie about her death he felt not only his faith his hope his future leaving him but even his selfcontrol with an effort he said  i think you have already satisfied my curiosity i was told five years ago that she was dead it was because of the date of the photographtwo years laterthat i ventured to intrude upon you i was anxious only to know the truth  she certainly was very much living and of the world when i saw her last two years ago said mrs van loo with an easy smile i dare say that was a ruse of her relativesa very stupid oneto break off the affair for i think they had other plans but dear me now i remember was there not some little quarrel between you before some letter from you that was not very kind my impression is that there was something of the sort and that the young lady was indignant but only for a time you know she very soon forgot it i dare say if you wrote something very charming to her it might not be too late we women are very forgiving mr demorest and although she is very much sought after as are all young american girls whose fathers can give them a comfortable dot her parents might be persuaded to throw over a poor prince for a rich countryman in the end of course you know to you republicans there is always something fascinating in titles and blood and our dear friend is like other girls still it is worth the risk and five years of waiting and devotion really ought to tell its quite a romance shall i write to her and tell her i have seen you looking well and prosperous nothing more do let me i should be delighted  i think it hardly worth while for you to give yourself that trouble said demorest quietly looking in mrs van loos smiling eyes now that i know the story of the young ladys death was a forgery and i will not intrude further on your time pray give yourself no needless hurry over your packing i may go to san francisco this afternoon and not even require the rooms tonight  at least let me make you a present of the souvenir as an acknowledgment of your courtesy said mrs van loo passing into her bedroom and returning with the photograph i feel that with your five years of constancy it is more yours than mine as a gentleman demorest knew he could not refuse and taking the photograph from her with a low bow with another final salutation he withdrew  alone by himself in a corner of the veranda he was surprised that the interview had made so little impression on him and had so little altered his conviction his discovery that the announcement of his betrotheds death was a fiction did not affect the fact that though living she was yet dead to him and apparently by her own consent the contrast between her life and his during those five years had been covertly accented by mrs van loo whether intentionally or not and he saw again as last night the full extent of his sentimental folly he could not even condole with himself that he was the victim of miserable falsehoods that others had invented she had accepted them and had even excused her desertion of him by that last deceit of the letter  he drew out her photograph and again examined it but not as a lover had she really grown stouter and more selfcomplacent was the spirituality and delicacy he had worshiped in her purely his own idiotic fancy had she always been like this yes there was the girl who could weakly strive weakly revenge herself and weakly forget there was the figure that he had expected to find carved upon the tomb which he had long sought that he might weep over he laughed aloud  it was very hot and he was stifling with inaction what was barker doing and why had not stacy telegraphed to him and what were those people in the courtyard doing were they discussing news of further disaster and ruin perhaps he was even now a beggar well his fortune might go with his faith  but the crowd was simply looking at the roof of the hotel and he now saw that a black smoke was drifting across the courtyard and was conscious of a smell of soot and burning he stepped down from the veranda among the mingled guests and servants and saw that the smoke was only pouring from a chimney he heard too that the chimney had been on fire and that it was mrs van loos bedroom chimney and that when the startled servants had knocked at the locked door she had told them that she was only burning some old letters and newspapers the refuse of her trunks there was naturally some indignation that the hotel had been so foolishly endangered in such scorching weather and the manager had had a scene with her which resulted in her leaving the hotel indignantly with her halfpacked boxes but even after the smoke had died away and the fire been extinguished in the chimney and hearth there was an acrid smell of smouldering pine penetrating the upper floors of the hotel all that afternoon  when mrs van loo drove away the manager returned with demorest to the rooms the marble hearth was smoked and discolored and still littered with charred ashes of burnt paper my belief is said the manager darkly that the old hag came here just to burn up a lot of incriminating papers that her son had intrusted to her keeping it looks mighty suspicious you see she got up an awful lot of side when i told her i didnt reckon to run a smelting furnace in a wooden hotel with the thermometer at one hundred in the office and i reckon it was just an excuse for getting off in a hurry  but the continued delay in stacys promised telegram had begun to work upon demorests usual equanimity and he scarcely listened in his anxiety for his old partner he knew that stacy should have arrived in san francisco by noon he had almost determined to take the next train from the divide when two horsemen dashed into the courtyard there was the usual stir on the veranda and rush for news but the two new arrivals turned out to be barker on a horse covered with foam and a dashing elegantly dressed stranger on a mustang as carefully groomed and as spotless as himself demorest instantly recognized jack hamlin  he had not seen hamlin since that day five years before when the latter had accompanied the three partners with their treasure to boomville and had handed him the mysterious packet as the two men dismounted hurriedly and moved towards him he felt a premonition of something as fateful and important as then in obedience to a sign from barker he led them to a more secluded angle of the veranda he could not help noticing that his younger partners face was mobile as ever but more thoughtful and older yet his voice rang with the old freemasonry of the camp as he said with a laugh the signal has been given and its boot and saddle and away  but i have had no dispatch from stacy said demorest in surprise he was to telegraph to me from san francisco in any emergency  he never got there at all said barker jack ran slap into van loo at the divide and sent a dispatch to jim which stopped him halfway until jack could reach him which he nearly broke his neck to do and then jack finished up by bringing a message from stacy to us that we should all meet together on the slope of heavy tree near the bar i met jack just as i was riding into the divide and came back with him he will tell you the rest and you can swear by what jack says for hes white all through he added laying his hand affectionately on hamlins shoulder  hamlin winced slightly for he had not told barker that his wife was with van loo nor his first reason for interfering but he related how he had finally overtaken van loo at canyon station and how the fugitive had disclosed the conspiracy of steptoe and hall against the bank and marshall as the price of his own release on this news remembering that stacy had passed the divide on his way to the station he had first sent a dispatch to him and then met him at the first station on the road i reckon gentlemen said hamlin with an unusual earnestness in his voice that hed not only got my telegram but all the news that had been flying around this morning for he looked like a man to whom it was just a tossup whether he took his own life then and there or was willing to have somebody else take it for him for he said ill go myself and telegraphed to have the surveyor stopped from coming then he told me to tell you fellows and ask you to come too jack paused and added half mischievously he sort of asked me what i would take to stand by him in the row if there was one and i told him id takewhiskey you see boys its a kind of offnight with me and i wouldnt mind for the sake of old times to finish the game with old steptoe that i began a matter of five years ago  all right said demorest with a kindling eye i suppose wed better start at once one moment he added barker boy will you excuse me if i speak a word to hamlin as barker nodded and walked to the rails of the veranda demorest took hamlin aside you and i he said hurriedly are single men barker has a wife and child this is likely to be no childs play  but jack hamlin was no fool and from certain leading questions which barker had already put but which he had skillfully evaded he surmised that barker knew something of his wifes escapade he answered a little more seriously than his wont i dont think as regards his wife that would make much difference to him or her how stiff the work was  demorest turned away with his last pang of bitterness it needed only this confirmation of all that stacy had hinted of what he himself had seen in his brief interview with mrs barker since his return to shake his last remaining faith well all go together then he said with a laugh as in the old times and perhaps its as well that we have no woman in our confidence  an hour later the three men passed quietly out of the hotel scarcely noticed by the other guests who were also oblivious of their absence during the evening for mrs barker quite recovered from her fatiguing ride was in high spirits and the most beautiful and spotless of summer gowns and was considered quite a heroine by the other ladies as she dwelt upon the terrible heat of her return journey only i knew mr barker would be worriedand the poor man actually walked a mile down the divide road to meet mei believe i should have stayed there all day she glanced round the other groups for mrs horncastle but that lady had retired early possibly she alone had noticed the absence of the two partners  the guests sat up until quite late for the heat seemed to grow still more oppressive and the strange smell of burning wood revived the gossip about mrs van loo and her stupidity in setting fire to her chimney some averred that it would be days before the smell could be got out of the house others referred it to the fires in the woods which were now dangerously near one spoke of the isolated position of the hotel as affording the greatest security but was met by the assertion of a famous mountaineer that the forest fires were wont to leap from crest to crest mysteriously without any apparent continuous contact this led to more or less lighthearted conjecture of present danger and some amusing stories of hotel fires and their ludicrous revelations there were also some entertaining speculations as to what they would do and what they would try to save in such an emergency  for myself said mrs barker audaciously i should certainly let mr barker look after sta and confine myself entirely to getting away with my diamonds i know the wretch would never think of them  it was still later when exhausted by the heat and some reaction from the excitement of the day they at last deserted the veranda for their rooms and for a while the shadowy bulk of the whole building was picked out with regularly spaced lights from its open windows until now these finally faded and went out one by one an hour later the whole building had sunk to rest it was said that it was only four in the morning when a yawning porter having put out the light in a dark upper corridor was amazed by a dull glow from the top of the wall and awoke to the fact that a red fire as yet smokeless and flameless was creeping along the cornice he ran to the office and gave the alarm but on returning with assistance was stopped in the corridor by an impenetrable wall of smoke veined with murky flashes the alarm was given in all the lower floors and the occupants rushed from their beds half dressed to the courtyard only to see as they afterwards averred the flames burst like cannon discharges from the upper windows and unite above the crackling roof so sudden and complete was the catastrophe although slowly prepared by a leak in the overheated chimney between the floors that even the excitement of fear and exertion was spared the survivors there was bewilderment and stupor but neither uproar nor confusion people found themselves wandering in the woods half awake and half dressed having descended from the balconies and leaped from the windowsthey knew not how others on the upper floor neither awoke nor moved from their beds but were suffocated without a cry from the first an instinctive idea of the hopelessness of combating the conflagration possessed them all to a blind automatic feeling to flee the building was added the slow mechanism of the somnambulist delicate women walked speechlessly but securely along ledges and roofs from which they would have fallen by the mere light of reason and of day there was no crowding or impeding haste in their dumb exodus it was only when mrs barker awoke disheveled in the courtyard and with an hysterical outcry rushed back into the hotel that there was any sign of panic  mrs horncastle who was standing near fully dressed as from some nightlong vigil quickly followed her the halffrantic woman was making directly for her own apartments whose windows those in the courtyard could see were already belching smoke suddenly mrs horncastle stopped with a bitter cry and clasped her forehead it had just flashed upon her that mrs barker had told her only a few hours before that sta had been removed with the nurse to the upper floor it was not the forgotten child that mrs barker was returning for but her diamonds mrs horncastle called her she did not reply the smoke was already pouring down the staircase mrs horncastle hesitated for a moment only and then drawing a long breath dashed up the stairs on the first landing she stumbled over somethingthe prostrate figure of the nurse but this saved her for she found that near the floor she could breathe more freely before her appeared to be an open door she crept along towards it on her hands and knees the frightened cry of a child awakened from its sleep in the dark gave her nerve to rise enter the room and dash open the window by the flashing light she could see a little figure rising from a bed it was sta there was not a moment to be lost for the open window was beginning to draw the smoke from the passage luckily the boy by some childish instinct threw his arms round her neck and left her hands free whispering him to hold tight she clambered out of the window a narrow ledge of cornice scarcely wide enough for her feet ran along the house to a distant balcony with her back to the house she zigzagged her feet along the cornice to get away from the smoke which now poured directly from the window then she grew dizzy the weight of the child on her bosom seemed to be toppling her forward towards the abyss below she closed her eyes frantically grasping the child with crossed arms on her breast as she stood on the ledge until as seen from below through the twisting smoke they might have seemed a figure of the madonna and child niched in the wall then a voice from above called to her courage and she felt the flap of a twisted sheet lowered from an upper window against her face she grasped it eagerly it held firmly then she heard a cry from below saw them carrying a ladder and at last was lifted with her burden from the ledge by powerful hands then only did she raise her eyes to the upper window whence had come her help smoke and flame were pouring from it the unknown hero who had sacrificed his only chance of escape to her remained forever unknown    only four miles away that night a group of men were waiting for the dawn in the shadow of a pine near heavy tree bar as the sky glowed redly over the crest between them and hymettus hamlin said  another one of those forest fires its this side of black spur and a big one i reckon  do you know said barker thoughtfully i was thinking of the time the old cabin burnt up on heavy tree it looks to be about in the same place  hush said stacy sharply     chapter ix   an abandoned tunnelan irregular orifice in the mountain flank which looked like a driedup sewer that had disgorged through its opening the refuse of the mountain in red slime gravel and a peculiar clay known as cement in a foul streak down its side a narrow ledge on either side broken up by heaps of quartz tailings and rock and half hidden in scrub oak and myrtle a decaying cabin of logs bark and cobblestonesthese made up the exterior of the marshall claim to this defacement of the mountain the rude clearing of thicket and underbrush by fire or blasting the lopping of treeboughs and the decapitation of saplings might be added the debris and ruins of halfcivilized occupancy the ground before the cabin was covered with broken boxes tin cans the staves and broken hoops of casks and the castoff rags of blankets and clothing the whole claim in its unsavory unpicturesque details and its vulgar story of sordid reckless and selfish occupancy and abandonment was a foul blot on the landscape which the first rosy dawn only made the more offending surely the last spot in the world that men should quarrel and fight for  so thought george barker as with his companions they moved in single file slowly towards it the little party consisted only of himself demorest and stacy marshall and hamlinaccording to a prearranged planwere still in ambush to join them at the first appearance of steptoe and his gang the claim was yet unoccupied they had secured their first success steptoes followers unaware that his design had been discovered and confident that they could easily reach the claim before marshall and the surveyor had lingered some of them had held a drunken carouse at their rendezvous at heavy tree others were still engaged in procuring shovels and picks and pans for their mock equipment as miners and this again gave marshalls adherents the advantage they knew that their opponents would probably first approach the empty claim encumbered only with their peaceful implements while they themselves had brought their rifles with them  stacy who by tacit consent led the party on reaching the claim at once posted demorest and barker each behind a separate heap of quartz tailings on the ledge which afforded them a capital breastwork and stationed himself at the mouth of the tunnel which was nearest the trail it had already been arranged what each man was to do they were in possession for the rest they must wait what they thought at that moment no one knew their characteristic appearance had slightly changed the melancholy and philosophic demorest was alert and bitter barkers changeful face had become fixed and steadfast stacy alone wore his fighting look which the others had remembered  they had not long to wait the sounds of rude laughter coarse skylarking and voices more or less still confused with halfspent liquor came from the rocky trail and then steptoe appeared with part of his straggling followers who were celebrating their easy invasion by clattering their picks and shovels and beating loudly upon their tins and prospectingpans the three partners quickly recognized the stamp of the strangers in spite of their peaceful implements they were the waifs and strays of san francisco wharves of sacramento dens of dissolute mountain towns and there was not probably a single actual miner among them a raging scorn and contempt took possession of barker and demorest but stacy knew their exact value as steptoe passed before the opening of the tunnel he heard the cry of halt  he looked up he saw stacy not thirty yards before him with his rifle at halfcock he saw barker and demorest fully armed rise from behind their breastworks of rock along the ledge and thus fully occupy the claim but he saw more he saw that his plot was known outlaw and desperado as he was he saw that he had lost his moral power in this actual possession and that from that moment he must be the aggressor he saw he was fighting no irresponsible hirelings like his own but men of position and importance whose loss would make a stir against their rifles the few revolvers that his men chanced to have slung to them were of little avail but he was not cowed although his few followers stumbled together at this momentary check half angrily half timorously like wolves without a leader bring up the other men and their guns he whispered fiercely to the nearest then he faced stacy  who are you to stop peaceful miners going to work on their own claim he said coarsely ill tell you who boys he added suddenly turning to his men with a hoarse laugh it aint even the bank its only jim stacy that the bank kicked out yesterday to save itselfjim stacy and his brokendown pals and whats the thief doing herein marshalls tunnelthe only spot that marshall can claim we aint no particular friends o marshalls though were neighbors on the same claim but we aint going to see marshall ousted by tramps are we boys  no by gd said his followers dropping the pans and seizing their picks and revolvers they understood the appeal to arms if not to their reason for an instant the fight seemed imminent then a voice from behind them said  you neednt trouble yourselves about that im marshall i sent these gentlemen to occupy the claim until i came here with the surveyor and two men stepped from a thicket of myrtle in the rear of steptoe and his followers the speaker marshall was a thin slight overworked overaged man his companion the surveyor was equally slight but redbearded spectacled and professionallooking with a long travelingduster that made him appear even clerical they were scarcely a physical addition to stacys party whatever might have been their moral and legal support  but it was just this support that steptoe strangely clung to in his designs for the future and a wild idea seized him the surveyor was really the only disinterested witness between the two parties if steptoe could confuse his mind before the actual fightingfrom which he would of course escape as a noncombatantit would go far afterwards to rehabilitate steptoes party very well then he said to marshall i shall call this gentleman to witness that we have been attacked here in peaceable possession of our part of the claim by these armed strangers and whether they are acting on your order or not their blood will be on your head  then i reckon said the surveyor as he tore away his beard wig spectacles and mustache and revealed the figure of jack hamlin that im about the last witness that mr steptoehorncastle ought to call and about the last witness that he ever will call  but he had not calculated upon the desperation of steptoe over the failure of this last hope for there sprang up in the outlaws brain the same hideous idea that he voiced to his companions at the divide with a hoarse cry to his followers he crashed his pickaxe into the brain of marshall who stood near him and sprang forward three or four shots were exchanged two of his men fell a bullet from stacys rifle pierced steptoes leg and he dropped forward on one knee he heard the steps of his reinforcements with their weapons coming close behind him and rolled aside on the sloping ledge to let them pass but he rolled too far he felt himself slipping down the mountainside in the slimy shoot of the tunnel he made a desperate attempt to recover himself but the treacherous drift of the loose debris rolled with him as if he were part of its refuse and carrying him down left him unconscious but otherwise uninjured in the bushes of the second ledge five hundred feet below  when he recovered his senses the shouts and outcries above him had ceased he knew he was safe the ledge could only be reached by a circuitous route three miles away he knew too that if he could only reach a point of outcrop a hundred yards away he could easily descend to the stage road down the gentle slope of the mountain hidden in a growth of hazelbrush he bound up his wounded leg and dragged himself on his hands and knees laboriously to the outcrop he did not look up since his pick had crashed into marshalls brain he had but one blind thought before himto escape at once that his revenge and compensation would come later he never doubted he limped and crept rolled and fell from bush to bush through the sloping thickets until he saw the red road a few feet below him  if he only had a horse he could put miles between him and any present pursuit why should he not have one the road was frequented by solitary horsemenminers and mexicans he had his revolver with him what mattered the life of another man if he escaped from the consequences of the one he had just taken he heard the clatter of hoofs two priests on mules rode slowly by he ground his teeth with disappointment but they had scarcely passed before another and more rapid clatter came from their rear it was a lad on horseback he started it was his own son  he remembered in a flash how the boy had said he was coming to meet the padre at the station on that day his first impulse was to hide himself his wound and his defeat from the lad but the blind idea of escape was still paramount he leaned over the bank and called to him the astonished lad cantered eagerly to his side  give me your horse eddy said the father im in bad luck and must get  the boy glanced at his fathers face at his tattered garments and bandaged leg and read the whole story it was a familiar page to him he paled first and then flushed and then with an odd glitter in his eyes said take me with you father do you always did before ill bring you luck  desperation is superstitious why not take him they had been lucky before and the two together might confound any description of their identity to the pursuers help me up eddy and then get up before me  behind you mean said the boy with a laugh as he helped his father into the saddle  no said steptoe harshly before medo you hear and if anything happens behind you dont look if i drop off dont stop dont get down but go on and leave me do you understand he repeated almost savagely  yes said the boy tremulously  all right said the father with a softer voice as he passed his one arm round the boys body and lifted the reins hold tight when we come to the crossroads for well take the first turn for old lucks sake to the mission  they were the last words exchanged between them for as they wheeled rapidly to the left at the crossroads jack hamlin and demorest swung as quickly out of another road to the right immediately behind them jacks challenge to halt was only answered by steptoes horse springing forward under the sharp lash of the riata  hold up said jack suddenly laying his hand upon the rifle which demorest had lifted to his shoulder hes carrying some onea wounded comrade i reckon we dont want him swing out and go for the horse well forward in the neck or shoulder  demorest swung far out to the right of the road and raised his rifle as it cracked steptoes horse seemed to have suddenly struck some obstacle ahead of him rather than to have been hit himself for his head went down with his fore feet under him and he turned a halfsomersault on the road flinging his two riders a dozen feet away  steptoe scrambled to his knees revolver in hand but the other figure never moved hands up said jack sighting his own weapon the reports seemed simultaneous but jacks bullet had pierced steptoes brain even before the outlaws pistol exploded harmlessly in the air  the two men dismounted but by a common instinct they both ran to the prostrate figure that had never moved  by god its a boy said jack leaning over the body and lifting the shoulders from which the head hung loosely neck broken and dead as his pal suddenly he started and to demorests astonishment began hurriedly pulling off the glove from the boys limp right hand  what are you doing demanded demorest in creeping horror  look said jack as he laid bare the small white hand the first two fingers were merely unsightly stumps that had been hidden in the padded glove  good god van loos brother said demorest recoiling  no said jack with a grim face its what i have long suspectedits steptoes son  his son repeated demorest  yes said jack and he added after looking at the two bodies with a longdrawn whistle of concern and i wouldnt if i were you say anything of this to barker  why said demorest  well returned jack when our scrimmage was over down there and they brought the news to barker that his wife and her diamonds were burnt up at the hotel you remember that they said that mrs horncastle had saved his boy  yes said demorest but what has that to do with it  nothing i reckon said jack with a slight shrug of his shoulders only mrs horncastle was the mother of the boy thats lying there    two years later as demorest and stacy sat before the fire in the old cabin on marshalls claimnow legally their ownthey looked from the door beyond the great bulk of black spur to the pallid snowline of the sierras still as remote and unchanged to them as when they had gazed upon it from heavy tree hill and for the matter of that they themselves seemed to have been left so unchanged that even now as in the old days it was barkers voice as he greeted them from the darkening trail that alone broke their reverie  well said demorest cheerfully your usual luck barker boy for they already saw in his face the happy light they had once seen there on an eventful night seven years ago  im to be married to mrs horncastle next month he said breathlessly and little sta loves her already as if she was his own mother wish me joy  a slight shadow passed over stacys face but his hand was the first to grasp barkers and his voice the first to say amen
