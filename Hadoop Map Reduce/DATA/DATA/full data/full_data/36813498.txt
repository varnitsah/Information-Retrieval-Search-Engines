cannot communicate themselves to others as there are also men who not only can do so but cannot do otherwise and it is hard to say which is the better man of the two we do not specially respect him who wears his heart upon his sleeve for daws to peck at who carries a crystal window to his bosom so that all can see the work that is going on within it who cannot keep any affair of his own private who gushes out in love and friendship to every chance acquaintance but then again there is but little love given to him who is always wary always silent as to his own belongings who buttons himself in a suit of close reserve which he never loosens respect such a one may gain but hardly love it is natural to us to like to know the affairs of our friends and natural also i think to like to talk of our own to those whom we trust perhaps after all that may be said of the weakness of the gushing and indiscreet babbler it is pleasanter to live with such a one than with the selfconstrained reticent man of iron whose conversation among his most intimate friends is solely of politics of science of literature or of some other subject equally outside the privacies of our inner life  sir thomas underwood whom i and i hope my readers also will have to know very intimately was one of those who are not able to make themselves known intimately to any i am speaking now of a man of sixty and i am speaking also of one who had never yet made a close friendwho had never by unconscious and slow degrees of affection fallen into that kind of intimacy with another man which justifies and renders necessary mutual freedom of intercourse in all the affairs of life and yet he was possessed of warm affections was by no means misanthropic in his nature and would in truth have given much to be able to be free and jocund as are other men he lacked the power that way rather than the will to himself it seemed to be a weakness in him rather than a strength that he should always be silent always guarded always secret and dark he had lamented it as an acknowledged infirmityas a man grieves that he should be shortsighted or dull of hearing but at the age of sixty he had taken no efficient steps towards curing himself of the evil and had now abandoned all idea of any such cure  whether he had been upon the whole fortunate or unfortunate in life shall be left to the readers judgment but he certainly had not been happy he had suffered cruel disappointments and a disappointment will crush the spirit worse than a realised calamity there is no actual misfortune in not being lord mayor of londonbut when a man has set his heart upon the place has worked himself into a position within a few feet of the mansion house has become alderman with the mayoralty before him in immediate rotation he will suffer more at being passed over by the liverymen than if he had lost half his fortune now sir thomas underwood had become solicitorgeneral in his profession but had never risen to the higher rank or more assured emoluments of other legal offices  we will not quite trace our meleager back to his egg but we will explain that he was the only son of a barrister of moderate means who put him to the bar and who died leaving little or nothing behind him the young barrister had an only sister who married an officer in the army and who had passed all her latter life in distant countries to which her husband had been called by the necessity of living on the income which his profession gave him as a chancery barrister mr underwoodour sir thomashad done well living on the income he made marrying at thirtyfive going into parliament at fortyfive becoming solicitorgeneral at fiftyand ceasing to hold that muchdesired office four months after his appointment such cessation however arising from political causes is no disappointment to a man it will doubtless be the case that a man so placed will regret the weakness of his party which has been unable to keep the good things of government in its hands but he will recognise without remorse or sorrow the fact that the ministry to which he has attached himself must cease to be a ministryand there will be nothing in his displacement to gall his pride or to create that inner feeling of almost insupportable mortification which comes from the conviction of personal failure sir thomas underwood had been solicitorgeneral for a few months under a conservative prime minister and when the conservative minister went out of office sir thomas underwood followed him with no feeling of regret that caused him unhappiness but when afterwards the same party came back to power and he having lost his election at the borough which he had represented was passed over without a word of sympathy or even of assumed regret from the minister then he was wounded it was true he knew that a man to be solicitorgeneral should have a seat in parliament the highest legal offices in the country are not to be attained by any amount of professional excellence unless the candidate shall have added to such excellence the power of supporting a ministry and a party in the house of commons sir thomas underwood thoroughly understood thisbut he knew also that there are various ways in which a lame dog may be helped over a stileif only the lame dog be popular among dogs for another exsolicitorgeneral a seat would have been foundor some delay would have been grantedor at least there would have been a consultation with a suggestion that something should be tried but in this case a man four years his junior in age whom he despised and who as he was informed had obtained his place in parliament by gross bribery was put into the office without a word of apology to him then he was unhappy and acknowledged to himself that his spirit was crushed  but he acknowledged to himself at the same time that he was one doomed by his nature to such crushing of the spirit if he came out of the hole of his solitude and endeavoured to carry on the open fight of life among his fellowmen he knew that he was one doomed to that disappointment the bitterest of all which comes from failure when the prize has been all but reached it is much to have become solicitorgeneral and that he had achievedbut it is worse than nothing to have been solicitorgeneral for four months and then to find that all the world around one regards one as having failed and as being therefore fit for the shelf such were sir thomas underwoods feelings as he sat alone in his chambers during those days in which the new administration was formedin which days he was neither consulted nor visited nor communicated with either by message or by letter but all thisthis formation of a ministry in which the late solicitorgeneral was not invited to take a partoccurred seven years before the commencement of our story  during those years in which our lawyer sat in parliament as mr underwoodat which time he was working hard also as a chancery barrister and was perhaps nearer to his fellowmen than he had ever been before or was ever destined to be afterwardshe resided as regarded himself almost nominally at a small but pretty villa which he had taken for his wifes sake at fulham it was close upon the river and had wellarranged though not extensive shrubbery walks and a little lawn and a tiny conservatory and a charming opening down to the thames mrs underwood had found herself unable to live in halfmoon street and mr underwood not unwillingly had removed his household gods to this retreat at that time his household gods consisted of a wife and two daughtersbut the wife had died before the time came at which she could have taken on herself the name of lady underwood the villa at fulham was still kept and there lived the two girls and there also sir thomas had he been interrogated on the subject would have declared that he also was domiciled but if a man lives at the place in which he most often sleeps sir thomas in truth lived at his chambers at southampton buildings when he moved those household gods of his to the villa it was necessary because of his duties in parliament that he should have some place in town wherein he might lay his head and therefore i fear not unwillingly he took to laying his head very frequently in the little bedroom which was attached to his chambers  it is not necessary that we should go back to any feelings which might have operated upon him during his wifes lifetime or during the period of his parliamentary career his wife was now dead and he no longer held a seat in parliament he had indeed all but abandoned his practice at the bar never putting himself forward for the ordinary business of a chancery barrister but nevertheless he spent the largest half of his life in his chambers breakfasting there reading there writing there and sleeping there he did not altogether desert the lodge at fulham and the two girls who lived there he would not even admit to them or allow them to assert that he had not his home with them sometimes for two nights together and sometimes for three he would be at the villanever remaining there however during the day but on sundays it may almost be said that he was never at home and hence arose the feeling that of all this went the nearest to create discord between the father and the daughters sir thomas was always in southampton buildings on sundays did sir thomas go to church the miss underwoods did go to church very regularly and thought much of the propriety and necessity of such sunday exercises they could remember that in their younger days their father always had been there with them they could remember indeed that he with something of sternness would require from them punctuality and exactness in this duty now and againperhaps four times in the yearhe would go to the rolls chapel so much they could learn but they believed that beyond that his sundays were kept holy by no attendance at divine service and it may be said at once that they believed aright  sir thomass chambers in southampton buildings though they were dull and dingy of aspect from the outside and were reached by a staircase which may be designated as lugubriousso much did its dark and dismantled condition tend to melancholywere in themselves large and commodious his bedroom was small but he had two spacious sittingrooms one of which was fitted up as a library and the other as a diningroom over and beyond these there was a clerks roomfor sir thomas though he had given up the greater part of his business had not given up his clerk and here the old man the clerk passed his entire time from halfpast eight in the morning till ten at night waiting upon his employer in various capacities with a sedulous personal attention to which he had probably not intended to devote himself when he first took upon himself the duties of clerk to a practising chancery barrister but joseph stemm and sir thomas were not unlike in character and had grown old together with too equal a step to admit of separation and of new alliance stemm had but one friend in the world and sir thomas was that friend i have already said that sir thomas had no friendbut perhaps he felt more of that true intimacy which friendship produces with stemm than with any other human being  sir thomas was a tall thin man who stooped considerablythough not from any effect of years with a face which would perhaps have been almost mean had it not been rescued from that evil condition by the assurance of intelligence and strength which is always conveyed by a certain class of ugliness he had a nose something like the great lord broughamsthin long and projecting at the point he had quick grey eyes and a good foreheadbut the component parts of his countenance were irregular and roughly put together his chin was long as was also his upper lipso that it may be taken as a fact that he was an ugly man he was hale however and strong and was still so good a walker that he thought nothing of making his way down to the villa on foot of an evening after dining at his club  it was his custom to dine at his clubthat highly respectable and most comfortable club situated at the corner of suffolk street pall mallthe senior of the two which are devoted to the wellbeing of scions of our great universities there sir thomas dined perhaps four nights in the week for ten months in the year and it was said of him in the club that he had never been known to dine in company with another member of the club his very manner as he sat at his solitary mealalways with a pint of port on the tablewas as well known as the figure of the old king on horseback outside in the street and was as unlike the ordinary manner of men as is that unlike the ordinary figures of kings he had always a book in his handnot a club book nor a novel from mudies nor a magazine but some ancient and hardbound volume from his own library which he had brought in his pocket and to which his undivided attention would be given the eating of his dinner which always consisted of the joint of the day and of nothing else did not take him more than five minutesbut he would sip his port wine slowly would have a cup of tea which he would also drink very slowlyand would then pocket his book pay his bill and would go it was rarely the case that he spoke to any one in the club he would bow to a man here and thereand if addressed would answer but of conversation at his club he knew nothing and hardly ever went into any room but that in which his dinner was served to him  in conversing about him men would express a wonder how such a one had ever risen to high officehow indeed he could have thriven at his profession but in such matters we are all of us too apt to form confident opinions on apparent causes which are near the surface but which as guides to character are fallacious perhaps in all london there was no better lawyer in his branch of law than sir thomas underwood he had worked with great diligence and though he was shy to a degree quite unintelligible to men in general in the ordinary intercourse of life he had no feeling of diffidence when upon his legs in court or in the house of commons with the lord chancellors wife or daughters he could not exchange five words with comfort to himselfnor with his lordship himself in a drawingroom but in court the lord chancellor was no more to him than another lawyer whom he believed to be not so good a lawyer as himself no man had ever succeeded in browbeating him when panoplied in his wig and gown nor had words ever been wanting to him when so arrayed it had been suggested to him by an attorney who knew him in that way in which attorneys ought to know barristers that he should stand for a certain boroughand he had stood and had been returned thrice he had been returned for the same town but at last when it was discovered that he would never dine with the leading townsmen or call on their wives in london or assist them in their little private views the strength of his extreme respectability was broken downand he was rejected in the meantime he was found to be of value by the party to which he had attached himself it was discovered that he was not only a sound lawyer but a man of great erudition who had studied the experience of history as well as the wants of the present age he was one who would disgrace no governmentand he was invited to accept the office of solicitorgeneral by a minister who had never seen him out of the house of commons he is as good a lawyer as there is in england said the lord chancellor he always speaks with uncommon clearness said the chancellor of the exchequer i never saw him talking with a human being said the secretary to the treasury deprecating the appointment he will soon get over that complaint with your assistance said the minister laughing so mr underwood became solicitorgeneral and sir thomasand he so did his work that no doubt he would have returned to his office had he been in parliament when his party returned to power but he had made no friend he had not learned to talk even to the secretary of the treasuryand when the party came back to power he was passed over without remorse and almost without a regret  he never resumed the active bustle of his profession after that disappointment his wife was then dead and for nearly a twelvemonth he went about declaring to attorneys and others that his professional life was done he did take again to a certain class of work when he came back to the old chambers in southampton buildings but he was seen in court only rarely and it was understood that he wished it to be supposed that he had retired he had ever been a moderate man in his mode of living and had put together a sum of money sufficient for moderate wants he possessed some twelve or fourteen hundred a year independent of anything that he might now earn and as he had never been a man greedy of money so was he now more indifferent to it than in his earlier days it is a mistake i think to suppose that men become greedy as they grow old the avaricious man will show his avarice as he gets into years because avarice is a passion compatible with old ageand will become more avaricious as his other passions fall off from him and so will it be with the man that is openhanded mr underwood when struggling at the bar had fought as hard as any of his compeers for comfort and independencebut money as money had never been dear to himand now he was so trained a philosopher that he disregarded it altogether except so far as it enabled him to maintain his independence  on a certain friday evening in june as he sat at dinner at his club instead of applying himself to his book which according to his custom he had taken from his pocket he there read a letter which as soon as read he would restore to the envelope and would take it out again after a few moments of thought at last when the cup of tea was done and the bill was paid he put away letter and book together and walked to the door of his club when there he stood and considered what next should he do that evening it was now past eight oclock and how should he use the four five or perhaps six hours which remained to him before he should go to bed the temptation to which he was liable prompted him to return to his solitude in southampton buildings should he do so he would sleep till ten in his chairthen he would read and drink more tea or perhaps write till one and after that he would prowl about the purlieus of chancery lane the temple and lincolns inn till two or even three oclock in the morninglooking up at the old dingy windows and holding by aid of those powers which imagination gave him long intercourse with men among whom a certain weakness in his physical organisation did not enable him to live in the flesh well the policemen knew him as he roamed about and much they speculated as to his roamings but in these night wanderings he addressed no word to any one nor did any one ever address a word to him yet the world perhaps was more alive to him then than at any other period in the twentyfour hours  but on the present occasion the temptation was resisted he had not been at home during the whole week and knew well that he ought to give his daughters the countenance of his presence whether that feeling alone would have been sufficient to withdraw him from the charms of chancery lane and send him down to the villa may be doubted but there was that in the letter which he had perused so carefully which he knew must be communicated to his girls his niece mary bonner was now an orphan and would arrive in england from jamaica in about a fortnight her mother had been sir thomass sister and had been at this time dead about three years general bonner the father had now died and the girl was left an orphan almost penniless and with no near friend unless the underwoods would befriend her news of the generals death had reached sir thomas beforeand he had already made inquiry as to the fate of his niece through her late fathers agents of the generals means he had known absolutely nothingbelieving however that they were confined to his pay as an officer now he was told that the girl would be at southampton in a fortnight and that she was utterly destitute he declared to himself as he stood on the steps of the club that he would go home and consult his daughtersbut his mind was in fact made up as to his nieces fate long before he got homebefore he turned out of pall mall into st jamess park he would sometimes talk to himself of consulting his daughters but in truth he very rarely consulted any human being as to what he would do or leave undone if he went straight he went straight without other human light than such as was given to him by his own intellect his own heart and his own conscience it took him about an hour and a half to reach his home but of that time fourfifths were occupied not in resolving what he would do in this emergency but in deep grumblings and regrets that there should be such a thing to be done at all all new cares were grievous to him nayold cares were grievous but new cares were terrible though he was bold in deciding he was very timid in looking forward as to the results of that decision of course the orphan girl must be taken into his houseand of course he must take upon himself the duty of a father in regard to her     chapter ii  popham villa   popham villa was the name of the house at fulhamas was to be seen by all men passing by for it was painted up conspicuously on the pillars through which the gate led into the garden mr underwood when he had first taken the place had wished to expunge the name feeling it to be cockneyfied pretentious and unalluring but mrs underwood had rather liked it and it remained it was a subject of ridicule with the two girls but they had never ventured to urge its withdrawal and after his wifes death sir thomas never alluded to the subject popham villa it was therefore and there the words remained the house was unpretentious containing only two sittingrooms besides a small side closetfor it could hardly be called morewhich the girls even in their mothers lifetime had claimed as their own but the drawingroom was as pretty as room could be opening on to the lawn with folding windows and giving a near view of the bright river as it flowed by with just a glimpse of the bridge that and the diningroom and the little closet were all on the ground floor and above were at any rate as many chambers as the family required the girls desired no better houseif only their father could be with them but he would urge that his books were all in london and that even were he willing to move them there was no room for them in popham villa  it was sad enough for the two girlsthis kind of life the worst of it perhaps was this that they never knew when to expect him a word had been said once as to the impracticability of having dinner ready for a gentleman when the gentleman would never say whether he would want a dinner it had been an unfortunate remark for sir thomas had taken advantage of it by saying that when he came he would come after dinner unless he had certified to the contrary beforehand then after dinner would come on him the temptation of returning to his chambers and so it would go on with him from day to day  on this friday evening the girls almost expected him as he rarely let a week pass without visiting them and still more rarely came to them on a saturday he found them out upon the lawn or rather on the brink of the river and with them was standing a young man whom he knew well he kissed each of the girls and then gave his hand to the young man i am glad to see you ralph he said have you been here long  as much as an hour or two i fear patience will tell you i meant to have got back by the 915 from putney but i have been smoking and dreaming and talking till now it is nearly ten  there is a train at 1030 said the eldest miss underwood  and another at 1115 said the young man  sir thomas was especially anxious to be alone with his daughters but he could not tell the guest to go nor was he justified in feeling any anger at his presence therethough he did experience some prick of conscience in the matter if it was wrong that his daughters should be visited by a young man in his absence the fault lay in his absence rather than with the young man for coming or with the girls for receiving him the young man had been a ward of his own and for a year or two in former times had been so intimate in his house as to live with his daughters almost as an elder brother might have done but young ralph newton had early in life taken rooms for himself in london had then ceased to be a ward and had latterlyso sir thomas understoodlived such a life as to make him unfit to be the trusted companion of his two girls and yet there had been nothing in his mode of living to make it necessary that he should be absolutely banished from the villa he had spent more money than was fitting and had got into debt and sir thomas had had trouble about his affairs he too was an orphanand the nephew and the heir of an old country squire whom he never saw what money he had received from his father he had nearly spent and it was rumoured of him that he had raised funds by postobits on his uncles life of all these things more will be told hereafterbut sir thomasthough he had given no instruction on the subject and was averse even to allude to itdid not like to think that ralph newton was at the villa with the girls in his absence his girls were as good as gold he was sure of that he told himself over and over again that were it not so he would not have left them so constantly without his own care patience the elder was a marvel among young women for prudence conduct and proper feeling and clarissa whom he had certainly ever loved the better of the two was as far as he knew faultlessa little more passionate a little warmer somewhat more fond of pleasure than her sister but on that account only the more to be loved nothing that he could do would make them safer than they would be by their own virtue but still he was not pleased to think that ralph newton was often at the villa when a man such as sir thomas has been entrusted with the charge of a young man with great expectations he hardly wishes his daughter to fall in love with his ward whether his ward be prudent or imprudent in his manner of life  sir thomas was hot and tired after his walk and there was some little fuss in getting him sodawater and tea and as it was plain to see that things were not quite comfortable ralph newton at last took his departure so as to catch the earlier of the two trains which had been mentioned it was nevertheless past ten when he wentand then sir thomas sitting at the open window of the drawingroom again took out the letter patience he said addressing his elder daughter as he withdrew the enclosure from the envelope mary bonner will be in england in a fortnight what shall we do for her as he spoke he held the letter in a manner which justified the girl in taking it from his hand he allowed it to go to her and she read it before she answered him  it was a very sad letter cold in its language but still full of pathos her friends in the west indiessuch friends as she hadhad advised her to proceed to england she was given to understand that when her fathers affairs should be settled there would be left to her not more than a few hundred pounds would her uncle provide for her some humble home for the present and assist her in her future endeavours to obtain employment as a governess she could she thought teach music and french and would endeavour to fit herself for the work of tuition in other respects i know she said how very slight is my claim upon one who has never seen me and who is connected with me only by my poor motherbut perhaps you will allow me to trouble you so far in my great distress  she must come here of course papa said patience as she handed the letter to clarissa  yes she must come here said sir thomas  but i mean to stayfor always  yesto stay for always i cannot say that the arrangement is one to which i look forward with satisfaction a man does not undertake new duties without fearsand especially not such a duty as this to which i can see no end and which i may probably be quite unable to perform  papa i am sure she will be nice said clarissa  but why are you sure my dear we will not argue that however she must come and we will hope that she will prove to be what clarissa calls nice i cannot allow my sisters child to go out into the world as a governess while i have a home to offer her she must come here as one of our household i only hope she will not interfere with your happiness  i am sure she will not said clarissa  we will determine that she shall add to it and will do our best to make her happy said patience  it is a great risk but we must run it said sir thomas and so the matter was settled then he explained to them that he intended to go himself to southampton to receive his niece and that he would bring her direct from that port to her new home patience offered to accompany him on the journey but this he declined as unnecessary everything was decided between them by eleven oclockeven to the room which mary bonner should occupy and then the girls left their father knowing well that he would not go to bed for the next four hours he would sleep in his chair for the next two hours and would then wander about or read or perhaps sit and think of this added care till the night would be half over nor did the two sisters go to bed at once this new arrangement so important to their father was certainly of more importance to them he no doubt would still occupy his chambers would still live practically alone in london though he was in theory the presiding genius of the household at fulham but they must take to themselves a new sister and they both knew in spite of clarissas enthusiasm that it might be that the new sister would be one whom they could not love i dont remember that i ever heard a word about her said clarissa  i have been told that she is pretty i do remember that said patience  how old is she younger than we i suppose now clarissa underwood at this time was oneandtwenty and patience was nearly two years her senior  oh yesabout nineteen i should say i think i have been told that there were four or five older than mary who all died is it not strange and terribleto be left alone the last of a large family with not a relation whom one has ever seen  poor dear girl  if she wrote the letter herself continued patience i think she must be clever  i am sure i could not have written a letter at all in such a position said clarissa and so they sat almost as late as their father discussing the probable character and appearance of this new relation and the chance of their being able to love her with all their hearts there was the necessity for an immediate small sacrifice but as to that there was no difficulty hitherto the two sisters had occupied separate bedrooms but now as one chamber must be given up to the stranger it would be necessary that they should be together but there are sacrifices which entail so little pain that the pleasant feeling of sacrificial devotion much more than atones for the consequences  patience underwood the elder and the taller of the two girls was certainly not pretty her figure was good her hands and feet were small and she was in all respects like a lady but she possessed neither the feminine loveliness which comes so often simply from youth nor that other rarer beauty which belongs to the face itself and is produced by its own lines and its own expression her countenance was thin and might perhaps have been called dry and hard she was very like her fatherwithout however her fathers nose and the redeeming feature of her face was to be found in that sense of intelligence which was conveyed by her bright grey eyes there was the long chin and there was the long upper lip which exaggerated in her fathers countenance made him so notoriously plain a man and then her hair though plentiful and long did not possess that shining lustre which we love to see in girls and which we all recognise as one of the sweetest graces of girlhood such outwardly was patience underwood and of all those who knew her well there was not one so perfectly satisfied that she did want personal attraction as was patience underwood herself but she never spoke on the subjecteven to her sister she did not complain neither as is much more common did she boast that she was no beauty her sisters loveliness was very dear to her and of that she would sometimes break out into enthusiastic words but of herself externally she said nothing her gifts if she had any were of another sort and she was by no means willing to think of herself as one unendowed with gifts she was clever and knew herself to be clever she could read and understood what she read she saw the difference between right and wrong and believed that she saw it clearly she was not diffident of herself and certainly was not unhappy she had a strong religious faith and knew how to supplement the sometimes failing happiness of this world by trusting in the happiness of the next were it not for her extreme anxiety in reference to her father patience underwood would have been a happy woman  clarissa the younger was a beauty the fact that she was a beauty was acknowledged by all who knew her and was well known to herself it was a fact as to which there had never been a doubt since she was turned fifteen she was somewhat shorter than her sister and less slender she was darker in complexion and her hair which was rich in colour as brown hair can be was lustrous silky and luxuriant she wore it now indeed according to the fashion of the day with a chignon on her head but beneath that there were curls which escaped and over her forehead it was clipped short and was wavy and impertinentas is also the fashion of the day such as it was she so wore it that a man could hardly wish it to be otherwise her eyes unlike those of her father and sister were blue and in the whole contour of her features there was nothing resembling theirs the upper lip was short and the chin was short and dimpled there was a dimple on one cheek too a charm so much more maddening than when it is to be seen on both sides alike her nose was perfectnot grecian nor roman nor egyptianbut simply english only just not retroussé there were those who said her mouth was a thought too wide and her teeth too perfectbut they were of that class of critics to whom it is a necessity to cavil rather than to kiss added to all this there was a childishness of manner about her of which though she herself was somewhat ashamed all others were enamoured it was not the childishness of very youthful yearsfor she had already reached the mature age of twentyone but the halfdoubting halfpouting halfyielding halfobstinate soft loving lovable childishness which gives and exacts caresses and which when it is genuine may exist to an age much beyond that which clarissa underwood had reached  but with all her charms clarissa was not so happy a girl as her sister and for this lack of inward satisfaction there were at this time two causes she believed herself to be a fool and was in that respect jealous of her sisterand she believed herself to be in love and in love almost without hope as to her foolishness it seemed to her to be a fact admitted by every one but by patience herself not a human being came near her who did not seem to imply that any question as to wisdom or judgment or erudition between her and her sister would be a farce patience could talk italian could read german knew at least by name every poet that had ever written and was always able to say exactly what ought to be done she could make the servants love her and yet obey her and could always dress on her allowance without owing a shilling whereas clarissa was obeyed by no one was in debt to her bootmaker and milliner and let her struggles in the cause be as gallant as they might could not understand a word of dante and was aware that she read the faery queen exactly as a child performs a lesson as to her lovethere was a sharper sorrow need the reader be told that ralph newton was the hero to whom its late owner believed that her heart had been given this was a sore subject which had never as yet been mentioned frankly even between the two sisters in truth though patience thought that there was a fancy she did not think that there was much more than fancy and as far as she could see there was not even fancy on the young mans part no word had been spoken that could be accepted as an expression of avowed love so at least patience believed and she would have been very unhappy had it been otherwise for ralph newton was notin her opiniona man to whose love her sister could be trusted with confidence and yet beyond her father and sister there was no one whom patience loved as she did ralph newton  there had however been a little episode in the life of clarissa underwood which had tended to make her sister uneasy and which the reader may as well hear at once there was a second newton a younger brotherbut though younger not only in orders but in the possession of a living gregory newtonthe rev gregory newtonwho in the space of a few weeks acquaintance had fallen into a fury of love for clarissa and in the course of three months had made her as many offers and had been as often refused this had happened in the winter and spring previous to the opening of our storyand both patience and sir thomas had been well disposed towards the young mans suit he had not been committed to sir thomass charge as had ralph having been brought up under the care of the uncle whose heir ralph was through the obligation of legal settlements this uncle having quarrelled with his own brother since dead and with his heir had nevertheless taken his other nephew by the hand and had bestowed upon the young clergyman the living of newton gregory newton had been brought to the villa by his brother and had at once fallen on his knees before the beauty but the beauty would have none of him and he had gone back to his living in hampshire a brokenhearted priest and swain now patience though she had never been directly so informed feared that some partiality for the unworthy ralph had induced her sister to refuse offers from the brother who certainly was worthy to the thinking of patience underwood no lot in life could be happier for a woman than to be the wife of a zealous and praiseworthy parson of an english country parishno lot in life at least could be happier for any woman who intended to become a wife  such were the two girls at popham villa who were told on that evening that a new sister was to be brought home to them when the next morning came they were of course still full of the subject sir thomas was to go into london after breakfast and he intended to walk over the bridge and catch an early train he was as intent on being punctual to time as though he were bound to be all day in court and fond as he might be of his daughters had already enjoyed enough of the comforts of home to satisfy his taste he did love his daughtersbut even with them he was not at his ease the only society he could enjoy was that of his books or of his own thoughts and the only human being whom he could endure to have long near him with equanimity was joseph stemm he had risen at nine as was his custom and before ten he was bustling about with his hat and gloves papa said clarissa when shall you be home again  i cant name a day my dear  papa do come soon  no doubt i shall come soon there was a slight tone of anger in his voice as he answered the last entreaty and he was evidently in a hurry with his hat and gloves  papa said patience of course we shall see you again before you go to southampton the voice of the elder was quite different from that of the younger daughter and sir thomas though the tone and manner of the latter question was injurious to him hardly dared to resent it yet they were not as he thought justified it now wanted twelve days to the date of his intended journey and not more than three or four times in his life had he been absent from home for twelve consecutive days  yes my dear he said i shall be home before that  because papa there are things to be thought of  what things  clarissa and i had better have a second bed in our roomunless you object  you know i dont object have i ever objected to anything of the kind he now stood impatient with his hat in his hand  i hardly like to order things without telling you papa and there are a few other articles of furniture needed  you can get what you want run up to town and go to barlows you can do that as well as i can  but i should have liked to have settled something about our future way of living before mary comes said patience in a very low voice  sir thomas frowned and then he answered her very slowly there can be nothing new settled at all things will go on as they are at present and i hope patience you will do your best to make your cousin understand and receive favourably the future home which she will have to inhabit  you may be sure papa i shall do my best said patienceand then sir thomas went  he did return to the villa before his journey to southampton but it was only on the eve of that journey during the interval the two girls together had twice sought him at his chambersa liberty on their part which as they well knew he did not at all approve sir thomas is very busy old stemm would say shaking his head even to his masters daughters and if you wouldnt mind then he would make a feint as though to close the door and would go through various manoeuvres of defence before he would allow the fort to be stormed but clarissa would ridicule old stemm to his face and patience would not allow herself to be beaten by him on their second visit they did make their way into their fathers sanctumand they never knew whether in truth he had been there when they called before old stemm doesnt in the least mind what lies he tells clarissa had said to this patience made no reply feeling that the responsibility for those figments might not perhaps lie exclusively on old stemms shoulders  my dears this is such an outoftheway place for you sir thomas said as soon as the girls had made good their entrance but the girls had so often gone through all this before that they now regarded but little what ejaculations of that nature were made to them  i have come to show you this list papa said patience sir thomas took the list and found that it contained various articles for bedroom and kitchen usetowels sheets pots and pans knives and forks and even a set of curtains and a carpet  i shouldnt have thought that a girl of eighteen would have wanted all these thingsa new corkscrew for instancebut if she does as i told you before you must get them  of course they are not all for mary said patience  the fact is papa said clarissa you never do look to see how things are getting worn out  clarissa exclaimed the angry father  indeed papa if you were more at home and saw these things began patience  i have no doubt it is all right get what you want go to barlows and to greens and to block and blowhard dont let there be any bills thats all i will give you cheques when you get the accounts and now my dearsi am in the middle of work which will not bear interruption then they left him and when he did come to the villa on the evening before his journey most of the new articlesincluding the corkscrewwere already in the house     chapter iii  what happened on the lawn at popham villa   sir thomas started for southampton on a friday having understood that the steamer from st thomas would reach the harbour on saturday morning he would then immediately bring mary bonner up to london and down to fulhamand there certainly had come to be a tacit understanding that he would stay at home on the following sunday on the friday evening the girls were alone at the villa but there was nothing in this as it was the life to which they were accustomed they habitually dined at two calling the meal lunchthen had a five or six oclock teaand omitted altogether the ceremony of dinner they had local acquaintances with whom occasionally they would spend their evenings and now and then an old maid or twonow and then also a young maid or two would drop in on them but it was their habit to be alone during these days of which we are speaking clarissa would take her faery queen and would work hard perhaps for half an hour then the faery queen would be changed for a novel and she would look up from her book to see whether patience had turned upon her any glance of reprobation patience in the meantime would sit with unsullied conscience at her work and so the evenings would glide by and in these soft summer days the girls would sit out upon the lawn and would watch the boats of london watermen as they passed up and down below the bridge on this very evening the last on which they were to be together before the arrival of their cousinpatience came out upon the lawn with her hat and gloves i am going across to miss spooners she said will you come but clarissa was idle and making some little joke not very much to the honour of miss spooner declared that she was hot and tired and had a headache and would stay at home dont be long patty she said it is such a bore to be alone patience promised a speedy return and making her way to the gate crossed the road to miss spooners abode she was hardly out of sight when the nose of a wager boat was driven up against the bank and there was ralph newton sitting in a blue jersey shirt with a straw hat and the perspiration running from his handsome brow clarissa did not see him till he whistled to her and then she started and laughed and ran down to the boat and hardly remembered that she was quite alone till she had taken his hand i dont think ill come out but you must get me some sodawater and brandy said ralph wheres patience  patience has gone out to see an old maid and we havent got any brandy  i am so hot said ralph carefully extricating himself from the boat you have got sherry  yes weve got sherry and port wine and gladstone and away she went to get him such refreshment as the villa possessed  he drank his sherry and sodawater and lit his pipe and lay there on the lawn as though he were quite at home and clarissa ministered to himunconscious of any evil he had been brought up with them on terms of such close intimacy that she was entitled to regard him as a brotheralmost as a brotherif only she were able so to regard him it was her practice to call him ralph and her own name was as common to him as though she were in truth his sister and what do you think of this new cousin he asked   illustration he drank his sherry and sodawater and lit his pipe and lay there on the lawn as though he were quite at home      i can think nothing as yetbut i mean to like her  i mean to hate her furiously said ralph  that is nonsense she will be nothing to you you neednt even see her unless you please but ralph do put your jacket on im sure youll catch cold and she went down and hooked his jacket for him out of the boat and put it over his shoulders i wont have you throw it off she said if you come here you must do as youre told  you neednt have knocked the pipe out of my mouth all the same what is she like i wonder  veryvery beautiful im told  a kind of tropical venusall eyes and dark skin and black hair and strong passions and apt to murder peoplebut at the same time so lazy that she is never to do anything either for herself or anybody elsewouldnt fetch a fellows jacket for him let him be catching cold ever so fast  she wouldnt fetch yours i dare say  and why shouldnt she  because she doesnt know you  they soon get to know onegirls of that sort im told that in the west indies you become as thick as thieves in half a mornings flirtation and are expected to propose at the second meeting  that is not to be your way with our cousin i can assure you  but these proposals out there never mean much you may be engaged to half a dozen girls at the same time and be sure that each of them will be engaged to halfadozen men theres some comfort in that you know  oh ralph  thats what they tell me i havent been there i shall come and look at her you know  of course you will  and if she is very lovely  what then  i do like pretty girls you know  i dont know anything about it  i wonder what uncle gregory would say if i were to marry a west indian he wouldnt say much to me because we never speak but hed lead poor greg a horrid life hed be sure to think she was a nigger or at least a creole but i shant do that  you might do worse ralph  but i might do much better as he said this he looked up into her face with all the power of his eyes and poor clarissa could only blush she knew what he meant and knew that she was showing him that she was conscious she would have given much not to blush and not to have been so manifestly conscious but she had no power to control herself i might do much better he said dont you think so  as far as she could judge of her own feelings at this moment in the absolute absence of any previous accurate thought on the subject she fancied that a real undoubted undoubting trustworthy engagement with ralph newton would make her the happiest girl in england she had never told herself that she was in love with him she had never flattered herself that he was in love with hershe had never balanced the matter in her mind as a contingency likely to occur but now at this moment as he lay there smoking his pipe and looking full into her blushing face she did think that to have him for her own lover would be joy enough for her whole life she knew that he was idle extravagant fond of pleasure andunsteady as she in her vocabulary would be disposed to describe the character which she believed to be his but in her heart of hearts she liked unsteadiness in men if it were not carried too far ralphs brother the parson as to whom she was informed that he possessed every virtue incident to humanity and who was quite as goodlooking as his brother had utterly failed to touch her heart a black coat and a white cravat were antipathetic to her ralph as he lay on the green sward hot with linen trousers and a coloured flannel shirt with a small straw hat stuck on the edge of his head with nothing round his throat and his jacket over his shoulder with a pipe in his mouth and an empty glass beside him was to her in externals the beauideal of a young man and then though he was unsteady extravagant and idle his sins were not so deep as to exclude him from her fathers and her sisters favour he was there on the villa lawn not as an interloper but by implied permission though she made for herself no argument on the matternot having much time just now for arguingshe felt that it was her undoubted privilege to be made love to by ralph newton if he and she pleased so to amuse themselves she had never been told not to be made love to by him of course she would not engage herself without her fathers permission of course she would tell patience if ralph should say anything very special to her but she had a right to be made love to if she liked itand in this case she would like it but when ralph looked at her and asked her whether he might not do better than marry her west indian cousin she had not a word with which to answer him he smoked on for some seconds in silence still looking at her while she stood over him blushing then he spoke again i think i might do a great deal better but still she had not a word for him  ahi suppose i must be off he said jumping up on his legs and flinging his jacket over his arm patience will be in soon  i expect her every minute  if i were to saysomething uncivil about patience i suppose you wouldnt like it  certainly i shouldnt like it  only just to wish she were atjericho  nonsense ralph  yes that would be nonsense and the chances are you know that you would be at jericho with her dear dear claryyou know i love you then he put his right arm round her waist pipe and all and kissed her  she certainly had expected no such assaulthad not only not thought of it but had not known it to be among the possibilities that might occur to her she had never been so treated before one other lover she had hadas we know but by him she had been treated with the deference due by an inferior to a superior being it would have been very nice if ralph would have told her that he loved herbut this was not nice that had been done which she would not dare to tell to patiencewhich she could not have endured that patience should have seen she was bound to resent itbut how she stood silent for a moment and then burst into tears you are not angry with me clary he said  i am angryvery angry go away i will never speak to you again  you know how dearly i love you  i dont love you at all you have insulted me and i will never forgive you go away at this moment the step of patience coming up from the gate was heard upon the gravel clarissas first thought when she heard it was to hide her tears though the man had injured herinsulted herher very last resource would be to complain to others of the injury or the insult it must be hidden in her own breastbut remembered always forgotten it could not benor as she thought at the moment forgiven but above all it must not be repeated as to any show of anger against the sinner that was impossible to herbecause it was so necessary that the sin should be hidden  whatralph have you been here long asked patience looking with somewhat suspicious eyes at clarissas back which was turned to her  about half an hourwaiting for you and smoking and drinking sodawater i have a boat here and i must be off now  youll have the tide with you said clarissa with an effort  there is a tide in the affairs of men said ralph with a forced laugh my affairs shall at once take advantage of this tide ill come again very soon to see the new cousin goodbye girls then he inserted himself into his boat and took himself off without bestowing even anything of a special glance upon clarissa  is there anything the matter patience asked  noonly why did you stay all the evening with that stupid old woman when you promised me that you would be back in ten minutes  i said nothing about ten minutes clary and after all i havent been an hour gone miss spooner is in trouble about her tenant who wont pay the rent and she had to tell me all about it  stupid old woman  have you and ralph been quarrelling clary  nowhy should we quarrel  there seems to have been something wrong  its so stupid being found all alone here it makes one feel that one is so desolate i do wish papa would live with us like other girls fathers as he wont it would be much better not to let people come at all  patience was sure that something had happenedand that that something must have reference to the guise of lover either assumed or not assumed by ralph newton she accused her sister of no hypocrisy but she was aware that clarissas words were wild not expressing the girls thoughts and spoken almost at random something must be said and therefore these complaints had been made clary dear dont you like ralph she asked  no that isoh yes i like him of course my head aches and ill go to bed  wait a few minutes clary something has disturbed you has it not  everything disturbs me  but if there is anything special wont you tell me there had been something very special which clarissa certainly would not tell what has he said to you i dont think he would be simply cross to you  he has not been cross at all  what is it then wellif you wont tell me i think that you are afraid of me we never yet have been afraid of each other then there was a pause clary has he said thathe loves you there was another pause clarissa thought it all over and for a moment was not quite certain whether any such sweet assurance had or had not been given to her then she remembered his wordsyou know how dearly i love you but ought they to be sweet to her now had he not so offended her that there could never be forgiveness and if no forgiveness how then could his love be sweet to her patience waited and then repeated her question tell me clary what has he said to you  i dont know  do you love him clary  no i hate him  hate him clary you did not use to hate him you did not hate him yesterday you would not hate him without a cause my darling tell me what it means if you and i do not trust each other what will the world be to us there is no one else to whom we can tell our troubles nevertheless clarissa would not tell this trouble why do you say that you hate him  i dont know why oh dear patty why do you go on so yes he did say that he loved methere  and did that make you unhappy it need not make you unhappy though you should refuse him when his brother asked you to marry him that did not make you unhappy  yes it didvery  and is this the same  noit is quite different  i am afraid clary that ralph newton would not make a good husband he is extravagant and in debt and papa would not like it  then papa should not let him come here just as he pleases and whenever he likes it is papas faultthat is to say it would be if there were anything in it  is there nothing in it clary what answer did you make when he told you that he loved you  you came and i made no answer i do so wish that you had come before she wanted to tell her sister everything but the one thing but was unable to do so because the one thing affected the other things so vitally as it was patience finding that she could press her questions no further was altogether in the dark that ralph had made a declaration of love to her sister she did know but in what manner clarissa had received it she could not guess she had hitherto feared that clary was too fond of the young man but clary would now only say that she hated him but the matter would soon be set at rest ralph newton would now no doubt go to their father if sir thomas would permit it this newfangled hatred of clarys would patience thought soon be overcome if howeveras was more probablesir thomas should violently disapprove then there would be no more visits from ralph newton to the villa as there had been a declaration of love of course their father would be informed of it at once patience having so resolved allowed her sister to go to her bed without further questioning  in clarissas own bosom the great offence had been forgivenor rather condoned before the morning her lover had been very cruel to her very wicked and most unkindespecially unkind in this that he had turned to absolute pain a moment of life which might have been of all moments the fullest of joy and especially cruel in this that he had so treated her that she could not look forward to future joy without alloy she could forgive himyes but she could not endure that he should think that she would forgive him she was willing to blot out the offence as a thing by itself in an island of her lifeof which no one should ever think again was she to lose her lover for ever because she did not forgive him if they could only come to some agreement that the offence should be acknowledged to be heinous unpardonable but committed in temporary madness and that henceforward it should be buried in oblivion such agreement however was impossible there could be no speech about the matter was she or was she not to lose her lover for ever because he had done this wicked thing during the night she made up her mind that she could not afford to pay such a price for the sake of avenging virtue for the future she would be on her guard wicked and heartless man who had robbed her of so much and yet how charming he had been to her as he looked into her eyes and told her that he could do very much better than fall in love with her west indian cousin then she thought of the offence again ah if only a time might come in which they should be engaged together as man and wife with the consent of everybody then there would be no more offences     chapter iv  mary bonner   while clarissa underwood was being kissed on the lawn at popham villa sir thomas was sitting very disconsolate in a private room at the dolphin in southampton it had required no great consideration to induce him to resolve that a home should be given by him to his niece though he was a man so weak that he could allow himself to shun from day to day his daily dutyand to do this so constantly as to make up out of various omissions small in themselves a vast aggregate of misconductstill he was one who would certainly do what his conscience prompted him to be right in any great matter as to which the right and the wrong appeared to him to be clearly defined though he loved his daughters dearly he could leave them from day to day almost without protectionbecause each days fault in so doing was of itself but small this new niece of his he certainly did not love at all he had never seen her he was almost morbidly fearful of new responsibilities he expected nothing but trouble in thus annexing a new unknown member to his family and yet he had decided upon doing it because the duty to be done was great enough to be clearly markeddemanding an immediate resolve and capable of no postponement but as he thought of it sitting alone on the eve of the girls coming he was very uneasy what was he to do with her if he found her to be one difficult to manage selfwilled vexatious orworse againillconditioned as to conduct and hurtful to his own children should it even become imperative upon him to be rid of her how should riddance be effected and then what would she think of him and his habits of life  and this brought him to other reflections might it not be possible utterly to break up that establishment of his in southampton buildings so that he would be forced by the necessity of things to live at his homeat some home which he would share with the girls he knew himself well enough to be sure that while those chambers remained in his possession as long as that bedroom and bed were at his command he could not extricate himself from the dilemma day after day the temptation was too great for him and he hated the villa there was nothing there that he could do he had no books at the villa andso he averredthere was something in the air of fulham which prevented him from reading books when he brought them there no he must break altogether fresh ground and set up a new establishment one thing was clear he could not now do this before mary bonners arrival and therefore there was nothing to create any special urgency he had hoped that his girls would marry so that he might be left to live alone in his chamberswaited upon by old stemmwithout sin on his part but he was beginning to discover that girls do not always get married out of the way in their first bloom and now he was taking to himself another girl he must he knew give over all hope of escape in that direction he was very uneasy and when quite late at nightor rather early in the morninghe took himself to bed his slumbers were not refreshing the truth was that no air suited him for sleeping except the air of southampton buildings  the packet from st thomas was to be in the harbour at eight oclock the next morningtelegrams from cape clear the lizard eddystone lighthouse and where not having made all that as certain as sunrising at eight oclock he was down on the quay and there was the travelling city of the royal atlantic steam mail packet company at that moment being warped into the harbour the ship as he walked along the jetty was so near to him that he could plainly see the faces of the passengers on deckmen and women girls and children all dressed up to meet their friends on shore crowding the sides of the vessel in their eagerness to be among the first to get on shore he anxiously scanned the faces of the ladies that he might guess which was to be the lady that was to be to him almost the same as a daughter he saw not one as to whom he could say that he had a hope some there were in the crowd some three or four as to whom he acknowledged that he had a fear at last he remembered that his girl would necessarily be in deep mourning he saw two young women in blackbut there was nothing to prepossess him about either of them one of them was insignificant and very plain the other was fat and untidy they neither of them looked like ladies what if fate should have sent to him as a daughteras a companion for his girlsthat fat untidy illbred looking young woman as it happened the illbred looking young woman whom he feared was a cook who had married a shipsteward had gone out among the islands with her husband had found that the speculation did not answer and was now returning in the hope of earning her bread in her old vocation of this woman sir thomas underwood was in great dread  but at last he was on board and whispered his question to the purser miss bonner oh yes miss bonner was on board was he sir thomas underwood miss bonners uncle the purser evidently knew all about it and there was something in his tone which seemed to assure sir thomas that the fat untidy woman and his niece could not be one and the same person the purser had just raised his cap to sir thomas and had turned towards the cabinstairs to go in search of the lady herself but he was stopped immediately by miss bonner herself the purser did his task very wellsaid some slightest word to introduce the uncle and the niece together and then vanished sir thomas blushed shuffled with his feet and put out both his hands he was shy astonished and frightenedand did not know what to say the girl came up to him took his hand in hers holding it for a moment and then kissed it i did not think you would come yourself she said  of course i have come myself my girls are at home and will receive you tonight she said nothing further then but again raised his hand and kissed it  it is hardly too much to say that sir thomas underwood was in a tremble as he gazed upon his niece had she been on the deck as he walked along the quay and had he noted her he would not have dared to think that such a girl as that was coming to his house he declared to himself at once that she was the most lovely young woman he had ever seen she was tall and somewhat large with fair hair of which now but very little could be seen with dark eyes and perfect eyebrows and a face which either for colour or lines of beauty might have been taken as a model for any female saint or martyr there was a perfection of symmetry about itand an assertion of intelligence combined with the loveliness which almost frightened her uncle for there was something there also beyond intelligence and loveliness we have heard of an eye to threaten and command sir thomas did not at this moment tell himself that mary bonner had such an eye but he did involuntarily and unconsciously acknowledge to himself that over such a young lady as this whom he now saw before him it would be very difficult for him to exercise parental control he had heard that she was nineteen but it certainly seemed to him that she was older than his own daughters as to clary there could be no question between the two girls as to which of them would exercise authority over the othernot by force of agebut by dint of character will and fitness and this mary bonner who now shone before him as a goddess almost a young woman to whom no ordinary man would speak without that kind of trepidation which goddesses do inflict on ordinary men had proposed to herselfto go out as a governess indeed at this very moment such probably was her own idea as yet she had received no reply to the letter she had written other than that which was now conveyed by her uncles presence  a few questions were asked as to the voyage noshe had not been at all ill i have almost feared she said to reach england thinking i should be so desolate we will not let you be desolate said sir thomas brightening up a little under the graciousness of the goddesss demeanour my girls are looking forward to your coming with the greatest delight then she asked some question as to her cousins and sir thomas thought that there was majesty even in her voice it was low soft and musical but yet even in that as in her eye there was something that indicated a power of command  he had no servant with him to assist in looking after her luggage old stemm was the only man in his employment and he could hardly have brought stemm down to southampton on such an errand but he soon found that everybody about the ship was ready to wait upon miss bonner even the captain came to take a special farewell of her and the second officer seemed to have nothing to do but to look after her the doctor was at her elbow to the lastand all her boxes and trunks seemed to extricate themselves from the general mass with a readiness which is certainly not experienced by ordinary passengers there are certain favours in life which are very charmingbut very unjust to others and which we may perhaps lump under the name of priority of service money will hardly buy it when money does buy it there is no injustice when priority of service is had like a coachandfour by the man who can afford to pay for it industry which is the source of wealth receives its fitting reward rank will often procure it most unjustlyas we who have no rank feel sometimes with great soreness position other than that of rank official position or commercial position will secure it in certain cases a railway train is stopped at a wrong place for a railway director or a postoffice manager gets his letters taken after time these too are grievances but priority of service is perhaps more readily accorded to feminine beauty and especially to unprotected feminine beauty than to any other form of claim whether or no this is ever felt as a grievance ladies who are not beautiful may perhaps be able to say there flits across our memory at the present moment some reminiscence of angry glances at the too speedy attendance given by customhouse officers to pretty women but this priority of service is we think if not deserved at least so natural as to take it out of the catalogue of evils of which complaint should be made one might complain with as much avail that men will fall in love with pretty girls instead of with those who are ugly on the present occasion sir thomas was well contented he was out of the ship and through the custom house and at the railway station and back at the inn before the struggling mass of passengers had found out whether their longedfor boxes had or had not come with them in the ship and then miss bonner took it allnot arrogantly as though it were her due but just as the grass takes rain or the flowers sunshine these good things came to her from heaven and no doubt she was thankful but they came to her so customarily as does a mans dinner to him or his bed that she could not manifest surprise at what was done for her   illustration even the captain came to take a special farewell of her      sir thomas hardly spoke to her except about her journey and her luggage till they were down together in the sittingroom at the inn then he communicated to her his proposal as to her future life it was right he thought that she should know at once what he intended two hours ago before he had seen her he had thought of telling her simply where she was to live and of saying that he would find a home for her now he found it expedient to place the matter in a different light he would offer her the shelter of his roof as though she were a queen who might choose among her various palaces mary he said we hope that you will stay with us altogether  to live with youdo you mean  certainly to live with us  i have no right to expect such an offer as that  but every right to accept it my dear when it is made that is if it suits you  i had not dreamed of that i thought that perhaps you would let me come to you for a few weekstill i should know what to do  you shall come and be one of us altogether my dear if you think that you will like it my girls have no nearer relative than you and we are not so barbarous as to turn our backs on a newfound cousin she again kissed his hand and then turned away from him and wept you feel it all strange now he said but i hope we shall be able to make you comfortable  i have been so lonely she sobbed out amidst her tears  he had not dared to say a word to her about her father whose death had taken place not yet three months since of his late brotherinlaw he had known little or nothing except that the general had been a man who always found it difficult to make both ends meet and who had troubled him frequently not exactly for loans but in regard to money arrangements which had been disagreeable to him whether general bonner had or had not been an affectionate father he had never heard there are men who in sir thomass position would have known all about such a niece after a few hours acquaintance but our lawyer was not such a man though the girl seemed to him to be everything that was charming he did not dare to question her and when they arrived at the station in london no word had as yet been said about the general  as they were having the luggage piled on the top of a cab the fat cook passed along the platform i hope you are more comfortable now mrs woods said mary bonner with a smile as sweet as may while she gave her hand to the woman  thankee miss im better but its only a moil of trouble one thing as well as tother mrs woods was evidently very melancholy at the contemplation of her prospects  i hope youll find yourself comfortable now then she whispered to sir thomasshe is a poor young woman whose husband has ill used her and she lost her only child and has now come here to earn her bread she isnt nice looking but she is so good sir thomas did not dare to tell mary bonner that he had already noticed mrs wood and that he had conceived the idea that mrs wood was the niece of whom he had come in search  they made the journey at once to fulham in the cab and sir thomas found it to be very long he was proud of his new niece but he did not know what to say to her and he felt that she though he was sure that she was clever gave him no encouragement to speak it was all very well while with her beautiful eyes full of tears she had gone through the ceremony of kissing his hand in token of her respect and gratitudebut that had been done often enough and could not very well be repeated in the cab so they sat silent and he was rejoiced when he saw those offensive words popham villa on the posts of his gateway we have only a humble little house my dear he said as they turned in she looked at him and smiled i believe you west indians generally are lodged very sumptuously  papa had a large straggling place up in the hills but it was anything but sumptuous i do love the idea of an english home where things are neat and nice oh dearhow lovely that is the river thamesisnt it how very beautiful then the two girls were at the door of the cab and the newcomer was enveloped in the embraces of her cousins  sir thomas as he walked along the banks of the river while the young ladies prepared each other for dinner reflected that he had never in his life done such a days work before as he had just accomplished when he had married a wife that indeed had been a great piece of business but it had been done slowlyfor he had been engaged four yearsand he had of course been much younger at that period now he had brought into his family a new inmate who would force him in his old age to change all his habits of life he did not think that he would dare to neglect mary bonner and to stay in london while she lived at the villa he was almost sorry that he had ever heard of mary bonner in spite of her beauty and although he had as yet been able to find in her no cause of complaint she was ladylike and quietbut yet he was afraid of her when she came down into the drawingroom with her hand clasped in that of clarissa he was still more afraid of her she was dressed all in black with the utmost simplicitywith nothing on her by way of ornament beyond a few large black beads but yet she seemed to him to be splendid there was a grace of motion about her that was almost majestic clary was very prettyvery pretty indeed but clary was just the girl that an old gentleman likes to fetch him his slippers and give him his tea sir thomas felt that old as he was it would certainly be his business to give mary bonner her tea  the two girls contrived to say a few words to their father that night before they joined mary amidst her trunks in her bedroom papa isnt she lovely said clarissa  she certainly is a very handsome young woman  and not a bit like what i expected continued clary of course i knew she was goodlooking i had always heard that but i thought that she would have been a sort of west indian girl dark and lazy and selfish ralph was saying that is what they are out there  i dont suppose that ralph knows anything about it said sir thomas and what do you say of your new cousin patience  i think i shall love her dearly she is so gentle and sweet  but she is not at all what you expected demanded clarissa  i hardly know what i expected replied the prudent patience but certainly i did not expect anything so lovely as she is of course we cant know her yet but as far as one can judge i think i shall like her  but she is so magnificently beautiful said the energetic clarissa  i think she is said sir thomas and i quite admit that it is a kind of beauty to surprise one it did surprise me had not one of you better go upstairs to her then both the girls bounded off to assist their cousin in her chamber     chapter v  mr neefit and his family   mr neefit was a breechesmaker in conduit street of such repute that no hunting man could be said to go decently into the hunting field unless decorated by a garment made in mr neefits establishment his manipulation of leather was something marvellous and in latter years he had added to his original artan art which had at first been perfect rather than comprehensivean exquisite skill in cords buckskins and such like materials when his trade was becoming prosperous he had thought of degenerating into a tailor adding largely to his premises and of compensating his pride by the prospects of great increase to his fortune but an angel of glory had whispered to him to let well alone and he was still able to boast that all his measurements had been confined to the legs of sportsmen instead of extending his business he had simply extended his price and had boldly clapped on an extra halfguinea to every pair that he supplied the experiment was altogether successful and when it was heard by the riding men of the city that mr neefits prices were undoubtedly higher than those of any other breechesmaker in london and that he had refused to supply breeches for the grooms of a marquis because the marquis was not a hunting man the riding men of the city flocked to him in such numbers that it became quite a common thing for them to give their orders in june and july so that they might not be disappointed when november came round mr neefit was a prosperous man but he had his troubles now it was a great trouble to him that some sporting men would be so very slow in paying for the breeches in which they took pride  mr neefits fortune had not been rapid in early life he had begun with a small capital and a small establishment and even now his place of business was very limited in size he had been clever enough to make profit even out of its smallnessand had contrived that it should be understood that the little back room in which men were measured was so diminutive because it did not suit his special business to welcome a crowd it was his pride he said to wait upon hunting menbut with the garments of the world at large he wished to have no concern whatever in the outer shop looking into conduit street there was a long counter on which goods were unrolled for inspection and on which an artist the solemnity of whose brow and whose rigid silence betokened the nature of his great employment was always cutting out leather this grave man was a german and there was a rumour among young sportsmen that old neefit paid this highlyskilled operator £600 a year for his services nobody knew as he did how each morsel of leather would behave itself under the needle or could come within two hairbreadths of him in accuracy across the kneepan as for measuring mr neefit did that himselfalmost always to be measured by mr neefit was as essential to perfection as to be cut out for by the german there were rumours indeed that from certain classes of customers mr neefit and the great foreigner kept themselves personally aloof it was believed that mr neefit would not condescend to measure a retail tradesman latterly indeed there had arisen a doubt whether he would lay his august hand on a stockbrokers leg though little wallop one of the young glories of capel court swears that he is handled by him every year confound is impudence says wallop id like to see him sending a foreman to me and as for cutting dyou think i dont know bawwahs and the name of the foreign artist is not exactly known but it is pronounced as we have written it and spelt in that fashion by sporting gentlemen when writing to each other  our readers may be told in confidence that up to a very late date mr neefit lived in the rooms over his shop this is certainly not the thing for a prosperous tradesman to do indeed if a tradesman be known not to have a private residence he will hardly become prosperous but neefit had been a cautious man and till two years before the commencement of our story he had actually lived in conduit streetworking hard however to keep his residence a deep secret from his customers at large now he was the proud possessor of a villa residence at hendon two miles out in the country beyond the swiss cottage and all his customers knew that he was never to be found before 930 am or after 515 pm  as we have said mr neefit had his troubles and one of his great troubles was our young friend ralph newton ralph newton was a hunting man with a stud of horsesnever less than four and sometimes running up to seven and eightalways standing at the moonbeam at barnfield all men know that barnfield is in the middle of the b b huntthe two initials standing for those two sporting counties berkshire and buckinghamshire now mr neefit had a very large connexion in the b b and though he never was on horseback in his life subscribed twentyfive pounds a year to the pack mr ralph newton had long favoured him with his custom but we are sorry to say mr ralph newton had become a thorn in the flesh to many a tradesman in these days it was not that he never paid he did pay something but as he ordered more than he paid the sumtotal against him was always an increasing figure but then he was a most engaging civilspoken young man whose order it was almost impossible to decline it was known moreover that his prospects were so good nevertheless it is not pleasant for a breechesmaker to see the second hundred pound accumulating on his books for leather breeches for one gentleman what does he do with em old neefit would say to himself but he didnt dare to ask any such question of mr newton it isnt for a tradesman to complain that a gentleman consumes too many of his articles things however went so far that mr neefit found it to be incumbent on him to make special inquiry about those prospects things had gone very far indeedfor ralph newton appeared one summer evening at the villa at hendon and absolutely asked the breechesmaker to lend him a hundred pounds before he left he had taken tea with mr and mrs and miss neefit on the lawn and had received almost a promise that the loan should be forthcoming if he would call in conduit street on the following morning that had been early in may and ralph newton had called and though there had been difficulties he had received the money before three days had passed  mr neefit was a stout little man with a bald head and somewhat protrusive eyes whose manners to his customers contained a combination of dictatorial assurance and subservience which he had found to be efficacious in his peculiar business on general subjects he would rub his hands and bow his head and agree most humbly with every word that was uttered in the same day he would be a radical and a conservative devoted to the church and a scoffer at parsons animated on behalf of staghounds and a loud censurer of aught in the way of hunting other than the orthodox fox on all trivial outside subjects he considered it to be his duty as a tradesman simply to ingratiate himself but in a matter of breeches he gave way to no man let his custom be what it might he knew his business and was not going to be told by any man whether the garments which he made did or did not fit it was the duty of a gentleman to come and allow him to see them on while still in a halfembryo condition if gentlemen did their duty he was sure that he could do his he would take back anything that was not approved without a murmurbut after that he must decline further transactions it was moreover quite understood that to complain of his materials was so to insult him that he would condescend to make no civil reply an elderly gentleman from essex once told him that his buttons were given to breaking if you have your breecheswashedby an old womanin the countrysaid mr neefit very slowly looking into the elderly gentlemans face and then run through the manglethe buttons will break the elderly gentleman never dared even to enter the shop again  mr neefit was perhaps somewhat overimperious in matters relating to his own business but in excuse for him it must be stated that he was in truth an honest tradesmanhe was honest at least so far that he did make his breeches as well as he knew how he had made up his mind that the best way to make his fortune was to send out good articlesand he did his best whether or no he was honest in adding on that additional half guinea to the price because he found that the men with whom he dealt were fools enough to be attracted by a high price shall be left to advanced moralists to decide in that universal agreement with diverse opinions there must we fear have been something of dishonesty but he made the best of breeches put no shoddy or cheap stitching into them and was upon the whole an honest tradesman  from 930 to 515 were mr neefits hours but it had come to be understood by those who knew the establishment well that from halfpast twelve to halfpast one the master was always absent the young man who sat at the high desk and seemed to spend all his time in contemplating the bad debts in the ledger would tell gentlemen who called up to one that mr neefit was in the city after one it was always said that mr neefit was lunching at the restaurong the truth was that mr neefit always dined in the middle of the day at a publichouse round the corner having a chop and a follow chop a pint of beer a penny newspaper and a pipe when the villa at hendon had been first taken mrs neefit had started late dinners but that vigilant and intelligent lady had soon perceived that this simply meant in regard to her husband two dinners a dayand apoplexy she had therefore returned to the old waysan early dinner for herself and daughter and a little bit of supper at night now one day in junethat very saturday on which sir thomas underwood brought his niece home to fulham the day after that wicked kiss on the lawn at fulham ralph newton walked into neefits shop during the hour of mr neefits absence and orderedthree pair of breeches herr bawwah the cutter who never left his board during the day for more than five minutes at a time remained as was his custom mute and apparently inattentive but the foreman came down from his perch and took the order mr neefit was out unfortunatelyin the city ralph newton remarked that his measure was not in the least altered gave his order and went out  three pairleather asked mr neefit when he returned raising his eyebrows and clearly showing that the moment was not one of unmixed delight  two leatherone cord said the foreman he had four pair last year said mr neefit in a tone so piteous that it might almost have been thought that he was going to weep  one hundred and eightynine pounds fourteen shillings and nine pence was the christmas figure said the foreman turning back to a leaf in the book which he found without any difficulty mr neefit took himself to the examination of certain completed articles which adorned his shop as though he were anxious to banish from his mind so painful a subject is he to ave em mr neefit asked the foreman the master was still silent and still fingered the materials which his very soul loved he must ave a matter of twenty pair by himunless he sells em said the suspicious foreman  he dont sell em said mr neefit he aint one of that sort you can put em in hand waddle  very well mr neefit i only thought id mention it it looked queer like his coming just when you was out  i dont see anything queer in it he aint one of that sort do you go on mr waddle knew nothing of the hundred pounds nor did he know that ralph newton hadtwice drank tea at hendon on both occasions mrs neefit had declared that if ever she saw a gentleman mr newton was a gentleman and miss neefit though her words had been very few had evidently approved of mr newtons manners now miss neefit was a beauty and an heiress  mr waddle had hardly been silenced and had just retired with melancholy diligence amidst the records of unsatisfactory commercial transactions before ralph newton again entered the shop he shook hands with mr neefitas was the practice with many favourite customersand immediately went to work in regard to his new order as though every christmas and every midsummer saw an account closed on his behalf in mr neefits books i did say just now when i found you were out that last years lines would do but it may be you know that im running a little to flesh  we cant be too particular mr newton said the master  its all for your sake that i come said the young sportsman walking into the little room while mr neefit followed with his scraps of paper and tapes and waddle followed him to write down the figures i dont care much how they look myself  oh mr newton  i shouldnt like em to wrinkle inside the knee you know  that isnt likely with us i hope mr newton  and i own i do like to be able to get into them  we dont give much trouble in that way mr newton  but the fact is i have such trust in you and the silent gentleman out there that i believe you would fit me for the next twenty years though you were never to see me  oh thank you mr newton2 4 and 18th waddle i think mr newton is a little stouter but perhaps you may work that off before november mr newton thank you mr newtoni think thatll do youll find we shant be far wrong three pair mr newton  yesi think three pair will see me through next season i dont suppose i shall hunt above four days and i have some by me  some by him there must be drawers full of thempresses full of them chests full of them waddle the melancholy and suspicious waddle was sure that their customer was playing them falseraising money on the garments as soon as they were sent to him but he did not dare to say anything of this after the snubbing which he had already received if old neefit chose to be done by a dishonest young man it was nothing to him but in truth waddle did not understand men as well as did his masterand then he knew nothing of his masters ambitious hopes  the bishops came out very strong last nightdidnt they said ralph in the outer shop  very strong indeed mr newtonvery strong  but after all theyre nothing but a pack of old women  thats about what they are mr newton  not but what we must have a church i suppose  we should do very badly without a church mr newton at least that is my opinion then ralph left the shop and the breechesmaker bowed him out of the door  fifty thousand pounds said ralph newton to himself as he walked into bond street and down to his club when a man is really rich rumour always increases his moneyand rumour had doubled the fortune which mr neefit had already amassed that means two thousand a year and the girl herself is so pretty that upon my honour i dont know which is the prettiershe or clary but fancy old neefit for ones fatherinlaw everybody is doing it now but i dont think id do it for ten times the money the fact is one has got to get used to these things and i am not used to it yet i soon shall beor to something worse such was the nature of ralphs thoughts as he walked away from mr neefits house to his club  mr neefit as he went home had his speculations also in making breeches he was perfect and in putting together money he had proved himself to be an adept but as to the use of his money he was quite as much at a loss as he would have been had he tried to wear the garments for which he measured his customers so successfully he had almost realised the truth that from that money he himself could extract for himself but little delight beyond that which arose simply from the possession holidays destroyed him even a day at home at hendon other than sunday was almost more than he could endure the fruition of life to him was in the completing of breeches and its charm in a muttonchop and a pipe of tobacco he had tried idleness and was wise enough to know almost at the first trial that idleness would not suit him he had made one mistake in life which was irreparable he had migrated from conduit street to a cold comfortless box of a house at a place in which in order that his respectability might be maintained he was not allowed to show his face in a publichouse this was very bad but he would not make bad worse by giving up so much of conduit street as was still left to him he would stick to the shop but what would he do with his money he had but one daughter thinking of this day after day month after month year after year he came slowly to the conclusion that it was his duty to make his daughter a lady he must find some gentleman who would marry her and then would give that gentleman all his moneyknowing as he did so that the gentleman would probably never speak to him again and to this conclusion he came with no bitterness of feeling with no sense of disappointment that to such an end must come the exertions of his laborious and successful life there was nothing else for him to do he could not be a gentleman himself it seemed to be no more within his reach than it is for the gentleman to be an angel he did not desire it he would not have enjoyed it he had that sort of sense which makes a man know so thoroughly his own limits that he has no regret at not passing them but yet in his eyes a gentleman was so grand a thinga being so infinitely superior to himselfthat loving his daughter above anything else he did think that he could die happy if he could see her married into a station so exalted there was a humility in this as regarded himself and an affection for his child which were admirable  the reader will think that he might at any rate have done better than to pitch upon such a one as ralph newton but then the reader hardly knows ralph newton as yet and cannot at all realise the difficulty which poor mr neefit experienced in coming across any gentleman in such a fashion as to be able to commence his operations it is hardly open to a tradesman to ask a young man home to his house when measuring him from the hip to the knee neefit had heard of many cases in which gentlemen of money had married the daughters of commercial men and he knew that the thing was to be done money which spent in other directions seemed to be nearly useless to him might be used beneficially in this way but how was he to set about it polly neefit was as pretty a girl as you shall wish to see and he knew that she was pretty but if he didnt take care the goodlooking young gasfitter next door to him down at hendon would have his polly before he knew where he was or worse still as he thought there was that mad son of his old friend moggs the bootmaker ontario moggs as he had been christened by a canadian godfather with whom polly had condescended already to hold something of a flirtation he could not advertise for a genteel lover what could he do  then ralph newton made his way down to the hendon villaasking for money what should have induced mr newton to come to him for money he could not guessbut he did know that of all the young men who came into his back shop to be measured there was no one whose looks and manners and cheery voice had created so strong a feeling of pleasantness as had those of mr ralph newton mr neefit could not analyse it but there was a kind of sunshine about the young man which would have made him very unwilling to press hard for payment or to stop the supply of breeches he had taken a liking to ralph and found himself thinking about the young man in his journeys between hendon and conduit street was not this the sort of gentleman that would suit his daughter neefit wanted no one to tell him that ralph newton was a gentlemanwhat he meant by a gentlemanand that wallop the stockbroker was not wallop the stockbroker spoke of himself as though he was a very fine fellow indeed but to the thinking of mr neefit ontario moggs was more like a gentleman than mr wallop he had feared much as to his daughter both in reference to the handsome gasfitter and to ontario moggs but since that second teadrinking he had hoped that his daughters eyes were opened  he had made inquiry about ralph newton and had found that the young man was undoubtedly heir to a handsome estate in hampshirea place called newton priory with a parish of newton peele and lodges and a gamekeeper and a park he knew from of old that ralphs uncle would have nothing to do with his nephews debts but he learned now as a certainty that the uncle could not disinherit his nephew and the debts did not seem to be very highand ralph had come into some property from his father upon the whole though of course there must be a sacrifice of money at first neefit thought that he saw his way mr newton too had been very civil to his girlnot simply making to her foolish flattering little speeches but treating herso thought neefitexactly as a highbred gentleman would treat the lady of his thoughts it was a high ambition but neefit thought that there might possibly be a way to success  mrs neefit had been a good helpmate to her husbandhaving worked hard for him when hard work on her part was neededbut was not altogether so happy in her disposition as her lord he desired to shine only in his daughterand as a tradesman she was troubled by the more difficult ambition of desiring to shine in her own person it was she who had insisted on migrating to hendon and who had demanded also the establishment of a onehorse carriage the onehorse carriage was no delight to neefit and hardly gave satisfaction to his wife after the first three months to be driven along the same roads day after day at the rate of six miles an hour though it may afford fresh air is not an exciting amusement mrs neefit was not given to reading and was debarred by a sense of propriety from making those beefsteak puddings for which within her own small household she had once been so famous hendon she found dull and though hendon had been her own choice she could not keep herself from complaining of its dulness to her husband but she always told him that the fault lay with him he ought to content himself with going to town four times a week and take a six weeks holiday in the autumn that was the recognised mode of life with gentlemen who had made their fortunes in trade then she tried to make him believe that constant seclusion in conduit street was bad for his liver but above all things he ought to give up measuring his own customers with his own hands none of their genteel neighbours would call upon his wife and daughter as long as he did that but mr neefit was a man within whose bosom gallantry had its limits he had given his wife a house at hendon and was contented to take that odious journey backwards and forwards six days a week to oblige her but when she told him not to measure his own customers he cut up rough as polly called it you be blowed he said to the wife of his bosom he had said it before and she bore it with majestic equanimity  polly neefit was as we have said as pretty a girl as you shall wish to see in spite of a nose that was almost a pug nose and a mouth that was a little large i think however that she was perhaps prettier at seventeen when she would run up and down conduit street on messages for her fatherwho was not as yet aware that she had ceased to be a childthan she became afterwards at hendon when she was twenty in those early days her glossy black hair hung down her face in curls now she had a thing on the back of her head and her hair was manoeuvred after the usual fashion but her laughing dark eyes were full of goodhumour and looked as though they could be filled also with feeling her complexion was perfectperfect at twenty though from its nature it would be apt to be fixed and perhaps rough and coarse at thirty but at twenty it was perfect it was as is the colour of a halfblown rose in which the variations from white to pink and almost to red are so gradual and soft as to have no limits and then with her there was a charm beyond that of the rose for the hues would ever be changing as she spoke or laughed or became serious or sat thoughtless or pored over her novel the tint of her cheek and neck would change as this or that emotion be it ever so slight played upon the current of her blood she was tall and well madeperhaps almost robust she was goodhumoured somewhat given to frank coquetry and certainly fond of young men she had sense enough not to despise her father and was good enough to endeavour to make life bearable to her mother she was clever too in her way and could say sprightly things she read novels and loved a love story she meant herself to have a grand passion some day but did not quite sympathise with her fathers views about gentlemen not that these views were discussed between them but each was gradually learning the mind of the other it was very pleasant to polly neefit to waltz with the goodlooking gasfitterand indeed to waltz with any man was a pleasure to polly for dancing was her paradise upon earth and she liked talking to ontario moggs who was a clever man and had a great deal to say about many things she believed that ontario moggs was dying for her love but she had by no means made up her mind that ontario was to be the hero of the great passion the great passion was quite a necessity for her she must have her romance but polly was aware that a great passion ought to be made to lead to a snug house half a dozen children and a proper churchgoing roastmutton dutydoing manner of life now ontario moggs had very wild ideas as for the gasfitter he danced well and was goodlooking but he had very little to say for himself when polly saw ralph newtonespecially when he sat out on the lawn with them and smoked cigars on his second comingshe thought him very nice she had no idea of being patronised by any one and she was afraid of persons whom she called stuckup ladies and gentlemen but mr newton had not patronised her and she had acknowledged that he wasvery nice such as she was she was the idol of her fathers heart and the apple of his eye if she had asked him to give up measuring he might have yielded but then his polly was too wise for that  we must say a word more of mrs neefit and then we shall hope that our readers will know the family she had been the daughter of a breechesmaker to whom neefit had originally been apprenticedand therefore regarded herself as the maker of the family but in truth the business such as it was now in its glory had been constructed by her husband and her own fortune had been very small she was a stout roundfaced healthy meaningless woman in whom illhumour would not have developed itself unless idlenessthat root of all evilhad fallen in her way as it was in the present condition of their lives she did inflict much discomfort on poor mr neefit had he been ill she would have nursed him with all her care had he died she would have mourned for him as the best of husbands had he been three parts ruined in trade she would have gone back to conduit street and made beefsteak puddings almost without a murmur she was very anxious for his sunday dinnerand would have considered it to be a sin to be without a bit of something nice for his supper she took care that he always wore flannel and would never let him stay away from churchlest worse should befall him but she couldnt let him be quiet what else was there left for her to do but to nag him polly who was with her during the long hours of the day would not be nagged now mamma shed say with a tone of authority that almost overcame mamma and if mamma was very cross polly would escape but during the long hours of the night the breechesmaker could not escapeand in minor matters the authority lay with her it was only when great matters were touched that mr neefit would rise in his wrath and desire his wife to be blowed  no doubt mrs neefit was an unhappy womanmore unfortunate as a woman than was her husband as a man the villa at hendon had been heavy upon him but it had been doubly heavy upon her he could employ himself the legs of his customers to him were a blessed resource but she had no resource the indefinite idea which she had formed of what life would be in a pretty villa residence had been proved to be utterly fallaciousthough she had never acknowledged the fallacy either to husband or daughter that onehorse carriage in which she was dragged about was almost as odious to her as her own drawingroom that had become so horrible that it was rarely usedbut even the diningroom was very bad what would she do there poor woman what was there left for her to do at all in this worldexcept to nag at her husband  nevertheless all who knew anything about the neefits said that they were very respectable people and had done very well in the world     chapter vi  mrs neefits little dinner   on the sunday morning following that remarkable saturday on which miss bonner had been taken to her new home and ralph newton had ordered three pair of breeches mr neefit made a very ambitious proposition my dear i think ill ask that young man to come and have a bit of dinner here next sunday this was said after breakfast as mr neefit was being made smart in his churchgoing coat and his sunday hat which were kept together in mrs neefits big press  which young man now mrs neefit when she asked the question knew very well that mr newton was the young man to whom hospitality was to be offered ontario moggs was her favourite but mr neefit would not have dreamed of asking ontario moggs to dinner  mr newton my dear said mr neefit with his head stuck sharply up while his wife tied a bow in his sunday neckhandkerchief  why should us ask him he wont think nothing of his vittels when he gets em hed only turn up his nose and as for polly whats the use of making her more saucy than she is i dont want such as him here neefitthat i dont stuckup young men like him had better stay away from alexandrina cottagethat was the name of the happy home at hendon im sure our polly wont be the better for having the likes of him here  nothing more was said on the subject till after the return of the family from church but during the sermon mr neefit had had an opportunity of thinking the subject over and had resolved that this was a matter in which it behoved him to be master how was this marriage to be brought about if the young people were not allowed to see each other of course he might fail he knew that very probably mr newton might not accept the invitationmight never show himself again at alexandrina cottage but unless an effort was made there could not be success i dont see why he shouldnt eat a bit of dinner here said mr neefit as soon as his pipe was lighted after their early dinner it aint anything out of the way as i know of  youre thinking of polly neefit  why shouldnt i be thinking of her there aint no more of em whats the use of working for her if one dont think of her  it wont do no good neefit if we had things here as we might have em indeed  whats amiss  with nothing to drink out of only common wineglasses and its my belief jemima d never cook a dinner as hed look at i know what they arethem sort of young men theyre worse than a dozen ladies when you come to vittels  nevertheless mr neefit resolved upon having his own way and it was settled that ralph newton should be asked to come and eat a bit of dinner on next sunday then there arose a difficulty as to the mode of asking him neefit himself felt that it would be altogether out of his line to indite an invitation in days gone by before he kept a clerk for the purpose he had written very many letters to gentlemen using various strains of pressure as he called their attention to the little outstanding accounts which stood on his books and were thorns in his flesh but of the writing of such letters as this now intended to be written he had no experience as for mrs neefit her skill in this respect was less even than that of her husband she could write no doubt on very rare occasions she would make some expression of her thoughts with pen and ink to polly when she and polly were apart but no one else ever saw how slight was her proficiency in this direction but polly was always writing pollys pothooks as her father called them were pictures in her fathers eyes she could dash off straight lines of writingline after linewith sharppointed angles and longtailed letters in a manner which made her father proud of the money which he had spent on her education so polly was told to write the letter and after many expressions of surprise polly wrote the letter that evening mr and mrs neefits compliments to mr newton and hope he will do them the honour to dine with them on sunday next at five oclock alexandrina cottage sunday  say five sharp said the breechesmaker  no father i wontsay anything about sharp  why not polly  it wouldnt look pretty i dont suppose hell come and im sure i dont know why you should ask him dear me im certain hell know that i wrote it what will he think  hell think it comes from as pretty a young woman as he ever clapped his eyes on said mr neefit who was not at all reticent in the matter of compliments to his daughter  laws neefit how you do spoil the girl said his wife  he has about finished spoiling me now mamma so it dont much signify you always did spoil medidnt you father then polly kissed mr neefits bald head and mr neefit as he sat in the centre of his lawn with his girdle loose around him a glass of gin and water by his side and a pipe in his mouth felt that in truth there was something left in the world worth living for but a thought came across his mindif that chap comes i shant be as comfortable next sunday and then there was another thoughtif he takes my polly away from me i dont know as i shall ever be comfortable again but still he did not hesitate or repent of course his polly must have a husband  then a dreadful proposition was made by mrs neefit why not have moggs too  oh mamma  are you going to turn your nose up at ontario moggs miss pride  i dont turn my nose up at him im very fond of mr moggs i think hes the best fun going but i am sure that if mr newton does come hed rather not have mr moggs here too  it wouldnt do at all said mr neefit ontario is all very well but mr newton and he wouldnt suit  mrs neefit was snubbed and went to sleep on the sofa for the rest of the afternoonintending no doubt to let mr neefit have the benefit of her feelings as soon as they two should be alone together  our friend ralph received the note and accepted the invitation he told himself that it was a lark as the reader knows he had already decided that he would not sell himself even to so pretty a girl as polly neefit for any amount of money but not the less might it be agreeable to him to pass a sunday afternoon in her company  ralph newton at this time occupied very comfortable bachelors rooms in a small street close to st jamess palace he had now held these for the last two years and had contrived to make his friends about town know that here was his home he had declined to go into the army himself when he was quite youngor rather had agreed not to go into the army on condition that he should not be pressed as to any other profession he lived however very much with military friends many of whom found it convenient occasionally to breakfast with him or to smoke a pipe in his chambers he never did any work and lived a useless butterfly lifeonly with this difference from other butterflies that he was expected to pay for his wings  in that matter of payment was the great difficulty of ralph newtons life he had been started at nineteen with an allowance of £250 per annum when he was twentyone he inherited a fortune from his father of more than double that amount and as he was the undoubted heir to a property of £7000 a year it may be said of him that he was born with a golden spoon but he had got into debt before he was twenty and had never got out of it the quarrel with his uncle was an old affair arranged for him by his father before he knew how to quarrel on his own score and therefore we need say no more about that at present but his uncle would not pay a shilling for him and would have quarrelled also with his other nephew the clergyman had he known that the younger brother assisted the elder but up to the moment of which we are writing the iron of debt had not as yet absolutely entered into the soul of this young man he had in his need just borrowed £100 from his breechesmaker and this perhaps was not the first time that he had gone to a tradesman for assistance but hitherto money had been forthcoming creditors had been indulgent and at this moment he possessed four horses which were eating their heads off at the moonbeam at barnfield  at five oclock with sufficient sharpness ralph newton got out of a hansom cab at the door of alexandrina cottage hes cum in a ansom said mrs neefit looking over the blind of the drawingroom window thats threeandsix said neefit with a sigh you didnt think he was going to walk father said polly theres the underground within two miles if the midland didnt suit said mr neefit nonsense father of course hed come in a cab said polly mrs neefit was not able to add the stinging remark with which her tongue was laden as ralph newton was already in the house she smoothed her apron crossed her hands and uttered a deep sigh there could be no more going down into the kitchen now to see whether the salmon was boiled or to provide for the proper dishing of the lamb this is quite condescending of you mr newton said the breechesmaker hardly daring to shake hands with his guestthough in his shop he was always free enough with his customers in this matter polly looked as though she thought there was no condescension whatever held up her head and laughed and joked and asked some questions about the german at the shop whom she declared she was never allowed to see now and whose voice she swore she had never heard is he dumb mr newton father never will tell me anything about him you must know  laws polly what does it matter said mrs neefit and they were the only words she had spoken polly from the first had resolved that she would own to the shop if mr newton came to see her he should come to see a girl who was not ashamed to speak of herself as the daughter of a breechesmaker  he dont talk much does he mr newton said mr neefit laughing merrily  do tell me one thing said ralph i know its a secret but ill promise not to tell it what is his real name  this isnt fair said mr neefit greatly delighted all trades have their secrets come come mr newton  i know his name said polly  do tell me said ralph coming close to her as though he might hear it in a whisper  mr neefit i wish you wouldnt talk about such things here said the offended matron but now heres dinner she was going to take her guests arm but mr neefit arranged it otherwise  the old uns and the young unsthats the way to pair them said mr neefitunderstanding nature better than he did precedence and so they walked into the next room mrs neefit was not quite sure whether her husband had or had not done something improper she had her doubts and they made her uncomfortable  the dinner went off very well neefit told how he had gone himself to the fishmongers for that bit of salmon how troubled his wife had been in mind about the lamb and how polly had made the salad and ill tell you what i did mr newton i brought down that bottle of champagne in my pocket myselfgave six bob for it at palmers in bond street my wife says we aint got glasses fit to drink it out of  you neednt tell mr newton all that  mr newton what i am i aint ashamed on nor yet what i does let me have the honour of drinking a glass of wine with you mr newton you see us just as we are i wish it was better but it couldnt be welcomer your health mr newton  there are many menand men too not of a bad sortwho in such circumstances cannot make themselves pleasant grant the circumstances with all the desire to make the best of themand these men cannot be otherwise than stiff disagreeable and uneasy but then again there are men who in almost any position can carry themselves as though they were to the manner born ralph newton was one of the latter he was not accustomed to dine with the tradesmen who supplied him with goods and had probably never before encountered such a host as mr neefitbut he went through the dinner with perfect ease and satisfaction and before the pies and jellies had been consumed had won the heart of even mrs neefit laws mr newton she said what can you know about custards then ralph newton offered to come and make custards against her in her own kitchenproviding he might have polly to help him but youd want the back kitchen to yourselves im thinking said mr neefit in high goodhumour  mr neefit certainly was not a delicate man as soon as dinner was over and the two ladies had eaten their strawberries and cream he suggested that the port wine should be taken out into the garden in the farther corner of mr neefits grounds at a distance of about twenty yards from the house was a little recess called the arbour admonitory of earwigs and without much pretension to comfort it might hold three persons but on this occasion mr neefit was minded that two only should enjoy the retreat polly carried out the decanter and glasses but did not presume to stay there for a moment she followed her mother into the gorgeous drawingroom where mrs neefit at once went to sleep while her daughter consoled herself with a novel mr neefit as we have said was not a delicate man that girl ll have twenty thousand pound down on the nail the day she marries the man as i approves of fill your glass mr newton she willand theres no mistake about it therell be more money too when im deadand the old woman  it might be owned that such a speech from the father of a marriageable daughter to a young man who had hardly as yet shown himself to be enamoured was not delicate but it may be a question whether it was not sensible he had made up his mind and therefore went at once at his object and unless he did the business in this way what chance was there that it would be done at all mr newton could not come down to alexandrina cottage every other day or meet the girl elsewhere as he might do young ladies of fashion and moreover the father knew well enough that were his girl once to tell him that she had set her heart upon the gasfitter or upon ontario moggs he would not have the power to contradict her he desired that she should become a gentlemans wife and thinking that this was the readiest way to accomplish his wish he saw no reason why he should not follow it when he had spoken he chucked off his glass of wine and looked into his young friends face for an answer  hell be a lucky fellow that gets her said ralph beginning unconsciously to feel that it might perhaps have been as well for him had he remained in his lodgings on this sunday  he will be a lucky fellow mr newton shes as good as gold and a well bred un too though i say it as shouldnt theres not a dirty drop in her and shes that clever she can do amost anything as for her looks ill say nothing about them youve got eyes in your head there aint no mistake there mr newton no paint no madame rachel no made beautiful for ever its human nature what you see there mr newton  im quite sure of that  and she has the heart of an angel by this time mr neefit was alternately wiping the tears from his eyes and taking half glasses of port wine i know all about you mr newton you are a gentlemanthats what you are  i hope so  and if you dont get the wrong side of the post youll come out right at last youll have a nice property some of these days but youre just a little short of cash at present  thats about true mr neefit  i want nobody to tell mei know continued neefit now if you make up to her there she iswith twenty thousand pounds down you are a gentleman and i want that girl to be a lady you can make her a lady you cant make her no better than she is the best man in england cant do that but you can make her a lady i dont know what shell say mind but you can ask herif you please i like you and you can ask herif you please what answer shell make thats her look out but you can ask herif you please perhaps im a little too forrard but i call that honest i dont know what you call it but this i do knowthere aint so sweet a girl as that within twenty miles round london then mr neefit in his energy dashed his hand down among the glasses on the little rustic table in the arbour  the reader may imagine that ralph newton was hardly ready with his answer there are men no doubt who in such an emergency would have been able to damn the breechesmakers impudence and to have walked at once out of the house but our young friend felt no inclination to punish his host in such fashion as this he simply remarked that he would think of it the matter being too grave for immediate decision and that he would join the ladies  do mr newton said mr neefit go and join polly youll find shes all i tell you ill sit here and have a pipe  ralph did join the ladies and finding mrs neefit asleep he induced polly to take a walk with him amidst the lanes of hendon when he left alexandrina cottage in the evening mr neefit whispered a word into his ear at the gate you know my mind strike while the irons hot there she isjust what you see her     chapter vii  you are one of us now   the first week after mary bonners arrival at popham villa went by without much to make it remarkable except the strangeness arising from the coming of a stranger sir thomas did stay at home on that sunday but when the time came for going to morning church shuffled out of that disagreeable duty in a manner that was satisfactory neither to himself nor his daughters oh papa i thought you would have gone with us said patience at the last moment  i think not today my dear he said with that sort of smile which betokens inward uneasiness patience reproached him with a look and then the three girls went off together even patience herself had offered to excuse mary on the score of fatigue seasickness and the like but mary altogether declined to be excused she was neither fatigued she said nor sick and of course she would go to church sir thomas stayed at home and thought about himself how could he go to church when he knew that he could neither listen to the sermon nor join in the prayers i suppose people do he said to himself but i cant id go to church all day long if i found that it would serve me  he went up to london on the monday and returned to the villa to dinner he did the same on the tuesday on the wednesday he remained in london on the thursday he came home but dined in town after that he found himself to be on sufficiently familiar terms with his niece to fall back into his old habits of life  patience was very slow in speaking to their cousin of her fathers peculiarities but clarissa soon told the tale youll get to know papa soon she said  he has been so kind to me  he is very good but you must know dear that we are the most deserted and disconsolate ladies that ever lived out of a poem papa has been home now four days together but that is for your beaux yeux we are here for weeks together without seeing himvery often for more than a week  where does he go  he has a place in londonsuch a place you shall go and see it some day though he wont thank us a bit for taking you there he has the queerest old man to wait upon him and he never sees anybody from day to day  but what does he do  he is writing a book that is the great secret he never speaks about it and does not like to be asked questions but the truth is he is the most solitudeloving person in the world he does find its charms though alexander selkirk never could  and does nobody come here to you  in the way of taking care of us nobody we have to take care of ourselves of course it is dull people do come and see us sometimes miss spooner for instance  why should you laugh at poor miss spooner asked patience  i dont laugh at her we have other friends you know but not enough to make the house pleasant to you after that when patience was not with them she told something of ralph newton and his visits though she said nothing to her cousin of her own cherished hopes i wonder what youll think of ralph newton she said ralph newtons name had been mentioned before in marys hearing more than once  why should i think anything particular of ralph newton  youll have to think something particular about him as he is a sort of child of the house papa was his guardian and he comes here just when he pleases  who is he and what is he and where is he and why is he  hes a gentleman at large who does nothing thats who he is  he thinks ever so much of himself then  nohe doesnt and he is nephew to an old squire down in hampshire who wont give him a penny he oughtnt to want it however because when he came of age he had ever so much money of his own but he does want itsometimes he must have the property when his uncle dies  dear mehow interesting  as for the where he is and why he ishe comes here just when it suits him and because we were almost brought up together he doesnt dine here and all that kind of thing because papa is never at home nobody ever does dine here  then there was a short pause this mr newton isnt a lover then asked miss bonner  there was another pause before clarissa could answer the question no she said no he isnt a lover we dont have any lovers at popham villa only thats not quite true she said after a pause and as you are to live with us just like a sister ill tell you about gregory newton ralphs brother then she did tell the story of the clergymans love and the clergymans discomfiture but she said not a word of ralphs declaration and ralphs great sin on that fatal evening and the way in which she told her story about the one brother altogether disarmed mary bonners suspicion as to the other  in truth clarissa did not know whether it was or was not her privilege to regard ralph newton as her lover he had not been to the cottage since that evening and though the words he had spoken were still sweet in her earsso sweet that she could not endure the thought of abandoning their sweetnessstill she had a misgiving that they were in some sort rendered nugatory by his great fault she had forgiven the faultlooking back at it now over the distance of eight or ten days had forgiven it with all her heart but still there remained with her an undefined and unpleasant feeling that the spoken words accompanied by a deed so wicked were absorbed and as it were drowned in the wickedness of the deed what if the words as first spoken were only a prelude to the deedfor as she well remembered they had been spoken twiceand if the subsequent words were only an excuse for it there was a painful idea in her mind that such might possibly be the case and that if so the man could never be forgiven or at least ought never to be spoken to again acting on this suggestion from within she absolutely refused to tell her father what had happened when patience urged her to do so hell come and see papa himselfif he means anything said clary patience only shook her head she thought that sir thomas should be told at once but she could not take upon herself to divulge her sisters secret which had been imparted to her in trust  clarissa was obstinate she would not tell her father nor would she say what would be her own answer if her father were to give his permission for the match as to this patience had not much doubt she saw that her sisters heart was set upon this lover she had feared it before this late occurrence and now she could hardly have a doubt but if ralph really meant it he would hardly have told her that he loved her and then not waited for an answernot have come back for an answernot have gone to their father for an answer and then patience thought sir thomas would never consent to this marriage ralph was in debt and a scapegrace and quite unfit to undertake the management of a wife such was the elder sisters belief as to her fathers mind but she could not force upon clary the necessity of taking any action in the matter she was not strong enough in her position as elder to demand obedience clarissas communication had been made in confidence and patience though she was unhappy would not break the trust  at last this young lothario appeared among them again but as it happened he came in company with sir thomas such a thing had not happened before since the day on which sir thomas had given up all charge of his wards property but it did so happen now the two men had met in london and sir thomas had suggested that ralph should come and be introduced to the new cousin  what are you doing now sir thomas had asked  nothing particular just at present  you can get away this evening  yesi think i can get away it had been his intention to dine at his club with captain cox but as he had dined at the club with captain cox on the previous day the engagement was not felt to be altogether binding i can get away for dinner that is but ive got to go out in the evening its a bore but i promised to be at lady mcmarshals tonight but if i show there at twelve it will do thus it happened that sir thomas and ralph newton went down to popham villa in a cab together  it was clear both to patience and clarissa that he was much struck with the new cousin but then it was quite out of the question that any man should not be struck with her her beauty was of that kindlike the beauty of a picturewhich must strike even if it fails to charm and mary had a way of exciting attention with strangers even by her silence it was hardly intentional and there certainly was no coquetry in it but it was the case that she carried herself after a fashion which made it impossible for any stranger to regard her place in the room as being merely a chair with a young lady in it she would speak hardly a word but her very lack of speech was eloquent at the present time she was of course in deep mourning and the contrast between the brilliance of her complexion and the dark dress which covered her throatbetween the black scarf and the profusion of bright hair which fell upon it was so remarkable as of itself to excite attention clarissa watching everything though with feminine instinct seeming to watch nothing could see that he was amazed but then she had known that he would be amazed and of what matter would be his amazement if he were true if indeed he were not truethen thenthen nothing mattered such was the light in which clary viewed the circumstances around her at the present moment  the evening did not pass very pleasantly ralph was introduced to the cousin and asked some questions about the west indies then there was tea ralph was dressed with a black coat and white cravat and clary could not keep herself from thinking how very much nicer he was with a pipe in his mouth and his neck bare drinking sodawater and sherry out on the lawn ahin spite of all that had then happened that was the sweetest moment in her existence when he jumped up from the ground and told her that he might do a great deal better than marry the west indian cousin she thought now of his very words and suggested to herself that perhaps he would never say them again naymight it not be possible that he would say the very reverse that he would declare his wish to marry the west indian cousin clary could not conceive but that he might have her should he so wish young ladies when they are in love are prone to regard their lovers as being prizes so valuable as to be coveted by all female comers  before ralph had taken his leave sir thomas took mary apart to make some communication to her as to her own affairs everything was now settled and sir thomas had purchased stock for her with her little fortune you have £20 2s 4d a year quite your own he said laughingas he might have done to one of his own girls had an unexpected legacy been left to her  that means that i must be altogether dependent on your charity she said looking into his face through her tears  it means nothing of the kind he said with almost the impetuosity of anger there shall be no such cold word as charity between you and me you are one of us now and of my cup and of my loaf it is your right to partake as it is the right of those girls there i shall never think of it or speak of it again  but i must think of it uncle  the less the betterbut never use that odious word again between you and me it is a word for strangers what is given as i give to you should be taken without even an acknowledgment my payment is to be your love  you shall be paid in full she said as she kissed him this was all very well but still on his part there was some misgivingsome misgiving though no doubt if he were to die what would become of her he must make a new willwhich in itself was to him a terrible trouble and he must take something from his own girls in order that he might provide for this new daughter that question of adopting is very difficult if a man have no children of his ownnone others that are dependent on himhe can give all and there is an end of his trouble but a man feels that he owes his property to his children and so feeling may he take it from them and give it to others had she been in truth his daughter he would have felt that there was enough for three but she was not his daughter and yet he was telling her that she should be to him the same as a child of his house  in the meantime ralph was out on the lawn with the two sisters and was as awkward as men always are in such circumstances when he spoke those words to clarissa he had in truth no settled purpose in his mind he had always liked herloved her after a fashionfelt for her an affection different to that which he entertained for her sister nevertheless most assuredly he had not come down to fulham on that evening prepared to make her an offer he had been there by chance and it had been quite by chance that he found clarissa alone he knew that the words had been spoken and he knew also that he had drawn down her wrath upon his head by his caress he was man enough also to feel that he had no right to believe himself to have been forgiven because now in the presence of others she did not receive him with a special coldness which would have demanded special explanation as it was the three were all cold patience half felt inclined to go and leave them together she would have given a finger off her hand to make clary happybut would it be right to make clary happy in such fashion as this she had thought at first when she saw her father and ralph together that ralph had spoken of his love to sir thomas and that sir thomas had allowed him to come but she soon perceived that this was not the case and so they walked about together each knowing that their intercourse was not as it always had been and each feeling powerless to resume an appearance of composure  i have got to go and be at lady mcmarshals he said after having suffered in this way for a quarter of an hour if i did not show myself there her ladyship would think that i had given over all ideas of propriety and that i was a lost sheep past redemption  dont let us keep you if you ought to go said clary with dismal propriety  i think ill be off goodbye patience the new cousin is radiant in beauty no one can doubt that but i dont know whether she is exactly the sort of girl i admire most bythebye what do you mean to do with her  do with her said patience she will live here of course  just settle down as one of the family then no doubt i shall see her again goodnight patience goodbye clary ill just step in and make my adieux to sir thomas and the beauty this he didbut as he went he pressed clarys hand in a manner that she could but understand she did not return the pressure but she did not resent it  clarissa said patience when they were together that night dear clarissa  clary knew that when she was called clarissa by her sister something special was meant what is it she asked what are you going to say now  you know that i am thinking only of your happiness my darling he doesnt mean it  how do you know what right have you to say so why am i to be thought such a fool as not to know what i ought to do  nobody thinks that you are a fool clary i know how clever you areand how good but i cannot bear that you should be unhappy if he had meant it he would have spoken to papa if you will only tell me that you are not thinking of him that he is not making you unhappy i will not say a word further  i am thinking of him and he is making me unhappy said clarissa bursting into tears but i dont know why you should say that he is a liar and dishonest and everything that is bad  i have neither said that nor thought it clary  that is what you mean he did say that he loved me  and youyou did not answer him  noi said nothing i cant explain it and i dont want to explain it i did not say a word to him you came and then he went away if i am to be unhappy i cant help it he did say that he loved me and i do love him  will you tell papa  noi will not it would be out of the question he would go to ralph and there would be a row and i would not have it for worlds then she tried to smile other girls are unhappy and i dont see why im to be better off than the rest i know i am a fool youll never be unhappy because you are not a fool but patience i have told you everything and if you are not true to me i will never forgive you patience promised that she would be true and then they embraced and were friends     chapter viii  ralph newtons troubles   july had come the second week in july and ralph newton had not as yet given any reply to that very definite proposition which had been made to him after the little dinner by mr neefit now the proposition was one which certainly required an answerand all the effect which it had hitherto had upon our friend was to induce him not to include conduit street in any of his daily walks it has already been said that before the offer was made to him when he believed that pollys fortune would be more than mr neefit had been able to promise he had determined that nothing should induce him to marry the daughter of a breechesmaker and therefore the answer might have been easy nevertheless he made no answer but kept out of conduit street and allowed the three pair of breeches to be sent home to him without trying them on this was very wrong for mr neefit though perhaps indelicate had at least been generous and trustingand a definite answer should have been given before the middle of july  troubles were coming thick upon ralph newton he had borrowed a hundred pounds from mr neefit but this he had done under pressure of a letter from his brother the parson he owed the parsonwe will not say how much he would get fifty pounds or a hundred from the parson every now and again giving an assurance that it should be repaid in a month or six weeks sometimes the promise would be keptand sometimes not the parson as a bachelor was undoubtedly a rich man he had a living of £400 a year and some fortune of his own but he had tastes of his own and was repairing the church at peele newton his parish in hampshire it would therefore sometimes happen that he was driven to ask his brother for money the hundred pounds which had been borrowed from mr neefit had been sent down to peele newton with a mere deduction of £25 for current expenses twentyfive pounds do not go far in current expenses in london with a man who is given to be expensive and ralph newton was again in want of funds  and there were other troubles all coming from want of money mr horsball of the moonbeam who was generally known in the sporting world as a man who never did ask for his money had remarked that as mr newtons bill was now above a thousand he should like a little cash mr newtons bill at two months for £500 would be quite satisfactory would mr newton accept the enclosed document mr newton did accept the document but he didnt like it how was he to pay £500 in the beginning of september unless indeed he got it from mr neefit he might raise money no doubt on his own interest in the newton priory estate but that estate would never be his were he to die before his uncle and he knew that assistance from the jews on such security would ruin him altogether of his own property there was still a remnant left he owned houses in london from which he still got some income but they were mortgaged and the titledeeds not in his possession and his own attorney made difficulties about obtaining for him a further advance  he was sitting one bright july morning in his own room in st jamess street over a very late breakfast with his two friends captain fooks and lieutenant cox when a little annoyance of a similar kind fell upon hima worse annoyance indeed than that which had come from mr horsball for mr horsball had not been spiteful enough to call upon him there came a knock at his door and young mr moggs was ushered into the room now mr moggs was the son of booby and moggs the wellknown bootmakers of old bond street and the boots they had made for ralph newton had been infinite in number as they had also no doubt been excellent in make and leather but booby and moggs had of late wanted money had written many letters and for four months had not seen the face of their customer when a gentleman is driven by his indebtedness to go to another tradesman it is so to say all up with him in the way of credit there is nothing the tradesman dislikes so much as this as he fears that the rival is going to get the ready money after he has given the credit and yet what is a gentleman to do when his demand for further goods at the old shop is met by a request for a little ready money we know what ralph newton did at the establishment in conduit street but then mr neefit was a very peculiar man  cox had just lighted his cigar and fooks was filling his pipe when ontario moggs entered the room this rival in the regards of polly neefit was not at that time personally known to ralph newton but the name as mentioned by his servant was painfully familiar to him oh mr moggsahits your father i suppose that i know sit down mr moggswill you have a cup of teaor perhaps a glass of brandy take a cigar mr moggs but moggs declined all refreshment for the body he was a tall thin young man with long straggling hair a fierce eye very thick lips and a flat nosea nose which seemed to be all nostriland then below his mouth was a tuft of beard which he called an imperial it was the glory of ontario moggs to be a politicianit was his ambition to be a poetit was his nature to be a loverit was his disgrace to be a bootmaker dependent on a stern father and aware that it behoved him to earn his bread he could not but obey but he groaned under this servitude to trade and was only happy when speaking at his debating club held at the cheshire cheese or when basking in the beauty of polly neefit he was great upon strikesin reference to which perilous subject he was altogether at variance with his father who worshipped capital and hated unions ontario held horrible ideas about cooperative associations the rights of labour and the welfare of the masses thrice he had quarrelled with his fatherbut the old man loved his son and though he was stern strove to bring the young man into the ways of moneymaking how was he to think of marrying polly neefitas to the expediency of which arrangement mr moggs senior quite agreed with mr moggs juniorunless he would show himself to be a man of business did he think that old neefit would give his money to be wasted upon strikes ontario who was as honest a fool as ever lived told his father that he didnt care a straw for neefits money then moggs the father had made a plunge against the counter with his sharppointed shoemakers knife which he always held in his hand that had almost been fatal to himself for the knife broke at the thrust and the fragment cut his wrist at this time there was no real booby and the firm was in truth moggs and moggs only the great question was whether it should become moggs and son but what tradesman would take a partner into his firm who began by declaring that strikes were the safeguards of trade and that hethe proposed partnerdid not personally care for money nevertheless old moggs persevered and ontario alive to the fact that it was his duty to be a bootmaker was now attempting to carry on his business in the manner laid down for him by his father  a worse duna dun with less power of dunningthan ontario moggs could not be conceived his only strength lay in his helplessness when he found that mr newton had two friends with him his lips were sealed to ask for money at all was very painful to him but to ask for it before three men was beyond his power ralph newton seeing something of this felt that generosity demanded of him that he should sacrifice himself im afraid youve come about your bill mr moggs he said ontario moggs who on the subject of trades unions at the cheshire cheese could pour forth a flood of eloquence that would hold the room in rapt admiration and then bring down a tumult of applause now stammered out a halfexpressed assent as mr newton was engaged perhaps he had better call again  wellthankee yes it would be as well but whats the total mr moggs ontario could not bring himself to mention the figures but handed a paper to our friend bless my soul thats very bad said our friend over two hundred pounds for boots how long can your father give me  hes a little pressed just at present whispered moggs  yesand he has my bill which he was forced to take up at christmas its quite true moggs said not a word though he had been especially commissioned to instruct the debtor that his father would be forced to apply through his solicitor unless he should receive at least half the amount due before the end of the next week tell your father that i will certainly call within the next three days and tell him what i can door at least what i cant do you are sure you wont take a cigar moggs was quite sure that he wouldnt take a cigar and retired thanking ralph as though some excellent arrangement had been made which would altogether prevent further difficulties  thats the softest chap i ever saw said lieutenant cox  i wish my fellows would treat me like that said captain fooks but i never knew a fellow have the luck that newton has i dont suppose i owe a tenth of what you do  thats your idea of luck said ralph  wellyes i owe next to nothing but ill be hanged if i can get anything done for me without being dunned up to my very eyes you know that chap of neefits im blessed if he didnt ask me whether i meant to settle last years bill before he should send me home a couple of cords i ordered now i dont owe neefit twenty pounds if all was told  what did you do asked lieutenant cox  i just walked out of the shop now i shall see whether theyre sent or not they tell me theres a fellow down at rugby makes just as well as neefit and never bothers you at all what do you owe neefit newton  untold sums  but how much really  dont you hear me say the sums are untold  oh dn it i dont understand that im never dark about anything of that kind ill go bail its more than five times what i do  very likely if you had given your orders generously as i have done you would have been treated nobly what good has a man in looking at twenty pounds on his books of course he must get in the small sums  i suppose theres something in that said the captain thoughtfully at this moment the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of another emissaryan emissary from that very establishment to which they were alluding it was ralph newtons orders that no one should ever be denied to him when he was really in his rooms he had fought the battle long enough to know that such denials create unnecessary animosity and then as he said they were simply the resources of a coward it was the duty of a brave man to meet his enemy face to face fortune could never give him the opportunity of doing that pleasantly in the field as might happen any day to his happy friends captain fooks and lieutenant cox but he was determined that he would accustom himself to stand fireand that therefore he would never run away from a dun now there slipped very slowly into the room that most mysterious person who was commonly called herr bawwahmuch to the astonishment of the three young gentlemen as the celebrated cutter of leather had never previously been seen by either of them elsewhere than standing silent at his board in neefits shop with his knife in his hands they looked at one another and the two military gentlemen thought that mr neefit was very much in earnest when he sent bawwah to look for his money mr neefit was very much in earnest but on this occasion his emissary had not come for money what herr bawwahis that you said ralph making the best he could of the name is there anything wrong at the shop the german looked slowly round the room and then handed to the owner of it a little note without a word  ralph read the noteto himself it was written on one of the shop bills and ran as followshave you thought of what i was saying if so i should be happy to see mr newton either in conduit street or at alexandrina cottage there was neither signature nor date ralph knew what he was called upon to do as well as though four pages of an elaborate epistle had been indited to him and he knew too that he was bound to give an answer he asked the herr to sit down and prepared to write an answer at once he offered the herr a glass of brandy which the herr swallowed at a gulp he handed the herr a cigar which the herr pocketedand in gratitude for the latter favour some inarticulate grunt of thanks was uttered ralph at once wrote his reply while the two friends smoked looked on and wondered dear mr neefiti will be with you at eleven tomorrow morning yours most truly ralph newton this he handed with another glass of brandy to the herr the herr swallowed the second glassas he would have done a third had it been offered to himand then took his departure  that was another duneh newton asked the lieutenant  what a conjuror you are said ralph  i never heard of his sending bawwah out before said the captain  he never does under two hundred and fifty pounds said ralph its a mark of the greatest respect if i wore nothing but brown cords like you i never should have seen the herr here  i never had a pair of brown cords in my life said the offended captain after this the conversation fell away and the two warriors went off to their military occupations at the horse guards where no doubt the commanderinchief was waiting for them with impatience  ralph newton had much to think of and much that required thinking of at once did he mean to make an offer to clary underwood did he mean to take polly neefit and her £20000 did he mean to marry at all did he mean to go to the dogs had he ever in his life seen anybody half so beautiful as mary bonner what was he to say to mr moggs how was he to manage about that £500 which horsball would demand of him in september in what terms could he speak to neefit of the money due both for breeches and the loan in the event of his declining polly and then generally how was he to carry on the war he was thoroughly disgusted with himself as he thought of all the evil that he had done and of the good which he had omitted to do while he was yet at college sir thomas had been anxious that he should be called to the bar and had again and again begged of him to consent to this as a commencement of his life in london but ralph had repliedand had at last replied with so much decision that sir thomas had abandoned the subjectthat as it was out of the question that he should ever make money at the bar the fact of his being called would be useless to him he argued that he need not waste his life because he was not a lawyer it was not his intention to waste his life he had a sufficient property of his own at once and must inherit a much larger property later in life he would not be called to the bar nor would he go into the army nor would he go abroad for any lengthened course of travelling he was fond of hunting but he would keep his hunting within measure surely an english private gentleman might live to some profit in his own country he would go out in honours and take a degree and then make himself happy among his books such had been his own plan for himself at twentyone at twentytwo he had quarrelled with the tutor at his college and taken his name off the books without any degree about this too he had argued with sir thomas expressing a strong opinion that a university degree was in england of all pretences the most vain and hollow at twentythree he began his career at the moonbeam with two horsesand from that day to this hunting had been the chief aim of his life during the last winter he had hunted six days a weekassuring sir thomas however that at the end of that season his wild oats would have been sown as regarded that amusement and that henceforth he should confine himself to two days a week since that he had justified the four horses which still remained at the moonbeam by the alleged fact that horses were drugs in april but would be pearls of price in november sir thomas could only expostulate and when he did so his late ward and present friend though he was always courteous would always argue then he fell as was natural into intimacies with such men as cox and fooks there was no special harm either in cox or fooks but no one knew better than did ralph newton himself that they were not such friends as he had promised himself when he was younger  fathers guardians and the race of old friends generally hardly ever give sufficient credit to the remorse which young men themselves feel when they gradually go astray they see the better as plainly as do their elders though they so often follow the worseas not unfrequently do the elders also ralph newton passed hardly a day of his life without a certain amount of remorse in that he had not managed himself better than he had done and was now doing he knew that fortune had been very good to him and that he had hitherto wasted all her gifts and now there came the question whether it was as yet too late to retrieve the injury which he had done he did believenot even as yet doubting his power to do wellthat everything might be made right only that his money difficulties pressed him so hardly he took pen and paper and made out a list of his debts heading the catalogue with mr horsball of the moonbeam the amount when added together came to something over four thousand pounds including a debt of three hundred to his brother the parson then he endeavoured to value his property and calculated that if he sold all that was remaining to him he might pay what he owed and have something about fifty pounds per annum left to live upon till he should inherit his uncles property but he doubted the accuracy even of this knowing that new and unexpected debts will always crop up when the day of settlement arrives of course he could not live upon fifty pounds a year it would have seemed to him to be almost equally impossible to live upon four times fifty pounds he had given sir thomas a promise that he would not raise money on postobits on his uncles life and hitherto he had kept that promise he thought that he would be guilty of no breach of promise were he so to obtain funds telling sir thomas of his purpose and asking the lawyers assistance but he knew that if he did this all his chance of future high prosperity would be at an end his uncle might live these twenty years and in that time he ralph might quite as readily die money might no doubt be raised but this could only be done at a cost which would be utterly ruinous to him there was one way out of his difficulty he might marry a girl with money a girl with money had been offered to him and a girl too who was very pretty and very pleasant but then to marry the daughter of a breechesmaker  and why not he had been teaching himself all his life to despise conventionalities he had ridiculed degrees he had laughed at the rank and standing of a barrister the rank is but the guinea stampthe mans the gowd for a that how often had he declared to himself and others that that should be his motto through life and might not he be as much a man and would not his metal be as pure with polly neefit for his wife as though he were to marry a duchess as for love he thought he could love polly dearly he knew that he had done some wrong in regard to poor clary but he by no means knew how much wrong he had done a single word of lovewhich had been so very much to her in her innocencehad been so little to him who was not innocent if he could allow himself to choose out of all the women he had ever seen he would he thought instigated rather by the ambition of having the loveliest woman in the world for his wife than by any love have endeavoured to win mary bonner as his own but that was out of the question mary bonner was as poor as himself and much as he admired her he certainly could not tell himself that he loved her polly neefit would pull him through all his difficulties nevertheless he could not make up his mind to ask polly neefit to be his wife  but he must make up his mind either that he would or that he would not he must see mr neefit on the morrowand within the next few days he must call on mr moggs unless he broke his word and in two months time he must have £500 for mr horsball suppose he were to go to sir thomas tell his whole story without reserve and ask his old friends advice everything without reserve he could not tell he could say nothing to the father of that scene on the lawn with clarissa but of his own pecuniary difficulties and of mr neefits generous offer he was sure that he could tell the entire truth he did go to southampton buildings and after some harsh language between himself and mr stemmsir thomas being away at the timehe managed to make an appointment for nine oclock that evening at his late guardians chambers at nine oclock precisely he found himself seated with sir thomas all among the books in southampton buildings perhaps youll have a cup of tea said sir thomas stemm give us some tea ralph waited till the tea was handed to him and stemm was gone then he told his story  he told it very fairly as against himself he brought out his little account and explained to the lawyer how it was that he made himself out to be worth fifty pounds a year and no more oh heavens what a mess you have made of it said the lawyer holding up both his hands no doubt i have said ralpha terrible mess but as i now come to you for advice hear me out to the end you can say nothing as to my folly which i do not know already go on said sir thomas go onill hear you it may however be remarked by the way that when an old gentleman in sir thomass position is asked his advice under such circumstances he ought to be allowed to remark that he had prophesied all these things beforehand i told you so is such a comfortable thing to say and when an old gentleman has taken much fruitless trouble about a young gentleman he ought at least not to be interrupted in his remarks as to that young gentlemans folly but ralph was energetic and knowing that he had a point before him would go on with his story and now he said i am coming to a way of putting these things right which has been suggested to me you wont like it i know but it would put me on my legs  raising money on your expectations said sir thomas  nothat is what i must come to if this plan dont answer  anything will be better than that said sir thomas  then ralph dashed at the suggestion of marriage without further delay you have heard of mr neefit the breechesmaker it so happened that sir thomas never had heard of mr neefit wellhe is a tradesman in conduit street he has a daughter and he will give her twenty thousand pounds  you dont mean to run away with the breechesmakers daughter ejaculated sir thomas  certainly not i shouldnt get the twenty thousand pounds if i did then he explained it allhow neefit had asked him to the house and offered him the girl how the girl herself was as pretty and nice as a girl could be and how he thoughtthough as to that he expressed himself with some humilitythat were he to propose to her the girl might perhaps take him  i dare say she would said sir thomas  wellnow you know it all in her way she has been educated neefit père is utterly illiterate and ignorant he is an honest man as vulgar as he can beor rather as unlike you and me which is what men mean when they talk of vulgarityand he makes the best of breeches neefit mère is worse than the fatherbeing cross and illconditioned as far as i can see polly is as good as gold and if i put a house over my head with her money of course her father and her mother will be made welcome there your daughters would not like to meet them but i think they could put up with polly now you know about all that i can tell you  ralph had been so rapid so energetic and withal so reasonable that sir thomas at this period of the interview was unable to refer to any of his prophecies what advice was he to give should he adjure this young man not to marry the breechesmakers daughter because of the blood of the newtons and the expected estate or were he to do so even on the score of education and general unfitness he must suggest some other mode or means of living but how could he advise the future newton of newton priory to marry polly neefit the newtons had been at newton priory for centuries and the men newtons had always married ladies as the women newtons had always either married gentlemen or remained unmarried sir thomas too was of his nature and by all his convictions opposed to such matches you have hardly realised said he what it would be to have such a fatherinlaw and such a motherinlawor probably such a wife  yes i have i have realised all that  of course if you have made up your mind  but i have not made up my mind sir thomas i must make it up before eleven oclock tomorrow morning because i must then be with neefitby appointment at this moment i am so much in doubt that i am almost inclined to toss up  i would sooner cut my throat said sir thomas forgetting his wisdom amidst the perplexities of his position  not quite that sir thomas i suppose you mean to say that anything would be better than such a marriage  i dont suppose you care for the girl said sir thomas crossly  i do not feel uneasy on that score if i did not like her and think that i could love her i would have nothing to do with it she herself is charmingthough i should lie if i were to say that she were a lady  and the father offered her to you  most distinctlyand named the fortune  knowing your own condition as to money  almost exactlyso much so that i do not doubt he will go on with it when he knows everything he had heard about my uncles property and complimented me by saying that i am agentleman  he does not deserve to have a daughter said sir thomas  i dont know about that according to his lights he means to do the best he can for her and indeed i think myself that he might do worse she will probably become mrs newton of newton priory if she marries me and the investment of neefits twenty thousand pounds wont be so bad  nothing on earth can make her a lady  im not so sure of that said ralph nothing on earth can make her mother a lady but of polly i should have hopes you however are against it  certainly  then what ought i to do sir thomas rubbed the calf of his leg and was silent the only advice you have given me hitherto was to cut my throat said ralph  no i didnt i dont know what youre to do youve ruined yourselfthats all  but there is a way out of the ruin in all emergencies there is a better and a worse course what now is the better course  you dont know how to earn a shilling said sir thomas  no i dont said ralph newton  sir thomas rubbed his face and scratched his head but did not know how to give advice you have made your bed and you must lie upon it he said  exactlybut which way am i to get into it and which way shall i get out sir thomas could only rub his face and scratch his head i thought it best to come and tell you everything said ralph that was all very well but sir thomas would not advise him to marry the breechesmakers daughter  it is a matter sir thomas said at last in which you must be guided by your own feelings i wish it were otherwise i can say no more then ralph took his leave and wandered all round st jamess park and the purlieus of westminster till midnight endeavouring to make up his mind and building castles in the air as to what he would do with himself and how he would act if he had not brought himself into so hopeless a mess of troubles     chapter ix  ontario moggs   on the following morning ralph newton was in conduit street exactly at the hour named he had not even then made up his mindbut he thought that he might get an extension of the time allowed him for decision after all it was hardly a month yet since the proposition was made to him he found mr neefit in the back shop measuring a customer ill be with you in two minutes said mr neefit just putting his head through the open door and then going back to his work 3118 waddle sir george isnt quite as stout as he was last year oh no sir george we wont tie you in too tight leave it to us sir george the last pair too tight oh no i think not sir george perhaps your man isnt as careful in cleaning as he ought to be gentlemens servants do get so careless it quite sickens one so mr neefit went on and as sir george was very copious in the instructions which he had to giveall of which bythebye were absolutely thrown awayralph newton became tired of waiting he remembered too that he was not there as a customer but almost as a member of the family and the idea sickened him he bethought himself that on his first visit to conduit street he had seen his polly in the shop cutting up strips wherewith her father would measure gentlemens legs she must then have been nearly fifteen and the occupation as he felt was not one fitting for the girl who was to be his wife now mr newton said mr neefit as sir george at last left the little room the day was hot and mr neefit had been at work in his shirt sleeves nor did he now put on his coat he wiped his brow put his cotton handkerchief inside his braces and shook hands with our hero well mr newton he said what do you think of it i couldnt learn much about it but it seemed to me that you and polly got on famous that night i thought wed have seen you out there again before this  i couldnt come mr neefit as long as there was a doubt  oh as to doubtsdoubts be bothered of course you must run your chance with polly like any other man  just so  but the way to get a girl like that isnt not to come and see her for a month there are others after our polly i can tell youand men who would take her with nothing but her smock on  im quite sure of that no one can see her without admiring her  then whats the good of talking of doubts i like you because you are a gentlemanand i can put you on your legs which from all i hear is a kind of putting you want bad enough just at present say the word and come down to tea this evening  the fact is mr neefit this is a very serious matter  serious twenty thousand pounds is serious there aint a doubt about that if you mean to say you dont like the bargainand as he said this there came a black cloud upon mr neefits browyouve only got to say the word our polly is not to be pressed upon any man but dont lets have any shillyshallying  tell me one thing mr neefit  wellwhats that  have you spoken to your daughter about this  mr neefit was silent for a moment well no i havent he said but i spoke to her mother and women is always talking mind i dont know what our polly would say to you but i do think she expects something theres a chap lives nigh to us who used always to be sneaking round but she has snubbed him terribly this month past so my wife tells me you come and try mr newton and then youll know all about it  ralph was aware that he had not as yet begun to explain his difficulty to the anxious father you see mr neefit he saidand then he paused it had been much easier for him to talk to sir thomas than to the breachesmaker  if you dont like itsay so said mr neefitand dont let us have no shillyshallying  i do like it  then give us your hand and come out this evening and have a bit of someat to eat and a drop of someat hot and pop the question thats about the way to do it  undoubtedlybut marriage is such a serious thing  so it is seriousuncommon serious to owe a fellow a lot of money you cant pay him i call that very serious  mr neefit i owe you nothing but what i can pay you  youre very slow about it mr newton thats all i can say but i wasnt just talking of myself after whats passed between you and me i aint going to be hard upon you  ill tell you what mr neefit said ralph at lastof course you can understand that a man may have difficulties with his family  because of my being a breechesmaker said neefit contemptuously  i wont say that but there may be difficulties  twenty thousand pounds does away with a deal of them things  just sobut as i was saying you can understand that there may be family difficulties i only say that because i ought perhaps to have given you an answer sooner i wont go down with you this evening  you wont  not tonightbut ill be with you on saturday evening if that will suit you  come and have a bit of dinner again on sunday said neefit ralph accepted the invitation shook hands with neefit and escaped from the shop  when he thought of it all as he went to his rooms he told himself that he had now as good as engaged himself to pollyas good or as bad of course after what had passed he could not go to the house again without asking her to be his wife were he to do so neefit would be justified in insulting him and yet when he undertook to make this fourth visit to the cottage he had done so with the intention of allowing himself a little more time for judgment he saw plainly enough that he was going to allow himself to drift into this marriage without any real decision of his own he prided himself on being strong and how could any man be more despicably weak than this it was indeed true that in all the arguments he had used with sir thomas he had defended the neefit marriage as though it was the best course he could adoptand even sir thomas had not ultimately ventured to oppose it would it not be as well for him to consider that he had absolutely made up his mind to marry polly  on the friday he called at mr moggss house mr moggs senior was there and mr moggs junior and also a shopman i was sorry said he that when your son called i had friends with me and could hardly explain circumstances  it didnt signify at all said moggs junior  but it does signify mr newton said moggs senior who on this morning was not in a good humour with his ledger two hundred and seventeen pounds three shillings and fourpence is a good deal of money for boots mr newton you must allow that  indeed it is mr moggs  there hasnt been what you may call a settlement for years twentyfive pounds paid in the last two years and mr moggs as he spoke had his finger on the fatal page that wont do you know mr newtonthat wont do at all mr moggs as he looked into his customers face worked himself up into a passion but i suppose you have come to settle it now mr newton  not exactly at this moment mr moggs  it must be settled very soon mr newtonit must indeed my son cant be calling on you day after day and all for nothing we cant stand that you know mr newton perhaps youll oblige me by saying when it will be settled then ralph explained that he had called for that purpose that he was making arrangements for paying all his creditors and that he hoped that mr moggs would have his money within three months at the farthest mr moggs then proposed that he should have his customers bill at three months and the interview ended by the due manufacture of a document to that effect ralph when he entered the shop had not intended to give a bill but the pressure had been too great upon him and he had yielded it would matter little however if he married polly neefit and had he not now accepted it as his destiny that he must marry polly neefit  the saturday he passed in much trouble of spirit and with many doubts but the upshot of it all was that he would keep his engagement for the sunday his last chance of escape would have been to call in conduit street on the saturday and tell mr neefit with such apologies as he might be able to make that the marriage would not be suitable while sitting at breakfast he had almost resolved to do thisbut when five oclock came after which as he well knew the breechesmaker would not be found no such step had been taken he dined that evening and went to the theatre with lieutenant cox at twelve they were joined by fooks and another gay spirit and they eat chops and drank stout and listened to songs at evanss till near two cox and fooks said that they had never been so jolly in their livesbut ralphthough he eat and drank as much and talked more than the otherswas far from happy there came upon him a feeling that after tomorrow he would never again be able to call himself a gentleman who would associate with him after he had married the breechesmakers daughter he laid in bed late on sunday and certainly went to no place of worship would it not be well even yet to send a letter down to neefit telling him that the thing could not be the man would be very angry with him and would have great cause to be angry but it would at least be better to do this now than hereafter but when four oclock came no letter had been sent  punctually at five the cab set him down at alexandrina cottage how well he seemed to know the placealmost as well as though he were already one of the family he was shown into the drawingroom and whom should he see there seated with mr and mrs and miss neefit but ontario moggs it was clear enough that each of the party was ill at ease neefit welcomed him with almost boisterous hospitality mrs neefit merely curtseyed and bobbed at him polly smiled and shook hands with him and told him that he was welcomebut even polly was a little beside herself ontario moggs stood bolt upright and made him a low bow but did not attempt to speak  i hope your father is well said ralph addressing himself to moggs junior  pretty well i thank you said mr moggs getting up from his chair and bowing a second time  mr neefit waited for a moment or two during which no one except ralph spoke a word and then invited his intended soninlaw to follow him into the garden the fact is said neefit winking this is mrs ns doing it dont make any difference you know  i dont quite understand said ralph  you see weve known onty moggs all our lives and no doubt he has been sweet upon polly but polly dont care for him mind you you ask her and mrs n has got it into her head that she dont want you for polly but i do mr newtonand im master  i wouldnt for the world make a family quarrel  there wont be no quarrelling its i as has the purse and its the purse as makes the master mr newton dont you mind moggs moggs is very well in his way but he aint going to have our polly wellhe come down here today just by chanceand what did mrs n do but ask him to stop and eat a bit of dinner it dont make any difference you know you come in now and just go on as though moggs werent there you and polly shall have it all to yourselves this evening  here was a new feature added to the pleasures of his courtship he had a rivaland such a rivalhis own bootmaker whom he could not pay and whose father had insulted him a day or two since moggs junior would of course know why his customer was dining at alexandrina cottage and would have his own feelings too upon the occasion  dont you mind himno more than nothing said neefit leading the way back into the drawingroom and passing at the top of the kitchen stairs the young woman with the bit of salmon  the dinner was not gay in the first place neefit and mrs neefit gave very explicit and very opposite directions as to the manner in which their guests were to walk in to dinner the result of which was that ralph was obliged to give his arm to the elder lady while ontario carried off the prize mrs neefit also gave directions as to the places which were obeyed in spite of an attempt of neefits to contravene them ontario and polly sat on one side of the table while ralph sat opposite to them neefit when he saw that the arrangement was made and could not be altered lost his temper and scolded his wife law papa what does it matter said polly pollys position certainly was unpleasant enough but she made head against her difficulties gallantly ontario who had begun to guess the truth said not a word he was not however long in making up his mind that a personal encounter with mr ralph newton might be good for his system mrs neefit nagged at her husband and told him when he complained about the meat that if he would look after the drinkables that would be quite enough for him to do ralph himself found it to be impossible even to look as though things were going right never in his life had he been in a position so uncomfortableor as he thought so disreputable it was not to be endured that moggs his bootmaker should see him sitting at the table of neefit his breechesmaker  the dinner was at last over and the portwine was carried out into the arbournot on this occasion by polly but by the maid polly and mrs neefit went off together while ralph crowded into the little summerhouse with moggs and neefit in this way half an hour was passeda half hour of terrible punishment but there was worse coming mr newton said neefit i think i heard something about your taking a walk with our polly if you like to make a start of it dont let us keep you moggs and i will have a pipe together  i also intend to walk with miss neefit said ontario standing up bravely   illustration i also intend to walk with miss neefit said ontario standing up bravely   twos company and threes none said neefit  no doubt said ontario no doubt i feel that myself mr newton ive been attached to miss neefit these two years i dont mind saying it out straight before her father i love miss neefit i dont know sir what your ideas are but i love miss neefit perhaps sir your ideas may be moneymy ideas are a pure affection for that young lady now mr newton you know what my ideas are mr moggs junior was standing up when he made this speech and when he had completed it he looked round first upon her father and then upon his rival  shes never given you no encouragement said neefit how dare you speak in that way about my polly  i do dare said ontario there  will you tell mr newton that she ever gave you any encouragement  ontario thought about it for a moment before he replied noi will not said he to say that of any young woman wouldnt be in accord with my ideas  because you cant its all gammon she dont mean to have him mr newton you may take my word for that you go in and ask her if she do a pretty thing indeed i cant invite my friend mr newton to eat a bit of dinner and let him walk out with my polly but you must interfere if you had her tomorrow you wouldnt have a shilling with her  i dont want a shilling with her said ontario still standing upon his legs i love her will mr newton say as fair as that  mr newton found it very difficult to say anything even had he been thoroughly intent on the design of making polly his wife he could not have brought himself to declare his love aloud as had just been done by mr moggs this is a sort of matter that shouldnt be discussed in public he said at last  public or private i love her said ontario moggs with his hand on his heart  polly herself was certainly badly treated among them she got no walk that evening and received no assurance of undying affection either from one suitor or the other it became manifest even to neefit himself that the game could not be played out on this evening he could not turn moggs off the premises because his wife would have interfered nor had he done so would it have been possible after such an affair to induce polly to stir from the house she certainly had been badly used among them and so she took occasion to tell her father when the visitors were both gone they left the house together at about eight and polly at that time had not reappeared moggs went to the nearest station of the midland railway and ralph walked to the swiss cottage certainly mr neefits little dinner had been unsuccessful but ralph newton as he went back to london was almost disposed to think that providence had interposed to save him  ill tell you what it is father said polly to her papa as soon as the two visitors had left the house if thats the way you are going to go on ill never marry anybody as long as i live  my dear it was all your mother said mr neefit now wasnt it all your mother i wish shed been blowed fust     chapter x  sir thomas in his chambers   it will be remembered that sir thomas underwood had declined to give his late ward any advice at that interview which took place in southampton buildingsor rather that the only advice which he had given to the young man was to cut his throat the idle word had left no impression on ralph newtonbut still it had been spoken and was remembered by sir thomas when he was left alone after the young mans departure he was very unhappy it was not only that he had spoken a word so idle when he ought to have been grave and wise but that he felt that he had been altogether remiss in his duty as guide philosopher and friend there were old sorrows too on this score in the main sir thomas had discharged well a most troublesome thankless and profitless duty towards the son of a man who had not been related to him and with whom an accidental intimacy had been ripened into friendship by letter rather than by social intercourse ralph newtons father had been the younger brother of the present gregory newton of newton priory and had been the parson of the parish of peele newtonas was now ralphs younger brother gregory the present squire of newton had been never married and the property as has before been said had been settled on ralph as the male heirprovided of course that his uncle left no legitimate son of his own it had come to pass that the two brothers gregory and ralph had quarrelled about matters of property and had not spoken for years before the death of the younger ralph at this time had been just old enough to be brought into the quarrel there had been questions of cutting timber and of leases as to which the parson acting on his sons behalf had opposed the squire with much unnecessary bitterness and suspicion and it was doubtless the case that the squire resented bitterly an act done by his own father with the view of perpetuating the property in the true line of the newtons for when the settlement was made on the marriage of the younger brother the elder was already the father of a child whom he loved none the less because that childs mother had not become his wife so the quarrel had been fostered and at the time of the parsons death had extended itself to the young man who was his son and the heir to the estate when on his deathbed the parson had asked mr underwood who had just then entered the house of commons to undertake this guardianship and the lawyer with many doubts had consented he had striven but striven in vain to reconcile the uncle and nephew and indeed he was illfitted to accomplish such task he could only write letters on the subject which were very sensible but very coldin all of which he would be careful to explain that the steps which had been taken in regard to the property were in strict conformity with the law the old squire would have nothing to do with his heirin which resolution he was strengthened by the tidings which reached him of his heirs manner of living he was taught to believe that everything was going to the dogs with the young man and was wont to say that newton priory with all its acres would be found to have gone to the dogs too when his day was doneunless indeed ralph should fortunately kill himself by drink or evil living in which case the property would go to the younger gregory the present parson now the present parson of newton was his uncles friend whether that friendship would have been continued had ralph died and the young clergyman become the heir may be matter of doubt  this disagreeable duty of guardianship sir thomas had performed with many scruples of conscience and a determination to do his bestand he had nearly done it well but he was a man who could not do it altogether well let his scruples of conscience be what they might he had failed in obtaining a fathers control over the young man and even in regard to the property which had passed through his handsthough he had been careful with ithe had not been adroit even at this moment things had not been settled which should have been settled and sir thomas had felt when ralph had spoken of selling all that remained to him and of paying his debts that there would be fresh trouble and that he might be forced to own that he had been himself deficient  and then he told himselfand did so as soon as ralph had left himthat he should have given some counsel to the young man when he came to ask for it you had better cut your throat in his troubled spirit he had said that and now his spirit was troubled the more because he had so spoken he sat for hours thinking of it all ralph newton was the undoubted heir to a very large property he was now embarrassedbut all his present debts did not amount to much more than half one years income of that property which would be hisprobably in about ten years the squire might live for twenty years or might die tomorrow but his lifeinterest in the estate according to the usual calculations was not worth more than ten years purchase could he sir thomas have been right to tell a young man whose prospects were so good and whose debts after all were so light that he ought to go and cut his throat as the only way of avoiding a disreputable marriage which would otherwise be forced upon him by the burden of his circumstances would not a guardian with any true idea of his duty would not a friend whose friendship was in any degree real have found a way out of such difficulties as these  and then as to the marriage itselfthe proposed marriage with the breechesmakers daughterthe more sir thomas thought of it the more distasteful did it become to him he knew that ralph was unaware of all the evil that would follow such a marriagerelatives whose every thought and action and word would be distasteful to him children whose mother would not be a lady and whose blood would be polluted by an admixture so baseand worse still a lifes companion who would be deficient in all those attributes which such a man as ralph newton should look for in a wife sir thomas was a man to magnify rather than lesson these evils and now he allowed his frienda man for whose behalf he had bound himself to use all the exercise of friendshipto go from him with an idea that nothing but suicide could prevent this marriage simply because there was an amount of debt which when compared with the mans prospects should hardly have been regarded as a burden as he thought of all this sir thomas was very unhappy  ralph had left him at about ten oclock and he then sat brooding over his misery for about an hour it was his custom when he remained in his chambers to tell his clerk stemm between nine and ten that nothing more would be wanted then stemm would go and sir thomas would sleep for a while in his chair but the old clerk never stirred till thus dismissed it was now eleven and sir thomas knew very well that stemm would be in his closet he opened the door and called and stemm aroused from his slumbers slowly crept into the room joseph said his master i want mr ralphs papers  tonight sir thomas  wellyes tonight i ought to have told you when he went away but i was thinking of things  so i was thinking of things said stemm as he very slowly made his way into the other room and climbing up a set of steps which stood there pulled down from an upper shelf a tin boxand with it a world of dust if youd have said before that theyd be wanted sir thomas there wouldnt be such a deal of dry muck said stemm as he put down the box on a chair opposite sir thomass knees  and now where is the key said sir thomas stemm shook his head very slowly you know stemmwhere is it  how am i to know sir thomas i dont know sir thomas its like enough in one of those drawers then stemm pointed to a certain table and after a while slowly followed his own finger the drawer was unlocked and under various loose papers there lay four or five loose keys like enough its one of these said stemm  of course you knew where it was said sir thomas  i didnt know nothing at all about it said stemm bobbing his head at his master and making at the same time a gesture with his lips whereby he intended to signify that his master was making a fool of himself stemm was hardly more than five feet high and was a wizened dry old man with a very old yellow wig he delighted in scolding all the world and his special delight was in scolding his master but against all the world he would take his masters part and had no care in the world except his masters comfort when sir thomas passed an evening at fulham stemm could do as he pleased with himself but they were blank evenings with stemm when sir thomas was away while sir thomas was in the next room he always felt that he was in company but when sir thomas was away all london which was open to him offered him no occupation thats the key said stemm picking out one but it wasnt i as put it there and you didnt tell me as it was there and i didnt know it was there i guessedjust because you do chuck things in there sir thomas  what does it matter joseph said sir thomas  it does matter when you say i knowed i didnt knownor i couldnt know theres the key anyhow  you can go now joseph said sir thomas  good night sir thomas said stemm retiring slowly but i didnt know sir thomasnor i couldnt know then sir thomas unlocked the box and gradually surrounded himself with the papers which he took from it it was past one oclock before he again began to think what he had better do to put ralph newton on his legs and to save him from marrying the breechesmakers daughter he sat meditating on that and other things as they came into his mind for over an hour and then he wrote the following letter to old mr newton very many years had passed since he had seen mr newtonso many that the two men would not have known each other had they met but there had been an occasional correspondence between them and they were presumed to be on amicable terms with each other      southampton buildings 14th july 186     dear sir     i wish to consult you about the affairs of your heir and    my late ward ralph newton of course i am aware of the    unfortunate misunderstanding which has hitherto separated    you from him as to which i believe you will be willing to    allow that he at least has not been in fault though his    life has by no means been what his friends could have    wished it he is a fine young fellow and perhaps his    errors have arisen as much from his unfortunate position    as from any natural tendency to evil on his own part he    has been brought up to great expectations with the    immediate possession of a small fortune these together    have taught him to think that a profession was unnecessary    for him and he has been debarred from those occupations    which generally fall in the way of the heir to a large    landed property by the unfortunate fact of his entire    separation from the estate which will one day be his had    he been your son instead of your nephew i think that his    life would have been prosperous and useful     as it is he has got into debt and i fear that the    remains of his own property will not more than suffice to    free him from his liabilities of course he could raise    money on his interest in the newton estate hitherto he    has not done so and i am most anxious to save him from a    course so ruinousas you will be also i am sure he has    come to me for advice and i grieve to say has formed a    project of placing himself right again as regards money by    offering marriage to the daughter of a retail tradesman i    have reason to believe that hitherto he has not committed    himself but i think that the young womans father would    accept the offer if made the money i do not doubt    would be forthcoming but the result could not be    fortunate he would then have allied himself with people    who are not fit to be his associates and he would have    tied himself to a wife who whatever may be her merits as    a woman cannot be fit to be the mistress of newton    priory but i have not known what advice to give him i    have pointed out to him the miseries of such a match and    i have also told him how surely his prospects for the    future would be ruined were he to attempt to live on    money borrowed on the uncertain security of his future    inheritance i have said so much as plainly as i know how    to say itbut i have been unable to point out a third    course i have not ventured to recommend him to make any    application to you     it seems however to me that i should be remiss in my    duty both to him and to you were i not to make you    acquainted with his circumstancesso that you may    interfere should you please to do so either on his    behalf or on behalf of the property whatever offence    there may have been i think there can have been none    personally from him to yourself i beg you to believe that    i am far from being desirous to dictate to you or to    point out to you this or that as your duty but i venture    to think that you will be obliged to me for giving you    information which may lead to the protection of interests    which cannot but be dear to you in conclusion i will    only again say that ralph himself is clever    wellconditioned and as i most truly believe a thorough    gentleman were the intercourse between you that of a    father and son i think you would feel proud of the    relationship     i remain dear sir    very faithfully yours     thomas underwood     gregory newton esq newton priory   this was written on friday night and was posted on the saturday morning by the faithful hand of joseph stemmwho however did not hesitate to declare to himself as he read the address that his master was a fool for his pains stemm had never been favourable to the cause of young newton and had considered from the first that sir thomas should have declined the trust that had been imposed upon him what good was to be expected from such a guardianship and as things had gone on proving stemms prophecies as to young newtons career to be true that trusty clerk had not failed to remind his master of his own misgivings i told you so had been repeated by stemm over and over again in more phrases than one until the repetition had made sir thomas very angry sir thomas when he gave the letter to stemm for posting said not a word of the contents but stemm knew something of old mr gregory newton and the newton priory estate stemm moreover could put two and two together hes a fool for his painsthats all said stemm as he poked the letter into the box  during the whole of the next day the matter troubled sir thomas what if ralph should go at once to the breechesmakers daughterthe thought of whom made sir thomas very sickand commit himself before an answer should be received from mr newton it was only on sunday that an idea struck him that he might still do something further to avoid the eviland with this object he despatched a note to ralph imploring him to wait for a few days before he would take any steps towards the desperate remedy of matrimony then he begged ralph to call upon him again on the wednesday morning this note ralph did not get till he went home on the sunday eveningat which time as the reader knows he had not as yet committed himself to the desperate remedy  on the following tuesday sir thomas received the following letter from mr newton      newton priory 17th july 186     dear sir     i have received your letter respecting mr ralph newtons    affairs in regard to which as far as they concern    himself i am free to say that i do not feel much    interest but you are quite right in your suggestion that    my solicitude in respect of the family property is very    great i need not trouble you by pointing out the nature    of my solicitude but may as well at once make an offer to    you which you as mr ralph newtons friend and as an    experienced lawyer can considerand communicate to him    if you think right to do so     it seems that he will be driven to raise money on his    interest in this property i have always felt that he    would do so and that from the habits of his life the    property would be squandered before it came into his    possession why should he not sell his reversion and why    should i not buy it i write in ignorance but i presume    such an arrangement would be legal and honourable on my    part the sum to be given would be named without    difficulty by an actuary i am now fiftyfive and i    believe in good health you yourself will probably know    within a few thousand pounds what would be the value of    the reversion a proper person would however be of    course employed     i have saved money but by no means enough for such an    outlay as this i would however mortgage the property or    sell one half of it if by doing so i could redeem the    other half from mr ralph newton     you no doubt will understand exactly the nature of my    offer and will let me have an answer i do not know that    i can in any other way expedite mr ralph newtons course    in life     i am dear sir    faithfully yours     gregory newton senior   when sir thomas read this he was almost in greater doubt and difficulty than before the measure proposed by the elder newton was no doubt legal and honourable but it could hardly be so carried out as to be efficacious ralph could only sell his share of the inheritanceor rather his chance of inheriting the estate were he to die without a son before his uncle then his brother would be the heir the arrangement however if practicable would at once make all things comfortable for ralph and would give him probably a large unembarrassed revenueso large that the owner of it need certainly have recourse to no discreditable marriage as the means of extricating himself from present calamity but then sir thomas had very strong ideas about a family property were ralphs affairs indeed in such disorder as to make it necessary for him to abandon the great prospect of being newton of newton if the breechesmakers twenty thousand would suffice surely the thing could be done on cheaper terms than those suggested by the old squireand done without the intervention of polly neefit     chapter xi  newton priory   newton priory was at this time inhabited by two gentlemenold gregory newton who for miles round was known as the squire and his son ralph newtonhis son but not his heir a son however whom he loved as well as though he had been born with an undoubted right to inherit all those dearlyvalued acres a few lines will tell all that need be told of the squires early lifeand indeed of his life down to the present period in very early days immediately upon his leaving college he had travelled abroad and had formed an attachment with a german lady who by him became the mother of a child he intended to marry her hoping to reconcile his father to the match but before either marriage or reconciliation could take place the young mother whose babes life could then only be counted by months was dead in the hope that the old man might yield in all things the infant had been christened ralph for the old squires name was ralph and there had been a ralph among the newtons since newton priory had existed but the old squire had a ralph of his ownthe father of our ralph and of the present parsonwho in his time was rector of peele newton and when the tidings of this foreign baby and of the proposed foreign marriage reached the old squirethen he urged his second son to marry and made the settlement of the estate of which the reader has heard the settlement was natural enough it simply entailed the property on the male heir of the family in the second generation it deprived the eldest son of nothing that would be his in accordance with the usual tenure of english primogeniture had he married and become the father of a family his eldest son would have been the heir but heretofore there had been no such entails in the newton family or at least he was pleased to think that there had been none such and when he himself inherited the property early in lifebefore he had reached his thirtieth yearhe thought that his father had injured him his boy was as dear to him as though the mother had been his honest wife then he endeavoured to come to some terms with his brother he would do anything in order that his child might be newton of newton after him but the parson would come to no terms at all and was powerless to make any such terms as those which the elder brother required the parson was honest selfdenying and proud on behalf of his own children but he was intrusive in regard to the property and apt to claim privileges of interference beyond his right as the guardian of his own or of his childrens future interests and so the brothers had quarrelledand so the story of newton priory is told up to the period at which our story begins  gregory newton and his son ralph had lived together at the priory for the last sixandtwenty years and the young man had grown up as a newton within the knowledge of all the gentry around them the story of his birth was public and it was of course understood that he was not the heir his father had been too wise on the sons behalf to encourage any concealment the son was very popular and deserved to be so but it was known to all the young men round and also to all the maidens that he would not be newton of newton there had been no illcontrived secret sufficient to make a difficulty but not sufficient to save the lad from the pains of his position everybody knew it and yet it can hardly be said that he was treated otherwise than he would have been treated had he been the heir in the huntingfield there was no more popular man a point had been stretched in his favour and he was a magistrate mothers were kind to him for it was known that his father loved him well and that his father had been a prudent man in all respects he was treated as though he were the heir he managed the shooting and was the trusted friend of all the tenants doubtless his father was the more indulgent to him because of the injury that had been done to him after all his life promised well as to material prosperity for though the squire in writing to sir thomas had spoken of selling half the property with the view of keeping the other half for his son he was already possessed of means that would enable him to make the proposed arrangement without such sacrifice as that for twentyfour years he had felt that he was bound to make a fortune for his son out of his own income and he had made a fortune and mothers knew it and everybody in the county was very civil to ralphto that ralph who was not the heir  but the squire had never yet quite abandoned the hope that ralph who was not the heir might yet possess the place and when he heard of his nephews doings heard falsehood as well as truth from day to day he built up new hopes he had not expected any such overture as that which had come from sir thomas but if as he did expect ralph the heir should go to the jews why should not the squire purchase the jews interest in his own estate or if ralph the heir should more wisely deal with some great moneylending office why should not he redeem the property through the same ralph the heir would surely throw what interest he had into the market and if so that interest might be bought by the person to whom it must be of more value than to any other he had said little about it even to his sonbut he had hoped and now had come this letter from sir thomas the reader knows the letter and the squires answer  the squire himself was a very handsome man tall broadshouldered squarefaced with hair and whiskers almost snowwhite already but which nevertheless gave to him but little sign of age he was very strong and could sit in the saddle all day without fatigue he was given much to farming and thoroughly understood the duties of a country gentleman he was hospitable too for though money had been saved the priory had ever been kept as one of the pleasantest houses in the county there had been no wife no child but the one and no house in london the stables however had been full of hunters and it was generally said that no men in hampshire were better mounted than gregory the father and ralph the son of the father we will only further say that he was a generous passionate persistent vindictive and unforgiving man a bitter enemy and a staunch friend a thoroughgoing tory who much as he loved england and hampshire and newton priory feared that they were all going to the dogs because of mr disraeli and household suffrage but who felt in spite of those fears that to make his son master of newton priory after him would be the greatest glory of his life he had sworn to the young mother on her deathbed that the boy should be to him as though he had been born in wedlock he had been as good as his wordand we may say that he was one who had at least that virtue that he was always as good as his word  the son was very like the father in face and gait and bearingso like that the parentage was marked to the glance of any observer he was tall as was his father and broad across the chest and strong and active as his father had ever been but his face was of a nobler stamp bearing a surer impress of intellect and in that respect telling certainly the truth this ralph newton had been educated abroad his father with a morbid feeling which he had since done much to conquer having feared to send him among other young men the sons of squires and noblemen who would have known that their comrade was debarred by the disgrace of his birth from inheriting the property of his father but it may be doubted whether he had not gained as much as he had lost german and french were the same to him as his native tongue and he returned to the life of an english country gentleman young enough to learn to ride to hounds and to live as he found others living around him  very little was said or indeed ever had been said between the father and son as to their relative position in reference to the property ralphthe illegitimate ralphknew well enough and had always known that the estate was not to be his he had known this so long that he did not remember the day when he had not known it occasionally the squire would observe with a curse that this or that could not be done with the propertysuch a house pulled down or such another built this copse grupped up or those trees cut downbecause of that reprobate up in london as to pulling down there was no probability of interference now though there had been much of such interference in the life of the old rector ralph he had once said to his brother the rector ill marry and have a family yet if there is another word about the timber i have not the slightest right or even wish to object to your doing so said the rector but as long as things are on their present footing i shall continue to do my duty soon after that it had come to pass that the brothers so quarrelled that all intercourse between them was at an end such revenge such absolute punishment as that which the squire had threatened would have been very pleasant to himbut not even for such pleasure as that would he ruin the boy whom he loved he did not marry but saved money and dreamed of buying up the reversion of his nephews interest  his son was just two years older than our ralph up in london and his father was desirous that he should marry your wife would be mistress of the houseas long as i live at least he had once said there are difficulties about it said the son of course there were difficulties i do not know whether it is not better that i should remain unmarried he said a few minutes later there are men whom marriage does not seem to suiti mean as regards their position the father turned away and groaned aloud when he was alone on the evening of that day as they were sitting together over their wine the son alluded not exactly to the same subject but to the thoughts which had arisen from it within his own mind father he said i dont know whether it wouldnt be better for you to make it up with my cousin and have him down here  what cousin said the squire turning sharply round  with gregorys eldest brother the reader will perhaps remember that the gregory of that day was the parson i believe he is a good fellow and he has done you no harm  he has done me all harm  no father no we cannot help ourselves you know were he to die gregory would be in the same position it would be better that the family should be kept together  i would sooner have the devil here no consideration on earth shall induce me to allow him to put his foot upon this place nonot whilst i live the son said nothing further and they sat together in silence for some quarter of an hourafter which the elder of the two rose from his chair and coming round the table put his hand on the sons shoulder and kissed his sons brow father said the young man you think that i am troubled by things which hardly touch me at all by god they touch me close enough said the elder this had taken place some month or two before the date of sir thomass letterbut any reference to the matter of which they were both no doubt always thinking was very rare between them  newton priory was a place which a father might well wish to leave unimpaired to his son it lay in the north of hampshire where that county is joined to berkshire and perhaps in england there is no prettier district no country in which moorland and woodland and pasture are more daintily thrown together to please the eye in which there is a sweeter air or a more thorough seeming of english wealth and english beauty and english comfort those who know eversley and bramshill and heckfield and strathfieldsaye will acknowledge that it is so but then how few are the englishmen who travel to see the beauties of their own country newton priory or newton peele as the parish was called lay somewhat west of these places but was as charming as any of them the entire parish belonged to mr newton as did portions of three or four parishes adjoining the house itself was neither large nor remarkable for its architecturebut it was comfortable the rooms indeed were low for it had been built in the ungainly days of queen anne with additions in the equally ungainly time of george ii and the passages were long and narrow and the bedrooms were up and down stairs as though pains had been taken that no two should be on a level and the windows were of ugly shape and the whole mass was uncouth and formlesspartaking neither of the gothic beauty of the stuart architecture nor of the palatial grandeur which has sprung up in our days and it stood low giving but little view from the windows but nevertheless there was a family comfort and a warm solidity about the house which endeared it to those who knew it well there had been a time in which the present squire had thought of building for himself an entirely new house on another siteon the rising brow of a hill some quarter of a mile away from his present residencebut he had remembered that as he could not leave his estate to his son it behoved him to spend nothing on the property which duty did not demand from him  the house stood in a park of some two hundred acres in which the ground was poor indeed but beautifully diversified by rising knolls and little ravines which seemed to make the space almost unlimited and then the pines which waved in the newton woods sighed and moaned with a melody which in the ears of their owner was equalled by that of no other fir trees in the world and the broom was yellower at newton than elsewhere and more plentiful and the heather was sweeterand wild thyme on the grass more fragrant so at least mr newton was always ready to swear and all this he could not leave behind him to his sonbut must die with the knowledge that as soon as the breath was out of his body it would become the property of a young man whom he hated he might not cut down the pine woods nor disturb those venerable single trees which were the glory of his parkbut there were moments in which he thought that he could take a delight in ploughing up the furze and in stripping the hillsides of the heather why should his estate be so beautiful for one who was nothing to him would it not be well that he should sell everything that was saleable in order that his own son might be the richer  on the day after he had written his reply to sir thomas he was rambling in the evening with his son through the woods nothing could be more beautiful than the park was nowand ralph had been speaking of the glory of the place but something had occurred to make his father revert to the condition of a certain tenant whose holding on the property was by no means satisfactory either to himself or to his landlord you know sir said the son i told you last year that darvell would have to go  wheres he to go to  hell go to the workhouse if he stays here it will be much better for him to be bought out while there is still something left for him to sell nothing can be worse than a man sticking on to land without a shilling of capital  of course its bad his father did very well there  his father did very well there till he took to drink and died of it you know where the road parts darvells farm and brownriggs just look at the difference of the crops theres a place with wheat on each side of you i was looking at them before dinner  brownriggs is in a different parish brownriggs is in bostock  but the land is of the same quality of course walker is a different sort of man from darvell i believe there are nearly four hundred acres in brownriggs  all that said the father  and darvell has about seventybut the land should be made to bear the same produce per acre  the squire paused a moment and then asked a question what should you say if i proposed to sell brownriggs now there were two or three matters which made the proposition to sell brownriggs a very wonderful proposition to come from the squire in the first place he couldnt sell an acre of the property at allof which fact his son was very well aware and then of all the farms on the estate it was perhaps the best and most prosperous mr walker the tenant was a man in very good circumstances who hunted and was popular and was just the man of whose tenancy no landlord would be ashamed   illustration what should you say if i proposed to sell brownriggs   sell brownriggs said the young man well yes i should be surprised could you sell it  not at present said the squire  how could it be sold at all they were now standing at a gate leading out of the park into a field held by the squire in his own hands and were both leaning on it father said the son i wish you would not trouble yourself about the estate but let things come and go just as they have been arranged  i prefer to arrange them for myselfif i can it comes to this that it may be possible to buy the reversion of the property i could not buy it allor if i did must sell a portion of it to raise the money i have been thinking it over and making calculations if we let walkers farm go and ingrams i think i could manage the rest of course it would depend on the value of my own life  there was a long pause during which they both were still leaning on the gate it is a phantom sir the young man said at last  what do you mean by a phantom i dont see any phantom a reversion can be bought and sold as well as any other property and if it be sold in this case i am as free to buy it as any other man  who says it is to be sold sir  i say so that prig of a barrister sir thomas underwood has already made overtures to me to do something for that young scoundrel in london he is a scoundrel for he is spending money that is not his own and he is now about to make a marriage that will disgrace his family the squire probably did not at the moment think of the disgrace which he had brought upon the family by not marrying the fact is that he will have to sell all that he can sell why should i not buy it  if he were to die suggested the son  i wish he would said the father  dont say that sir but if he were to die gregory here who is as good a fellow as ever lived would come into his shoes ralph could sell no more than his own chance  we could get gregory to join us said the energetic squire he also could sell his right  you had better leave it as it is sir said the son after another pause i feel sure that you will only get yourself into trouble the place is yours as long as you live and you should enjoy it  and know that it is going to the jews after me not if i can help it you wont marry as things are but youd marry quick enough if you knew you would remain here after my deathif you were sure that a child of yours could inherit the estate i mean to try it on and it is best that you should know whatever he can make over to the jews he can make over to meand as that is what he is about i shall keep my eyes open i shall go up to london about it and see carey next week a man can do a deal if he sets himself thoroughly to work  id leave it alone if i were you said the young man  i shall not leave it alone i maynt be able to get it all but ill do my best to secure a part of it if any is to go it had better be the land in bostock and twining i think we could manage to keep newton entire  his mind was always on the subject though it was not often that he said a word about it to the son in whose behalf he was so anxious his thoughts were always dwelling on it so that the whole peace and comfort of his life were disturbed a lifeinterest in a property is perhaps as much as a man desires to have when he for whose protection he is debarred from further privileges of ownership is a wellloved sonbut an entail that limits an owners rights on behalf of an heir who is not loved who is looked upon as an enemy is very grievous and in this case the man who was so limited so cramped so hedged in and robbed of the true pleasures of ownership had a son with whom he would have been willing to share everythingwhom it would have been his delight to consult as to every roof to be built every tree to be cut every lease to be granted or denied he would dream of telling his son with a certain luxury of selfabnegation that this or that question as to the estate should be settled in the interest not of the setting but of the rising sun it is your affair rather than mine my boydo as you like he could picture to himself in his imagination a pleasant halfmock melancholy in saying such things and in sharing the reins of government between his own hands and those of his heir as the sun is falling in the heavens and the evening lights come on this worlds wealth and prosperity afford no pleasure equal to this it is this delight that enables a man to feel up to the last moment that the goods of the world are good but of all this he was to be robbedin spite of all his prudence it might perhaps sometimes occur to him that he by his own vice had brought this scourge upon his backbut not the less on that account did it cause him to rebel against the rod then there would come upon him the idea that he might cure this evil were his energy sufficientand all that he heard of that nephew and heir whom he hated tended to make him think that the cure was within his reach there had been moments in which he had planned a scheme of leading on that reprobate into quicker and deeper destruction of a pretended friendship with the spendthrift in order that money for speedier ruin might be lent on that security which the uncle himself was so anxious to possess as his very own but the scheme of this iniquity though it had been planned and mapped out in his brain had never been entertained as a thing really to be done there are few of us who have not allowed our thoughts to work on this or that villany arranging the method of its performance though the performance itself is far enough from our purpose the amusement is not without its dangerand to the squire of newton had so far been injurious that it had tended to foster his hatred he would however do nothing that was dishonestnothing that the world would condemnnothing that would not bear the light the argument to which he mainly trusted was thisthat if ralph newton the heir had anything to sell and was pleased to sell it it was as open to him to buy it as to any other if the reversion of the estate of newton priory was in the market why should he not buy itthe reversion or any part of the reversion if such were the case he certainly would buy it     chapter xii  mrs brownlow   there was a certain old mrs brownlow who inhabited a large oldfashioned house on the fulham road just beyond the fashionable confines of brompton but nearer to town than the decidedly rural district of walham green and parsons green she was deeply interested in the welfare of the underwood girls having been a first cousin of their paternal grandmother and was very unhappy because their father would not go home and take care of them she was an excellent old woman affectionate charitable and religious but she was rather behindhand in general matters and did not clearly understand much about anything in these latter days she had heard that sir thomas was accustomed to live away from his daughters and thought it very shockingbut she knew that sir thomas either was or had been in parliament and that he was a great lawyer and a very clever man and therefore she made excuses she did not quite understand it all but she thought it expedient to befriend the young ladies she had heard too that ralph newton who had been entrusted to the care of sir thomas was heir to an enormous property and she thought that the young man ought to marry one of the young ladies consequently whenever she would ask her cousins to tea she would also ask mr ralph newton sometimes he would come more frequently he would express his deep regret that a previous engagement prevented him from having the pleasure of accepting mrs brownlows kind invitation on all these occasions mrs brownlow invited sir thomasbut sir thomas never came it could hardly have been expected of him that he should do so bolsover house was the oldfashioned name of mrs brownlows residence and an invitation for tea had been sent for a certain tuesday in julytuesday july the 18th mrs brownlow had of course been informed of the arrival of mary bonnerwho was in truth as nearly related to her as the underwood girlsand the invitation was given with the express intention of doing honour to mary by the young ladies from popham villa the invitation was accepted as a matter of course  will he be there clary said to her sister  i hope not clarissa  why do you hope not we are not to quarrel are we patty  nowe need not quarrel but i am afraid of him he is not good enough clary for you to be unhappy about him and i feari fear he is  is what patty do speak it out there is nothing i hate so much as a mystery  i fear he is not genuinewhat people call honest he would say things without quite meaning what he says  i dont think it i am sure he is not like that i may have been a fool then she stopped herself remembering the whole scene on the lawn alasthere had been no misunderstanding him the crime had been forgiven but the crime had been a great fact since that she had seen him only once and then he had been so cold but yet as he left her he had not been quite cold surely that pressure of her hand had meant somethinghad meant something after that great crime but why did he not come to her or whywhich would have been so far far betterdid he not go to her papa and tell everything to him now however there was the chance that she would see him at bolsover house that mrs brownlow would ask him was quite a matter of course  the great event of the evening was to be the introduction of mrs brownlow to the new cousin they were to drink tea out in the oldfashioned garden behind the house from which mrs brownlow could retreat into her own room at the first touch of a breath of air the day was one of which the world at large would declare that there was no breath of air morning noon or night there was to be quite a party that was evident from the first to our young ladies who knew the ways of the house and who saw that the maids were very smart and that an extra young woman had been brought in but they were the first to comeas was proper  my dear mary said the old woman to her new guest i am glad to see you i knew your mother and loved her well i hope you will be happy my dear mrs brownlow was a very little old woman very pretty very grey very nicely dressed and just a little deaf mary bonner kissed her and murmured some word of thanks the old woman stood for a few seconds looking at the beautyastounded like the rest of the world somebody told me she was goodlooking mrs brownlow said to patiencebut i did not expect to see her like that  is she not lovely  she is a miracle my dear i hope she wont steal all the nice young men away from you and your sister eh yesyes what does mr newton say to her patience however knew that she need not answer all the questions which mrs brownlow asked and she left this question unanswered  two or three elderly ladies came in and four or five young ladies and an old gentleman who sat close to mrs brownlow and squeezed her hand very often and a middleaged gentleman who was exceedingly funny and two young gentlemen who carried the tea and cakes about but did not talk much such were the guests and the young ladies who no doubt were accustomed to mrs brownlows parties took it all as it was intended and were not discontented there was one young lady however who longed to ask a question but durst not had ralph newton promised that he would come clary was sitting between the old gentleman who seemed to be so fond of mrs brownlows hand and her cousin mary she said not a wordnor indeed was there much talking among the guests in general the merry middleaged gentleman did the talking combining with it a good deal of exhilarating laughter at his own wit the ladies sat round and sipped their tea and smiled that middleaged gentleman certainly earned his mild refreshmentfor the party without him must have been very dull then there came a breath of airor as mrs brownlow called it a keen north wind and the old lady retreated into the house dont let me take anybody else inonly i cant stand a wind like that the old gentleman accompanied her and then the elderly ladies the young ladies came next and the man of wit with the silent young gentlemen followed laden with scarfs parasols fans and stray teacups i dont think we used to have such cold winds in july said mrs brownlow the old gentleman pressed her hand once more and whispered into her ear that there had certainly been a great change  suddenly ralph newton was among them clarissa had not heard him announced and to her it seemed as though he had come down from the heavensas would have befitted his godship he was a great favourite with mrs brownlow who having heard that he was heir to a very large property thought that his extravagance became him according to her views it was his duty to spend a good deal of money and his duty also to marry clarissa underwood as he was as yet unmarried to any one else she hardly doubted that he would do his duty she was a sanguine old lady who always believed that things would go right she bustled and fussed on the present occasion with the very evident intention of getting a seat for him next to clarissa but clarissa was as active in avoiding such an arrangement and ralph soon found himself placed between mary bonner and a very deaf old lady who was always present at mrs brownlows teaparties i suppose this has all been got up in your honour he said to mary she smiled and shook her head oh but it has i know the dear old ladys ways so well she would never allow a new underwood to be at the villa for a month without having a teaparty to consecrate the event  isnt she charming mr newtonand so pretty  no end of charming and awfully pretty why are we all in here instead of out in the garden  mrs brownlow thought that it was cold  with the thermometer at 80° what do you think who ought to know what hot weather means are you chilly  not in the least we west indians never find this climate cold the first year next year i dont doubt that i shall be full of rheumatism all over and begging to be taken back to the islands  clarissa watched them from over the way as though every word spoken between them had been a treason to herself and yet she had almost been rude to old mrs brownlow in the manner in which she had placed herself on one side of the circle when the old lady had begged her to sit on the other certainly had she heard all that was said between her lover and her cousin there was nothing in the words to offend her she did not hear them but she could see that ralph looked into marys beautiful face and that mary smiled in a demure silent selfassured way which was already becoming odious to clarissa clarissa herself when ralph looked into her face would blush and turn away and feel herself unable to bear the gaze of the god  in a few minutes there came to be a sudden move and all the young people trooped back into the garden it was ralph newton who did it and nobody quite understood how it was done certainly my dears certainly said the old lady i dare say the moon is very beautiful yes i see mr ralph you are not going to take me out i can tell you the moon is all very well but i like to see it through the window dont mind me mr truepeny will stay with me mr truepeny who was turned eighty put out his hand and patted mrs brownlows arm and assured her that he wanted nothing better than to stay with her for ever the witty gentleman did not like the move because it had been brought about by a newcomer who had as it were taken the wind out of his sails he lingered awhile hoping to have weight enough to control the multitudein which he failed and at last made one of the followers and clarissa lingered also because ralph had been the first to stir ralph had gone out with mary bonner and therefore clarissa had held back so it came to pass that she found herself walking round the garden with the witty exhilarating middleaged gentlemanwhom for the present at least she most cordially hated i am not quite sure that our dear old friend isnt right said the witty man whose name was poojeana chair to sit down upon and a wall or two around one and a few little knicknacks aboutcarpets and tables and those sort of thingsare comfortable at times  i wonder you should leave them then said clarissa  can there be a wonder that i leave them with such temptation as this said the gallant poojean clarissa hated him worse than ever and would not look at him or even make the faintest sign that she heard him the voice of ralph newton through the trees struck her ears and yet the voice wasnt loudas it would not be if it were addressed with tenderness to mary and there was she bound by some indissoluble knot tomr poojean that mr newton is a friend of yours asked mr poojean  yesa friend of ours said clarissa  then i will express my intense admiration for his wit general character and personal appearance had he been a stranger to you i should of course have insinuated an opinion that he was a fool a coxcomb and the very plainest young man i had ever seen that is the way of the worldisnt it miss underwood  i dont know said clarissa  oh yesyou do thats the way we all go on as he is your friend i cant dare to begin to abuse him till after the third time round the garden  i beg then that there may be only two turns said clarissa but she did not know how to stop or to get rid of her abominable companion  if i mustnt abuse him after three turns he must be a favourite said the persevering poojean i suppose he is a favourite bythebye what a lovely girl that is with whom your favourite wasshall i say flirting  that lady is my cousin mr poojean  i didnt say that she was flirting mind i wouldnt hint such a thing of any young lady let her be anybodys cousin young ladies never flirt but young men do sometimesdont they after all it is the best fun goingisnt it  i dont know said clarissa by this time they had got round to the steps leading from the garden to the house i think ill go in mr poojean she did go in and mr poojean was left looking at the moon all alone as though he had separated himself from all mirth and society for that melancholy but pleasing occupation he stood there gazing upwards with his thumbs beneath his waistcoat grandis it not he said to the first couple that passed him  awfully grand and beautifully soft and all the rest of it said ralph as he went on with mary bonner by his side  that fellow has got no touch of poetry in him said poojean to himself in the meantime clarissa pausing a moment as she entered through the open window heard ralphs cheery voice how well she knew its tones and she still paused with ears erect striving to catch some word from her cousins mouth but marys words if they were words spoken by her were too low and soft to be caught ohif she should turn out to be sly clarissa said to herself was it true that ralph had been flirting with heras that odious man had said and why why why had ralph not come to her if he really loved her as he had twice told her that he did of course she had not thrown herself into his arms when old mrs brownlow made that foolish fuss but still he might have come to her he might have waited for her in the garden he might have saved her from the odious vulgarity of that abominable old wretch for in such language did clarissa describe to herself the exertions to amuse her which had been made by her late companion but had the sydney smith of the day been talking to her he would have been dull or the count dorsay of the day he would have been vulgar while the sound of ralph newtons voice as he walked with another girl was reaching her ears and then before she had seated herself in mrs brownlows drawingroom another idea had struck her could it be that ralph did not come to her because she had told him that she would never forgive him for that crime was it possible that his own shame was so great that he was afraid of her if so could she not let him know that he waswell forgiven poor clarissa in the meantime the voices still came to her from the garden and she still thought that she could distinguish ralphs low murmurings  it may be feared that ralph had no such deep sense of his fault as that suggested he did remember well enoughhad reflected more than once or twiceon those words which he had spoken to clary having spoken them he had felt his crime to be their not unnatural accompaniment at that moment when he was on the lawn at fulham he had thought that it would be very sweet to devote himself to dear clarythat clary was the best and prettiest girl he knew that in short it might be well for him to love her and cherish her and make her his wife had not patience come upon the scene and disturbed them he would probably then and there have offered to her his hand and heart but patience had come upon the scene and the offer had not been as he thought made since all that which had passed ages agoweeks and weeks agothere had fallen upon him the prosaic romance of polly neefit he had actually gone down to hendon to offer himself as a husband to the breechesmakers daughter it is true he had hitherto escaped in that quarter alsoor at any rate had not as yet committed himself but the train of incidents and thoughts which had induced him to think seriously of marrying polly had made him aware that he could not propose marriage to sir thomas underwoods daughter from such delight as that he found on calm reflection that he had debarred himself by the folly of his past life it was well that patience had come upon the scene  such being the state of affairs with him that little episode with clary being at an endor rather as he thought never having quite come to a beginningand his little arrangement as to polly neefit being in abeyance he was free to amuse himself with this newcomer miss bonner was certainly the most lovely girl he had ever seen he could imagine no beauty to exceed hers he knew well enough that her loveliness could be nothing to himbut a womans beauty is in one sense as free as the air in all christian countries it is a light shed for the delight not of one but of many there could be no reason why he should not be among the admirers of miss bonner i expect you know to be admitted quite on the terms of an old friend he said i shall call you mary and all that kind of thing  i dont see your claim said miss bonner  oh yes you doand must allow it i was almost a sort of son of sir thomasstill he turned me off when i came of age and patience and clarissa are just the same as sisters to me  you are not even a cousin mr newton  noim not a cousin its more like a fosterbrother you know of course i shant call you mary if you tell me not how is it to be  just for the present ill be miss bonner  for a week or so  say for a couple of years and then well see how it is  youll be some luckys fellows wife long before that do you like living at fulham  very much how should i not like it they are so kind to me and you know when i first resolved to come home i thought i should have to go out as a governessor perhaps as a nurserymaid if they didnt think me clever enough to teach i did not expect my uncle to be so good to me i had never seen him you know is it not odd that my uncle is so little at home  it is odd he is writing a book you see and he finds that the air of fulham doesnt suit his brains  oh mr newton  and he likes to be quite alone there isnt a better fellow going than your uncle i am sure i ought to say so but he isnt just what i should callsociable  i think him almost perfectionbut i do wish he was more at home for their sakes well go in now mr newton patience has gone in and i havent seen clarissa for ever so long  soon after this the guests began to go away mr truepeny gave mrs brownlows hand the last squeeze and mr poojean remarked that all terrestrial joys must have an end not but that such hours as these said he have about them a dash of the celestial which almost gives them a claim to eternity horrible fool said clarissa to her sister who was standing close to her  mrs brownlow would perhaps prefer going to bed said ralph then every one was gone except the underwoods and ralph newton the girls had on their hats and shawls and all was prepared for their departurebut there was some difficulty about the fly the fulham fly which had brought them and which always took them everywhere had hitherto omitted to return for them it was ordered for halfpast ten and now it was eleven are you sure he was told said clary patience had told him herselftwice then he must be tipsy again said clary mrs brownlow bade them to sit still and wait but when the fly did not arrive by halfpast eleven it was necessary that something should be done there were omnibuses on the road but they might probably be full it is only two mileslet us walk said clary and so it was decided  ralph insisted on walking with them till he should meet an omnibus or a cab to take him back to london patience did her best to save him from such labour protesting that they would want no such escort but he would not be gainsayed and would go with them at least a part of the way of course he did not leave them till they had reached the gate of popham villa but when they were starting there arose a difficulty as to the order in which they would marshal themselvesa difficulty as to which not a word could be spoken but which was not the less a difficulty clarissa hung back ralph had spoken hardly a word to her all the evening it had better continue so she was sure that he could not care for her but she thought that she would be better contented that he should walk with patience than with mary bonner but mary took the matter into her own hands and started off boldly with patience patience hardly approved but there would be nothing so bad as seeming to disapprove clarys heart was in her mouth as she found her arm within his he had contrived that it should be so and she could not refuse her mind was changed again now and once more she wished that she could let him know that the crime was forgiven  i am so glad to have a word with you at last he said how do you get on with the new cousin  very welland how have you got on with her  you must ask her that she is very beautifulwhat i call wonderfully beautiful  indeed she is said clary withdrawing almost altogether the weight of her hand from his arm  and clever toovery clever but  but what asked clary and the softest gentlest halfounce of pressure was restored  wellnothing i like her uncommonlybut is she not quitequitequite  she is quite everything that she ought to be ralph  im sure of thatan angel you know and all the rest of it but angels are cold you know i dont know that i ever admired a girl so much in my life the pressure was again lessenedall but annihilated but somehow i should never dream of falling in love with your cousin  perhaps you may do so without dreaming said clary as unconsciously she gave back the weight to her hand  noi know very well the sort of girl that makes me spoony this was not very encouraging to poor clary but still she presumed that he meant to imply that she herself was a girl of the sort that so acted upon him and the conversation went on in this way throughout the walk there was not much encouragement to her and certainly she did not say a word to him that could make him feel that she wanted encouragement but still he had been with her and she had been happy and when they parted at the gate and he again pressed her hand she thought that things had gone well he must know that i have forgiven him now she said to herself     chapter xiii  mr neefit is disturbed   on the morning following mrs brownlows little teaparty ralph newton was bound by appointment to call upon sir thomas but before he started on that duty a certain friend of his called upon him this friend was mr neefit but before the necessary account of mr neefits mission is given the reader must be made acquainted with a few circumstances as they had occurred at hendon  it will be remembered perhaps that on the sunday evening the two rivals left the cottage at the same moment one taking the road to the right and the other that to the leftso that bloodshed for that occasion at least was prevented neefit said his wife to him when they were alone together youll be getting yourself into trouble you be blowed said neefit he was very angry with his wife and was considering what steps he would take to maintain his proper marital and parental authority he was not going to give way to the weaker vessel in a matter of such paramount importance as to be made a fool of in his own family he was quite sure of this while the strength of the port wine still stood to him and though he was somewhat more troubled in spirit when his wife began to bully him on the next morning he still had valour enough to say that ontario moggs also might beblowed  on the monday when he returned home and asked for polly he found that polly was out walking mrs neefit did not at once tell him that moggs was walking with her but such was the fact just at five oclock moggs had presented himself at the cottageknowing very well sly dog that he was the breechesmakers hour of return which took place always precisely at four minutes past sixand boldly demanded an interview with polly i should like to hear what shes got to say to me said he looking boldly almost savagely into mrs neefits face according to that matrons ideas this was the proper way in which maidens should be wooed and won and though polly had at first declared that she had nothing at all to say to mr moggs she allowed herself at last to be led forth till they had passed the railway station on the road leading away from london ontario said not a word of his purpose polly feeling that silence was awkward and finding that she was being hurried along at a tremendous pace spoke of the weather and of the heat and expostulated it is hot very hot said ontario taking off his hat and wiping his browbut there are moments in a mans life when he cant go slow  then there are moments in his life when he must go on by himself said polly but her pluck was too good for her to desert him at such a moment and although he hardly moderated his pace till he had passed the railway station she kept by his side as things had gone so far it might be quite as well now that she should hear what he had to say a dim hazy idea had crossed the mind of moggs that it would be as well that he should get out into the country before he began his task and that the line of the railway which passed beneath the road about a quarter of a mile beyond mr neefits cottage might be considered as the boundary which divided the town from pastoral joys he waited therefore till the bridge was behind them till they had passed the station which was close to the bridgeand then he began polly said he you know what brings me here  polly did know very well but she was not bound to confess such knowledge youve brought me here mr moggs and thats all i know she said  yesive brought you here polly what took place last night made me very unhappyvery unhappy indeed  i cant help that mr moggs  not that i mean to blame you  blame me i should think not blame me indeed why are you to blame anybody because father chooses to ask whom he pleases to dinner a pretty thing indeed if father isnt to have whom he likes in his own house  polly you know what i mean  i know you made a great goose of yourself last night and i didnt feel a bit obliged to you  no i didnt i wasnt a goose at all i dont say but what im as big a fool as most men i dont mean to stick up for myself i know well enough that i am foolish often but i wasnt foolish last night what was he there for  what business have you to ask mr moggs  all the business in life lovereal love thats why i have business that young man who is i suppose what you call a swell  dont put words into my mouth mr moggs i dont call him anything of the kind  hes a gentleman  yeshe is a gentlemani suppose  and im a tradesmana bootmaker  so is father a tradesman and if you mean to tell me that i turn up my nose at people the same as father is you may just go back to london and think what you like about me i wont put up with it from you or anybody a tradesman to me is as good as anybodyif he is as good there  oh polly you do look so beautiful  bother  when you say that and speak in that way i think you as good as you are beautiful  rememberi dont say a word against what you callgentlemen i take em just as they come mr newton is a very nice young man  are you going to take him polly  how can i take him when he has never asked me you are not my father mr moggs not yet my uncle what right have you to question me if i was going to take him i shouldnt want your leave  polly you ought to be honest  i am honest  will you hear me polly  no i wont  you wont is that answer to go for always  yes it is you come and tease and say uncivil things and i dont choose to be bullied what right have you to talk to me about mr newton did i ever give you any right honest indeed what right have you to talk to me about being honest  its all true dear  very well then hold your tongue and dont say such things honest indeed if i were to take the young man tomorrow that would not make me dishonest  its all true dear and i beg your pardon if i have offended you i will beg your pardon  never mind about thatonly dont say foolish things  is it foolish polly to say that i love you and if i love you can i like to see a young fellow like mr newton hanging about after you he doesnt love you he cant love youas i do your father brings him here because he is a gentleman  i dont think anything of his being a gentleman  but think of me of course i was unhappy wretchedmiserable i knew why he was there you can understand polly that when a man really loves he must be the miserablest or the happiest of human beings  i dont understand anything about it  i wish you would let me teach you  i dont want to learn and i doubt whether youd make a good master i really must go back now mr moggs i came out because mother said id better i dont know that it could do any good if we were to walk on to edgeware and so saying polly turned back  he walked beside her half the way home in silence thinking that if he could only choose the proper words and the proper tone he might yet prevail but feeling that the proper words and the proper tone were altogether out of his reach on those favourite subjects the ballot or the power of strikes he could always find the proper words and the proper tone when he rose upon his legs at the cheshire cheeseand yet much as he loved the ballot he loved polly neefit infinitely more dearly when at the cheshire cheese he was a man but now walking with the girl of his heart he felt himself to be a bootmaker and the smell of the leather depressed him it was evident that she would walk the whole way home in silence if he would permit it the railway station was already again in sight when he stopped her on the pathway and made one more attempt you believe me when i say that i love you  i dont know mr moggs  oh polly you dont know  but it doesnt signifynot the least i aint bound to take a man because he loves me  you wont take mr newtonwill you  i dont know i wont say anything about it mr newton is nothing to you then there was a pause if you think mr moggs that you can recommend yourself to a young woman by such tantrums as there were going on last night you are very much mistaken thats not the way to win me  i wish i knew which was the way  mr newton never said a word  your father told him to take you out awalking before my very eyes was i to bear that think of it polly you maynt care for me and i dont suppose you do but you may understand what my feelings were what would you have thought of me if id stayed there smoking and borne it quietand you going about with that young man ill tell you what it is polly i couldnt bear it and i wont thereand now you know what i mean at this point in his speech he took off his hat and waved it in the air i wont bear it there are things a man cant bearcant bearcant bear oh polly if you could only be brought to understand what it is that i feel  after all he didnt do it so very badly there was just a tear in the corner of pollys eye though polly was very careful that he shouldnt see it and polly did know well enough that he was in earnestthat he was in fact true but then he was gawky and ungainly it was not that he was a shoemaker could he have had his own wits and danced like the gasfitter he might have won her still against ralph newton with all his blood and white hands but poor ontario was as regarded externals so ill a subject for a great passion  and where have you been polly said her father as soon as she entered the house  i have been walking with ontario moggs said polly boldly  what have you been saying to him i wont have you walk with ontario moggs i and your mother ll have to fall out if this kind of thing goes on  dont be silly father  what do you mean by that miss  it is silly why shouldnt i walk with him havent i known him all my life and walked with him scores of times isnt it silly father dont i know that if i told you i loved ontario moggs youd let me marry him tomorrow  hed have to take you in what you stand up in  he wouldnt desire anything better ill say that for him hes true and honest id love him if i couldonly somehow i dont  youve told him you didntonce and for all  i dont know about that father hell come again you may be sure hes one of that sort that isnt easily said nay to if you meanhave i said yesi havent ill never say yes to any man unless i love him when i do say it i shall mean itwhether its onty moggs or anybody else im not going to be given away you know like a birthday present out of a shop theres nobody can give me away fatheronly myself to all which utterances of a rebellious spirit the breechesmaker made no answer he knew that polly would at least be true to him and as she was as yet free the field was still open to his candidate he believed thoroughly that had not his wife interfered and asked the bootmaker to join that unfortunate dinner party his daughter and ralph newton would now have been engaged together and probably it might have been so when first it had been whispered to polly that that handsome and very agreeable young gentleman mr ralph newton might become a suitor for her hand she had chucked up her head and declared to her mother that she didnt intend to take a husband of her fathers choosing but as she came to know ralph a little she did find that he was goodlooking and agreeableand her heart did flutter at the idea of becoming the wife of a real undoubted gentleman she meant to have her grand passion and she must be quite sure that mr newton loved her but she didnt see any reason why mr newton shouldnt love her and upon the whole she was inclined to obey her father rather than to disobey him and it might still be that he should win herfor he had done nothing to disgrace himself in her sight but there did lurk within her bosom some dim idea that he should have bestirred himself more thoroughly on that sunday evening and not have allowed himself to be driven out of the field by ontario moggs she wronged him there as indeed he had had no alternative unless he had followed her up to her bedroom  mr neefit when he found that no harm had as yet been done resolved that he would return to the charge it has been before observed that he lacked something in delicacy but what he did so lack he made up in persistency he had been unable to impute any blame to ralph as to that evening he felt that he rather owed an apology to his favourite candidate he would make the apology and inform the favourite candidate at the same time that the course was still open to him with these views he left conduit street early on the wednesday morning and called on ralph at his rooms mr newton he said hastening at once upon the grand subject i hope you didnt think as i was to blame in having moggs at our little dinner on sunday ralph declared that he had never thought of imputing blame to any one but it wasas awkard as awkard could be it was my wifes doing of course you can see how it all is that chap has been hankering after polly ever since she was in her teens but lord love you captain he aint a chance with her he was there again o monday but the girl wouldnt have a word to say to him ralph sat silent and very grave he was taken now somewhat by surprise having felt up to this moment that he would at least have the advantage of a further interview with sir thomas before he need say another word to mr neefit what i want you to do captain is just to pop it straight off to my girl i know shed take you because of her way of looking not mind that she ever said so oh no but the way to find out is just to ask the question  you see mr neefit it wasnt very easy to ask it last sunday said ralph attempting to laugh  moggs has been at her again said neefit this argument was good had ralph been as anxious as moggs he would have made his opportunity  and to tell you the truth mr neefit  well sir  there is nothing so disagreeable as interfering in families i admire your daughter amazingly  shes a trump mr newton  she is indeedand i thoroughly appreciate the great generosity of your offer  ill be as good as my word mr newton the money shall be all theredown on the nail  but you see your wife is against me  blow my wife you dont think polly d do what her mother tells her whos got the moneybag thats the question you go down and pop it straight you aint afraid of an old woman i supposenor yet of a young un dont mind waiting for more dinners or anything of that kind they likes a man to be hot about itthats what they likes youre sure to find her any time before dinnerthats at one you know may be she maynt be figged out fine but you wont mind that ill go bail youll find the flesh and blood all right just you make your way in and say what youve got to say ill make it straight with the old woman afterwards  ralph newton had hitherto rather prided himself on his happy management of young ladies he was not ordinarily much afflicted by shyness and conceived himself able to declare a passion perhaps whether felt or feigned as well as another and now he was being taught how to go awooing by his breechesmaker he did not altogether like it and as at this moment his mind was rather set against the hendon matrimonial speculation he was disposed to resent it i think youre making a little mistake mr neefit he said  what mistake i dont know as im making any mistake youll be making a mistake and so youll find when the plums gone  its just this you know when you suggested this thing to me  wellyes i did suggest it and i aint ashamed of it  i was awfully grateful i had met your daughter once or twice and i told you i admired her ever so much  thats truebut you didnt admire her a bit more than what shes entitled to  im sure of that but then i thought i oughtjust toknow her a little better you see and then how could i presume to think shed take me till she knew me a little better  presume to think is that all you know about young women pop the question right out and give her a buss thats the way  newton paused a moment before he spoke and looked very grave i think youre driving me a little too fast mr neefit he said at last  the deuce i am driving you too fast what does that mean  there must be a little management and deliberation in these things if i were to do as you propose i should not recommend myself to your daughter and i should myself feel that at the most important crisis of my life i was allowing myself to be hurried beyond my judgment these words were spoken with a slow solemnity of demeanour and a tone of voice so serious that for a moment they perfectly awed the breechesmaker ralph was almost successful in reducing his proposed fatherinlaw to a state of absolute subjection mr neefit was all but induced to forget that he stood there with twenty thousand pounds in his pocket there came a drop or two of perspiration on his brow and his large saucer eyes almost quailed before those of his debtor but at last he rallied himselfthough not entirely he could not quite assume that selfassertion which he knew that his position would have warranted but he did keep his flag up after a fashion i dare say you know your own business best mr newtononly thems not my ideas thats all i come to you fair and honest and i repeats the same good morning mr newton so he went and nothing had been settled  to say that ralph had even yet made up his mind would be to give him praise which was not his due he was still doubting though in his doubts the idea of marrying polly neefit became more indistinct and less alluring than ever by this time he almost hated mr neefit and most unjustly regarded that man as a persecutor who was taking advantage of his pecuniary ascendancy to trample on him he thinks i must take his daughter because i owe him two or three hundred pounds such were ralph newtons thoughts about the breechesmakerwhich thoughts were very unjust neefit was certainly vulgar illiterate and indelicate but he was a man who could do a generous action and having offered his daughter to this young aristocrat would have scorned to trouble him afterwards about his little bill ralph sat trying to think for about an hour and then walked to southampton buildings he had not much hope as he went indeed hope hardly entered into his feelings sir thomas would of course say unpleasant words to him and of course he would be unable to answer them there was no ground for hoping anythingunless indeed he could make himself happy in a snug little box in a hunting country with polly neefit for his wife living on the interest of the breechesmakers money he was quite alive to the fact that in this position he would in truth be the most miserable dog in existencethat it would be infinitely better for him to turn his prospects into cash and buy sheep in australia or cattle in south america or to grow corn in canada any life would be better than one supported in comfortable idleness on mr neefits savings nevertheless he felt that that would most probably be his doom the sheep or the cattle or the corn required an amount of energy which he no longer possessed there were the four horses at the moonbeamand he could ride them to hounds as well as any man so much he could do and would seem in doing it to be full of life but as for selling the four horses and changing altogether the mode of his lifethat was more than he had vitality left to perform such was the measure which he took of himself and in taking it he despised himself thoroughlyknowing well how poor a creature he was  sir thomas told him readily what he had done giving him to read a copy of his letter to mr newton and mr newtons reply i can do nothing more said sir thomas i hope you have given up the sad notion of marrying that young woman ralph sat still and listened no good i think can come of that continued sir thomas if you are in truth compelled to part with your reversion to the newton estatewhich is in itself a property of great valuei do not doubt but your uncle will purchase it at its worth it is a thousand pities that prospects so noble should have been dissipated by early imprudence  thats quite true sir thomas said ralph in a loud ringing tone which seemed to imply that let things be as bad as they might he did not mean to make a poor mouth of them it was his mask for the occasion and it sufficed to hide his misery from sir thomas  if you think of selling what you have to sell continued sir thomas you had better take mr newtons letter and put it into the hands of your own attorney it will be ten times better than going to the moneylending companies for advances if i had the means of helping you myself i would do it  oh sir thomas  but i have not i should be robbing my own girls which i am sure you would not wish  that is quite out of the question sir thomas  if you do resolve on selling the estate you had better come to me as the thing goes on i cant do much but i may perhaps be able to see that nothing improper is proposed for you to do goodbye ralph anything will be better than marrying that whatdyecallems daughter  ralph as he walked westwards towards the club was by no means sure that sir thomas had been right in this by marrying polly he would after all keep the property  just by the lions in trafalgar square he met ontario moggs ontario moggs scowled at him and cut him dead     chapter xiv  the rev gregory newton   it was quite at the end of july in the very hottest days of a very hot summer that squire newton left newton priory for london intent upon law business and filled with ambition to purchase the right of leaving his own estate to any heir whom he might himself select he left his son alone at the priory but his son and the parson were sure to be together on such an occasion ralphthe country ralphdined at the rectory on the day that his father started and on every succeeding day gregory the parson dined up at the large house it was a thing altogether understood at the priory that the present parson gregory was altogether exempted from the anathema which had been pronounced against the heir and against the memory of the heirs father gregory simply filled the place which might have been his had there been no crushing entail and was moreover so sweet and gentlehearted a fellow that it was impossible not to love him he was a tall slender man somewhat narrowchested brighteyed with a kindlooking sweet mouth a small wellcut nose dark but not black hair and a dimple on his chin he always went with his hands in his pockets walking quick but shuffling sometimes in step as though with hesitation stooping somewhat absent occasionally going about with his chin stuck out before him as though he were seeking somethinghe knew not what a more generous fellow who delighted more in giving hesitated more in asking more averse to begging though a friend of beggars less selfarrogant or selfseeking or more devoted to his profession never lived he was a man with prejudiceskindly gentlemanlike amiable prejudices he thought that a clergyman should be a graduate from one of the three universitiesincluding trinity dublin and he thought also that a clergyman should be a gentleman he thought that dissenters werea great mistake he thought that convocation should be potential he thought that the church had certain powers and privileges which parliament could not take away except by spoliation he thought that a parson should always be welldressedaccording to his order he thought that the bishop of his diocese was the purest best and noblest peer in england he thought that newton churchyard was of all spots on earth the most lovely he thought very little of himself and he thought that of all the delights given by god for the delectation of his creatures the love of clarissa underwood would be the most delightful in all these thinkings he was astray carried away by prejudices which he was not strong enough to withstand but the joint effect of so many faults in judgment was not disagreeable and as one result of that effect gregory newton was loved and respected and believed in by all men and women poor and rich who lived within knowledge of his name his uncle gregory who was wont to be severe in his judgment on men would declare that the rev gregoryas he was calledwas perfect but then the squire was a man who was himself very much subject to prejudices  there was now and ever had been great freedom of discussion between ralph newton of the priory and his cousin gregoryif under the circumstances the two young men may be called cousinsrespecting the affairs of the property there was naturally much to check or to prevent such freedom their own interests in regard to the property were as far as they went adverse the young parson might possibly inherit the whole of the estate whereas he was aware that the present squire would move heaven and earth to leave it or a portion of it to his own son gregory had always taken his brothers part before the squire and the squire much as he liked the parson was never slow in abusing the parsons brother it would have been no more than natural had the question of the property been by tacit agreement always kept out of sight between the two young men but they had grown up from boyhood together as firm friends and there was no reticence between them on this allimportant subject the squires son had never known his mother and could therefore speak of his own position as would hardly have been possible to him had any memory of her form or person remained with him and then though their interests were opposite nothing that either could say would much affect those interests  the two men were sitting on the lawn at the priory after dinner smoking cigars and ralphthis other ralphhad just told the parson of his intention of joining his father in london i dont see that i can do any good said ralph but he wishes it and of course i shall go  you wont see my brother i suppose  i should think not you know what my fathers feelings are and i certainly shall not go out of my way to offend them i have no animosity against ralph but i could do no good by opposing my father  no said the parson not but what i wish it were otherwise it is a trouble to me that i cannot have ralph herethough perhaps he would not care to come  i feel it hard too that he should not be allowed to see a place which in a measure belongs to him i wish with all my heart that my father did not think so much about the estate much as i love the old place i can hardly think about it without bitterness had my father and your brother been on good terms together there would have been none of that nothing that he could dono success in his effortscan make me be as i should have been had i been born his heir it is a misfortune and of course one feels it but i think i should feel it less were he not so fixed in his purpose to undo what can never be undone  he will never succeed said gregory  probably notthough for that matter i suppose ralph will be driven to raise money on his inheritance  he will never sell the property  it seems that he does spend money faster than he can get it  he may have done so  is he not always in debt to you yourself is he not now thinking of marrying some tradesmans daughter to relieve him of his embarrassments we have to own i suppose that master ralph has made a mess of his money matters the parson who couldnt deny the fact hardly knew what to say on his brothers behalf i protest to you greg that if my father were to tell me that he had changed his mind and paid your brothers debts out of sheer kindness and uncleship and the rest of it i should be well pleased but he wont do that and it does seem to me probable that the estate will get into the hands of jews financiers and professional moneydealers unless my father can save it you wouldnt be glad to see some shopkeepers daughter calling herself mrs newton of newton  a shopkeepers daughter need not necessarily be aaa bad sort of woman said gregory  the chances are that a shopkeepers daughter will not be an educated lady come gregyou cannot say that it is the kind of way out of the mess you would approve  i am so sorry that there should be any mess at all  just so it is a pity that there should be any messis not it come old fellow drink your coffee and let us take a turn across the park i want to see what larkin is doing about those sheep i often feel that my coming into the world was a mess altogether though now that i am here i must make the best of it if i hadnt come my father would have married and had a score of children and master ralph would have been none the better for it  youll go and see the underwoods said the parson as they were walking across the park   illustration youll go and see the underwoods said the parson as they were walking across the park   if you wish it i will  i do wish it they know all the history as a matter of course it cannot be otherwise and they have so often heard me talk of you the girls are simply perfect i shall write to miss underwood and tell her that you will call i hope too that you will see sir thomas it would be so much better that he should know you  that same night gregory newton wrote the two following letters before he went to bedthe first written was to miss underwood and the second to his brother but we will place the latter first      newton 4th august 186     my dear ralph     no doubt you know by this time that my uncle gregory is    in london though you will probably not have seen him i    understand that he has come up with the express purpose    of making some settlement in regard to the property on    account of your embarrassments i need not tell you how    sorry i am that the state of your affairs should make this    necessary ralph goes up also tomorrowand though he    does not purpose to hunt you up i hope that you may meet    you know what i think of him and how much i wish that you    two could be friends he is as generous as the sun and    as just as he is generous every newton ought to make him    welcome as one of the family     as to money i do not know what may be the state of    your affairs i only hear from him what he hears from    his father sooner than that you should endanger your    inheritance here i will make any sacrificeif there be    anything that i can do you are welcome to sell my share    of the holborn property and you can pay me after my    uncles death i can get on very well with my living    as it is not probable that i shall marry at any rate    understand that i should infinitely prefer to lose every    shilling of the london property to hearing that you had    imperilled your position here at newton i do not suppose    that what i have can go farbut as far as it will go it    is at your service you can show this letter to sir thomas    if you think fit     i could say ever so much more only that you will know    it all without my saying it and i cannot bear that you    should think that i would preach sermons to you never    mind what i said before about the money that i wanted    then i can do without it now my uncle will pay for the    entire repair of the chancel out of his own pocket ever    so much must be left undone till more money comes in    money does come in from this quarter or from that by    gods help as for the church rates of course i regret    them but we have to take things in a lump and it is    certainly the fact that we spend ten times as much on the    churches as was spent fifty years ago     your most affectionate brother     gregory newton   the other letter was much shorter and was addressed to patience underwood      newton peele parsonage 4th august 186     my dear miss underwood     my cousin mr ralph newton of whom you have heard me    speak so often is going up to london and i have asked    him to call at popham villa because i am desirous that so    very dear a friend of mine should know other friends whom    i love so dearly i am sure you will receive him kindly    for my sake and that you will like him for his own there    are reasons why i wish that your father should know him     give my most affectionate love to your sister i can send    her no other message and i do not think she will be angry    with me for sending that it cannot hurt her and she and    you at least know how honest and how true it is distance    and time make no difference it is as though i were on the    lawn with her now     most sincerely yours     gregory newton   when he had written this in the little bookroom of his parsonage he opened the window and crossing the garden seated himself on a low brick wall which divided his small domain from the churchyard the night was bright with stars but there was no moon in the heavens and the gloom of the old ivycoloured church tower was complete but all the outlines of the place were so well known to him that he could trace them all in the dim light after a while he got down among the graves and with slow steps walked round and round the precincts of his church here at least in this spot close to the house of god which was his own church within this hallowed enclosure which was his own freehold in a peculiar manner he could after a fashion be happy in spite of the misfortunes of himself and his family his lines had been laid for him in very pleasant places according to his ideas there was no position among the children of men more blessed more diversified more useful more noble than that which had been awarded to himif only by gods help he could perform with adequate zeal and ability the high duties which had been entrusted to him things outside were darkat least so said the squires and parsons around him with whom he was wont to associate his uncle gregory was sure that all things were going to the dogs since a socalled tory leader had become an advocate for household suffrage and real tory gentlemen had condescended to follow him but to our parson it had always seemed that there was still a fresh running stream of water for him who would care to drink from a fresh stream he heard much of unbelief and of the professors of unbelief both within and without the great churchbut in that little church with which he was personally concerned there were more worshippers now than there had ever been before and he heard too how certain wellesteemed preachers and prophets of the day talked loudly of the sins of the people and foretold destruction such as was the destruction of gomorrahbut to him it seemed that the people of his village were more honest less given to drink and certainly better educated than their fathers in all which thoughts he found matter for hope and encouragement in his daily life and he set himself to work diligently placing all this as a balance against his private sorrows so that he might teach himself to take that world of which he himself was the centre as one wholeand so to walk on rejoicing  the one great sorrow of his life the thorn in the flesh which was always festering the wound which would not be cured the grief for which there was no remedy was his love for clarissa underwood he had asked her thrice to be his wifewith very little interval indeed between the separate prayersand had been so answered that he entertained no hope had there been any faintest expectation in his mind that clarissa would at last become his wife he would have been deterred by a sense of duty from making to his brother that generous offer of all the property he owned but he had no such hope clarissa had given thrice that answer which of all answers is the most grievous to the truehearted lover she felt for him unbounded esteem and would always regard him as a friend a short decided negative or a doubtful no or even an indignant repulse may be changedmay give way to second convictions or to better acquaintance or to altered circumstances or even simply to perseverance but an assurance of esteem and friendship means and only can mean that the lady regards her lover as she might do some old uncle or patriarchal family connection whom after a fashion she loves but who can never be to her the one creature to be worshipped above all others  such were gregory newtons ideas as to his own chance of success and so believing he had resolved that he would never press his suit again he endeavoured to conquer his lovebut that he found to be impossible he thought that it was so impossible that he had determined to give up the endeavour though he would have advised others that by gods mercy all sorrows in this world could be cured he told himselfwithout arraigning gods mercythat for him this sorrow could not be cured he did not scruple therefore to assure his brother that he would not marrynor did he hesitate in writing to patience underwood to assure her that his love for her sister was unchangeable in saying so he urged no suitbut it was impossible that he should write to the house without some message and none other from him to her could be a true message it could not hurt her it would not even give her the trouble to think whether she had decided well he quite understood the nature of the love he wanteda love that would have felt it to be all happiness to lean upon his bosom without this love he would not have wished to take herand with such love as that he knew he could not fill her heart therefore it was that he would satisfy himself with walking round the churchyard of newton peele and telling himself that the pleasure of this world was best to be found in the pursuit of the joys of the next     chapter xv  clarissa waits   when patience and clarissa had got to their own room on the night on which they had walked back from mrs brownlows house to popham villaduring all which long walk clarissas hand had lain gently upon ralph newtons armthe elder sister looked painfully and anxiously into the youngers face in order that if it were possible she might learn without direct enquiry what had been said during that hour of close communion had ralph meant to speak there could have been no time more appropriate and patience hardly knew what she herself wishedexcept that she wished that her sister might have everything that was good and joyous and prosperous there was never a look of pain came across clarys face but patience suffered some touch of inner agony this feeling was so strong that she sympathised even with clarys follies and with clarys faults she almost knew that it would not be well that ralph newton should be encouraged as a loverbrilliant as were his future prospects and dear as he was personally to them all he was a spendthrift and it might be that his fine prospects would all be wasted before they were matured and then their father would so probably disapprove and then again it was so wrong that clarys peace should have been disturbed and yet no word said to their father there was much that was wrongbut still so absolute was her clinging love for clary that she longed above all things that clary should be made happy when ralphs brother had declared himself as a suitorwhich he had done boldly to sir thomas after but a short intimacy with the familypatience had given him all her sympathy sir thomas having looked at his circumstances had made him welcome to the house and to his daughters handif he could win her heart the stage had been open to him and patience had been his most eager friend but all that had passed awayand clary had been obstinate patty she had said with some little arrogance he has made a mistake he should have fallen in love with you clergymen are as fond of pretty girls as other men patty had said with a smile and isnt my patty as pretty and as delicate as a primrose clary had said embracing her sister pretty patience underwood was notbut for delicacythat with which patience underwood was gifted transcended poor clarissas powers of comparison so it was between them and now there was this acknowledged passion for the spendthrift  patience could see that her sister was not unhappy when she came in from her walkwas not moodywas not heartbroken and yet it had seemed to her before the walk began while they were sauntering about mrs brownlows garden that ralph had devoted himself entirely to the new cousin and that clarissa had been miserable surely if he had spoken during the walkif he had renewed his protestations of love if he were now regarded by clary as her accepted lover clary would not keep all this as a secret it could not be that clary should have surrendered herself to a lover and that their father was to be allowed to remain in ignorance that it was so and yet how could it be otherwise if clary was happy nowclary who had acknowledged that she loved this man and had now been leaning on his arm for an hour beneath the moonlight but patience said not a word she could not bring herself to speak when speech might pain her sister  when they had been some half hour in bed there stole a whisper across the darkness of the chamber from one couch to the other patty are you asleep patience declared that she was wide awake then ill come to youand clarys naked feet pattered across the room ive just something to say and ill say it better here patience made glad way for the intruder and knew that now she would hear it all patty it is better to wait  what do you mean dear  i mean this i think he does like me im almost sure he does  he said nothing tonight  he said a great dealof course but nothing about thatnothing about that exactly  oh clary im afraid of him  what is the good of fear the evil is dear i think he likes me but it may so well be that he cannot speak out he is in debt and all thatand he must wait  but that is so terrible what will you do  i will wait too i have thought about it and have determined whats the good of loving a man if one wont go through something for him i do love himwith all my heart i pray god i may never have a husband if i cannot be his wife patience shuddered in her sisters embrace as these bold words were spoken with energy i tell you patty just as i tell myself because you love me so dearly  i do love youoh i do love you  i do not think it can be unmaidenly to tell the truth to you and to myself how can i help telling it to myself there it is i feel that i could kiss the very ground on which he stands he is my hero my paladin my heart my soul i have given myself to him for everything how can i help myself  but claryyou should repress this not encourage it  it wont be repressednot in my own heart but i will never never never let him know that it has been sotill he is all my own there may be a day whenohi shall tell him everything how wretched i was when he did not speak to mehow brokenhearted when i heard his voice with mary how fluttered and halfhappy and halfwretched when i found that i was to have that long walk with himand then how i determined to wait i will tell him allperhapssome day goodnight dear dear patty i could not sleep without letting you know everything then she sprang out from her sisters arms and pattered back across the room to her own bed in two minutes clarissa was asleep but patience lay long awake and before she slept her pillow was damp with her tears  in the course of the following week ralph was again at the villa sir thomas as a matter of course was away but the three girls were at home and as it happened miss spooner had also come over to take her tea with her friends the hour that he spent there was passed half indoors and half out and certainly ralphs attentions were chiefly paid to miss bonner miss bonner herself however was so discreet in her demeanour that no one could have suggested that any approach had been made to flirtation to tell the truth mary who had received no confidence from her cousinand who was a girl slow to excite or give a confidencehad seen some sign or heard some word which had created on her mind a suspicion of the truth it was not that she thought that clarys heart was irrecoverably given to the young man but that there seemed to be just something with which it might be as well that she herself should not interfere she was there on sufferancedependent on her uncles charity for her daily bread let her uncle say what he might to the contrary as yet she hardly knew her cousins and was quite sure that she was not known by them she heard that ralph newton was a man of fashion and the heir to a large fortune she knew herself to be utterly destitutebut she knew herself to be possessed of great beauty in her bosom doubtless there was an ambition to win by her beauty from some man whom she could love those good things of which she was so destitute she did not lack ambition and had her high hopes grounded on the knowledge of her own charms her beauty and a certain sufficiency of intellectof the extent of which she was in a remarkable degree herself awarewere the gifts with which she had been endowed but she knew when she might use them honestly and when she ought to refrain from using them ralph had looked at her as men do look who wish to be allowed to love all this to her was much more clearly intelligible than to clarissa who was two years her senior though she had seen ralph but thrice she already felt that she might have him on his knees before her if she cared so to place him but there was that suspicion of something which had gone before and a feeling that honour and gratitudeperhaps also selfinterestcalled upon her to be cold in her manner to ralph newton she had purposely avoided his companionship in their walk home from mrs brownlows house and now as they wandered about the lawn and shrubberies of popham villa she took care not to be with him out of earshot of the others in all of which there was ten times more of womanly clevernessor cunning shall we saythan had yet come to the possession of clarissa underwood  cunning she wasbut she did not deserve that the objectionable epithet should be applied to her the circumstances of her life had made her cunning she had been the mistress of her fathers house since her fifteenth year and for two years of her life had had a succession of admirers at her feet her father had eaten and drunk and laughed and had joked with his childs lovers about his child it had been through no merit of his that she had held her own among them all without soiling either her name or her inner self captains in west indian regiments and lieutenants from queens ships lying at spanish point had been her admirers proposals to marry are as ready on the tongues of such men out in the tropics as offers to hand a shawl or carry a parasol they are softhearted bold to face the world and very confident in circumstances then too they are ignorant of any other way to progress with a flirtation which is allengrossing in warm latitudes it is so natural to make an offer after the fifth dance it is the way of the people in those latitudes and seems to lead to no harm men and women do marry on small incomes but they do not starve and the world goes on wagging mary bonner however whose fathers rank had at least been higher than that of her adorers and who knew that great gifts had been given to her had held herself aloof from all this and had early resolved to bide her time she was still biding her timewith patience sufficient to enable her to resist the glances of ralph newton  clarissa underwood behaved very well on this evening she gave a merry glance at her sister and devoted herself to miss spooner mary was so wise and so prudent that there was no cause for any great agony as far as clary could see ralph had quite as much to say to patience as to mary for herself she had resolved that she would wait her manner to him was very prettyalmost the manner of a sister to a brother and then she stayed resolutely with miss spooner while ralph was certainly tempting mary down by the riverside it did not last long he was soon gone and miss spooner had soon followed him  he is very amusing mary said as soon as they were alone  very amusing said patience  and uncommonly goodlooking isnt he considered a very handsome man here  yesi suppose he is said patience i dont know that i ever thought much about that  of course he is said clarissa nobody can doubt about it there are some people as to whom it is as absurd not to admit that they are handsome as it would be to say that a fine picture is not beautiful ralph is one such personand of course i know another  mary would not seem to take the allusion even by a smile i always thought gregory much nicer looking said patience  that must be because you are in love with him said clarissa  there is a speaking brightness an eloquence in his eyes and a softness of feeling in the expression of his face which is above all beauty continued patience with energy  heres poetry said clarissa eloquence and softness and eyes and feeling and expressive and speaking brightness youd better say at once that hes a god  i wish i knew him said mary bonner  youll know him before long i dont doubt and when you do youll know one of the best fellows in the world ill admit as much as that but i will not admit that he can be compared to his brother in regard to good looks in all which poor clarissa who had nothing to console her but her resolve to wait with courage bore herself well and gallantly  soon after this there arrived at popham villa the note from gregory newton as it happened sir thomas was at home on that morning and heard the tidings if young mr newton does come get him to dine and i will take care to be at home said sir thomas patience suggested that ralphtheir own ralphshould be asked to meet him but to this sir thomas would not accede it is not our business to make up a family quarrel he said i have had old mr newton with me once or twice lately and i find that the quarrel still exists as strong as ever i asked him to dine here but he refused his son chooses to come i shall be glad to see him  gregorys letter had not been shown to sir thomas but it was of course shown to clarissa how could i help it said she from which it may be presumed that patience had looked as though gregory had been hardly treated one doesnt know how it is or why it comes or what it isor why it doesnt come i couldnt have taken gregory newton for my husband  and yet he had all things to recommend him  i wish he had asked you patty  dont say that dear because there is in it something that annoys me i dont think of myself in such matters but i do hope to see you the happy wife of some happy man  i hope you will with all my heart said clary standing upof one man of one special dearest best and brightest of all men oh dear and yet i know it will never be and i wonder at myself that i have been bold enough to tell you and patience also wondered at her sisters boldness  ralph newtonralph from the priorydid come down to the villa and did accept the invitation to dinner which was given to him the event was so important that patience found it necessary to go up to london to tell her father mary went with her desirous to see something of the mysteries of southampton buildings while clarissa remained at homewaiting after the usual skirmishes with stemm who began by swearing that his master was not at home they made their way into sir thomass library dear dear dear this is a very awkward place to bring your cousin to he said frowning mary would have retreated at once had it not been that patience held her ground so boldly why shouldnt she come papa and i had to see you mr newton is to dine with us tomorrow tomorrow was a saturday and sir thomas became seriously displeased why had a saturday been chosen saturday was the most awkward day in the world for the giving and receiving of dinners it was in vain that patience explained to him that saturday was the only day on which mr newton could come that sir thomas had given his express authority for the dinner and that no bar had been raised against saturday you ought to have known said sir thomas nevertheless he allowed them to leave the chamber with the understanding that he would preside at his own table on the following day why is it that saturday is so distasteful to him mary asked as they walked across lincolns inn fields together  patience was silent for awhile not knowing how to answer the question or how to leave it unanswered but at last she preferred to make some reply he does not like going to our church i think  but you like it  yesand i wish papa did but he doesnt then there was a pause of course it must strike you as very odd the way in which we live  i hope it is not i who drive my uncle away  not in the least mary since mammas death he has fallen into this habit and he has got so to love solitude that he is never happy but when alone we ought to be grateful to him because it shows that he trusts usbut it would be much nicer if he would come home  he is so different from my father  he was always with you  wellyes that is i could be always with himalmost always he was so fond of society that he would never be alone we had a great rambling house always full of people if he could see people pleasant and laughing that was all that he wanted it is hard to say what is best  papa is as good to us as ever he can be  so was my papa good to mein his way but oh dear the people that used to come there poor papa he used to say that hospitality was his chief duty i sometimes used to think that the world would be much pleasanter and better if there was no such thing as hospitalityif people always eat and drank alone and lived as uncle does in his chambers there would not be so much money wasted at any rate  papa never wastes any money said patiencethough there never was a more generous man  ralph newtonralph of the priorycame to dinner and miss spooner was asked to meet him it might have been supposed that a party so composed would not have been very bright but the party at the villa went off very satisfactorily ralph made himself popular with everybody he became very popular with sir thomas by the frank and easy way in which he spoke of the family difficulties at newton i wish my namesake knew my father he said when he was alone with the lawyer after dinner he never spoke of either of these newtons as his cousins though to gregory whom he knew well and loved dearly he would declare that from him he felt entitled to exact all the dues of cousinship  it would be desirable said sir thomas  i never give it up you know my father i dare say he thought his brother interfered with him and i suppose he did but a more affectionate or generous man never lived he is quite as fond of gregory as he is of me and would do anything on earth that gregory told him he is rebuilding the chancel of the church just because gregory wishes it some day i hope they may be reconciled  it is hard to get over money difficulties said sir thomas  i dont see why there should be money difficulties said ralph as far as i am concerned there need be none  ralph newton has made money difficulties said sir thomas if he had been careful with his own fortune there would have been no question as to the property between him and your father  i can understand thatand i can understand also my fathers anxiety though i do not share it it would be better that my namesake should have the estate i can see into these matters quite well enough to know that were it to be mine there would occur exactly that which my father wishes to avoid i should be the owner of newton priory and people would call me mr newton but i shouldnt be newton of newton it had better go to ralph i should live elsewhere and people would not notice me then  sir thomas as he looked up at the young man leaning back in his armchair and holding his glass half full of wine in his hand could not but tell himself that the greater was the pity this offshoot of the newton stock who declared of himself that he never could be newton of newton was a fine manly fellow to look atnot handsome as was ralph the heir not marked by that singular mixture of gentleness intelligence and sweetness which was written not only on the countenance but in the demeanour and very step of gregory but he was a bigger man than either of them with a broad chest and a square brow and was not without that bright gleam of the newton blue eye which characterised all the family and there was so much of the man in himwhereas in manhood ralph the heir had certainly been deficient ralph must lie on the bed that he has made said sir thomas and you of course will accept the good things that come in your way as far as i can see at present it will be best for ralph that your father should redeem from him a portion at least of the property the girls are waiting for us to go out and perhaps you will like a cigar on the lawn  it was clear to every one there to see that this other newton greatly admired the west indian cousin and mary with this newcomer seemed to talk on easier terms than she had ever done before since she had been at fulham she smiled and listened and was gracious and made those pleasant little halfaffected sallies which girls do make to men when they know that they are admired and are satisfied that it should be so all the story had been told to her and it might be that the poor orphan felt that she was better fitted to associate with the almost nameless one than with the true heir of the family mr newton when he got up to leave them asked permission to come again and left them all with a pleasant air of intimacy two boats had passed them racing on the river almost close to the edge of their lawn and newton had offered to bet with mary as to which would first reach the bridge i wish you had taken my wager miss bonner he said because then i should have been bound to come back at once to pay you thats all very well mr newton said mary but i have heard of gentlemen who are never seen again when they lose mr newton is unlike that im sure said clary but i hope hell come again at any rate newton promised that he would and was fully determined to keep his promise when he made it  wouldnt it be delightful if they were to fall in love with each other and make a match of it said clary to her sister  i dont like to plot and plan such things said patience  i dont like to scheme but i dont see any harm in planning he is ever so niceisnt he  i thought him very pleasant  such an openspoken manly free sort of fellow and hell be very well off you know  i dont knowbut i dare say he will said patience  oh yes you do poor ralph our ralph is a spendthrift and i shouldnt wonder if this one were to have the property after all and then his father is very rich i know that because gregory told me dear me wouldnt it be odd if we were all three to become mrs newtons  clary what did i tell you  well i wont but it would be oddand so nice at least i think so welli dare say i ought not to say it but then i cant help thinking itand surely i may tell you what i think  i would think it as little as i could dear  ah thats very well a girl can be a hypocrite if she pleases and perhaps she ought of course i shall be a hypocrite to all the world except you i tell you what it is pattyyou make me tell you everything and say that of course you and i are to tell everythingand then you scold me dont you want me to tell you everything  indeed i doand i wont scold you dear clary do i scold you wouldnt i give one of my eyes to make you happy  thats quite a different thing said clarissa  three days afterwards mr ralph newtonit is hoped that the reader may understand the attempts which are made to designate the two young menmr ralph newton appeared again at popham villa he came in almost with the gait of an old friend and brought some fern leaves which he had already procured from hampshire in compliance with a promise which he had made to patience underwood thats what we call the harts tongue said he though i fancy they give them all different names in different places  its the same plant as ours mr newtononly yours is larger  its the ugliest of all the ferns said clary  even thats a compliment said newton its no use transplanting them in this weather but ill send you a basket in october you should come down to newton and see our ferns we think were very pretty but because were so near nobody comes to see us then he fell atalking with mary bonner and stayed at the villa nearly all the afternoon for a moment or two he was alone with clarissa and at once expressed his admiration i dont think i ever saw such perfect beauty as your cousins he said  she is handsome  and then she is so fair whereas everybody expects to see dark eyes and black hair come from the west indies  but mary wasnt born there  that doesnt matter the mind doesnt travel back as far as that a negro should be black and an american thin and a french woman should have her hair dragged up by the roots and a german should be broadfaced and a scotchman redhairedand a west indian beauty should be dark and languishing  ill tell her you say so and perhaps shell have herself altered  whatever you do dont let her be altered said mr newton she cant be changed for the better  i am quite sure he is over head and ears in love said clarissa to patience that evening     chapter xvi  the cheshire cheese   labour is the salt of the earth and capital is the sworn foe to labour hear hear hear with the clattering of many glasses and the smashing of certain pipes then the orator went on that labour should be the salt of the earth has been the purpose of a beneficent creatorthat capital should be the foe to labour has been mans handywork the one is an eternal decree which nothing can changewhich neither the good nor the evil done by man can affect the other is an evil ordinance the fruit of mans ignorance and within the scope of mans intellect to annul mr ontario moggs was the orator and he was at this moment addressing a crowd of sympathising friends in the large front parlour of the cheshire cheese of all those who were listening to ontario moggs there was not probably one who had reached a higher grade in commerce than that of an artizan working for weekly wagesbut mr moggs was especially endeared to them because he was not an artizan working for weekly wages but himself a capitalist his father was a master bootmaker on a great scalefor none stood much higher in the westend trade than booby and moggs and it was known that ontario was the only child and heir and as it were sole owner of the shoulders on which must some day devolve the mantle of booby and moggs booby had long been gathered to his fathers and old moggs was the stern opponent of strikes what he had lost by absolutely refusing to yield a point during the last strike among the shoemakers of london no one could tell he had professed aloud that he would sooner be ruined sooner give up his country residence at shepherds bush sooner pull down the honoured names of booby and moggs from over the shopwindow in old bond street than allow himself to be driven half an inch out of his course by men who were attempting to dictate to him what he should do with his own in these days of strikes moggs would look even upon his own workmen with the eyes of a coriolanus glaring upon the disaffected populace of rome mr moggs senior would stand at his shopdoor with his hand within his waistcoat watching the men out on strike who were picketing the streets round his shop and would feel himself every inch a patrician ready to die for his order such was moggs senior and moggs junior who was a child of capital but whose heirship depended entirely on his fathers will harangued his fathers workmen and other workmen at the cheshire cheese telling them that labour was the salt of the earth and that capital was the foe to labour of course they loved him the demagogue who is of all demagogues the most popular is the demagogue who is a demagogue in opposition to his apparent nature the radical earl the freethinking parson the squire who wont preserve the tenant who defies his landlord the capitalist with a theory for dividing profits the moggs who loves a strikethese are the men whom the working men delight to follow ontario moggs who was at any rate honest in his philanthropy and who did in truth believe that it was better that twenty real bootmakers should eat beef daily than that one socalled bootmaker should live in a country residencewho believed this and acted on his belief though he was himself not of the twenty but rather the one socalled bootmaker who would suffer by the propagation of such a creedwas beloved and almost worshipped by the denizens of the cheshire cheese how far the real philanthropy of the man may have been marred by an uneasy and fatuous ambition how far he was carried away by a feeling that it was better to make speeches at the cheshire cheese than to apply for payment of money due to his father it would be very hard for us to decide that there was an alloy even in ontario moggs is probablebut of this alloy his hearers knew nothing to them he was a perfect specimen of that combination which is so grateful to them of the rich mans position with the poor mans sympathies therefore they clattered their glasses and broke their pipes and swore that the words he uttered were the kind of stuff they wanted  the battle has been fought since man first crawled upon the earth continued moggs stretching himself to his full height and pointing to the farthest confines of the inhabited globesince man first crawled upon the earth there was a sound in that word crawl typical of the abject humility to which working shoemakers were subjected by their employers which specially aroused the feelings of the meeting and whence comes the battle the orator paused and the glasses were jammed upon the table yeswhence comes the battle in fighting which hecatombs of honest labourers have been crushed till the sides of the mountains are white with their bones and the rivers run foul with their blood from the desire of one man to eat the bread of two thats it said a lean wizened palefaced little man in a corner whose trembling hand was resting on a beaker of gin and water yes and to wear two mens coats and trousers and to take two mens bedses and the wery witals out of two mens bodies d them ontario who understood something of his trade as an orator stood with his hand still stretched out waiting till this ebullition should be over no my friend said he we will not damn them i for one will damn no man i will simply rebel of all the sacraments given to us the sacrament of rebellion is the most holy hereupon the landlord of the cheshire cheese must have feared for his tables so great was the applause and so tremendous the thumpingbut he knew his business no doubt and omitted to interfere of rebellion my friends continued ontario with his right hand now gracefully laid across his breast there are two kindsor perhaps we may say three there is the rebellion of arms which can avail us nothing here perhaps it might tho said the little wizened man in a corner whose gin and water apparently did not comfort him to this interruption ontario paid no attention and there is the dignified and slow rebellion of moral resistancetoo slow i fear for us this point was lost upon the audience and though the speaker paused no loud cheer was given its as true as true said one man but he was a vain fellow simply desirous of appearing wiser than his comrades and then there is the rebellion of the strike now the clamour of mens voices and the kicking of mens feet and the thumping with mens fists became more frantic than everthe legitimate rebellion of labour against its tyrant gentlemen of all efforts this is the most noble it is a sacrifice of self a martyrdom a giving up on the part of him who strikes of himself his little ones and his wife for the sake of others who can only thus be rescued from the grasp of tyranny gentlemen were it not for strikes this would be a country in which no free man could live by the aid of strikes we will make it the paradise of the labourer an elysium of industry an eden of artizans there was much more of itbut the reader might be fatigued were the full flood of mr moggss oratory to be let loose upon him and through it all there was a germ of truth and a strong dash of true noble feelingbut the speaker had omitted as yet to learn how much thought must be given to a germ of truth before it can be made to produce fruit for the multitude and then in speaking grand words come so easily while thoughtseven little thoughtsflow so slowly   illustration the battle has been fought since man first crawled upon the earth continued moggs stretching himself to his full height and pointing to the farthest confines of the inhabited globe      but the speech such as it was sufficed amply for the immediate wants of the denizens of the cheshire cheese there were men there who for the halfhour believed that ontario moggs had been born to settle all the difficulties between labourers and their employers and that he would do so in such a way that the labourers at least should have all that they wanted it would be perhaps too much to say that any man thought this would come in his own daythat he so believed as to put a personal trust in his own belief but they did think for a while that the good time was coming and that ontario moggs would make it come well have im in parlament any ways said a sturdy short dirtylooking artizan who shook his head as he spoke to show that on that matter his mind was quite made up i dunno no good as is to cum of sending sich as him to parlament said another parlament aint the place when it comes to the pint they wont ave em there was odgers and mr beale i dont blieve in parlament no more kennington ovals about the place said a third or primrose ill said a fourth hyde park screamed the little wizen man with the gin and water thats the ticketand down with them gold railings well let em see nevertheless they all went away home in the quietest way in the world andas there was no strike in handgot to their work punctually on the next morning of all those who had been loudest at the cheshire cheese there was not one who was not faithful and in a certain way loyal to his employer  as soon as his speech was over and he was able to extricate himself from the crowd ontario moggs escaped from the publichouse and strutted off through certain narrow dark streets in the neighbourhood leaning on the arm of a faithful friend mr moggs you did pitch it rayther strong tonight said the faithful friend  pitch it rather strongyes what good do you think can ever come from pitching any thing weak pitch it as strong as you will find it dont amount to much  but about rebellion now mr moggs rebellion aint a good thing surely mr moggs  isnt it what was washington what was cromwell what was rienzi what waswas but never mind said ontario who could not at the moment think of the name of his favourite pole  and you think as the men should be rebels again the masters  that depends on who the masters are waddle  what good d cum of it if i rebelled again mr neefit and told him up to his face as i wouldnt make up the books hed only sack me i find thirtyfive bob a week with two kids and their mother to keep on it tight enough mr moggs if i ad the fixing on it i should say forty bob wasnt over the marki should indeed but i dont see as i should get it  yes you wouldif you earned it and stuck to your purpose but youre a single stick and it requires a faggot to do this work  i never could see it mr moggs all the same i do like to hear you talk it stirs one up even though one dont just go along with it you wont let on you know to mr neefit as i was there  and why not said ontario turning sharp upon his companion  the old genleman hates the very name of a strike hes amost as bad as your own father mr moggs  you have done his work today you have earned your bread you owe him nothing  that i dont mr moggs hell take care of that  and yet you are to stay away from this place or go to that to suit his pleasure are you neefits slave  im just the young man in his shopthats all  as long as that is all waddle you are not worthy to be called a man  mr moggs youre too hard as for being a man i am a man ive a wife and two kids i dont think more of my governor than anotherbut if he sacked me where d i get thirtyfive bob aweek  i beg your pardon waddleits true i should not have said it perhaps you do not quite understand me but your position is one of a single stick rather than of the faggot ah me she hasnt been at the shop lately  she do come sometimes she was there the day before yesterday  and alone  she come alone and she went home with the governor  and he  mr newton you mean  has he been there  wellyes he was there once last week  well  there was wordsthats what there was it aint going smooth and he aint been out there no morenot as i knows on i did say a word once or twice as to the precious long figure as he stands for on our books over two hundred for breeches is something quite stupendous isnt it mr moggs  and what did neefit say  just snarled at me he can show his teeth you know and look as bitter as you like it aint off because when i just named the very heavy figure in such a business as ourshe only snarled but it aint on mr moggs it aint what i callon after this they walked on in silence for a short way when mr waddle made a little proposition hes on your books too mr moggs pretty tight as im told why aint you down on him  down on him said moggs  i wouldnt leave him an hour if i was you  dyou think thats the way i would be down ona rival and moggs as he walked along worked both his fists closely in his energy if i cant be down on him other gait than that ill leave him alone but waddle by my sacred honour as a man ill not leave him alone waddle started and stood with his mouth open looking up at his friend base mercenary falsehearted loon what is it that he wants  old neefits money thats it you know  he doesnt know what love means and hed take that fair creature and drag her through the dirt and subject her to the scorn of hardened aristocrats and crush her spirits and break her heartjust because her father has scraped together a mass of gold but ii wouldnt let the wind blow on her too harshly i despise her fathers money i love her yesill be down upon him somehow goodnight waddle to come between me and the pride of my heart for a little dirt yes ill be down upon him waddle stood and admired he had read of such things in books but here it was brought home to him in absolute life he had a young wife whom he loved but there had been no poetry about his marriage one didnt often come across real poetry in the worldwaddle feltbut when one did the treat was great now ontario moggs was full of poetry when he preached rebellion it was very grandthough at such moments waddle was apt to tell himself that he was precluded by his two kids from taking an active share in such poetry as that but when moggs was roused to speak of his love poetry couldnt go beyond that hell drop into that customer of ours said waddle to himself and hell mean it when hes a doing of it but polly ll never ave im and then there came across waddles mind an idea which he could not expressthat of course no girl would put up with a bootmaker who could have a real gentleman real gentlemen think a good deal of themselves but not half so much as is thought of them by men who know that they themselves are of a different order  ontario moggs as he went homewards by himself was disturbed by various thoughts if it really was to be the case that polly neefit wouldnt have him why should he stay in a country so illadapted to his manner of thinking as this why remain in a paltry island while all the starry west with its brilliant promises was open to him here he could only quarrel with his father and become a rebel and perhaps live to find himself in a jail and then what could he do of good he preached and preached but nothing came of it would not the land of the starry west suit better such a heart and such a mind as his but he wouldnt stir while his fate was as yet unfixed in reference to polly neefit strikes were dear to him and oratory and the noisy applauses of the cheshire cheese but nothing was so dear to him as polly neefit he went about the world with a great burden lying on his chest and that burden was his love for polly neefit in regard to strikes and the ballot he did in a certain way reason within himself and teach himself to believe that he had thought out those matters but as to polly he thought not at all he simply loved her and felt himself to be a wild frantic man quarrelling with his father hurrying towards jails and penal settlements rushing about the streets half disposed to suicide because polly neefit would have none of him he had been jealous too of the gasfitter when he had seen his polly whirling round the room in the gasfitters armsbut the gasfitter was no gentleman and the battle had been even in spite of the whirling he still had a chance against the gasfitter but the introduction of the purple and fine linen element into his affairs was maddening to him with all his scorn for gentry ontario moggs in his heart feared a gentleman he thought that he could make an effort to punch ralph newtons head if they two were ever to be brought together in a spot convenient for such an operation but of the mans standing in the world he was afraid it seemed to him to be impossible that polly should prefer him or any one of his class to a suitor whose hands were always clean whose shirt was always white whose words were soft and wellchosen who carried with him none of the stain of work moggs was as true as steel in his genuine love of labourof labour with a great lof the people with a great pof trade with a great tof commerce with a great c but of himself individuallyof himself who was a man of the people and a tradesman he thought very little when he compared himself to a gentleman he could not speak as they spoke he could not walk as they walked he could not eat as they ate there was a divinity about a gentleman which he envied and hated  now polly neefit was not subject to this idolatry could moggs have read her mind he might have known that success as from the bootmaker against the gentleman was by no means so hopeless an affair what polly liked was a nice young man who would hold up his head and be true to herand who would not make a fool of himself if he could waltz into the bargain that also would polly like  on that night ontario walked all the way out to alexandria cottage and spent an hour leaning upon the gate looking up at the window of the breechesmakers bedroomfor the chamber of polly herself opened backwards when he had stood there an hour he walked home to bond street     chapter xvii  ralph newtons doubts   that month of august was a very sad time indeed for ralph the heir with him all months were we may say idle months but as a rule august was of all the most idle sometimes he would affect to shoot grouse but hunting not grouseshooting was his passion as a sportsman he would leave london and spend perhaps a couple of days with mr horsball looking at the nags then he would run down to some seaside place and flirt and laugh and waste his time upon the sands or he would go abroad as far as dieppe or perhaps biarritz and so would saunter through the end of the summer it must not be supposed of him that he was not fully conscious that this manner of life was most pernicious he knew it well knew that it would take him to the dogs made faint resolves at improvement which he hardly for an hour hoped to be able to keepand was in truth anything but happy this was his usual lifeand so for the last three or four years had he contrived to get through this month of august but now the utmost sternness of business had come upon him he was forced to remain in town found himself sitting day after day in his lawyers anteroom was compelled to seek various interviews with sir thomas in which it was impossible that sir thomas should make himself very pleasant andworst of allwas at last told that he must make up his own mind  squire newton was also up in london and though london was never much to his taste he was in these days by no means so wretched as his nephew he was intent on a certain object and he began to hope nay to think that his object might be achieved he had not once seen his nephew having declared his conviction very strongly that it would be better for all parties that they should remain apart his own lawyer he saw frequently and ralphs lawyer once and sir thomas more than once or twice there was considerable delay but the squire would not leave london till something was if not settled at any rate arranged towards a settlement and it was the expression of his will conveyed through the two lawyers which kept ralph in london what was the worth of ralphs interest in the property that was one great question would ralph sell that interest when the price was fixed that was the second question ralph to whom the difficulty of giving an answer was as a labour of hercules staved off the evil day for awhile by declaring that he must know what was the price before he could say whether he would sell the article the exact price could not be fixed the lawyers combined in saying that the absolute sum of money to include all ralphs interest in the estate could not be named that side of christmas it was not to be thought of that any actuary or valuer or lawyer or conveyancer should dispose of so great a matter by a months work but something approaching to a settlement might be made a sum might be named as a minimum and a compact might be made subject to the arbitration of a sworn appraiser a sum was named the matter was carried so far that ralph was told that he could sign away all his rights by the middle of septembersign away the entire propertyand have his pockets filled with ample funds for the moonbeam and all other delights he might pay off moggs and neefit and no longer feel that pollypoor dear pollywas a millstone round his neck and he would indeed in this event be so well provided that he did not for a moment doubt that if he chose so to circumscribe himself clarissa underwood might be his wife all the savings of the squires life would be hisenough as the opposing lawyer told him with eager pressing words to give him an estate of over a thousand a year at once and it may be moreprobably will be more said the lawyer but at the very least a sum approaching to thirty thousand pounds would be paid over to him at once and he might do what he pleased with this there was still a remnant of his own paternal property sufficient to pay his debts  but why should a man whose encumbrances were so trifling sacrifice prospects that were so glorious could he not part with a portion of the estatewith the reversion of half of it so that the house of newton newton priory with its grouse and paddocks and adjacent farms might be left to him if the whole were saleable surely so also must be the half the third of the money offered to him would more than suffice for all his wants no doubt he might sell the halfbut not to the squire nor could he effect such sale immediately as he would do if the squire bought it nor on such terms as were offered by the squire money he might raise at once certainly but it became by degrees as a thing certain to him that if once he raised money in that way the estate would fly from him his uncle was a hale man and people told him that his own life was not so much better than his uncles his uncle had a great object and if ralph chose to sell at all that fact would be worth thousands to him but his uncle would not buy the reversion of half or of a portion of the property the squire at last spoke his mind freely on this matter to sir thomas it shall never be cast in my sons teeth he said that his next neighbour is the real man early in life i made a mistake and i have had to pay for it ever since i am paying for it now and must pay for it to the end but my paying for it will be of small service if my boy has to pay for it afterwards sir thomas understood him and did not press the point  ralph was nearly driven wild with the need of deciding moggss bill at two months was coming due and he knew that he could expect no mercy there to neefits establishment in conduit street he had gone once and had had wordsas waddle had told to his rival neefit was still persistent in his wishesstill urgent that newton should go forth to hendon like a man and pop at once ill tell you what captain said hehe had taken to calling ralph captain as a goodly familiar name feeling no doubt that mister was cold between fatherinlaw and soninlaw and not quite daring to drop all reverential titleif youre a little hard up as i know you are you can have three or four hundred if you want it ralph did want it sorely i know how you stand with old moggs said neefit and ill see you all right there neefit was very urgent he too had heard something of these dealings among the lawyers to have his polly mrs newton of newton priory the prize was worth fighting for dont let them frighten you about a little ready money captain if it comes to that other folk has got ready money besides them  your trust in me surprises me said ralph i already owe you money which i cant pay you  i know where to trust and i know where not to trust if youll once say as how youll pop the question to polly fair and honest on the square you shall have five hundredbless me if you shant if she dont take you after all why then i must look for my money byandbye if youre on the square with me captain youll never find me hard to deal with  i hope i shall be on the square at any rate  then you step out to her and pop hereupon ralph made a long and intricate explanation of his affairs the object of which was to prove to mr neefit that a little more delay was essential he was so environed by business and difficulties at the present moment that he could take no immediate step such as mr neefit suggestedno such step quite immediately in about another fortnight or in a month at the furthest he would be able to declare his purpose and how about moggs said neefit putting his hands into his breechespocket pulling down the corners of his mouth and fixing his saucer eyes full upon the young mans face so he stood for some seconds and then came the words of which waddle had spoken neefit could not disentangle the intricacies of ralphs somewhat fictitious story but he had wit enough to know what it meant you aint on the square captain thats what you aint he said at last it must be owned that the accusation was just and it was made so loudly that waddle did not at all exaggerate in saying that there had been words nevertheless when ralph left the shop neefit relented you come to me captain when moggss bit of stiff comes round  a few days after that ralph went to sir thomas with the object of declaring his decisionat least sir thomas understood that such was to be the purport of the visit according to his ideas there had been quite enough of delay the squire had been liberal in his offer and though the thing to be sold was in all its bearings so valuable though it carried with it a value which in the eyes of sir thomasand indeed in the eyes of all englishmenwas far beyond all money price though the territorial position was for a legitimate heir almost a principality yet when a man cannot keep a thing what can he do but part with it ralph had made his bed and he must lie upon it sir thomas had done what he could but it had all amounted to nothing there was this young man a beggarbut for this reversion which he had now the power of selling as for that mode of extrication by marrying the breechesmakers daughterthat to sir thomas was infinitely the worst evil of the two let ralph accept his uncles offer and he would still be an english gentleman free to live as such free to marry as such free to associate with friends fitting to his habits of life and he would be a gentleman too with means sufficing for a gentlemans wants but that escape by way of the breechesmakers daughter would in accordance with sir thomass view of things destroy everything  well ralph he said sighing almost groaning as his late ward took the now accustomed chair opposite to his own  i wish id never been born said ralph and that gregory stood in my place  but you have been born ralph we must take things as we find them then there was a long silence i think you know that you should make up your mind one way or the other your uncle of course feels that as he is ready to pay the money at once he is entitled to an immediate answer  i dont see that at all said ralph i am under no obligation to my uncle and i dont see why i am to be bustled by him he is doing nothing for my sake  he has at any rate the power of retracting  let him retract  and then youll be just where you were beforeready to fall into the hands of the jews if you must part with your property you cannot do so on better terms  it seems to me that i shall be selling £7000 a year in land for about £1200 a year in the funds  just sothats about it i suppose but can you tell me when the land will be yoursor whether it will ever be yours at all what is it that you have got to sell but ralph it is no good going over all that again  i know that sir thomas  i had hoped you would have come to some decision if you can save the property of course you ought to do so if you can live on what pittance is left to you  i can save it  then do save it  i can save it bymarrying  by selling yourself to the daughter of a man who makesbreeches i can give you advice on no other point but i do advise you not to do that i look upon an illassorted marriage as the very worst kind of ruin i cannot myself conceive any misery greater than that of having a wife whom i could not ask my friends to meet  ralph when he heard this blushed up to the roots of his hair he remembered that when he had first mentioned to sir thomas his suggested marriage with polly neefit he had said that as regarded polly herself he thought that patience and clarissa would not object to her he was now being told by sir thomas himself that his daughters would certainly not consent to meet polly neefit should polly neefit become mrs newton he too had his ideas of his own standing in the world and had not been slow to assure himself that the woman whom he might choose for his wife would be a fit companion for any ladyas long as the woman was neither vicious nor disagreeable he could make any woman a lady he could at any rate make polly neefit a lady he rose from his seat and prepared to leave the room in disgust i wont trouble you by coming here again he said  you are welcome ralph said sir thomas if i could assist you you would be doubly welcome  i know i have been a great trouble to youa thankless fruitless worthless trouble i shall make up my mind no doubt in a day or two and i will just write you a line i need not bother you by coming any more of course i think a great deal about it  no doubt said sir thomas  unluckily i have been brought up to know the value of what it is i have to throw away it is a kind of thing that a man doesnt do without some regrets  they should have come earlier said sir thomas  no doubtbut they didnt and it is no use saying anything more about it goodday sir then he flounced out of the room impatient of that single word of rebuke which had been administered to him  sir thomas as soon as he was alone applied himself at once to the book which he had reluctantly put aside when he was disturbed but he could not divest his mind of its trouble as quickly as his chamber had been divested of the presence of its troubler he had said an illnatured word and that grieved him and thenwas he not taking all this great matter too easily if he would only put his shoulder to the wheel thoroughly might he not do something to save this friendthis lad who had been almost as his own sonfrom destruction would it not be a burden on his conscience to the last day of his life that he had allowed his ward to be ruined when by some sacrifice of his own means he might have saved him he sat and thought of it but did not really resolve that anything could be done he was wont to think in the same way of his own children whom he neglected his conscience had been pricking him all his life but it hardly pricked him sharp enough to produce consequences  during those very moments in which ralph was leaving southampton buildings he had almost made up his mind to go at once to alexandria cottage and to throw himself and the future fate of newton priory at the feet of polly neefit two incidents in his late interview with sir thomas tended to drive him that way sir thomas had told him that should he marry the daughter of a man who madebreeches no lady would associate with his wife sir thomas also had seemed to imply that he must sell his property he would show sir thomas that he could have a will and a way of his own polly neefit should become his wife and he would show the world that no proudest lady in the land was treated with more delicate consideration by her husband than the breechesmakers daughter should be treated by him and when it should please providence to decide that the present squire of newton had reigned long enough over that dominion he would show the world that he had known something of his own position and the value of his own prospects then polly should be queen in the newton dominions and he would see whether the ordinary world of worshippers would not come and worship as usual all the same he did not on that occasion go out to alexandria cottage  when he reached his club he found a note from his brother      newton peele september 8th 186     my dear ralph     i have been sorry not to have had an answer from you to    the letter which i wrote to you about a month ago of    course i hear of what is going on ralph newton up at the    house tells me everything the squire is still in town    as of course you know and there has got to be a report    about here that he has as the people say bought you out    i still hope that this is not true the very idea of it    is terrible to methat you should sell for an old song    as it were the property that has belonged to us for    centuries it would not indeed go out of the name but    as far as you and i are concerned that is the same i    will not refuse myself to do anything that you may say    is necessary to extricate yourself from embarrassment but    i ran hardly bring myself to believe that a step so fatal    as this can be necessary     if i understand the matter rightly your difficulty is not    so much in regard to debts as in the want of means of    livelihood if so can you not bring yourself to live    quietly for a term of years of course you ought to marry    and there may be a difficulty there but almost anything    would be better than abandoning the property as i told    you before you are welcome to the use of the whole of my    share of the london property it is very nearly £400 a    year could you not live on that till things come round     our cousin ralph knows that i am writing to you and knows    what my feelings are it is not he that is so anxious for    the purchase pray write and tell me what is to be done     most affectionately yours     gregory newton     i wouldnt lose a day in doing anything you might direct    about the holborn property   ralph received this at his club and afterwards dined alone considering it before the evening was over he thought that he had made up his mind that he would not under any circumstances give up his reversionary right they couldnt make me do it even though i went to prison he said to himself let him starve till he died and then the property would go to gregory what did it matter the thing that did matter was thisthat the estate should not be allowed to depart out of the true line of the newton family he sat thinking of it half the night and before he left the club he wrote the following note to his brother      september 9th 186     dear greg     be sure of thisthat i will not part with my interest in    the property i do not think that i can be forced and i    will never do it willingly it may be that i may be driven    to take advantage of your liberality and prudence if so    i can only say that you shall share the property with me    when it comes     yours always     r n   this he gave to the porter of the club as he passed out and then as he went home he acknowledged to himself that it was tantamount to a decision on his part that he would forthwith marry polly neefit     chapter xviii  we wont sell brownriggs   on the 10th of september the squire was informed that ralph newton demanded another ten days for his decision and that he had undertaken to communicate it by letter on the 20th the squire had growled thinking that his nephew was unconscionable and had threatened to withdraw his offer the lawyer with a smile assured him that the matter really was progressing very quickly that things of that kind could rarely be carried on so expeditiously and that in short mr newton had no fair ground of complaint when a man pays through the nose for his whistle he ought to get it said the squire plainly showing that his idea as to the price fixed was very different from that entertained by his nephew but he did not retract his offer he was too anxious to accomplish the purchase to do that he would go home he said and wait till the 20th then he would return to london and he did go home  on the first evening he said very little to his son he felt that his son did not quite sympathise with him and he was sore that it should be so he could not be angry with his son he knew well that this want of sympathy arose from a conviction on this sons part that let what might be done in regard to the property nothing could make him who was illegitimate capable of holding the position in the country which of right belonged to newton of newton but the presence of this feeling in the mind of the son was an accusation against himself which was very grievous to him almost every act of his latter life had been done with the object of removing the cause for such accusation to make his boy such as he would have been in every respect had not his father sinned in his youth had been the one object of the fathers life and nobody gainsayed him in this but that son himself nobody told him that all his bother about the estate was of no avail nobody dared to tell him so parson gregory in his letters to his brother could express such an opinion sir thomas sitting alone in his chamber could feel it ralph the legitimate heir with an assumed scorn could declare to himself that let what might be sold he would still be newton of newton the country people might know it and the farmers might whisper it one to another but nobody said a word of this to the squire his own lawyer never alluded to such a matter though it was of course in his thoughts nevertheless the son whom he loved so well would tell him from day to dayindirectly indeed but with words that were plain enoughthat the thing was not to be done men and women called him newton because his father had chosen so to call himas they would have called him tomkins or montmorenci had he first appeared before them with either of those names but he was not a newton and nothing could make him newton of newton priorynot even the possession of the whole parish and an habitation in the priory itself i wish you wouldnt think about it the son would say to the fatherand the expression of such a wish would contain the whole accusation what other son would express a desire that the father would abstain from troubling himself to leave his estate entire to his child  on the morning after his return the necessary communication was made but it was not commenced in any set form the two were out together as was usual with them and were on the road which divided the two parishes bostock from newton on the left of them was walkers farm called the brownriggs and on the right darvells farm which was in their own peculiar parish of newton i was talking to darvell while you were away said ralph  what does he say for himself  nothing its the old story he wants to stay though he knows hed be better away  then let him stay only i must have the place made fit to look at a man should have a chance of pulling through  certainly sir i dont want him to go i was only thinking it would be better for his children that there should be a change as for making the place fit to look at he hasnt the means its walkers work at the other side that shames him  one cant have walkers on every farm said the squire noif things go as i think they will go well pull down every stick and stone at brumbysbrumbys was the name of darvells farmand put it up all shipshape the house hasnt been touched these twenty years ralph said nothing he knew well that his father would not talk of building unless he intended to buy before he built nothing could be more opposed to the squires purposes in life than the idea of building a house which at his death would become the property of his nephew and in this way the estate was being starved all this ralph understood thoroughly and understanding it had frequently expressed a desire that his father and the heir could act in accord together but now the squire talked of pulling down and building up as though the property were his own to do as he liked with it and i think i can do it without selling brownriggs continued the squire when it came to black and white the value that he has in it doesnt come to so much as i thought still ralph said nothingnothing at least as to the work that had been done up in london he merely made some observation as to darvells farmsuggesting that a clear half years rent should be given to the man i have pretty well arranged it all in my mind continued the squire we could part with twining it dont lie so near as brownriggs  ralph felt that it would be necessary that he should say something lord fitzadam would be only too glad to buy it he owns every acre in the parish except ingrams farm  therell be no difficulty about selling itwhen we have the power to sell itll fetch thirty years purchase id give thirty years purchase for it at the present rent myself if i had the money lord fitzadam shall have it if he pleases of course theres four hundred acres of it  four hundred and nine said ralph  and its worth over twelve thousand pounds it would have gone against the grain with me to part with any of the land in bostock but i think we can squeeze through without that  is it arranged sir asked the son at last  wellno i cant say it is he is to give me his answer on the 20th but i cannot see that he has any alternative he must pay his debts and he has no other way of paying them he must live and he has nothing else to live on a fellow like that will have money if he can lay his hands on it and he cant lay his hands on it elsewhere of course he could get money but he couldnt get it on such terms as i have offered him he is to have down thirty thousand pounds and thenafter thati am to pay him whatever more than that they may think the thing is worth to him under no circumstances is he to have less its a large sum of money ralph  yes indeedthough not so much as you had expected sir  wellno but then there are drawbacks however i shall only be too glad to have it settled i dont think ralph you have ever realised what it has been for me not to be able to lay out a shilling on the property as to which i was not satisfied that i should see it back again in a year or two  and yet sir i have thought much about it  thought by heavens i have thought of nothing else as i stand here the place has hardly been worth the having to me because of such thinking your uncle from the very first was determined to make it bitter enough i shall never forget his coming to me when i cut down the first tree was i going to build houses for a mans son who begrudged me the timber i wanted about the place  he couldnt stop you there  but he said he couldand he tried and if i wanted to change a thing here or there was it pleasant do you think to have to go to him and what pleasure could there be in doing anything when another was to have it all but you have never understood it ralph welli hope youll understand it some day if this goes right nobody shall ever stop you in cutting a tree you shall be free to do what you please with every sod and every branch and every wall and every barn i shall be happy at last ralph if i think that you can enjoy it then there was again a silence for tears were in the eyes both of the father and of the son indeed continued the squire as he rubbed the moisture away my great pleasure while i remain will be to see you active about the place as it is now how is it possible that you should care for it  but i do care for it and i think i am active about it  yesmaking money for that idiot who is to come after me but i dont think he ever will come i dare say he wont be ashamed to shoot your game and drink your claret if youll allow him for the matter of that when the thing is settled he may come and drink my wine if he pleases ill be his loving uncle then if he dont object but as it is nowas it has been i couldnt have borne him  even yet there had been no clear statement as to what had been done between father and son there was so much of clinging trusting perfect love in the fathers words towards the son that the latter could not bear to say a word that should produce sorrow when the squire declared that ralph should have it all freeto do just as he pleased with it with all the full glory of ownership ralph could not bring himself to throw a doubt upon the matter and yet he did doubtmore than doubtedfelt almost certain that his father was in error while his father had remained alone up in town he had been living with gregory and had known what gregory thought and believed he had even seen his namesakes letter to gregory in which it was positively stated that the reversion would not be sold throughout the morning the squire went on speaking of his hopes and saying that this and that should be done the very moment that the contract was signed at last ralph spoke out when on some occasion his father reproached him for indifference i do so fear that you will be disappointed he said  why should i be disappointed  it is not for my own sake that i fear for in truth the arrangement as it stands is no bar to my enjoyment of the place  it is a most absolute bar to mine said the squire  i fear it is not settled  i know thatbut i see no reason why it should not be settled do you know any reason  gregory feels sure that his brother will never consent  gregory is all very well gregory is the best fellow in the world had gregory been in his brothers place i shouldnt have had a chance but gregory knows nothing about this kind of thing and gregory doesnt in the least understand his brother  but ralph has told him so  ralph will say anything he doesnt mind what lies he tells  i think you are too hard on him said the son  wellwe shall see but what is it that ralph has said and when did he say it then the son told the father of the short letter which the parson had received from his brother and almost repeated the words of it and he told the date of the letter only a day or two before the squires return why the mischief could he not be honest enough to tell me the same thing if he had made up his mind said the squire angrily put it how you will he is lying either to me or to his brotherprobably to both of us his word either on one side or on the other is worth nothing i believe he will take my money because he wants money and because he likes money as for what he says it is worth nothing when he has once written his name he cannot go back from it and there will be comfort in that ralph said nothing more his father had talked himself into a passion and was quite capable of becoming angry even with him so he suggested something about the shooting for next day and proposed that the parson should be asked to join them he may come if he likes said the squire but i give you my word if this goes on much longer i shall get to dislike even the sight of him on that very day the parson dined with them and early in the evening the squire was cold and silent and then snappish but he warmed afterwards under the double influence of his own portwine and the thorough sweetness of his nephews manner his last words as gregory left him that night in the hall were as followsbother about the church im half sick of the church you come and shoot tomorrow dont let us have any new fads about not shooting  there are no new fads uncle greg and ill be with you by twelve oclock said the parson  he is very good as parsons go said the squire as he shut the door  hes as good as gold said the squires son     chapter xix  pollys answer   moggss bill became due before the 20th of september and ralph newton received due noticeas of course he had known that he would dothat it had not been cashed at his bankers how should it be cashed at his bankers seeing that he had not had a shilling there for the last three months moggs himself moggs senior came to ralph and made himself peculiarly disagreeable he had never heard of such a thing on the part of a gentleman not to have his bill taken up to have his paper dishonoured moggs spoke of it as though the heavens would fall and he spoke of it too as though even should the heavens not fall the earth would be made a very tumultuous and unpleasant place for mr newton if mr newton did not see at once that these two hundred and odd pounds were forthcoming moggs said so much that ralph became very angry turned him out of the room and told him that he should have his dirty money on the morrow on the morrow the dirty money was paid ralph having borrowed the amount from mr neefit mr moggs was quite content his object had been achieved and when the cash was paid he was quite polite but ralph newton was not happy as he made the payment he had declared to himself after writing that letter to his brother that the thing was settled by the very declaration made by him therein when he assured his brother that he would not sell his interest in the property he did in fact resolve that he would make polly neefit his wife and he did no more than follow up that resolution when he asked neefit for a small additional advance his due would not be given to the breechesmaker if it were not acknowledged that on this occasion he behaved very well he had told ralph to come to him when moggss bit of stiff came round moggss bit of stiff did come round and the captain did as he had been desired to do neefit wrote out the cheque without saying a word about his daughter do you just run across to argyle street captain said the breechesmaker and get the stuff in notes for mr neefits bankers held an establishment in argyle street there aint no need you know to let on captain is there said the breechesmaker ralph newton clearly seeing that there was no need to let on did as he was bid and so the account was settled with mr moggs but now as to settling the account with mr neefit neefit had his own idea of what was right between gentlemen as the reader knows he could upon an occasion make his own views very clearly intelligible he was neither reticent nor particularly delicate but there was something within him which made him give the cheque to ralph without a word about polly that something let it be what it might was not lost upon ralph  any further doubt on his part was quite out of the question if his mind had not been made up before it must at least be made up now he had twice borrowed mr neefits money and on this latter occasion had taken it on the express understanding that he was to propose to mr neefits daughter and then in this way and in this way only he could throw over his uncle and save the property as soon as he had paid the money to moggs he went to his room and dressed himself for the occasion as he arranged his dress with some small signs of an intention to be externally smart he told himself that it signified nothing at all that the girl was only a breechesmakers daughter and that there was hardly a need that he should take a new pair of gloves for such an occasion as this in that he was probably right an old pair of gloves would have done just as well though polly did like young men to look smart  he went out in a hansom of course a man does not become economical because he is embarrassed and as for embarrassment he need not trouble himself with any further feelings on that score when once he should be the promised husband of polly neefit he would have no scruple about the breechesmakers money why should he when he did the thing with the very view of getting it they couldnt expect him to be married till next spring at the earliest and he would take another winter out of himself at the moonbeam as the sacrifice was to be made he might as well enjoy all that would come of the sacrifice then as he sat in the cab he took to thinking whether after any fashion at all he did love polly neefit and from that he got to thinkingnot of poor clarybut of mary bonner if his uncle could at once be translated to his fitting place among the immortals ohwhat a life might be his but his uncle was still mortal andafter allpolly neefit was a very jolly girl  when he got to the house he asked boldly for miss neefit he had told himself that no repulse could be injurious to him if mrs neefit were to refuse him admission into the house the breechesmaker would be obliged to own that he had done his best but there was no repulse in two minutes he found himself in the parlour with polly standing up to receive him dear me mr newton how odd you might have come weeks running before youd find me here and mother out shes gone to fetch father home she dont do itnot once a month ralph assured her that he was quite contented as it was and that he did not in the least regret the absence of mrs neefit but shell be ever so unhappy she likes to see gentlemen when they call  and you dislike it asked ralph  indeed i dont then said polly  and now in what way was he to do it would it be well to allude to her fathers understanding with himself in the ordinary way of lovemaking ralph was quite as much at home as another he had found no difficulty in saying a soft word to clarissa underwood and in doing more than that but with polly the matter was different there was an inappropriateness in his having to do the thing at all which made it difficult to himunless he could preface what he did by an allusion to his agreement with her father he could hardly ask polly to be his wife without giving her some reason for the formation of so desperate a wish on his own part polly he said at last that was very awkward for us allthat evening when mr moggs was here  indeed it was mr newton poor mr moggs he shouldnt have stayedbut mother asked him  has he been here since  he was then and he and i were walking together there isnt a better fellow breathing than ontario moggsin his own way but hes not company for you mr newton of course  ralph quailed at this to be told that his own bootmaker wasnt company for himand that by the young lady whom he intended to make his wife i dont think he is company for you either polly he said  why not mr newton hes as good as me whats the difference between him and father he wondered whether when she should be his own he would be able to teach her to call mr neefit her papa mr newton when you know me better youll know that im not one to give myself airs ive known mr moggs all my life and hes equal to me anywaysonly hes a deal better  i hope theres nothing more than friendship polly  what business have you to hope  upon that theme he spoke and told her in plain language that his reason for so hoping was that he trusted to be able to persuade her to become his own wife polly when the word was spoken blushed ruby red and trembled a little the thing had come to her and after all she might be a real lady if she pleased she blushed ruby red and trembled but she said not a word for a while and then having made his offer he began to speak of love in speaking of it he was urgent enough but his words had not that sort of suasiveness which they would have possessed had he been addressing himself to clary underwood polly he said i hope you can love me i will love you very dearly and do all that i can to make you happy to me you shall be the first woman in the world do you think that you can love me polly  polly was perhaps particular she had not quite approved of the manner in which ontario had disclosed his love though there had been something of the eloquence of passion even in thatand now she was hardly satisfied with ralph newton she had formed to herself perhaps some idea of a soft insinuating coaxing whisper something that should be half caress and half prayer but something that should at least be very gentle and very loving ontario was loving but he was not gentle ralph newton was gentle but then she doubted whether he was loving will you say that it shall be so he asked standing over her and looking down upon her with his most bewitching smile  polly amidst her blushing and her trembling made up her mind that she would say nothing of the kind at this present moment she would like to be a lady though she was not ashamed of being a tradesmans daughterbut she would not buy the privilege of being a lady at too dear a price the price would be very high indeed were she to give herself to a man who did not love her and perhaps despised her and then she was not quite sure that she could love this man herself though she was possessed of a facility for liking nice young men ralph newton was well enough in many ways he was good looking he could speak up for himself he did not give himself airsand then as she had been fully instructed by her father he must ultimately inherit a large property were she to marry him her position would be absolutely that of one of the ladies of the land but then she knewshe could not but knowthat he sought her because he was in want of money for his present needs to be made a lady of the land would be delightful but to have a grand passionin regard to which polly would not be satisfied unless there were as much love on one side as on the otherwould be more delightful that latter was essentially necessary to her the man must take an absolute pleasure in her company or the whole thing would be a failure so she blushed and trembled and thought and was silent dear polly do you mean that you cannot love me said ralph  i dont know said polly  will you try demanded ralph  and i dont know that you can love me  indeed indeed i can  ah yesyou can say so i dont doubt theres a many of them as can say so and yet its not in em to do it and theres men as dont know hardly how to say it and yet its in their hearts all the while polly must have been thinking of ontario as she made this latter oracular observation  i dont know much about saying it but i can do it polly  oh as for talking you can talk youve been brought up that way youve had nothing else much to do  she was very hard upon him and so he felt it i think thats not fair polly what can i say to you better than that i love you and will be good to you  oh good to me people are always good to me why shouldnt they  nobody will be so good as i will beif you will take me tell me polly do you not believe me when i say i love you  noi dont  why should i be false to you  ahwellwhy its not for me to say why fathers been putting you up to this thats why  your father could put me up to nothing of the kind if it were not that i really loved you  and theres another thing mr newton  whats that polly  im not at all sure that im so very fond of you  thats unkind  better be true than to rue said polly why mr newton we dont know anything about each othernot as yet i may be oh anything bad for what you know and for anything i know you may be idle and extravagant and a regular man flirt polly had a way of speaking the truth without much respect to persons and then mr newton im not going to be given away by father just as he pleases father thinks this and that and he means it all for the best i love father dearly but i dont mean to take any body as i dont feel id pretty nigh break my heart if i wasnt to have him i aint come to breaking my heart for you yet mr newton  i hope you never will break your heart  i dont suppose you understand but thats how it is let it just stand by for a year or so mr newton and see how it is then maybe we might get to know each other just now marrying you would be like taking a husband out of a lottery ralph stood looking at her passing his hand over his head and not quite knowing how to carry on his suit ill tell father what you was saying to me and what i said to you continued polly who seemed quite to understand that ralph had done his duty by his creditor in making the offer and that justice to him demanded that this should be acknowledged by the whole family  and is that to be all polly asked ralph in a melancholy voice  all at present mr newton  ralph as he returned to london in his cab felt more hurt by the girls refusal of him than he would before have thought to be possible he was almost disposed to resolve that he would at once renew the siege and carry it on as though there were no question of twenty thousand pounds and of money borrowed from the breechesmaker polly had shown so much spirit in the interview and had looked so well in showing it had stood up such a perfect specimen of healthy comely honest womanhood that he thought that he did love her there was however one comfort clearly left to him he had done his duty by old neefit the money due must of course be paidbut he had in good faith done that which he had pledged himself to do in taking the money  as to the surrender of the estate there were still left to him four days in which to think of it     chapter xx  the conservatives of percycross   early in this month of september there had come a proposition to sir thomas which had thoroughly disturbed him and made him for a few days a most miserable man by the tenth of the month however he had so far recovered himself as to have made up his mind in regard to the proposition with some feeling of triumphant expectation on the following day he went home to fulham and communicated his determination to his eldest daughter in the following words patience i am going to stand for the borough of percycross  papa  yes i dare say im a fool for my pains it will cost me some money which i oughtnt to spend and if i get in i dont know that i can do any good or that it can do me any good i suppose you think im very wrong  i am delightedand so will clary be im so much pleased why shouldnt you be in parliament i have always longed that you should go back to public life though i have never liked to say so to you  it is very kind of you to say it now my dear  and i feel it there was no doubt of that for as she spoke the tears were streaming from her eyes but will you succeed is there to be anybody against you  yes my dear there is to be somebody against me in fact there will be three people against me and probably i shall not succeed men such as i am do not have seats offered to them without a contest but there is a chance i was down at percycross for two days last week and now ive put out an address there it is upon which he handed a copy of a placard to his daughter who read it no doubt with more enthusiasm than did any of the free and independent electors to whom it was addressed  the story in regard to the borough of percycross was as follows there were going forward in the country at this moment preparations for a general election which was to take place in october the readers of this story have not as yet been troubled on this head there having been no connection between that great matter and the small matters with which our tale has concerned itself in the parliament lately dissolved the very old borough of percycrossor percy st cross as the place was properly calledhad displayed no political partiality having been represented by two gentlemen one of whom always followed the conservative leader and the other the liberal leader into the respective lobbies of the house of commons the borough had very nearly been curtailed of the privilege in regard to two members in the great reform bill which had been initiated and perfected and carried through as a whole by the almost unaided intellect and exertions of the great reformer of his age but it had had its own luck as the irishmen say and had been preserved intact now the wise men of percycross rejoicing in their salvation and knowing that there might still be danger before them should they venture on a contestfor bribery had not been unknown in previous contests at percycross nor petitions consequent upon bribery and some men had marvelled that the borough should have escaped so long and there was now supposed to be abroad a spirit of assumed virtue in regard to such matters under which percycross might still be sacrificed if percycross did not look very sharp after itselfthinking of all this the wise men at percycross had concluded that it would be better just for the present to let things run smoothly and to return their two old members when the new broom which was to sweep up the dirt of corruption was not quite so new they might return to the old gamewhich was in truth a game very much loved in the old town of percycross so thought the wise men and for a while it seemed that the wise men were to have their own way but there were men at percycross who were not wise and who would have it that such an arrangement as this showed lack of spirit the conservative foolish men at percycross began by declaring that they could return two members for the borough if they pleased and that they would do so unless this and that were conceded to them the liberal foolish men swore that they were ready for the battle they would concede nothing and would stand up and fight if the word concession were named to them they would not only have one member but would have half the aldermen half the towncouncillors half the mayor half the patronage in beadles bellringers and bumbledom in general had the great reformer of the age given them household suffrage for nothing the liberal foolish men of percycross declared and perhaps thought that they could send two liberal members to parliament and so the borough grew hot there was one very learned pundit in those parts a pundit very learned in political matters who thus prophesied to one of the proposed candidatesyoull spend a thousand pounds in the election you wont get in of course but youll petition thatll be another thousand youll succeed there and disfranchise the borough it will be a great career and no doubt youll find it satisfactory you mustnt show yourself in percycross afterwardsthats all but the spirit was afloat and the words of the pundit were of no avail the liberal spirit had been set a going and men went to work with the new lists of borough voters by the end of august it was seen that there must be a contest but who should be the new candidates  the old candidates were thereone on each side an old tory and a young radical in telling our tale we will not go back to the old sins of the borough or say aught but good of the past career of the members old mr griffenbottom the tory had been very generous with his purse and was beloved doubtless by many in the borough it is so well for a borough to have some one who is always ready with a fiftypound note in this or that need it is so comfortable in a borough to know that it can always have its subscription lists well headed and the young radical was popular throughout the county no one could take a chair at a mechanics meeting with better grace or more alacrity or spin out his halfhours speech with greater ease and volubility and then he was a born gentleman which is so great a recommendation for a radical so that in fact young mr westmacott though he did not spend so much money as old griffenbottom was almost as popular in the borough there was no doubt about griffenbottom and westmacottif only the borough would have listened to its wise men and confined itself to the political guardianship of such excellent representatives but the foolish men prevailed over the wise men and it was decided that there should be a contest  it was an evil day for griffenbottom when it was suggested to him that he should bring a colleague with him griffenbottom knew what this meant almost as well as the learned pundit whose words we have quoted griffenbottom had not been blessed with uncontested elections and had run through many perils he had spent what he was accustomed to call when speaking of his political position among his really intimate friends a treasure in maintaining the borough he must often have considered within himself whether his whistle was worth the price he had petitioned and been petitioned against and had had evil things said of him and had gone through the very heat of the fire of political warfare but he had kept his seat and now at lastso he thoughtthe ease and comfort of an unopposed return was to repay him for everything alas how all this was changed how his spirits sank within him when he received that hightoned letter from his confidential agent mr trigger in which he was invited to suggest the name of a colleague im sure youll be rejoiced to hear for the sake of the old borough said mr trigger that we feel confident of carrying the two seats could mr trigger have heard the remarks which his patron made on reading that letter mr trigger would have thought that mr griffenbottom was the most ungrateful member of parliament in the world what did not mr griffenbottom owe to the borough of percycross did he not owe all his position in the world all his friends the fact that he was to be seen on the staircases of cabinet ministers and that he was called honourable friend by the sons of dukesdid he not owe it all to the borough of percycross mr trigger and other friends of his felt secure in their conviction that they had made a man of mr griffenbottom mr griffenbottom understood enough of all this to answer mr trigger without inserting in his letter any of those anathemas which he uttered in the privacy of his own closet he did indeed expostulate saying that he would of course suggest a colleague if a colleague were required but did not mr trigger and his other friends in the dear old borough think that just at the present moment a pacific line of action would be best for the interests of the dear old borough mr trigger answered him very quickly and perhaps a little sharply the liberals had decided upon having two men in the field and therefore a pacific line of action was no longer possible mr griffenbottom hurried over to the dear old borough still hopingbut could do nothing the scent of the battle was in the air and the foolish men of percycross were keen for blood mr griffenbottom smiled and promised and declared to himself that there was no peace for the politician on this side the grave he made known his desiresor the desire rather of the boroughto a certain gentleman connected with a certain club in london and the gentleman in question on the following day waited upon sir thomas sir thomas had always been true to the partyso the gentleman in question was good enough to say everybody had regretted the loss of sir thomas from the house the present opportunity of returning to it was almost unparalleled seeing that thing was so nearly a certainty griffenbottom had always been at the top of the poll and the large majority of the new voters were men in the employment of conservative masters the gentleman in question was very clear in his explanation that there was a complete understanding on this matter between the employers and employed at percycross it was the nature of the percycross artizan to vote as his master voted they made boots mustard and paper at percycross the men in the mustard and paper trade were quite safeexcellent men who went in a line to the poll and voted just as the master papermakers and master mustardmakers desired the gentleman from the club acknowledged that there was a difficulty about the boottrade all the world over boots do affect radical sentiments the master bootmakersthere were four in the boroughwere decided but the men could not be got at with any certainty  why should you wish to get at them demanded sir thomas  noof course not one doesnt wish to get at them said the gentleman from the clubparticularly as we are safe without them then he went into statistics and succeeded in proving to sir thomas that there would be a hard fight sir thomas who was much pressed as to time took a day to consider did mr griffenbottom intend to fight the battle with clean hands the gentleman from the club was eager in declaring that everything would be done in strict accordance with the law he could give no guarantee as to expenses but presumed it would be about £300perhaps £400certainly under £500 the other party no doubt would bribe they always did and on their behalfon behalf of westmacott and cothere would be treating and intimidation and subornation and fictitious voting and every sin to which an election is subject it always was so with the liberals at percycross but sir thomas might be sure that on his side everything would beserene sir thomas at last consented to go down to percycross and see one or two of his proposed supporters  he did go down and was considerably disgusted mr trigger took him in hand and introduced him to three or four gentlemen in the borough sir thomas in his first interview with mr trigger declared his predilection for purity yes yes yes yes of course said mr trigger mr trigger seeing that sir thomas had come among them as a stranger to whom had been offered the very great honour of standing for the borough of percycrossoffered to him before he had subscribed a shilling to any of the various needs of the boroughwas not disposed to listen to dictation but sir thomas insisted its as well that we should understand each other at once said sir thomas i should throw up the contest in the middle of iteven if i were winningif i suspected that money was being spent improperly how often has the same thing been said by a candidate and what candidate ever has thrown up the sponge when he was winning mr trigger was at first disposed to tell sir thomas that he was interfering in things beyond his province had it not been that the day was late and that the liberals were supposed to be hard at workthat the candidate was wanted at once mr trigger would have shown his spirit as it was he could only assent with a growl and say that he had supposed all that was to be taken as a matter of course  but i desire to have it absolutely understood by all those who act with me in this matter said sir thomas at any rate i will not be petitioned against  petitions never come to much at percycross said mr trigger he certainly ought to have known as he had had to do with a great many of them then they started to call upon two or three of the leading conservative gentlemen if i were you i wouldnt say anything about that sir thomas  about what  wellbribery and petitions and the rest of it gentlemen when theyre consulted dont like to be told of those sort of things there has been a little of it perhaps who can say who indeed if not mr triggerin regard to percycross but its better to let all that die out of itself it never came to much in percycross i dont think there was ever more than ten shillings to be had for a vote and ive known halfacrown a piece buy fifty of em he added emphatically it never was of much account and its best to say nothing about it  its best perhaps to make ones intentions known said sir thomas mildly mr trigger hummed and hawed and shook his head and put his hands into his trousers pocketsand in his heart of hearts he despised sir thomas  on that day sir thomas was taken to see four gentlemen of note in percycrossa mustardmaker a papermaker and two bootmakers the mustardmaker was very cordial in offering his support he would do anything for the cause trigger knew him the men were all right at his mills then sir thomas said a word he was a great foe to intimidationhe wouldnt for worlds have the men coerced the mustardmaker laughed cheerily we know what all that comes to at percycross dont we trigger we shall all go straight from this placeshant we trigger and he neednt ask any questionsneed he trigger lord a mercy no said trigger who was beginning to be disgusted then they went on to the papermakers  the papermaker was a very polite gentleman who seemed to take great delight in shaking sir thomas by the hand and who agreed with energy to every word sir thomas said trigger stood a little apart at the papermakers as soon as the introduction had been performedperhaps disapproving in part of the papermakers principles certainly not sir thomas not for the world sir thomas im clean against anything of that kind sir thomas said the papermaker sir thomas assured the papermaker that he was glad to hear itand he was glad as they went to the first bootmakers mr trigger communicated to sir thomas a certain incident in the career of mr spiveycomb the papermaker hes got a contract for paper from the walhamshire herald sir thomasthe largest circulation anywhere in these parts griffenbottom gets him that and if ere a man of his didnt vote as he bade em he wouldnt keep em not a day i dont know that weve a man in percycross so stanch as old spiveycomb this was mr triggers revenge  the first bootmaker had very little to say for himself and hardly gave sir thomas much opportunity of preaching his doctrine of purity i hope youll do something for our trade sir thomas said the first bootmaker sir thomas explained that he did not at present see his way to the doing of anything special for the bootmakers and then took his leave hes all right said mr trigger he means it hes all right and hell say a word to his men too though i dont know that much ll come of it theyre a rum lot if theyre put out here today they can get in there tomorrow theyre a cankery independent sort of chaps are bootmakers now well go and see old pile hell have to second one of youwill pile hes a sort of father of the borough in the way of conservatives and look here sir thomaslet him talk dont you say much to him its no use in life talking to old pile sir thomas said nothing but he determined that he would speak to old pile just as freely as he had to mr trigger himself  ehahsaid old pile youre sir thomas underwood are you and you wants to go into parliament  if it please you and your townsmen to send me there  yesthats just it but if it dont please  why then ill go home again  just sobut the people here aint what they are at other places sir thomas underwood ive seen many elections here sir thomas  no doubt you have mr pile  over a dozenhavent you mr pile said trigger  and carried on a deal better than they have been since you meddled with them said mr pile turning upon trigger they used to do the thing here as it should be done and nobody wasnt extortionate nor yet crossgrained theyre changing a deal about these things im told but theyre changing all for the worse theyre talking of puritypuritypurity and what does it all amount to men is getting greedier every day  we mean to be pure at this election mr pile said sir thomas mr pile looked him hard in the face at least i do mr pile i can answer for myself mr pile turned away his face and opened his mouth and put his hand upon his stomach and made a grimace as thoughas though he were not quite as well as he might be and such was the case with him the idea of purity of election at percycross did in truth make him feel very sick it was an idea which he hated with his whole heart there was to him something absolutely mean and ignoble in the idea of a man coming forward to represent a borough in parliament without paying the regular fees that somebody somewhere should make a noise about itsomebody who was impalpable to him in some place that was to him quite another worldwas intelligible it might be all very well in manchester and suchlike disagreeable places but that candidates should come down to percycross and talk about purity there was a thing abominable to him he had nothing to get by bribery to a certain extent he was willing to pay money in bribery himself but that a stranger should come to the borough and want the seat without paying for it was to him so distasteful that this assurance from the mouth of one of the candidates did make him very sick  i think youd better go back to london sir thomas said mr pile as soon as he recovered himself sufficiently to express his opinion  you mean that my ideas as to standing wont suit the borough  no they wont sir thomas i dont suppose anybody else will tell you sobut ill do it why should a poor man lose his days wages for the sake of making you a parliament man what have you done for any of em  half an hour would take a working man to the poll and back argued sir thomas  thats all you know about elections thats not the way we manage matters here there wont be any place of business agait that day then mr trigger whispered a few words to mr pile mr pile repeated the grimace which he had made before and turned on his heel although he was in his own parlour as though he were going to leave them but he thought better of this and turned again i always vote blue myself said mr pile and i dont suppose i shall do otherwise this time but i shant take no trouble theres a many things that i dont like sir thomas good morning sir thomas its all very well for mr trigger he knows where the butter lies for his bread  a very disagreeable old man said sir thomas when they had left the house thinking that as mr trigger had been grossly insulted by the bootmaker he would probably coincide in this opinion  but mr trigger knew his townsman well and was used to him hes better than some of em sir thomas hell do as much as he says and more now there was that chap spicer at the mustard works they say westmacott people are after him and if they can make it worth his while hell go over theres some talk about apothecarys halli dont know what it is but you couldnt buy old pile if you were to give him the queen and all the royal family to make boots for  this was to have been the last of sir thomass preliminary visits among the leading conservatives of the borough but as they were going back to the percy standardfor such was the name of the blue inn in the boroughmr trigger saw a gentleman in black standing at an open hall door and immediately proposed that they should just say a word or two to mr pabsby wesleyan minister whispered the percycross bearleader into the ear of his bearand has a deal to say to many of the men and more to the women cant say what hell dosplit his vote probably then he introduced the two men explaining the cause of sir thomass presence in the borough mr pabsby was delighted to make the acquaintance of sir thomas and asked the two gentlemen into the house in truth he was delighted the hours often ran heavily with him and here there was something for him to do youll give us a help mr pabsby said mr trigger mr pabsby smiled and rubbed his hands and paused and laid his head on one side  i hope he will said sir thomas if he is of our way cf thinking otherwise i should be sorry to ask him still mr pabsby said nothingbut he smiled very sweetly and laid his head a little lower   illustration still mr pabsby said nothingbut he smiled very sweetly and laid his head a little lower   he knows were on the respectable side said mr trigger the wesleyans now are most as one as the church of englandin the way of not being roughs and rowdies sir thomas who did not know mr pabsby was afraid that he would be offended at this but he showed no sign of offence as he continued to rub his hands mr pabsby was meditating his speech  were a little hurried mr pabsby said mr trigger perhaps youll think of it  but mr pabsby was not going to let them escape in that way it was not every day that he had a sir thomas or a candidate for the borough or even a mr trigger in that little parlour the fact was that mr trigger who generally knew what he was about had made a mistake sir thomas who was ready enough to depart saw that an immediate escape was impossible sir thomas began mr pabsby in a soft greasy voicea voice made up of pretence politeness and salivaif you will give me three minutes to express myself on this subject i shall be obliged to you  certainly said sir thomas sitting bolt upright in his chair and holding his hat as though he were determined to go directly the three minutes were over  a minister of the gospel in this town is placed in a peculiar position sir thomas said mr pabsby very slowly and of all the ministers of religion in percycross mine is the most peculiar in this matter i would wish to be guided wholly by duty and if i could see my way clearly i would at once declare it to you but sir thomas i owe much to the convictions of my people  which way do you mean to vote asked mr trigger  mr pabsby did not even turn his face at this interruption a private man sir thomas may follow the dictates ofofof his own heart perhaps here he paused expecting to be encouraged by some words but sir thomas had acquired professionally a knowledge that to such a speaker as mr pabsby any rejoinder or argument was like winding up a clock it is better to allow such clocks to run down with me i have to consider every possible point what will my people wish some of them are eager in the cause of reform sir thomas and some others  we shall lose the train said mr trigger jumping up and putting on his hat  im afraid we shall said sir thomas rising but not putting on his  half a minute said mr pabsby pleading but not rising from his chair perhaps you will do me the honour of calling on me when you are again here in percycross i shall have the greatest pleasure in discussing a few matters with you sir thomas and then if i can give you my poor help it will give me and mrs pabsby the most sincere pleasure mrs pabsby had now entered the room and was introduced but trigger would not sit down again nor take off his hat he boldly marshalled the way to the door while sir thomas followed subject as he came to the eloquence of mr pabsby if i can only see my way clearly sir thomas were the last words which mr pabsby spoke  hell give one to griffenbottom certainly said mr trigger westmacott ll probably have the other i thought perhaps your title might have gone down with him but it didnt seem to take  all this was anything but promising anything but comfortable and yet before he went to bed that night sir thomas had undertaken to stand in such circumstances it is very hard for a man to refuse he feels that a certain amount of trouble has been taken on his behalf that retreat will be cowardly and that the journey for nothing will be personally disagreeable to his own feelings and then too there was that renewed ambition in his breastan ambition which six months ago he would have declared to be at rest for everbut which prompted him now as strongly as ever to go forward and do something it is so easy to go and seeso hard to retreat when one has seen he had not found percycross to be especially congenial to him he had felt himself to be out of his element thereamong people with whom he had no sympathies and he felt also that he had been unfitted for this kind of thing by the life which he had led for the last few years still he undertook to stand  who is coming forward on the other side he asked mr trigger late at night when this matter had been decided in regard to himself  westmacott of course said trigger and im told that the real rads of the place have got hold of a fellow named moggs  moggs ejaculated sir thomas  yesmoggs the young mens reform association is bringing him forward hes a trades union man and a reform leaguer and all that kind of thing i shouldnt be surprised if he got in they say hes got money     chapter xxi  the liberals of percycross   yesontario moggs was appalled delighted exalted and nearly frightened out of his wits by an invitation conveyed to him by certain eager spirits of the town to come down and stand on the real radical interest for the borough of percycross the thing was not suggested to him till a day or two after sir thomas had been sounded and he was then informed that not an hour was to be lost the communication was made in the little back parlour of the cheshire cheese and moggs was expected to give an answer then and there he stood with his hand on his brow for five minutes and then asked that special question which should always come first on such occasions would it cost any money wellyes the eager spirits of percycross thought that it would cost something they were forced to admit that percycross was not one of those wellarranged boroughs in which the expenses of an election are all defrayed by the public spirit of the citizens it soon became clear that the deputation had waited upon moggs not only because moggs was a good radical but because also moggs was supposed to be a radical with a command of money ontario frowned and expressed an opinion that all elections should be made absolutely free to the candidates and everybody ought to go to eaven mr moggs said the leading member of the deputation but everybody dont cause things aint as they ought to be there was no answer to be made to this ontario could only strike his forehead and think it was clear to him that he could not give an affirmative answer that night and he therefore with some difficulty arranged an adjournment of the meeting till the following afternoon at 2 pm we must go down by the 445 express tomorrow said the leading member of the deputation who even by that arrangement would subject himself to the loss of two days wagesfor he was a foreman in the establishment of mr spicer the mustardmakerand whose allowance for expenses would not admit of his sleeping away from home a second night ontario departed promising to be ready with his answer by 2 pm on the following day  how bright with jewels was the crown now held before his eyes and yet how unapproachable how far beyond his grasp to be a member of parliament to speak in that august assembly instead of wasting his eloquence on the beery souls of those who frequented the cheshire cheese to be somebody in the land at his early agesomething so infinitely superior to a maker of boots a member of parliament was by law an esquire and therefore a gentleman ralph newton was not a member of parliamentnot half so great a fellow as a member of parliament surely if he were to go to polly neefit as a member of parliament polly would reject him no longer and to what might it not lead he had visions before his eyes of very beautiful moments in his future life in which standing as it were on some wellchosen rostrum in that great house he would make the burning thoughts of his mind the soaring aspirations of his heart audible to all the people how had cobden begun his careerand bright had it not been in this way why should not he be as greatgreater than eithergreater because in these coming days a man of the people would be able to wield a power more extensive than the people had earned for themselves in former days and then as he walked alone through the streets he took to making speechessome such speeches as he would make when he stood up in his place in the house of commons as the member for percycross the honourable member for percycross there was something ravishing in the sound would not that sound be pleasant to the ears of polly neefit  but then was not the thing as distant as it was glorious how could he be member for percycross seeing that in all matters he was subject to his father his father hated the very name of the cheshire cheese and was in every turn and feeling of his life diametrically opposed to his sons sentiments he would nevertheless go to his father and demand assistance if on such an occasion as this his father should give him a stone when he asked for bread he and his father must be two if when such a prospect as this is held out to his son he cannot see it said ontario then he can see nothing but yet he was sure that his father wouldnt see it  to his extreme astonishment mr moggs senior did see it it was some time before mr moggs senior clearly understood the proposition which was made to him but when he did he became alive to the honourand perhaps profitof having a member of his firm in parliament of politics in the abstract mr moggs senior knew very little nor indeed did he care much in matters referring to trade he was a conservative because he was a master he liked to be able to manage his people and to pay 5s 3d instead of 5s 8d for the making of a pair of boots he hated the cheshire cheese because his son went there and because his son entertained strange and injurious ideas which were propagated at that low place but if the cheshire cheese would send his son to parliament mr moggs did not know but what the cheshire cheese might be very well at any rate he undertook to pay the bills if ontario his son were brought forward as a candidate for the borough he lost his head so completely in the glory of the thing that it never occurred to him to ask what might be the probable amount of the expenditure there aint no father in all london as d do more for his son than i would if only i seed there was something in it said moggs senior with a tear in his eye moggs junior was profuse in gratitude profuse in obedience profuse in love oh heavens what a golden crown was there now within his grasp  all this occurred between the father and son early in the morning at shepherds bush whither the son had gone out to the father after a night of feverish longing and ambition they went into town together on the top of the omnibus and ontario felt that he was being carried heavenwards what a heaven had he before him even in that fortnights canvass which it would be his glory to undertake what truths he would tell to the people how he would lead them with him by political revelations that should be almost divine how he would extract from them bursts of rapturous applause to explain to them that labour is the salt of the earththat would be his mission and then how sweet to teach them the value the inestimable value of the political privilege lately accorded to themor as ontario would put it lately wrested on their behalf from the hands of an aristocracy which was more timid even than it was selfishhow sweet to explain this and then to instruct them afterwards that it was their duty now having got this great boon for themselves to see at once that it should be extended to those below them let the first work of household suffrage be a demand for manhood suffrage this had been enunciated by ontario moggs with great effect at the cheshire cheeseand now as the result of such enunciation he was going down to percycross to stand as a candidate for the borough he was almost drunk with delight as he sat upon the knifeboard of the shepherds bush omnibus thinking of it all  he too went down to percycross making a preliminary journeyas had done sir thomas underwoodtiming his arrival there a day or two after the departure of the lawyer alas he also met much to disappoint him even at that early period of the contest the people whom he was taken to see were not millionaires and tradesmen in a large way of business but leading young men of warm political temperaments this man was president of a mechanics institute that secretary to an amalgamation of unions for general improvement and a third chairman of the young mens reform association they were delighted to see him and were very civil but he soon found that they were much more anxious to teach him than they were to receive his political lessons when he began as unfortunately he did very early in his dealings with them to open out his own views he soon found that they had views also to open out he was to represent themthat is to say become the mouthpiece of their ideas he had been selected because he was supposed to have some command of money of course he would have to address the people in the mechanics hall but the chairman of the young mens reform association was very anxious to tell him what to say on that occasion i am accustomed to addressing people said ontario moggs with a considerable accession of dignity  he had the satisfaction of addressing the people and the people received him kindly but he thought he observed that the applause was greater when the secretary of the amalgamationofimprovementunions spoke and he was sure that the enthusiasm for the young mens chairman mounted much higher than had done any ardour on his own behalf and he was astonished to find that these young men were just as fluent as himself he did think indeed that they did not go quite so deep into the matter as he did that they had not thought out great questions so thoroughly but they had a way of saying things whichwhich would have told even at the cheshire cheese the result of all this was that at the end of three daysthough he was no doubt candidate for the borough of percycross and in that capacity a great man in percycrosshe did not seem to himself to be so great as he had been when he made the journey down from london there was a certain feeling that he was a catspaw brought there for certain objects which were not his objectsbecause they wanted money and some one who would be fool enough to fight a losing battle he did not reap all that meed of personal admiration for his eloquence which he expected  and then during these three days there arose another question the discussion of which embarrassed him not a little mr westmacott was in the town and there was a question whether he and mr westmacott were to join forces it was understood that mr westmacott and mr westmacotts leading friends objected to this but the chairmen of the young men and the presidents and the secretaries on the radical side put their heads together and declared that if mr westmacott were proud they would run their horse alonethey would vote for moggs and for moggs only or elseas it was whisperedthey would come to terms with griffenbottom and see that sir thomas was sent back to london the chairmen and the presidents and the secretaries were powerful enough to get the better of mr westmacott and large placards were printed setting forward the joint names of westmacott and moggs the two liberal candidates were to employ the same agent and were to canvass together this was all very wellwas the very thing which moggs should have desired but it was all arranged without any consultation with him and he felt that the objection which had been raised was personal to himself worse than all when he was brought face to face with mr westmacott he had not a word to say for himself he tried it and failed mr westmacott had been a member of parliament and was a gentleman ontario for aught he himself knew might have called upon mr westmacott for the amount of mr westmacotts little bill he caught himself calling mr westmacott sir and almost wished that he could bite out his own tongue he felt that he was a nobody in the interview and that the chairmen the secretaries and the presidents were regretting their bargain and saying among themselves that they had done very badly in bringing down ontario moggs as a candidate for their borough there were moments before he left percycross in which he was almost tempted to resign  but he left the town the accepted candidate of his special friends and was assured with many parting grasps of the hand on the platform that he would certainly be brought in at the top of the poll another little incident should be mentioned he had been asked by the electioneering agent for a small trifle of some hundred pounds towards the expenses and this by the generosity of his father he had been able to give we shall get along now like a house on fire said the agent as he pocketed the cheque up to that moment there may have been doubts upon the agents mind  as he went back to london he acknowledged to himself that he had failed hithertohe had failed in making that impression at percycross which would have been becoming to him as the future member of parliament for the borough but he gallantly resolved that he would do better in the future he would speak in such a way that the men of percycross should listen to him and admire he would make occasion for himself he thought that he could do better than mr westmacottput more stuff in what he had got to say and whatever might happen to him he would hold up his head why should he not be as good a man as westmacott it was the man that was needednot the outside trappings then he asked himself a question whether as trappings themselves were so trivial a man was necessarily mean who dealt in trappings he did not remember to have heard of a bootmaker in parliament but there should be a bootmaker in parliament soonand thus he plucked up his courage  on his journey down to percycross he had thought that immediately on his return to london he would go across to hendon and take advantage of his standing as a candidate for the borough but as he returned he resolved that he would wait till the election was over he would go to polly with all his honours on his head     chapter xxii  ralph newtons decision   ontario moggs was at percycross when ralph newton was making his formal offer to polly neefit ralph when he had made his offer returned to london with mixed feelings he had certainly been oppressed at times by the conviction that he must make the offer even though it went against the grain with him to do soand at these moments he had not failed to remind himself that he was about to make himself miserable for life because he had been weak enough to take pecuniary assistance in the hour of his temporary necessities from the hands of pollys father now he had made his offer it had not been accepted and he was still free he could see his way out of that dilemma without dishonour but then that dilemma became very much smaller to his sight when it was surmountedas is the nature with all dilemmas and the other dilemma which would have been remedied had polly accepted him again loomed very large and as he looked back at the matrimonial dilemma which he had escaped and at polly standing before him comely healthy and honest such a pleasant armful and so womanly withalso pleasant a girl if only she was not to be judged and sentenced by others beside himselfhe almost thought that that dilemma was one which he could have borne without complaint but pollys suggestion that they should allow a year to run round in order that they might learn to know each other was one which he could not entertain he had but three days in which to give an answer to his uncle and up to this time two alternatives had been open to himthe sale of his reversion and independence or polly and the future lordship of newton he had thought that there was nothing but to choose it had not occurred to him that polly would raise any objection he had felt neither fear nor hope in that direction it followed as a consequence now that the lordship must go he would not however make up his mind that it should go till the last moment  on the following morning he was thinking that he might as well go to the shop in conduit street feeling that he could encounter neefit without any qualms of conscience when mr neefit came to him this was certainly a better arrangement it was easier to talk of his own affairs sitting at ease in his own armchair than to carry on the discussion among the various sporting garments which adorned mr neefits little back room subject to interruption from customers and possibly within the hearing of mr waddle and herr bawwah neefit seated at the end of the sofa in ralphs comfortable room looking out of his saucer eyes with all his energy was in a certain degree degradingbut was not quite so degrading as neefit at his own barndoor in conduit street i was just coming to you he said as he made the breechesmaker welcome  wellyes but i thought id catch you here captain them men of mine has such long ears that german who lets on that he dont understand only just a word or two of english hears everything through a twelveinch brick wall polly told me as youd been with her  i suppose so mr neefit  oh she aint one as d keep anything from me shes open and straightforward anyways  so i found her  now look here captain ive just one word to say about her stick to her ralph was well aware that he must explain the exact circumstances in which he stood to the man who was to have been his fatherinlaw but hardly knew how to begin his explanation she aint nowise again you continued mr neefit she owned as much when i put her through her facings i did put her through her facings pretty tightly what is it that you want miss said i d you want to have a husband or d you want to be an old maid they dont like that word old maidnot as used again themselves dont any young woman  polly will never be an old maid said ralph  she owned as she didnt want that i suppose ill have to take some of em some day she said lord how pretty she did look as she said itjust laughing and crying smiling and pouting all at once she aint a bad un to look at captain  indeed she is not  nor yet to go do you stick to her thems my words d you want to have that ugly bootmaker said i he aint ugly said she d you want to have him miss said i no i dont said she well said i but i do know him said polly and i dont know mr newton no more than adam them were her very words captain do you stick to her captain ill tell you what lets all go down to margate together for a week that was mr neefits plan of action  then ralph got up from his easychair and began his explanation he couldnt very well go down to margate delightful as it would be to sit upon the sands with polly he was so situated that he must at once decide as to the sale of his property at newton mr neefit put his hands in his pockets and sat perfectly silent listening to his young friends explanation if polly would have accepted him at once ralph went on to explain everything would have been straight but as she would not do so he must take his uncles offer he had no other means of extricating himself from his embarrassments why mr neefit i could not look you in the face unless i were prepared to pay you your money he said  drat that replied neefit and then again he listened  ralph went on he could not go on long in his present condition his bill for £500 to mr horsball of the moonbeam was coming round he literally had not £20 in his possession to carry on the war his uncles offer would be withdrawn if it were not accepted the day after tomorrow nobody else would give half so much the thing must be done and thenwhy then he would have nothing to offer to polly worthy of her acceptance bother said mr neefit who had not once taken his eyes off ralphs face ralph said that that might be all very well but such were the facts you aint that soft that youre going to let em rob you of the estate said the breechesmaker in a tone of horror ralph raised his hands and his eyebrows together yesthat was what he intended to do  there shant be nothing of the kind said the breechesmaker what £7000 a year aint it all in land aint it and it must be your own let em do what they will mustnt it he paused a moment and ralph nodded his head what you have to do is to get a wifeand a son before any of em can say jack robinson lord bless you just spit at em if they talks of buying it spose the old gent was to go off all along of apperplexy the next day howd you feel then like cutting your throatwouldnt you captain  but my uncles life is very good  he aint got no receipt against kingdom come i dare say ralph was surprised by his tradesmans eloquence and wit you have a chick of your own and then youll know as itll be yours some way or other if id the chance id sooner beg borrow starve or die before id sell itlet alone working captain there was satire too as well as eloquence in the breechesmaker noyou must run your chance somehow  i dont see my way said ralph  you have got something captainsomething of your own  welljust enough to pay my debts if all were sold and buy myself a rope to hang myself  ill pay your debts captain  i couldnt hear of it mr neefit  as for not hearing of itthats bother you do hear of it now and how much more do you want to keep you you shall have what you want you meant honest along of polly yesterday and you mean honest now ralph winced but he did not deny what neefit said nor aught that was implied in the saying well bring you and polly together and i tell you shell come round ralph shook his head anyways you shall have the moneythere now well have a bit of a paper and if this marriage dont come off therell be the money to come back and five per cent when the old gent dies  but i might die first  well insure your life captain only we must be upon the square  oh yes said ralph  id rather amost lose it all than think such a chance should be missed £7000 a year and all in land when one knows how hard it is to get to think of selling it  ralph made no positive promise but when mr neefit left him there wasso at least thought mr neefitan implied understanding that the captain would at once put an end to this transaction between him and his uncle and yet ralph didnt feel quite certain the breechesmaker had been generousvery generous and very trusting but he hated the mans generosity and confidence the breechesmaker had got such a hold of him that he seemed to have lost all power of thinking and acting for himself and then such a man as he was with his staring round eyes and heavy face and dirty hands and ugly bald head there is a baldness that is handsome and noble and a baldness that is peculiarly mean and despicable neefits baldness was certainly of the latter order now moggs senior who was grey and not bald was not bad lookingat a little distance his face when closely inspected was poor and greedy but the general effect at a passing glance was not contemptible moggs might have been a banker or an officer in the commissariat or a clerk in the treasury a soninlaw would have had hopes of moggs but nothing of the kind was possible with neefit one would be forced to explain that he was a respectable tradesman in conduit street in order that he might not be taken for a dealer in potatoes from whitechapel he was hopeless and yet he had taken upon himself the absolute management of all ralph newtons affairs  ralph was very unhappy and in his misery he went to sir thomass chambers this was about four oclock in the day at which hour sir thomas was almost always in his rooms but stemm with much difficulty succeeded in making him believe that the lawyer was not at home stemm at this time was much disturbed by his masters terrible resolution to try the world again to stand for a seat in parliament and to put himself once more in the way of work and possible promotion stemm had condemned the projectbut nevertheless took glory in it what if his master should becomeshould become anything great and magnificent stemm had often groaned in silencehad groaned unconsciously that his master should be nothing he loved his master thoroughlyloving no one else in the whole worldand sympathised with him acutely still he had condemned the project theres so many of them sir thomas as is only wanting to put their fingers into somebodys eyes no doubt stemm no doubt said sir thomas and as well into mine as anothers thats it sir thomas but ill just run down and see stemm and so it had been settled stemm who had always hated ralph newton and who now regarded his masters time as more precious than ever would hardly give any answer at all to ralphs enquiries his master might be at home at fulhamprobably was where should a gentleman so likely be as at homethat is when he wasnt in chambers anyways hes not here said stemm bobbing his head and holding the door ready to close it ralph was convinced then dined at his club and afterwards went down to fulham he had heard nothing from stemm or elsewhere of the intended candidature  sir thomas was not at fulham nor did the girls know aught of his whereabouts but the great story was soon told papa was going to stand for percycross we are so glad said mary bonner bursting out into enthusiasm we walk about the garden making speeches to the electors all day oh dear i do wish we could do something  glad is no word said clarissa but if he loses it  the very trying for it is good said patience it is just the proper thing for papa  i shall feel so proud when uncle is in parliament again said mary bonner a womans pride is always vicariousbut still it is pride  ralph also was surprisedso much surprised that for a few minutes his own affairs were turned out of his head he too had thought that sir thomas would never again do anything in the worldunless that book should be written of which he had so often heard hintsthough never yet with any accuracy its name or subject sir thomas he was told had been at percycross but was not supposed to be there now of course he was in his chambers said clarissa old stemm does know how to tell lies so well it was however acknowledged that having on his hands a piece of business so very weighty sir thomas might be almost anywhere without any fault on his part a gentleman in the throes of an election for parliament could not be expected to be at home even patience did not feel called upon to regret his absence  before he went back to town ralph found himself alone with mary for a few minutes mr newton she said why dont you stand for parliament  i have not the means  you have great prospects i should have thought you were just the man who ought to make it the work of your life to get into parliament ralph began to ask himself what had been the work of his life they say that to be of real use a man ought to begin young  nobody ought to go into the house without money said ralph  that means i suppose that men shouldnt go in who want their time to earn their bread but you havent that to do if i were a man such as you are i would always try to be something i am sure parliament was meant for men having estates such as you will have  when ive got it ill think about parliament miss bonner  perhaps it will be too late then dont you know that song of excelsior mr newton you ought to learn to sing it  yeshe was learning to sing it after a fine fashionborrowing his tradesmans money and promising to marry his tradesmans daughter he was half inclined to be angry with this interference from mary bonnerand yet he liked her for it could it be that she herself felt an interest in what concerned him ah mehe said to himselfhow much better would it have been to have learned something to have fitted myself for some high work and to have been able to choose some such woman as this for my wife and all that had been sacrificed to horses at the moonbeam and little dinners with captain fooks and lieutenant cox every now and again during his life phoebus had touched his trembling ears and had given him to know that to sport with the tangles of naæras hair was not satisfactory as the work of a mans life but alas the god had intervened but to little purpose the horses at the moonbeam which had been two became four and then six and now he was pledged to marry polly neefitif only he could induce polly neefit to have him it was too late in the day for him to think now of parliament and mary bonner  and then before he left them poor clary whispered a word into his eara cousinly brotherly word such as their circumstances authorised her to make is it settled about the property ralph for she too had heard that this question of a sale was going forward  not quite clary  you wont sell it will you  i dont think i shall  oh dontpray dont anything will be better than that it is so good to wait she was thinking only of ralph and of his interests but she could not forget the lesson which she was daily teaching to herself  if i can help it i shall not sell it  papa will help youwill he not if i were you they should drag me in pieces before i would part with my birthrightand such a birthright it had occurred to her once that ralph might feel that after what had passed between them one night on the lawn he was bound not to wait that it was his duty so to settle his affairs that he might at once go to her father and saythough i shall never be mr newton of newton i have still such and such means of supporting your daughter ah if he would only be open with her and tell her everything he would soon know how unnecessary it was to make a sacrifice for her he pressed her hand as he left her and said a word that was a word of comfort clary i cannot speak with certainty but i do not think that it will be sold  i am so glad she said oh ralph never never part with it and then she blushed as she thought of what she had said could it be that he would think that she was speaking for her own sakebecause she looked forward to reigning some day as mistress of newton priory ah no ralph would never misinterpret her thoughts in a manner so unmanly as that  the day came and it was absolutely necessary that the answer should be given neefit came to prompt him again and seemed to sit on the sofa with more feeling of being at home than he had displayed before he brought his chequebook with him and laid it rather ostentatiously upon the table he had good news too from polly if mr newton would come down to margate she would be ever so glad that was the message as given by mr neefit but the reader will probably doubt that it came exactly in those words from pollys lips ralph was angry and shook his head in wrath well captain hows it to be asked mr neefit  i shall let my uncle know that i intend to keep my property said ralph with as much dignity as he knew how to assume  the breechesmaker jumped up and crowedactually crowed as might have crowed a cock it was an art that he had learned in his youth thats my lad of wax he said slapping ralph on the shoulder and now tell us how much its to be said he opening the chequebook but ralph declined to take money at the present moment endeavouring to awe the breechesmaker back into sobriety by his manner neefit did put up his chequebook but was not awed back into perfect sobriety come to me when you want it and you shall have it captain dont let that chap as as the orses be any way disagreeable you tell him he can have it all when he wants it and he canbe blowed if he cant well see it through captain and now captain whenll you come out and see polly ralph would give no definite answer to thison account of business but was induced at last to send his love to miss neefit that man will drive me into a lunatic asylum at last he said to himself as he threw himself into his armchair when neefit had departed  nevertheless he wrote his letter to his uncles lawyer mr carey as follows       club 20 sept 186     dear sir     after mature consideration i have resolved upon declining    the offer made to me by my uncle respecting the newton    property     faithfully yours     ralph newton     richard carey esq   it was very short but it seemed to him to contain all that there was to be said he might indeed have expressed regret that so much trouble had been occasionedbut the trouble had been taken not for his sake and he was not bound to denude himself of his property because his uncle had taken trouble  when the letter was put into the squires hands in mr careys private room the squire was nearly mad with rage in spite of all that his son had told him in disregard of all his own solicitors cautions in the teeth of his nephew gregorys certainty he had felt sure that the thing would be done the young man was penniless and must sell and he could sell nowhere else with circumstances so favourable and now the young man wrote a letter as though he were declining to deal about a horse its some sham some falsehood said the squire some low attorney is putting him up to thinking that he can get more out of me  its possible said mr carey but theres nothing more to be done the squire when last in london had asserted most positively that he would not increase his bid  but hes penniless said the squire  there are those about him that will put him in the way of raising money said the lawyer  and so the property will go to the hammerand i can do nothing to help it mr carey did not tell his client that a gentleman had no right to complain because he could not deal with effects which were not his own but that was the line which his thoughts took the squire walked about the room lashing himself in his rage he could not bear to be beaten how much more would do it he said at last it would be terribly bitter to him to be made to give way to be driven to increase the price but even that would be less bitter than failure  i should say nothingjust at present if i were you said mr carey the squire still walked about the room if he raises money on the estate we shall hear of it and so much of his rights as pass from him we can purchase it will be more prudent for us to wait  would another £5000 do it at once said the squire  at any rate i would not offer it said mr carey  ahyou dont understand you dont feel what it is that i want what would you say if a man told you to wait while your hand was in the fire  but you are in possession mr newton  noim not im not in possession im only a lodger in the place i can do nothing i cannot even build a farmhouse for a tenant  surely you can mr gregory  whatfor him you think that would be one of the delights of possession put my money into the ground like seed in order that the fruit may be gathered by him im not a good enough christian mr carey to take much delight in that ill tell you what it is mr carey the place is a hell upon earth to me till i can call it my own at last he left his lawyer and went back to newton priory having given instructions that the transaction should be reopened between the two lawyers and that additional money to the extent of £5000 should by degrees be offered     chapter xxiii  ill be a hypocrite if you choose   there could hardly be a more unhappy man than was the squire on his journey home he had buoyed himself up with hope till he had felt certain that he would return to newton priory its real and permanent owner no longer a lodger in the place as he had called himself to the lawyer but able to look upon every tree as his own with power to cut down every oak upon the property though as he knew very well he would rather spill blood from his veins than cut down one of them but in that case he would preserve the oakspreserve them by his own decisionbecause they were his own and because he could give them to his own son his son should cut them down if he pleased and then the power of putting up would be quite as sweet to him as the power of pulling down what pleasure would he have in making every deficient house upon the estate efficient when he knew that the stones as he laid them would not become the property of his enemy he was a man who had never spent his full income the property had been in his hands now for some fifteen years and he had already amassed a considerable sum of moneya sum which would have enabled him to buy out his nephew altogether without selling an acrepresuming the price already fixed to have been sufficient he had determined to sell something knowing that he could not do as he would do with the remainder if his hands were empty he had settled it all in his mindhow ralph his ralph must marry and have a separate income there would be no doubt about his ralphs marriage when once it should be known that his ralph was the heir to newton the bar sinister would matter but little thenwould be clean forgotten his mind had been full of all this as he had come up to london it had all been settled he had decided upon ignoring altogether those cautions which his son and nephew and lawyer had croaked into his ears this legitimate heir was a ruined spendthrift who had no alternative but to raise money no ambition but to spend money no pursuit but to waste money his temperament was so sanguine that when he entered mr careys office he had hardly doubted now everything had been upset and he was cast down from triumph into an abyss of despondency by two lines from this wretched meaningless poorspirited spendthrift i believe hed take a pleasure in seeing the property going to the dogs merely to spite me said the squire to his son as soon as he reached homehaving probably forgotten his former idea that his nephew was determined with the pertinacity of a patient farsighted jew moneylender to wring from him the last possible shilling  ralph who was not the heir was of his nature so just that he could not hear an accusation which he did not believe to be true without protesting against it the squire had called the heir a spiritless spendthrift and a malicious evildoer intent upon ruining the estate and a grasping jew all in the same breath  i think you are hard upon him sir said the son to the father  of course you think so at any rate youll say so said the squire one would suppose i was thinking only of myself to hear you talk  i know what youre thinking of said ralph slowly and i know how much i owe you  i sometimes think that you ought to curse me said the squire  after this at this moment with such words ringing in his ears ralph found it to be impossible to expostulate with his father he could only take his fathers arm and whisper a soft feminine word or two he would be as happy as the day was long if only he could see his father happy  i can never be happy till i have placed you where you would have been said the squire the gods are just and our pleasant vices make instruments to scourge us he did not quote the line to himself but the purport of it hung heavy on him and yet he thought it hard that because he had money in his pocket he could not altogether make himself free of the scourge  on the following morning he was less vituperative and less unreasonable but he was still intent upon the subject after breakfast he got his son into his own roomthe room in which he did his magistrates work and added up his accounts and kept his spuds and spursand seriously discussed the whole matter what would it be wise that they should do next you dont mean to tell me that you dont wish me to buy it said the squire no ralph would not say that if it were in the market to be bought and if the money were forthcoming of course such a purchase would be expedient the money is forthcoming said the squire we can make it up one way or another what matter if we did sell brownriggs what matter if we sold brownriggs and twining as well ralph quite acceded to this as far as buying and selling were concerned he would have acceded to anything that would have made his father happy i wont say a word against this fellow since you are so fond of him continued the squire ralph though his father paused made no reply to the intended sarcasm but you must allow that he had a reason for writing such a letter as he did  of course he had a reason said ralph  wellwell say that he wants to keep it  thats not unnatural  not at all everybody likes to keep what hes got and to get as much as he can thats nature but a man cant eat his cake and have it he has been slow to learn that no doubt but i suppose he has learned it he wouldnt have gone to sir thomas underwood in the way he did crying to be helpedif he hadnt learned it remember ralph i didnt go to him firsthe came to me you always forget that what was the meaning then of sir thomas writing to me in that pitiful wayasking me to do something for himand he who had i dont know how much something like £800 a year i take it the day he came of age  of course he has been imprudent  he cannot eat his cake and have it he wants to eat it and i want to have it i am sure it may be managed i suppose you mean to go up and see him  see ralph  why not you are not afraid of him the son smiled but made no answer you might find out from him what it is he really wantswhat he will really do those attorneys dont understand carey isnt a bad fellow and as for honesty id trust him with anything ive known him and his father all my life and in any ordinary piece of business there is no one whose opinion i would take so soon but he talks of my waiting telling me that the thing will come round after a few yearsas if what one wanted was merely an investment for ones money it isnt that  no sirit isnt that  not that at all its the feeling of the thing your lawyer may be the best man in the world to lay out your money in a speculation but he doesnt dare to buy contentment for you he doesnt see it and one hardly dares to try and make him see it id give the half of it all to have the other half but i cannot tell him that id give one half so long as that fellow wasnt to be the owner of the other well have no opposition newton in the place  the squires son was of course willing enough to go up to london he would see the heir at any rate and endeavour to learn what were the wishes of the heir you may say what money you like said the squire i hardly care what i pay so long as it is possible to pay it go up to £10000 more if that will do it  i dont think i can bargain said the son  but he can said the father at any rate you can find out whether he will name a price id go myself but i know i should quarrel with him  ralph prepared himself for the journey and as a matter of course took the parson into his confidence not telling the parson anything of the absolute sum named but explaining that it was his purpose to become acquainted with the heir and if possible to learn his views youll find ralph a very different fellow from what my uncle thinks him said the parson i shall be much mistaken if he does not tell you quite openly what he intends he is careless about money but he never was greedy and then they got to other matters you will of course see the girls at fulham said the parson  yesi shall manage to get down there  the story of gregorys passion for clarissa was well known to the other gregory who would not for worlds have spoken of such a matter among his general acquaintance who could not have brought himself to mention it in the presence of two hearers had told it all to the one companion who was nearest and dearest to himi wish i were going with you said the parson  why not come with me then  and yet i dont wish it if i were in london i doubt whether i would go there there could be no use in it  it is one of those things said ralph in which a man should never despair as long as there is a possibility  ah yes people say so i dont believe in that kind of perseverance myselfat any rate not with her she knows her own mindas well as i know mine i think i promised her that i would trouble her no more  promises like that are mere piecrusts said ralph  give her my lovethats all and dont do that unless youre alone with her i shall live it down some day no doubt but to tell the truth i have made up my mind not to marry im half inclined to think that a clergyman shouldnt marry there are some things which our ancestors understood pretty well although we think they were such fools i should like to see the new cousin certainly  ralph said nothing more about the new cousin and was perhaps hardly aware how greatly the idea of again seeing the new cousin had enhanced the pleasure of his journey to london about a week after this he started having devoted nearly all the afternoon before he went to the packing of a large basket of fernsto each root or small bundle of which was appended a long name in latinas an offering to patience underwood and yet he did not care very much for patience underwood  it was just the end of septemberthe last day of september when he reached london ralph the heir was out of town and the servant at his lodging professed she did not know where he was she thought it probable that he was at mr orsballsmr orsball of the moonbeam barnfieldalooking after his orses she suggested this not from any knowledge in her possession but because ralph was always believed to go to the moonbeam when he left town he would however be back next week his namesake therefore did not consider that it would be expedient for him to follow the heir down to the moonbeam  but the underwood girls would certainly be at fulham and he started at once with his ferns for popham villa he found them at home and singular to say he found sir thomas there also on the very next morning sir thomas was to start for percycross to commence the actual work of his canvass the canvass was to occupy a fortnight and on monday the sixteenth the candidates were to be nominated tuesday the seventeenth was the day of the election the whole household was so full of the subject that at first there was hardly room for the ferns oh mr newton we are so much obliged to you papa is going to stand for percycross that or nearly that was the form in which the ferns were received newton was quite contented an excuse for entering the house was what he had wanted and his excuse was deemed ample sir thomas who was disposed to be very civil to the stranger had not much to say about his own prospects to a certain degree he was ashamed of percycross and had said very little about it even to stemm since his personal acquaintance had been made with messrs spiveycomb pile and pabsby but the girls were not ashamed of percycross to them as yet percycross was the noblest of all british boroughs had not the conservatives of percycross chosen their father to be their representative out of all british subjects sir thomas had tried but had tried quite in vain to make them understand the real fashion of the selection if percycross would only send him to parliament percycross should be divine what dyou think said clary theres a man of the name of i wish youd guess the name of this man who is going to stand against papa mr newton  the name wont make much difference said sir thomas  ontario moggs said clary do you think it possible mr newton that percycrossthe town where one of the percys set up a cross in the time of the crusadersdidnt he papa  i shall not consider myself bound to learn all that unless they elect me said sir thomas but i dont think there were percys in the days of the crusaders  at any rate the proper name is percy st cross said clary could such a borough choose ontario moggs to be one of its members mr newton  i do like the name said mary bonner  perhaps papa and ontario moggs may be the two members said clary laughing if so you must bring him down here papa only hes a shoemaker  that makes no difference in these days said sir thomas  the ferns were at last unpacked and the three girls were profuse in their thanks who does not know how large a space a basket of ferns will cover when it is unpacked and how large the treasure looms theyll cover the rocks on the other side said mary it seemed to newton that mary bonner was more at home than she had been when he had seen her before spoke more freely of what concerned the house and was beginning to become one of the family but still she was as it were overshadowed by clarissa in appearance indeed she was the queen among the three but in active social life she did not compete with clary patience stood as a statue on a pedestal by no means unobserved and ignored beautiful in form but colourless newton as he looked at the three wondered that a man so quiet and gentle as the young parson should have chosen such a love as clary underwood he remained half the day at the villa dining there at the invitation of sir thomas my last dinner said sir thomas unless i am lucky enough to be rejected men when they are canvassing never dineand not often after theyre elected  the guest had not much opportunity of ingratiating himself specially with the beauty but the beauty did so far ingratiate herself with himunconsciously on her partthat he half resolved that should his father be successful in his present enterprise he would ask mary bonner to be the queen of newton priory his father had often urged him to marrynever suggesting that any other quality beyond good looks would be required in his sons wife he had never spoken of money or birth or name i have an idea he had said laughing that youll marry a fright some day i own i should like to have a pretty woman about the house one doesnt expect much from a woman but she is bound to be pretty this woman was at any rate pretty pretty indeed was it possible that any woman should be framed more lovely than this one but he must bide his time he would not ask any girl to marry him till he should know what position he could ask her to fill but though he spoke little to mary he treated her as men do treat women whom they desire to be allowed to love there was a tone in his voice a worship in his eye and a flush upon his face and a hesitation in his manner which told the story at any rate to one of the party there he didnt come to bring you the ferns said clarissa to patience  he brought them for all of us said patience  young men dont go about with ferns for the sake of the ferns said clary they were merely an excuse to come and see mary  why shouldnt he come and see mary  he has my leave patty i think it would be excellent isnt it odd that there should be two ralph newtons one would be mrs newton and the other mrs ralph  clarissa clarissa said patience almost in a tone of agony  ill be a hypocrite if you choose patty said clarissa or ill be true but you cant have me both at once patience said nothing further then the lesson of selfrestraint which she desired to teach was very hard of teaching  there was just a word spoken between sir thomas and newton about the property i intend to see ralph newton if i can find him said ralph who was not the heir  i dont think he is far from town said sir thomas  my father thinks that we might come to an understanding  perhaps so said sir thomas  i have no strong anxiety on the subject myself said newton but my father thinks that if he does wish to sell his reversion  he doesnt wish it how can a man wish it  under the circumstances it may be desirable  you had better see him and i think he will tell you said sir thomas you must understand that a man thinks much of such a position pray come to us again we shall always be glad to see you when you are in town     chapter xxiv  i find i must   ralph the heir had after all gone to margate mr neefit had got such a hold upon him that he had no help for it he found himself forced to go to margate when he was asked the second and third time with all the energy of mr neefits eloquence he was unable to resist what reason could he give that he should not go to margate seeing that it was a thing quite understood that he was to endeavour to persuade polly to be his wife neefit came to him two mornings running catching him each morning just as he was smoking his cigar after breakfast and was very eloquent he already owed mr neefit over five hundred pounds and the debt on the first of these mornings was made up to one thousand pounds a receipt being given for the shop debt on one side and a bond for the whole money with 5 per cent interest being taken in return for it youd better pay off what little things you owes captain said the generous breechesmaker and then when the time comes well settle with the gent about the orses neefit played his game very well he said not a word about selling the horses or as to any restriction on his young captains amusements if you pull at your fish too hard you only break your line neefit had a very fine fish on his hook and he meant to land it not a word was said about margate on that occasion till the little pecuniary transaction was completed then the captain was informed that the neefit family would certainly spend the next week at that marine paradise and that polly expected the captains company thems the places said neefit where a girl grows soft as butter this he said when the doorhandle was in his hand so that the captain had no chance of answering him then he came again the next morning and returned to the subject as though the captain had already consented there was a near approach to anger on one side and determined opposition on the other during this interview but it ended in acquiescence on the captains side then mr neefit was once more as gracious as possible the graciousness of such men in acknowledging their own inferiority is sometimes wonderful you neednt be seen about with me you know said mr neefit this was said after ralph had positively declared that he would not go actually with the neefits and occupy the same apartments it would be altogether wrongfor pollys sake said ralph looking very wise and very moral to this view neefit assented not being quite sure how far the captain might be correct in his ideas of morality  theyve been and fixed young newton for polly said mr waddle that morning to his friend herr bawwah when he was told to mark off ralphs account in the books as settled dashed if they avent the german grunted old neverfits aplaying at igh game aint he such was the most undeserved nickname by which this excellent tradesman was known in his own establishment i dont see nodin about igh said the german he aint got no money i call it low waddle endeavoured to explain the circumstances but failed de peoples should be de peoples and de nobles should be de nobles said herr bawwaha doctrine which was again unintelligible to mr waddle  ralph having overcome an intense desire to throw over his engagement to sell his horses and to start for jerusalem did go down to margate he put himself up at an hotel there eat his dinner lighted a cigar and went down upon the sands it was growing dusk and he thought that he should be aloneor at least uninterrupted in a crowd the crowd was there and nobody in the place would know himexcept the neefits he had not been on the sands two minutes before he encountered mr neefit and his daughter the breechesmaker talked loud and was extremely happy polly smiled and was very pretty in two minutes neefit saw or pretended to see a friend and ralph was left with his ladylove there never was so goodnatured a father youll bring her home to tea captain said the father as he walked off  on that occasion ralph abstained from all direct lovemaking and polly when she found that it was to be so made herself very pleasant the idea of your being at margate mr newton said polly  why not i as well as another  oh i dont know brighton or some of those french places or any where all about the world would be more likely for you i should think  margate seems to be very jolly  oh i like it but then we are not swells you know have you heard the news ontario moggs is going to stand to be member of parliament for percycross  my rival that was the only word he uttered approaching to the subject of love  i dont know anything about that mr newton but its true  why sir thomas underwood is going to stand  i dont know anything about anybody else but ontario moggs is going to stand i do so hope hell get in they say he speaks quite beautiful did you ever hear him  i never heard him  ah you may laugh but a bootmaker can make a speech sometimes as well asas well as a peer of parliament father says that old mr moggs has given him ever so much money to do it when a man is in parliament mr newton doesnt that make him a gentleman  no  what then  nothing on earth can make a man a gentleman you dont understand latin polly  no i hope that isnt necessary for a young woman  by no means but a poet is born and cant be made  im not talking of poets ontario moggs is a poet but i know what you mean theres something better even than to be a gentleman  one may be an angelas you are polly  ohmeim not thinking of myself im thinking of ontario moggsgoing into parliament but then he is so clever  ralph was not minded to be cut out by moggs junior after coming all the way to margate after his ladylove the thing was to be done and he would do it but not tonight then he took polly home and eat prawns with mr and mrs neefit on the next day they all went out together in a boat  the week was nearly over and ralph had renewed his suit more than once when the breechesmaker proceeded to put him through his facings shes acoming round aint she captain said mr neefit by this time ralph hated the sight of neefit so thoroughly that he was hardly able to repress the feeling indeed he did not repress it whether neefit did not see it or seeing it chose to ignore the matter cannot be said he was at any rate as courteous as ever mrs neefit overcome partly by her husbands authority and partly induced to believe that as ontario moggs was going into parliament he was no longer to be regarded as a possible husband had yielded and was most polite to the lover when he came in of an evening she always gave him a double allowance of prawns and hoped that the tea was to his liking but she said very little more than this standing somewhat in awe of him polly had been changeable consenting to walk with him every day but always staving the matter off when he asked her whether she thought that she yet knew him well enough to be his wife oh not half well enough she would say and then perhaps you know im not over fond of the half that i do know and so it was up to the last evening when the father put him through his facings in respect of the captains behaviour to polly the father had no just ground of complaint for ralph had done his best indeed ralph was fond enough of polly and it was hard for a man to be much with her without becoming fond of her shes acoming round aint she captain said mr neefit  i cant say that she is said ralph turning upon his heel near the end of the pier  you dont stick to her fast enough captain  this was not to be borne ill tell you what it is mr neefit said ralph youd better let me alone or else i shall be off  youd only have to come back captain you know said neefit not as i want to interfere youre on the square i see that as long as youre on the square there aint nothing i wont do i aint ablaming youonly stick to her damn it all said ralph turning round again in the other direction but there was neefit still confronting him only stick to her captain and well pull through ill put her through her facings tonight shes thinking of that orkard lout of a fellow just because hes standing to be a parlament gent this did not improve matters and ralph absolutely ran awayran away and escaped to his hotel he would try again in the morning would still make her his wife if she would have him and then swore a solemn oath that in such case he would never see his fatherinlaw again  polly was not at all averse to giving him opportunities they were together on the sands on the next morning and he then asked her very seriously whether she did not think that there had been enough of this that they might make up their minds to love each other and be married as it were out of hand her father and mother wished it and what was there against it you cannot doubt that i am in earnest now polly he said  i know you are in earnest well enough she answered  and you do not doubt that i love you  i doubt very much whether you love father said polly she spoke this so sharp and quickly that he had no reply ready if you and i were to be married where should we live i should want to have father and mother with me youd mean that i suppose the girl had read his thoughts and he hadnt a word to say for himself the truth is you despise father mr newton  no indeed  yes you do i can see it and perhaps its all right that you should im not saying of course hes not like you and your people how should he be only im thinking like should marry like  polly youre fit for any position in which a man could place you  no im not im not fit for any place as father wouldnt be fit for too id make a better hand at it than father i dare saybecause im younger but i wont go anywhere where folk is to be ashamed of father id like to be a lady well enoughbut itd go against the very grain of my heart if i had a house and he wasnt to be made welcome to the best of everything  polly youre an angel  im a young woman who knows whos been good to me hes to give me pretty nigh everything you wouldnt be taking me if it wasnt for that and then after all im to turn my back on him because he aint like your people no never mr newton youre well enough mr newton more than good enough for me no doubt but i wont do it id cut my heart out if i was turning my back upon father she had spoken out with a vengeance and ralph didnt know that there was any more to be said he couldnt bring himself to assure her that mr neefit would be a welcome guest in his house at this moment the breechesmaker was so personally distasteful to him that he had not force enough in him to tell a lie upon the matter they were now at the entrance of the pier at which their ways would separate goodbye mr newton said she there had better be an end of ithadnt there goodbye polly he said pressing her hand as he left her  polly walked up home with a quick step with a tear in her eye and with grave thoughts in her heart it would have been very nice she could have loved him and she felt the attraction and the softness and the sweetsmelling delicateness of gentle associations it would have been very nice but she could not sever herself from her father she could understand that he must be distasteful to such a man as ralph newton she would not blame ralph but the fact that it was so shut for her the door of that elysium she knew that she could not be happy were she to be taken to such a mode of life as would force her to accuse herself of ingratitude to her father and so ralph went back to town without again seeing the breechesmaker  the first thing he found in his lodgings was a note from his namesake      dear sir     i am up in town and am very anxious to see you in respect    of the arrangements which have been proposed respecting    the property will you fix a meeting as soon as you are    back     yours always     ralph newton     charing cross hotel 2 oct 186   of course he would see his namesake why not and why not take his uncles money and pay off neefit and have done with it neefit must be paid off let the money come from where it would he called at the hotel and not finding his cousin left a note asking him to breakfast on the following morning and then he spent the remainder of that day in renewed doubt he was so sick of neefitwhose manner of eating shrimps had been a great offence added to other offences and yet one of his great sorrows was that he should lose polly polly in her way was perfect and he felt almost sure now that polly loved him girls had no right to cling to their fathers after marriage there was scripture warranty against it and yet the manner in which she had spoken of her father had greatly added to his admiration  the two ralphs breakfasted together not having met each other since they were children and having even then scarcely known each other ralph the heir had been brought up a boy at the parsonage of newton peele but the other ralph had never been taken to newton till after his grandfathers death the late parson had died within twelve months of his fathera wretched year during which the squire and the parson had always squabbledand then ralph who was the heir had been transferred to the guardianship of sir thomas underwood it was only during the holidays of that one year that the two ralphs had been together the dear sir will probably be understood by the discerning reader the squires son had never allowed himself to call even gregory his cousin ralph the heir in writing back had addressed him as dear ralph the squires son thought that that was very well but chose that any such term of familiarity should come first from him who was in truth a newton he felt his condition though he was accustomed to make so light of it to his father  the two young men shook hands together cordially and were soon at work upon their eggs and kidneys they immediately began about gregory and the parsonage and the church and the big house the heir to the property though he had not been at newton for fourteen years remembered well its slopes and lawns and knolls and little valleys he asked after this tree and that of this old man and that old woman of the game and the river fishery and the fox coverts and the otters of which three or four were reputed to be left when he was there otters it seems were gone but the foxes were there in plenty my father would be half mad if they drew the place blank said the squires son  does my uncle hunt much  every monday and saturday and very often on the wednesday  and you  i call myself a threeday man but i often make a fourth garth must be very far off if he dont see me i dont do much with any other pack  does my uncle ride  yes he goes pretty wellhe says he dont if he gets well away i think he rides as hard as ever he did he dont like a stern chace  no more do i said ralph the heir but im often driven to make it what can a fellow do an old chap turns round and goes home and doesnt feel ashamed of himself but we cant do that thats the time when one ruins his horses then he told all about the moonbeam and the b  b and his own stud the morning was half gone and not a word had been said about business  the squires son felt that it was so and rushed at the subject all in a hurry i told you what i have come up to town about  oh yes i understand  i suppose i may speak plainly said the squires son  why not said ralph the heir  well i dont know of course its best you wrote to carey you know  yes i wrote the very moment i had made up my mind  you had made up your mind then  ralph had certainly made up his mind when he wrote the letter of which they were speaking but he was by no means sure but that his mind was not made up now in another direction since he had become so closely intimate with mr neefit and since polly had so clearly explained to him her ideas as to paternal duty his mind had veered round many points yes said he i had made up my mind  i dont suppose it can be of any use for you and me to be bargaining together said the other ralph  not in the least  of course its a great thing to be heir to newton its a nice property and all that only my father thought  he thought that i wanted money said ralph the heir  just that  so i do god knows i do i would tell you everything i would indeed as to screwing a hard bargain im the last man in london who would do it i thought that your father might be willing to buy half the property  he wont do that you see the great thing is the house and park we should both want thatshouldnt we of course it must be yours and i feeli dont know how i feel in asking you whether you want to sell it  you neednt mind that ralph  if you dont think the sum the lawyers and those chaps fixed is enough  then ralph the heir interrupting him rose from his chair and spoke out my uncle has never understood me and never will he thinks hardly of me and if he chooses to do so i cant help it he hasnt seen me for fourteen years and of course he is entitled to think what he pleases if he would have seen me the thing might have been easier  dont let us go back to that ralph said the squires son  i dont want to go back to anything when it comes to a fellows parting with such prospects as mine it does come very hard upon him of course its my own fault i might have got along well enoughonly i havent i am hard up for moneyvery hard up and yetif you were in my place you wouldnt like to part with it  perhaps not said the squires son not knowing what to say  as to bargaining and asking so much more and all the rest of it thats out of the question somebody fixed a price and i suppose he knew what he was at  that was a minimum price  i understand it was all fair i dont doubt it didnt seem a great deal but your father might live for thirty years  i hope he will said the squires son  as for standing off for more money i never dreamed of such a thing if your father thinks that he has wronged me but i believe he always does wrong me and about the building and the trees and the leases and the house he might do just as he pleased for me i have never said a word and never shall i must say i sometimes think he has been hard upon me in fourteen years he has never asked me to set my foot upon the estate that i might see the place which must one day be mine  this was an accusation which the squires son found it very difficult to answer it could not be answered without a reference to his own birth and it was almost impossible that he should explain his fathers feelings on the subject if this were settled we should be glad that you would come he said  yes said ralph the heir yesif i consented to give up everything that is mine by right do you think that a fellow can bring himself to abandon all that so easily its like tearing a fellows heart out of him if ill do that my uncle will let me come and see what it is that i have lost that which would induce him to welcome me would make it impossible that i should go there it may be that i shall sell it i suppose i shall but i will never look at it afterwards as it came to this point the tears were streaming down his cheeks and the eyes of the other ralph were not dry  i wish it could be made pleasant for us all said the squires son the wish was well enough but the expression of it was hardly needed because it must be so general  but all this is rot and nonsense said ralph the heir brushing the tears away from his eyes and i am only making an ass of myself your father wants to know whether i will sell the reversion to newton priory i will i find i must i dont know whether i wouldnt sooner cut my throat but unless i cut my throat i must sell it i had a means of escape but that has gone by when i wrote that letter there was a means of escape now theres none  ralph said the other  well speak on ive about said all ive got to say only dont think i want to ballyrag about the money thats right enough no doubt if theres more to come the people that have to look to it will say so im not going to be a jew about it  ralph i wouldnt do anything in a hurry i wont take your answer in a hurry like this  its no good my dear fellow i must do it i must have £5000 at once  you can get that from an insurance office  and then i should have nothing to live on i must do it i have no way out of itexcept cutting my throat  the squires son paused a moment thinking i was told by my father said he to offer you more money  if its worth more the people will say so said ralph the heir impetuously i do not want to sell it for more than its worth ask them to settle it immediately there are people i must pay money to at once  and so the squires son had done the squires errand when he reported his success to mr carey that gentleman asked him whether he had the heirs consent in writing at this the successful buyer was almost disposed to be angry but mr carey softened him by an acknowledgment that he had done more than could have been expected ill see his lawyer tomorrow said mr carey and then unless he changes his mind again well soon have it settled after that the triumphant negotiator sent a telegram home to his father it is settled and the purchase is made     chapter xxv  mr griffenbottom   on monday the 16th of october sir thomas underwood went down to percycross and the first information given him was that mr westmacott and ontario moggs had arrived on the saturday and were already at work mr griffenbottom was expected early on the tuesday theyve stolen a march on us then said sir thomas to mr trigger  give em rope enough and theyll hang themselves replied the managing agent there was moggs spouting to them on his own hook on saturday night and westmacotts chaps are ready to eat him and he wanted to be doing it yesterday sunday only some of them got a hold of him and wouldnt let him loose moggs is a great card for us sir thomas theres nothing like one of them spouting fellows to overset the coach  mr westmacott is fond of that too said sir thomas  he understands hes used to it he does it in the proper place westmacott wasnt a bad member for the placewasnt perhaps quite free enough with his money but westmacott was very decent sir thomas could not help feeling that trigger spoke of it as though he wished that the two old members might be returned ah well had it been possible mr trigger would have wished it mr trigger understood the borough knew well the rocks before them and would have wished italthough he had been so imperative with mr griffenbottom as to the second conservative candidate and now mr griffenbottom had sent them a man who would throw all the fat in the fire by talking of purity of election and moggs has been making a fool of himself in another direction said trigger thinking that no opportunity for giving a valuable hint should be lost hes been telling the working men already that theyll be scoundrels and knaves if they take so much as a glass of beer without paying for it  scoundrel is a strong word said sir thomas but i like him for that  percycross wont like him men would rather have all that left to their own feelings they who want beer or money certainly wont thank him and they who dont want it dont like to be suspected  every one will take it as addressed to his neighbour and not to himself  we are very fond of our neighbours here sir thomas and that kind of thing wont go down this was on the evening of the candidates arrival and the conversation was going on absolutely while sir thomas was eating his dinner he had asked mr trigger to join him and mr trigger had faintly alleged that he had dined at three but he soon so far changed his mind as to be able to express an opinion that he could pick a bit and he did pick a bit after which he drank the best part of a bottle of porthaving assured sir thomas that the port at the percy standard was a sort of wine that one didnt get every day and as he drank his port he continued to pour in lessons of wisdom sir thomas employed his mind the while in wondering when mr trigger would go away and forecasting whether mr trigger would desire to drink port wine at the percy standard every evening during the process of canvassing about nine oclock the waiter announced that a few gentlemen below desired to see sir thomas our friends said mr trigger just put chairs and bring a couple of bottles of port john im glad theyre come sir thomas because it shows that they mean to take to you up they were shown messrs spiveycomb spicer pile roodylandsthe bootmaker who has not yet been namedpabsby and seven or eight others sir thomas shook hands with them all he observed that mr trigger was especially cordial in his treatment of spicer the mustardmakeras to whose defection he had been so fearful in consequence of certain power which mr westmacott might have in the wholesale disposal of mustard i hope you find yourself better said mr pile opening the conversation sir thomas assured his new friend that he was pretty well cause you seemed rayther down on your luck when you was here before said mr pile  no need for that said spicer the man of mustard is there trigger trigger sat a little apart with one bottle of port wine at his elbow and took no part in the conversation he was aware that his opportunities were so great that the outside supporters ought to have their time any objection to this sir thomas he said taking a cigarcase out of his pocket sir thomas who hated tobacco of course gave permission trigger rang the bell ordered cigars for the party and then sat apart with his port wine in ten minutes sir thomas hardly knew where he was so dense was the cloud of smoke  sir thomas began mr pabsbyif i could only clearly see my way  youll see it clear enough before nominationday said mr pile  any ways after election said a conservative grocer both these gentlemen belonged to the established church and delighted in snubbing mr pabsby indeed mr pabsby had no business at this meeting and so he had been told very plainly by one or two as he had joined them in the street he explained however that his friend sir thomas had come to him the very first person in percycross and he carried his point in joining the party but he was a mild man and when he was interrupted he merely bided another opportunity  i hope sir thomas your mind is made up to do something for our trade said mr roodylands  whats the matter with your trade said spiveycomb the papermaker  wellwe aint got no jobs in itthats the matter said mr pile  as for jobs whats the odds said a big and burly loudmouthed tanner all on us likes a good thing when it comes in our way stow that and dont lets be told about jobs sir thomas heres your health and i wish you at the top of the pollthat is next to mr griffenbottom then they all drank to sir thomass health mr pabsby filling himself a bumper for the occasion  it was eleven before they went away at which time mr pabsby had three times got as far as a declaration of his wish to see things clearly further than this he could not get but still he went away in perfect good humour he would have another opportunity as he took occasion to whisper when he shook hands with the candidate trigger stayed even yet for halfanhour dont waste your time on that fellow pabsby he said no i wont said sir thomas and be very civil to old pile he doesnt seem disposed to return the compliment said sir thomas but he doesnt want your interest in the borough said trigger with the air of a man who had great truths to teach in electioneering sir thomas its mostly the same as in other matters nothings to be had for nothing if you were a retail seller of boots from manchester old pile would be civil enough to you you may snub spicer as much as you please because hell expect to get something out of you hell be very much deceived said sir thomas im not so sure of that said triggerspicer knows what hes about pretty well then at last mr trigger went assuring sir thomas most enthusiastically that he would be with him before nine the next morning  many distressing thoughts took possession of sir thomas as he lay in bed he had made up his mind that he would in no way break the law and he didnt know whether he had not broken it already by giving these people tobacco and wine and yet it would have been impossible for him to have refused mr trigger permission to order the supply even for the sake of the seateven for the sake of his reputation which was so much dearer to him than the seathe could not have bidden guests who had come to him in his own room to go elsewhere if they required wine it was a thing not to be done and yet for aught he knew mr trigger might continue to order food and wine and beer and tobacco to be supplied ad libitum and whenever he chose how was he to put an end to it otherwise than by throwing up the game and going back to london that now would be gross illusage to the conservatives of percycross who by such a step would be left in the lurch without a candidate and then was it to be expected that he should live for a week with mr trigger with no other relief than that which would be afforded by messrs pile spiveycomb and co everything about him was reeking of tobacco and then when he sat down to breakfast at nine oclock there would be mr trigger  the next morning he was out of bed at seven and ordered his breakfast at eight sharp he would steal a march on trigger he went out into the sittingroom and there was trigger already seated in the armchair studying the list of the voters of percycross heavens what a man i thought id look in early and they told me you were coming out or id have just stepped into your room into his very bedroom sir thomas shuddered as he heard the proposition weve a telegram from griffenbottom continued trigger and he wont be here till noon we cant begin till he comes  ahthen i can just write a few letters said sir thomas  i wouldnt mind letters now if i was you if you dont mind well go and look up the parsons there are four or five of em and they like to be seennot in the way of canvassing theyre all right of course and theres two of em wont leave a stone unturned in the outside hamlets but they like to be seen and their wives like it whereupon mr trigger ordered breakfastand eat it sir thomas reminded himself that a fortnight was after all but a short duration of time he might live through a fortnightprobablyand then when mr griffenbottom came it would be shared between two  at noon he returned to the percy standard very tired there to await the coming of mr griffenbottom mr griffenbottom didnt come till three and then bustled up into the sittingroom which sir thomas had thought was his own as though all percycross belonged to him during the last three hours supporters had been in and out continually and mr pabsby had made an ineffectual attempt or two to catch sir thomas alone trigger had been going up and down between the standard and the station various men friends and supporters of griffenbottom and underwood had been brought to him who were paid agents who were wealthy townsmen who were canvassers and messengers he did not know there were bottles on the sideboard the whole time sir thomas in a speculative manner endeavouring to realise to himself the individuality of this and that stranger could only conceive that they who helped themselves were wealthy townsmen and that they who waited till they were asked by others were paid canvassers and agents but he knew nothing and could only wish himself back in southampton buildings  at last mr griffenbottom followed by a cloud of supporters bustled into the room trigger at once introduced the two candidates very glad to meet you said griffenbottom so were going to fight this little battle together i remember you in the house you know and i dare say you remember me im used to this kind of thing i suppose you aint well trigger how are things looking i suppose wed better begin down pump lane i know my way about the place honeywood as well as if it was my bedroom and so i ought trigger  i suppose youve seen the inside of pretty nearly every house in percycross said trigger  theres some i dont want to see the inside of any more i can tell you that how are these new householders going to vote  betwixt and between mr griffenbottom  i never thought we should find much difference it dont matter what rent a man pays but what he does i could tell you how nineteen out of twenty men here would vote if youd tell me what they did and who they were whats to be done about talking to em  tomorrow night were to be in the town hall mr griffenbottom and thursday an openair meeting with a balcony in the marketplace  all right come along are you good at spinning yarns to them honeywood  i dont like it if you mean that said sir thomas  its better than canvassing by george anything is better than that come along we may get pump lane and petticoat yard and those back alleys done before dinner youve got cards of course trigger and the old accustomed electioneerer led the way out to his work  mr griffenbottom was a heavy hale man over sixty somewhat inclined to be corpulent with a red face and a look of assured impudence about him which nothing could quell or diminish the kind of life which he had led was one to which impudence was essentially necessary he had done nothing for the world to justify him in assuming the airs of a great manbut still he could assume them and many believed in him he could boast neither birth nor talent nor witnor indeed wealth in the ordinary sense of the word though he had worked hard all his life at the business to which he belonged he was a poorer man now than he had been thirty years ago it had all gone in procuring him a seat in parliament and he had so much sense that he never complained he had known what it was that he wanted and what it was that he must pay for it he had paid for it and had got it and was in his fashion contented if he could only have continued to have it without paying for it again how great would have been the blessing but he was a man who knew that such blessings were not to be expected after the first feeling of disgust was over on the receipt of triggers letter he put his collar to the work again and was prepared to draw his purseintending of course that the new candidate should bear as much as possible of this drain he knew well that there was a prospect before him of abject miseryfor life without parliament would be such to him there would be no salt left for him in the earth if he was ousted and yet no man could say why he should have cared to sit in parliament he rarely spoke and when he did no one listened to him he was anxious for no political measures he was a favourite with no section of a party he spent all his evenings at the house but it can hardly be imagined that those evenings were pleasantly spent but he rubbed his shoulders against the shoulders of great men and occasionally stood upon their staircases at any rate such as was the life it was his life and he had no time left to choose another he considered himself on this occasion pretty nearly sure to be elected he knew the borough and was sure but then there was that accursed system of petitioning which according to his idea was unenglish ungentlemanlike and unpatriotica standup fight and if youre lickedtake it that was his idea of what an election should be  sir thomas who only just remembered the appearance of the man in the house at once took an extravagant dislike to him it was abominable to him to be called underwood by a man who did not know him it was nauseous to him to be forced into close relations with a man who seemed to him to be rough and illmannered and judging from what he saw he gave his colleague credit for no good qualities now mr griffenbottom had good qualities he was possessed of pluck he was in the main goodnatured and though he could resent an offence with ferocity he could forgive an offence with ease hit him hard and then have an end of it that was mr griffenbottoms mode of dealing with the offenders and the offences with which he came in contact  in every house they entered griffenbottom was at home and sir thomas was a stranger of whom the inmates had barely heard the name griffenbottom was very good at canvassing the poorer classes he said not a word to them about politics but asked them all whether they didnt dislike that fellow gladstone who was one thing one day and another thing another day by g nobody knows what he is swore mr griffenbottom over and over again the women mostly said that they didnt know but they liked the blue blues allays was gallanter nor the yellow said one of em they who expressed an opinion at all hoped that their husbands would vote for him as d do most for em the big loafthats what we want said one mother of many children taking sir thomas by the hand there were some who took advantage of the occasion to pour out their tales of daily griefs into the ears of their visitors to these griffenbottom was rather short and hard what we want my dear is your husbands vote and interest well hear all the rest another time sir thomas would have lingered and listened but griffenbottom knew that 1400 voters had to be visited in ten days and work as they would they could not see 140 a day trigger explained it all to sir thomas you cant work above seven hours and you cant do twenty an hour and much of the ground you must do twice over if you stay to talk to them you might as well be in london mr griffenbottom understands it so well youd better keep your eye on him there could be no object in the world on which sir thomas was less desirous of keeping his eye   illustration the big loafthats what we want said one mother of many children taking sir thomas by the hand   the men who were much more difficult to find than the women had generally less to say for themselves most of them understood at once what was wanted and promised for it must be understood that on this their first day the conservative brigade was moving among its firm friends in petticoat yard lived papermakers in the employment of mr spiveycomb and in pump lane the majority of the inhabitants were employed by mr spicer of the mustard works the manufactories of both these men were visited and there the voters were booked much quicker than at the rate of twenty an hour here and there a man would hold some peculiar opinion of his own the permissive bill was asked for by an energetic teetotaller and others even in these tory quarters suggested the ballot but they allor nearly all of thempromised their votes now and again some sturdy fellow seeming to be half ashamed of himself in opposing all those around him would say shortly that he meant to vote for moggs and pass on you dodo you sir thomas heard mr spicer say to one such man yes i does said the man sir thomas heard no more but he felt how perilous was the position on which a candidate stood under the present law  as regarded sir thomas himself he felt as the evening was coming on that he had hardly done his share of the work mr griffenbottom had canvassed and he had walked behind every now and then he had attempted a little conversation but in that he had been immediately pulled up by the conscientious and energetic mr trigger as for asking for votes he hardly knew when he had been carried back into the main street through a labyrinth of alleys at the back of petticoat yard whether he had asked any man for his vote or not with the booking of the votes he had of course nothing to do there were three men with booksand three other men to open the doors show the way and make suggestions on the expediency of going hither or thither sir thomas would always have been last in the procession had there not been one silent civil person whose duty it seemed to be to bring up the rear if ever sir thomas lingered behind to speak to a poor woman there was this silent civil person lingering too the influence of the silent civil person was so strong that sir thomas could not linger much  as they came into the main street they encountered the opposition party mr westmacott ontario moggs and their supporters ill introduce you said mr griffenbottom to his colleague come along its the thing to do then they met in the middle of the way poor ontario was hanging behind but holding up his head gallantly and endeavouring to look as though he were equal to the occasion griffenbottom and westmacott shook hands cordially and complained with mutual sighs that household suffrage had made the work a deal harder than ever and im only a week up from the gout said griffenbottom then sir thomas and westmacott were introduced and at last ontario was brought forward he bowed and attempted to make a little speech but nobody in one army or in the other seemed to care much for poor ontario he knew that it was so but that mattered little to him if he were destined to represent percycross in parliament it must be by the free votes and unbiassed political aspirations of the honest working men of the borough so remembering he stood aloof stuck his hand into his breast and held up his head something higher than before though the candidates had thus greeted each other at this chance meeting the other parties in the contending armies had exhibited no courtesies  the weariness of sir thomas when this first days canvass was over was so great that he was tempted to go to bed and ask for a bowl of gruel nothing kept him from doing so but amazement at the courage and endurance of mr griffenbottom we could get at a few of those chaps who were at the works if we went out at eight said griffenbottom trigger suggested that mr griffenbottom would be very tired trigger himself was perhaps tired oh tired said griffenbottom a man has to be tired at this work sir thomas perceived that griffenbottom was at least ten years his senior and that he was still almost lame from the gout youll be ready underwood said griffenbottom sir thomas felt himself bound to undertake whatever might be thought necessary if we were at it day and night it wouldnt be too much said griffenbottom as he prepared to amuse himself with one of the pollbooks till dinner should be on the table didnt we see jacob pucky asked the energetic candidate observing that the mans name wasnt marked to be sure we did i was speaking to him myself he was one of those who didnt know till the day came we know what that means eh honeywood sir thomas wasnt quite sure that he did know but he presumed that it meant something dishonest again mr trigger dined with them and as soon as ever their dinner was swallowed they were out again at their work sir thomas being dragged from door to door while griffenbottom asked for the votes  and this was to last yet for ten days more     chapter xxvi  moggs purity and the rights of labour   mr trigger had hinted that ontario moggs would be a thorn in the flesh of mr westmacotts supporters at percycross and he had been right ontario was timid hesitating and not unfrequently browbeaten in the social part of his work at the election though he made great struggles he could neither talk nor walk nor eat nor sit as though he were the equal of his colleague but when they came to politics and political management there was no holding him he would make speeches when speeches were not held to be desirable by his committee and he was loud upon topics as to which it was thought that no allusion whatever should have been made to talk about the ballot had from the first been conceded to moggs mr westmacott was indeed opposed to the ballot but it had been a matter of course that the candidate of the people should support that measure the ballot would have been a safetyvalve but moggs was so crossgrained illconditioned and uncontrollable that he would not let the ballot suffice him the ballot was almost nothing to him strikes and bribery were his great subjects the beauty of the one and the ugliness of the other the right of the labourer to combine with his brother labourers to make his own terms for his labour was the great lesson he taught the suicidal iniquity of the labourer in selling that political power which he should use to protect his labour was the source of his burning indignation that labour was the salt of the earth he told the men of percycross very oftenand he told them as often that manliness and courage were necessary to make that salt productive gradually the men of percycrosssome said that they were only the boys of percycrossclustered round him and learned to like to listen to him they came to understand something of the character of the man who was almost too shamefaced to speak to them while he was being dragged round to their homes on his canvas but whom nothing could repress when he was on his legs with a crowd before him it was in vain that the managing agent told him that he would not get a vote by his spouting and shouting on such occasions he hardly answered a word to the managing agent but the spouting and shouting went on just the same and was certainly popular among the bootmakers and tanners mr westmacott was asked to interfere and did do so once in some mild fashion but ontario replied that having been called to this sphere of action he could only do his duty according to his own lights the young mens presidents and secretaries and chairmen were for awhile somewhat frightened having been assured by the managing men of the liberal committee that the election would be lost by the furious insanity of their candidate but they decided upon supporting moggs having found that they would be deposed from their seats if they discarded him at last when the futile efforts to control moggs had been maintained with patience for something over a week when it still wanted four or five days to the election an actual split was made in the liberal camp moggs was turned adrift by the westmacottian faction bills were placarded about the town explaining the cruel necessity for such action and describing moggs as a revolutionary firebrand and now there were three parties in the town mr trigger rejoiced over this greatly with mr griffenbottom if they havent been and cut their throats now it is a wonder he said over and over again even sir thomas caught something of the feeling of triumph and began almost to hope that he might be successful nevertheless the number of men who could not quite make up their minds as to what duty required of them till the day of the election was considerable and mr pile triumphantly whispered into mr triggers ear his conviction that after all things werent going to be changed at percycross quite so easily as some people supposed  when moggs was utterly discarded by the respectable leaders of the liberal party in the boroughturned out of the liberal inn at which were the headquarters of the party and refused the right of participating in the liberal breakfasts and dinners which were there provided moggs felt himself to be a triumphant martyr his portmanteau and hatbox were carried by an admiring throng down to the cordwainers armsa house not indeed of the highest repute in the townand here a separate committee was formed mr westmacott did his best to avert the secession but his supporters were inexorable the liberal tradesmen of percycross would have nothing to do with a candidate who declared that inasmuch as a mans mind was more worthy than a mans money labour was more worthy than capital and that therefore the men should dominate and rule their masters that was a doctrine necessarily abominable to every master tradesman the men were to decide how many hours they would work what recreation they would have in what fashion and at what rate they would be paid and what proportion of profit should be allowed to the members and masters and creators of the firm that was the doctrine that moggs was preaching the tradesmen of percycross whether liberal or conservative did not understand much in the world of politics but they did understand that such a doctrine as that if carried out would take them to a very gehenna of revolutionary desolation and so moggs was banished from the northern star the inn at which mr westmacott was living and was forced to set up his radical staff at the cordwainers arms  in one respect he certainly gained much by this persecution the record of his election doings would have been confined to the columns of the percycross herald had he carried on his candidature after the usual fashion but as it was now his doings were blazoned in the london newspapers the daily news reported him and gave him an article all to himself and even the times condescended to make an example of him and to bring him up as evidence that revolutionary doctrines were distasteful to the electors of the country generally the fame of ontario moggs certainly became more familiar to the ears of the world at large than it would have done had he continued to run in a pair with mr westmacott and that was everything to him polly neefit must hear of him now that his name had become a household word in the london newspapers  and in another respect he gained much all personal canvassing was now at an end for him there could be no use in his going about from house to house asking for votes indeed he had discovered that to do so was a thing iniquitous in itself a demoralising practice tending to falsehood intimidation and corruptiona thing to be denounced and he denounced it let the men of percycross hear him question him in public learn from his spoken words what were his political principlesand then vote for him if they pleased he would condescend to ask a vote as a favour from no man it was for them rather to ask him to bestow upon them the gift of his time and such ability as he possessed he took a very high tone indeed in his speeches and was saved the labour of parading the streets during these days he looked down from an immeasurable height on the truckling mean sordid doings of griffenbottom underwood and westmacott a huge board had been hoisted up over the somewhat low frontage of the cordwainers arms and on this was painted in letters two feet high a legend which it delighted him to read moggs purity and the rights of labour ah if that could only be understood there was enough in it to bring back an age of gold to suffering humanity no other reform would be needed in that short legend everything necessary for man was contained  mr pile and mr trigger stood together one evening looking at the legend from a distance moggs and purity said mr pile in that tone of disgust and with that peculiar action which had become common to him in speaking of this election  he hasnt a ghost of a chance said mr trigger who was always looking straight at the main pointnor yet hasnt westmacott  theres worse than westmacott said mr pile  but what can we do said trigger  purity purity said the old man it makes me that sick that i wish there werent such a thing as a member of parliament purity and pickpockets is about the same when im among em i buttons up my breechespockets  but what can we do asked mr trigger again in a voice of woe mr trigger quite sympathised with his elder friend but being a younger man he knew that these innovations must be endured  then mr pile made a speech of such length that he had never been known to make the like beforeso that mr trigger felt that things had become very serious and that not impossibly mr pile might be so affected by this election as never again to hold up his head in percycross purity purity he repeated theyre a going on that way trigger that the country soon wont be fit for a man to live in and whats the meaning of it all its just thisthat folks wants what they wants without paying for it i hate purity i do i hate the very smell of it it stinks when i see the chaps as come here and talk of purity i know they mean that nothing aint to be as it used to be nobody is to trust no one there aint to be nothing warm nor friendly nor comfortable any more this sir thomas youve brought down is just as bad as that shoemaking chapworse if anything i know whats a going on inside him i can see it if a man takes a glass of wine out of his bottle hes a asking hisself if that aint bribery and corruption hes got a handle to his name and money i suppose and comes down here without knowing a chick or a child why isnt a poor man as cant hardly live to have his three halfcrowns or fifteen shillings as things may go for voting for a stranger such as him ill tell you what it is trigger ive done with it things have come to that in the borough that ill meddle and make no more mr trigger as he listened to this eloquence could only sigh and shake his head i did think it would last my time added mr pile almost weeping  moggs would steal out of the house in the early morning look up at the big bright red letters and rejoice in his very heart of hearts he had not lived in vain when his name had been joined in the public view of men with words so glorious purity and the rights of labour it contains just everything said moggs to himself as he sat down to his modest lonely breakfast after that sitting with his hands clasped upon his brow disdaining the use of pen and paper for such work he composed his speech for the eveninga speech framed with the purpose of proving to his hearers that purity and the rights of labour combined would make them as angels upon the earth as for himself moggs he explained in his speechanalysing the big board which adorned the houseit mattered little whether they did or did not return him but let them be always persistent in returning on every possible occasion purity and the rights of labour and then all other good things would follow to them he enjoyed at any rate that supreme delight which a man feels when he thoroughly believes his own doctrine  but the days were very long with him when the evening came when his friends were relieved from their toil and could assemble here and there through the borough to hear him preach to them he was happy enough he had certainly achieved so much that they preferred him now to their own presidents and chairmen there was an enthusiasm for moggs among the labouring men of percycross and he was always happy while he was addressing them but the hours in the morning were long and sometimes melancholy though all the town was busy with these electioneering doings there was nothing for him to do his rivals canvassed consulted roamed through the townas he could seefilching votes from him but he too noble for such work as that sat there alone in the little upstairs parlour of the cordwainers arms thinking of his speech for the eveningthinking too of polly neefit and then of a sudden it occurred to him that it would be good to write a letter to polly from percycross surely the fact that he was waging this grand battle would have some effect upon her heart so he wrote the following letter which reached polly about a week after her return home from margate      cordwainers arms inn percycross    14 october 186     my dear polly     i hope you wont be angry with me for writing to you i am    here in the midst of the turmoil of a contested election    and i cannot refrain from writing to tell you about it    out of a full heart they say the mouth speaks and out of    a very full heart i am speaking to you with my pen the    honourable prospect of having a seat in the british house    of parliament which i regard as the highest dignity that    a briton can enjoy is very much to me and fills my mind    and my heart and my soul but it all is not so much to me    as your love if only i could win that seat if i could    sit there in your heart and be chosen by you not for a    short seven years but for life i should be prouder and    happier of that honour than of any other it ought not    perhaps to be so but it is i have to speak here to    the people very often but i never open my mouth without    thinking that if i had you to hear me i could speak with    more energy and spirit if i could gain your love and the    seat for this borough together i should have done more    then than emperor or conqueror or high priest ever    accomplished     i dont know whether you understand much about elections    when i first came here i was joined with a gentleman    who was one of the old membersbut now i stand alone    because he does not comprehend or sympathise with the    advanced doctrines which it is my mission to preach to the    people purity and the rights of labourthose are my    watchwords but there are many here who hate the very name    of purity and who know nothing of the rights of labour    labour dear polly is the salt of the earth and i hope    that some day i may have the privilege of teaching you    that it is so for myself i do not see why ladies should    not understand politics as well as men and i think that    they ought to vote i hope you think that women ought to    have the franchise     we are to be nominated on monday and the election will    take place on tuesday i shall be nominated and seconded    by two electors who are working men i would sooner    have their support than that of the greatest magnate in    the land but your support would be better for me than    anything else in the world people here as a rule are    very lukewarm about the ballot and they seemed to know    very little about strikes till i came among them without    combination and mutual support the working people must be    ground to powder if i am sent to parliament i shall feel    it to be my duty to insist upon this doctrine in season    and out of seasonwhenever i can make my voice heard    but oh polly if i could do it with you for my wife my    voice would be so much louder     pray give my best respects to your father and mother i am    afraid i have not your fathers good wishes but perhaps    if he saw me filling the honourable position of member of    parliament for percycross he might relent if you would    condescend to write me one word in reply i should be    prouder of that than of anything i suppose i shall be    here till wednesday morning if you would say but one kind    word to me i think that it would help me on the great    day     i am and ever shall be    your most affectionate admirer     ontario moggs   illustration out of a full heart they say the mouth speaks and out of a very full heart i am speaking to you with my pen   polly received this on the monday the day of the nomination and though she did answer it at once ontario did not get her reply till the contest was over and that great day had done its best and its worst for him but pollys letter shall be given here to a wellbred young lady living in good society the mixture of politics and love which had filled ontarios epistle might perhaps have been unacceptable but polly thought that the letter was a good letter and was proud of being so noticed by a young man who was standing for parliament she sympathised with his enthusiasm and thought that she should like to be taught by him that labour was the salt of the earthif only he were not so awkward and long and if his hands were habitually a little cleaner she could not however take upon herself to give him any hope in that direction and therefore confined her answer to the parliamentary prospects of the hour      dear mr moggsshe wrotei was very much pleased    when i heard that you were going to stand for a member of    parliament and i wish with all my heart that you may be    successful i shall think it a very great honour indeed    to know a member of parliament as i have known you for    nearly all my life i am sure you will do a great deal of    good and prevent the people from being wicked as for    ladies voting i dont think i should like that myself    though if i had twenty votes i would give them to    youbecause i have known you so long     father and mother send their respects and hope you will    be successful     yours truly     maryanne neefit     alexandra cottage monday   when moggs received this letter he was not unnaturally in a state of great agitation in reference to the contest through which he had just passed but still he thought very much of it and put it in his breast where it would lie near his heart ah if only one word of warmth had been allowed to escape from the writer how happy could he have been yes he said scornfullybecause she has known me all her life nevertheless the paper which her hand had pressed and the letters which her fingers had formed were placed close to his heart     chapter xxvii  the moonbeam   ralph the heir had given his answer and the thing was settled he had abandoned his property for ever and was to be put into immediate possession of a large sum of moneyof a sum so large that it would seem at once to make him a rich man he knew however that if he should spend this money he would be a pauper for life and he knew also how great was his facility for spending there might however be at least a thousand a year for him and for his heirs after him and surely it ought to be easy for him to live upon a thousand a year  as he thought of this he tried to make the best of it he had at any rate rescued himself out of the hands of neefit who had become intolerable to him as for polly she had refused him twice polly was a very sweet girl but he could not make it matter of regret to himself that he should have lost polly had polly been all alone in the world she would have been well enoughbut polly with papa and mamma neefit must have been a mistake it was well for him at any rate that he was out of that trouble as regarded the neefits it would be simply necessary that he should pay the breechesmaker the money that he owed them and go no more either to conduit street or to hendon  and then what else should he door leave undone in what other direction should he be active or inactive he was well aware that hitherto he had utterly wasted his life born with glorious prospects he had now so dissipated them that there was nothing left for him but a quiet and very unambitious mode of life of means he had sufficient if only he could keep that sufficiency but he knew himselfhe feared that he knew himself too well to trust himself to keep that which he had unless he altogether changed his manner of living to be a hybrid at the moonbeam for lifehalf hero and half dupe among grooms and stablekeepers was not satisfactory to him he could see and could appreciate better things and could long for them but he could not attain to anything better unless he were to alter altogether his mode of life would it not be well for him to get a wife he was rid of polly who had been an incubus to him and now he could choose for himself  he wrote to his brother gregory telling his brother what he had done the writing of letters was ever a trouble to him and on this occasion he told his tidings in a line or two dear greg i have accepted my uncles offer it was better so when i wrote to you before things were different i need not tell you that my heart is sore for the old place had i stuck to it however i should have beggared you and disgraced myself yours affectionately r n that was all what more was to be said which in the saying could be serviceable to any one the dear old place he would never see it again nothing on earth should induce him to go there now that it could under no circumstances be his own it would still belong to a newton and he would try and take comfort in that he might at any rate have done worse with it he might have squandered his interest among the jews and so have treated his inheritance that it must have been sold among strangers  he was very low in spirits for two or three days thinking of all this he had been with his lawyer and his lawyer had told him that it must yet be some weeks before the sale would be perfected now that it is done the sooner the better said ralph the lawyer told him that if he absolutely wanted ready money for his present needs he could have it but that otherwise it would be better for him to wait patientlysay for a month he was not absolutely in want of money having still funds which had been supplied to him by the breechesmaker but he could not remain in town were he to remain in town neefit would be upon him and in truth though he was quite clear in his conscience in regard to polly he did not wish to have to explain personally to mr neefit that he had sold his interest in newton priory the moment the money was in his hands he would pay mr neefit and then why then he thought that he would be entitled to have mr neefit told that he was not at home should mr neefit trouble him again  he would marry and live somewhere very quietlyperhaps take a small farm and keep one hunter his means would be sufficient for that even with a wife and family yesthat would be the kind of life most suited for him he would make a great change he would be simple in his habits domestic and extravagant in nothing to hunt once a week from his own little country house would be delightful who should be the mistress of that home that of all questions was now the most important  the reader may remember a certain trifling incident which took place some three or four months since on the lawn at popham villa it was an incident which clary underwood had certainly never forgotten it is hardly too much to say that she thought of it every hour she thought of it as a great sinbut as a sin which had been forgiven and though a grievous sin as strong evidence of that which was not sinful and which if true would be so full of joy clary had never forgotten this incidentbut ralph had forgotten it nearly altogether that he had accompanied the incident by any assurance of his love by any mention of love intended to mean anything he was altogether unaware he would have been ready to swear that he had never so committed himself little tender passages of course there had been such are commonso he thoughtwhen young ladies and young gentlemen know each other well and are fond of each others company but that he owed himself to clarissa underwood and that he would sin grievously against her should he give himself to another he had no idea it merely occurred to him that there might be some slight preparatory embarrassment were he to offer his hand to mary bonner yet he thought that of all the girls in the world mary bonner was the one to whom he would best like to offer it it might indeed be possible for him to marry some young woman with money but in his present frame of mind he was opposed to any such effort hitherto things with him had been all worldly empty useless and at the same time distasteful he was to have married polly neefit for her money and he had been wretched ever since he had entertained the idea love and a cottage were he knew things incompatible but the love and the cottage implied in those words were synonymous with absolute poverty love with thirty thousand pounds even though it should have a cottage joined with it need not be a povertystricken love he was sick of the worldof the world such as he had made it for himself and he would see if he could not do something better he would first get mary bonner and then he would get the farm he was so much delighted with the scheme which he thus made for himself that he went to his club and dined there pleasantly allowing himself a bottle of champagne as a sort of reward for having made up his mind to so much virtue he met a friend or two and spent a pleasant evening and as he walked home to his lodgings in the evening was quite in love with his prospects it was well for him to have rid himself of the burden of an inheritance which might perhaps not have been his for the next fiveandtwenty years as he undressed himself he considered whether it would be well for him at once to throw himself at mary bonners feet there were two reasons for not doing this quite immediately he had been told by his lawyer that he ought to wait for some form of assent or agreement from the squire before he took any important step as consequent upon the new arrangement in regard to the property and then sir thomas was still among the electors at percycross he wished to do everything that was proper and would wait for the return of sir thomas but he must do something at once to remain in his lodgings and at his club was not in accord with that better path in life which he had chalked out for himself  of course he must go down to the moonbeam he had four horses there and must sell at least three of them one hunter he intended to allow himself there were brag banker buff and brewer and he thought that he would keep brag brag was only six years old and might last him for the next seven years in the meantime he could see a little cubhunting and live at the moonbeam for a week at any rate as cheaply as he could in london so he went down to the moonbeam and put himself under the charge of mr horsball  and here he found himself in luck lieutenant cox was there and with the lieutenant a certain fred pepper who hunted habitually with the b and b lieutenant cox had soon told his little tale he had sold out and had promised his family that he would go to australia but he intended to take one more winter out of himself as he phrased it he had made a bargain to that effect with his governor his debts had been paid his commission had been sold and he was to be shipped for queensland but he was to have one more winter with the b and b an open goodhumoured shrewd youth was lieutenant cox who suffered nothing from false shame and was intelligent enough to know that life at the rate of £1200 a year with £400 to spend must come to an end fred pepper was a young man of about fortyfive who had hunted with the b and b and lived at the moonbeam from a time beyond which the memory of mr horsballs present customers went not he was the father of the moonbeam mr horsball himself having come there since the days in which fred pepper first became familiar with its loose boxes no one knew how he lived or how he got his horses he had however a very pretty knack of selling them and certainly paid mr horsball regularly he was wont to vanish in april and would always turn up again in october some people called him the dormouse he was goodhumoured goodlooking after a horsey fashion clever agreeable and quite willing to submit himself to any nickname that could be found for him he liked a rubber of whist and was supposed to make something out of bets with bad players he rode very carefully and was altogether averse to ostentation and bluster in the field but he could make a horse do anything when he wanted to sell him and could on an occasion give a lead as well as any man everybody liked him and various things were constantly said in his praise he was never known to borrow a sovereign he had been known to lend a horse he did not drink he was a very safe man in the field he did not lie outrageously in selling his horses he did not cheat at cards as long as he had a drop of drink left in his flask he would share it with any friend he never boasted he was much given to chaff but his chaff was goodhumoured he was generous with his cigars such were his virtues that he had no adequate means of his own and that he never earned a penny that he lived chiefly by gambling that he had no pursuit in life but pleasure that he never went inside a church that he never gave away a shilling that he was of no use to any human being and that no one could believe a word he said of himselfthese were specks upon his character taken as a whole fred pepper was certainly very popular with the gentlemen and ladies of the b and b  ralph newton when he dropped down upon the moonbeam was made loudly welcome mr horsball whose bill for £500 had been honoured at its first day of maturity not a little perhaps to his own surprise treated ralph almost as a hero when ralph made some reference to the remainder of the money due mr horsball expressed himself as quite shocked at the allusion he had really had the greatest regret in asking mr newton for his note of hand and would not have done it had not an unforeseen circumstance called upon him suddenly to make up a few thousands he had felt very much obliged to mr newton for his prompt kindness there neednt be a word about the remainder and if mr newton wanted something specially good for the next seasonas of course he wouldmr horsball had just the horse that would suit him youll about want a couple more mr newton said mr horsball  then ralph told something of his plans to this master of the studssomething but not much he said nothing of the sale of his property and nothing quite definite as to that one horse with which his hunting was to be done for the future im going to turn over a new leaf horsball he said  not going to be spliced squire  welli cant say that i am but i wont say that i aint but im certainly going to make a change which will take me away from your fatherly care  im sorry for that squire we think weve always taken great care of you here  the very best in the worldbut a man must settle down in the world some day you know i want a nice bit of land a hundred and fifty acres or something of that sort  to purchase squire  i dont care whether i buy it or take it on lease but it mustnt be in this county i am too well known here and should always want to be out when i ought to be looking after the stock  youll take the season out of yourself first at any rate said mr horsball ralph shook his head but mr horsball felt nearly sure of his customer for the ensuing winter it is not easy for a man to part with four horses seven or eight saddles an establishment of bridles horsesheets spurs rollers and bandages a pet groom a roomful of top boots and leather breeches beyond the power of counting this is a wealth which it is easy to increase but of which it is very difficult to get quit  i think i shall sell said ralph  well talk about that in april said mr horsball  he went out cubhunting three or four times and spent the intermediate days playing dummy whist with fred pepper and coxwho was no longer a lieutenant ralph felt that this was not the sort of beginning for his better life which would have been most appropriate but then he hardly had an opportunity of beginning that better life quite at once he must wait till something more definite had been done about the propertyand above all things till sir thomas should be back from canvassing he did however so far begin his better life as to declare that the points at whist must be lowshilling points with halfacrown on the rubber quite enough for this kind of thing said fred pepper we only want just something to do and ralph when at the end of the week he had lost only a matter of fifteen pounds congratulated himself on having begun his better life cox and fred pepper who divided the trifle between them laughed at the bagatelle  but before he left the moonbeam things had assumed a shape which when looked at all round was not altogether pleasant to him before he had been three days at the place he received a letter from his lawyer telling him that his uncle had given his formal assent to the purchase and had offered to pay the stipulated sum as soon as ralph would be willing to receive it as to any further sum that might be forthcoming a valuer should be agreed upon at once the actual deed of sale and transfer would be ready by the middle of november and the lawyer advised ralph to postpone his acceptance of the money till that deed should have been executed it was evident from the letter that there was no need on his part to hurry back to town this letter he found waiting for him on his return one day from hunting there had been a pretty run very fast with a kill as there will be sometimes in cubhunting in octoberthough as a rule of all sports cubhunting is the sorriest ralph had ridden his favourite horse brag and mr pepper had taken outjust to try hima little animal of his that he had bought as he said quite at haphazard he knew nothing about him and was rather afraid that he had been done but the little horse seemed to have a dash of pace about him and in the evening there was some talk of the animal fred pepper thought that the little horse was faster than brag fred pepper never praised his own horses loudly and when brags merits were chaunted said that perhaps ralph was right would ralph throw his leg over the little horse on friday and try him on the friday ralph did throw his leg over the little horse and there was another burst ralph was obliged to confess as they came home together in the afternoon that he had never been better carried i can see what he is now said fred pepperhe is one of those little horses that one dont get every day hes up to a stone over my weight too now ralph and fred pepper each rode thirteen stone and a half  on that day they dined together and there was much talk as to the future prospects of the men not that fred pepper said anything of his future prospects no one ever presumed him to have a prospect or suggested to him to look for one but cox had been very communicative and confidential and ralph had been prompted to say something of himself fred pepper though he had no future of his own could he pleasantly interested about the future of another and had quite agreed with ralph that he ought to settle himself the only difficulty was in deciding the when cox intended to settle himself too but cox was quite clear as to the wisdom of taking another season out of himself he was prepared to prove that it would be sheer waste of time and money not to do so here i am said cox and a fellow always saves money by staying where he is there was a sparkle of truth in this which ralph newton found himself unable to deny  youll never have another chance said pepper  thats another thing said cox of course i shant ive turned it round every side and i know what im about as for horses i believe they sell better in april than they do in october men know what they are then fred pepper would not exactly back this opinion but he ventured to suggest that there was not so much difference as some men supposed  if you are to jump into the cold water said ralph youd better take the plunge at once  id sooner do it in summer than winter said fred pepper  of course said cox if you must give up hunting do it at the end of the season not at the beginning theres a time for all things ring the bell dormouse and well have another bottle of claret before we go to dummy  if i stay here for the winter said ralph i should want another horse though i might perhaps get through with four  of course you might said pepper who never spoilt his own market by pressing  id rather give up altogether than do it in a scratch way said ralph ive got into a fashion of having a second horse and i like it  its the greatest luxury in the world said cox  i never tried it said pepper im only too happy to get one it was admitted by all men that fred pepper had the art of riding his horses without tiring them  they played their rubber of whist and had a little hot whisky and water on this evening mr horsball was admitted to their company and made a fourth but he wouldnt bet shilling points he said were quite as much as he could afford through the whole evening they went on talking of the next season of the absolute folly of giving up one thing before another was begun and of the merits of fred peppers little horse a clever little animal mr pepper said the great man a very clever little animal but i wish you wouldnt bring so many clever uns down here mr pepper  why not horsball asked cox  because he interferes with my trade said mr horsball laughing it was supposed nevertheless that mr horsball and mr pepper quite understood each other before the evening was over a price had been fixed and ralph had bought the little horse for £130 why shouldnt he take another winter out of himself he could not marry mary bonner and get into a farm all in a daynor yet all in a month he would go to work honestly with the view of settling himself but let him be as honest about it as he might his winters hunting would not interfere with him so at last he assured himself and then he had another argument strong in his favour he might hunt all the winter and yet have this thirty thousand poundsnay more than thirty thousand pounds at the end of it in fact imprudent and foolish as had been his hunting in all previous winters there would not even be any imprudence in this winters hunting fortified by all these unanswerable arguments he did buy mr fred peppers little horse  on the next morning the morning of the day on which he was to return to town the arguments did not seem to be so irresistible and he almost regretted what he had done it was not that he would be ruined by another six months fling at life situated as he now was so much might be allowed to him almost without injury but then how can a man trust in his own resolutions before he has begun to keep themwhen at the very moment of beginning he throws them to the winds for the present postponing everything for another hour he knew as well as any one could tell him that he was proving himself to be unfit for that new life which he was proposing to himself when one man is wise and another foolish the foolish man knows generally as well as does the wise man in what lies wisdom and in what folly and the temptation often is very slight ralph newton had hardly wished to buy mr peppers little horse the balance of desire during the whole evening had lain altogether on the other side but there had come a moment in which he had yielded and that moment governed all the other minutes we may almost say that a man is only as strong as his weakest moment  but he returned to london very strong in his purpose he would keep his establishment at the moonbeam for this winter he had it all laid out and planned in his mind he would at once pay mr horsball the balance of the old debt and count on the value of his horses to defray the expense of the coming season and he would without a weeks delay make his offer to mary bonner a dim idea of some feeling of disappointment on clarys part did cross his braina feeling which seemed to threaten some slight discomfort to himself as resulting from want of sympathy on her part but he must assume sufficient courage to brave this that he would in any degree be an evildoer towards clarythat did not occur to him nor did it occur to him as at all probable that mary bonner would refuse his offer in these days men never expect to be refused it has gone forth among young men as a doctrine worthy of perfect faith that young ladies are all wanting to get marriedlooking out for lovers with an absorbing anxiety and that few can dare to refuse any man who is justified in proposing to them     chapter xxviii  the new heir counts his chickens   the squire was almost lost in joy when he received his sons letter telling him that ralph the heir had consented to sell everything the one great wish of his life was to be accomplished at last the property was to be his own so that he might do what he liked with it so that he might leave it entire to his own son so that for the remainder of his life he might enjoy it in that community with his son which had always appeared to him to be the very summit of human bliss from the sweet things which he had seen he had been hitherto cut off by the record of his own fault and had spent the greater part of his life in the endurance of a bitter punishment he had been torn to pieces too in contemplating the modes of escape from the position in which his fathers very natural will had placed him he might of course have married and at least have expected and have hoped for children but in that there would have been misery his son was the one human being that was dear to him above all others and by such a marriage he would have ruined his son early in life comparatively early he had made up his mind that he would not do thatthat he would save his money and make a property for the boy he loved but then it had come home to him as a fact that he could be happy in preparing no other home for his son than this old family house of his with all its acres woods and homesteads the acres woods and homesteads gave to him no delight feeling as he did every hour of his life that they were not his own for purposes of a real usufruct then by degrees he had heard of his nephews follies and the idea had come upon him that he might buy his nephew out ralph his own ralph had told him that the idea was cruel but he could not see the cruelty what a bad man loses a good man will get he said and surely it must be better for all those who are to live by the property that a good man should be the master of it he would not interfere nor would he have any power of interfering till others would interfere were he to keep aloof the doings would be the doings of that spendthrift heir and none of his when ralph would tell him that he was cruel he would turn away in wrath but hiding his wrath because he loved his son but now everything was set right and his son had had the doing of it  he was nearly mad with joy throughout that day as he thought of the great thing which he had accomplished he was alone in the house for his son was still in london and during the last few months guests had been unfrequent at the priory but he did not wish to have anybody with him now he went out roaming through the park and realising to himself the fact that now at length the very trees were his own he gazed at one farmhouse after another not seeking the tenants hardly speaking to them if he met them but with his brain full of plans of what should be done he saw gregory for a moment but only nodded at him smiling and passed on he was not in a humour just at present to tell his happiness to any one he walked all round darvells premises the desolate halfruined house of brumbys telling himself that very shortly it should be desolate and halfruined no longer then he crossed into the lane and stood with his eyes fixed upon brownriggswalkers farm the pearl of all the farms in those parts the land with which he thought he could have parted so easily when the question before him was that of becoming in truth the owner of any portion of the estate but now every acre was ten times dearer to him than it had been then he would never part with brownriggs he would even save ingrams farm in twining if it might possibly be saved he had not known before how dear to him could be every bank every tree every sod yesnow in very truth he was lord and master of the property which had belonged to his father and his fathers fathers before him he would borrow money and save it during his lifetime he would do anything rather than part with an acre of it now that the acres were his own to leave behind him to his son  on the following day ralph arrived we must no longer call him ralph who was not the heir he would be heir to everything from the day that the contract was completed the squire though he longed to see the young man as he had never longed before would not go to the station to meet the welcome one his irrepressible joy was too great to be exhibited before strangers he remained at home in his own room desiring that mr ralph might come to him there he would not even show himself in the hall and yet when ralph entered the room he was very calm there was a bright light in his eyes but at first he spoke hardly a word so youve managed that little job he said as he took his sons hand  i managed nothing sir said ralph smiling  didnt you i thought you had managed a good deal it is done anyway  yes sir its done at least i suppose so ralph after sending his telegram had of course written to his father giving him full particulars of the manner in which the arrangement had been made  you dont mean that there is any doubt said the squire with almost an anxious tone  not at all as far as i know the lawyers seem to think that it is all right ralph is quite in earnest  he must be in earnest said the squire  he has behaved uncommonly well said the namesake so well that i think you owe him much we were quite mistaken in supposing that he wanted to drive a sharp bargain he himself had never so supposed but he found this to be the best way of speaking of that matter to his father  i will forgive him everything now said the squire and will do anything that i can to help him  ralph said many things in praise of his namesake he still almost regretted what had been done at any rate he could see the pity of it it was that other ralph who should have been looked to as the future proprietor of newton priory and not he who was hardly entitled to call himself a newton it would have been more consistent with the english order of things that it should be so and then there was so much to say in favour of this young man who had lost it all and so little to say against him and it almost seemed to him for whose sake the purchase was being made that advantagean unscrupulous if not an unfair advantagewas being taken of the purchaser he could not say all this to his father but he spoke of ralph in such a way as to make his father understand what he thought he is such a pleasant fellow said ralph who was now the heir  let us have him down here as soon as the thing is settled  ahi dont think hell come now of course hes wretched enough about it it is not wonderful that he should have hesitated at parting with it  perhaps not said the squire who was willing to forgive past sins but of course there was no help for it  that was what he didnt feel so sure about when he declined your first offer it was not that he objected to the price as to the price he says that of course he can say nothing about it when i told him that you were willing to raise your offer he declared that he would take nothing in that fashion if those who understood the matter said that more was coming to him he supposed that he would get it according to my ideas he behaved very well sir  in this there was something that almost amounted to an accusation against the squire at least so the squire felt it and the feeling for the moment robbed him of something of his triumph according to his own view there was no need for pity it was plain that to his son the whole affair was pitiful but he could not scold his sonat any rate not now i feel this ralph he saidthat from this moment everybody connected with the property every tenant on it and every labourer will be better off than they were a month ago i may have been to blame i say nothing about that but i do say that in all cases it is well that a property should go to the natural heir of the lifetenant of course it has been my fault he added after a pause but i do feel now that i have in a great measure remedied the evil which i did the tone now had become too serious to admit of further argument ralph feeling that this was so pressed his fathers hand and then left him gregory is coming across to dinner said the squire as ralph was closing the door behind him  at that time gregory had received no intimation of what had been done in london his brothers note not reaching him till the following morning ralph met him before the squire came down and the news was soon told it is all settled said ralph with a sigh  well  your brother has agreed to sell  no  i have almost more pain than pleasure in it myself because i know it will make you unhappy  he was so confident when he wrote to me  yesbut he explained all that he had hoped then that he could have saved it but the manner of saving it would have been worse than the loss he will tell you everything no doubt no man could have behaved better as it happened there was still some little space of time before the squire joined thema period perhaps of five minutes but the parson spoke hardly a word the news which he now heard confounded him he had been quite sure that his brother had been in earnest and that his uncle would fail and then though he loved the one ralph nearly as well as he did the otherthough he must have known that ralph the baseborn was in all respects a better man than his own brother more of a man than the legitimate heirstill to his feelings that legitimacy was everything he too was a newton of newton but it may be truly said of him that there was nothing selfish in his feelings to be the younger brother of newton of newton and parson of the parish which bore the same name as themselves was sufficient for his ambition but things would be terribly astray now that the right heir was extruded ralph this ralph whom he loved so well could not be the right newton to own the property the world would not so regard him the tenants would not so think of him the county would not so repute him to the thinking of parson gregory a great misfortune had been consummated as soon as he had realised it he was silent and could speak no more  nor did ralph say a word not to triumph in what had been done on his behalfor at least not to seem to triumphthat was the lesson which he had taught himself he fully sympathised with gregory and therefore he stood silent and sad by his side that there must have been some triumph in his heart it is impossible not to imagine it could not be but that he should be alive to the glory of being the undoubted heir to newton priory and he understood well that his birth would interfere but little now with his position should he choose to marry as he would choose it would of course be necessary that he should explain his birth but it was not likely he thought that he should seek a wife among those who would reject him with all his other advantages because he had no just title to his fathers name that he should take joy in what had been done on his behalf was only natural but as he stood with gregory waiting for his father to come to them he showed no sign of joy at last the squire came there certainly was triumph in his eye but he did not speak triumphantly it was impossible that some word should not be spoken between them as to the disposition of the property i suppose ralph has told you he said what he has done up in london  yeshe has told me said gregory  i hope there will now be an end of all family illfeeling among us said the uncle your brother shall be as welcome at the old place as i trust you have always found yourself if he likes to bring his horses here we shall be delighted  the parson muttered something as to the kindness with which he had ever been treated but what he said was said with an ill grace he was almost brokenhearted and thoroughly wished himself back in his own solitude the squire saw it all and did not press him to talksaid not a word more of his purchase and tried to create some little interest about parish mattersasked after the new building in the chancel and was gracious about this old man and that young woman but gregory could not recover himselfcould not recall his old interests or so far act a part as to make it seem that he was not thinking of the misfortune which had fallen upon the family in every look of his eyes and every tone of his voice he was telling the son that he was a bastard and the father that he was destroying the inheritance of the family but yet they bore with him and endeavoured to win him back to pleasantness soon after the cloth was taken away he took his leave he had work to do at home he said and must go his uncle went out with him into the hall leaving ralph alone in the parlour it will be for the best in the long run said the squire with his hand on his nephews shoulder  perhaps it may sir i am not pretending to say good night as he walked home across the park through the old trees which he had known since he was an infant he told himself that it could not be for the best that the property should be sent adrift out of the proper line the only thing to be desired now was that neither he nor his brother should have a child and that there should no longer be a proper line  the squires joy was too deep and well founded to be in any way damped by poor gregorys illhumour and was too closely present to him for him to be capable of restraining it why should he restrain himself before his son i am sorry for greg he said because he has oldfashioned ideas but of course it will be for the best his brother would have squandered every acre of it to this ralph made no answer it might probably have been as his father said it was perhaps best for all who lived in and by the estate that he should be the heir and gradually the feeling of exultation in his own position was growing upon him it was natural that it should do so he knew himself to be capable of filling with credit and with advantage to all around him the great place which was now assigned to him and it was impossible that he should not be exultant and he owed it to his father to show him that he appreciated all that had been done for him i think he ought to have the £35000 at least said the squire  certainly said ralph  i think so as for the bulk sum i have already written to carey about that no time ought to be lost there is no knowing what might happen he might die  he doesnt look like dying sir  he might break his neck out hunting there is no knowing at any rate there should be no delay from what i am told i dont think that with the timber and all theyll make it come to another £5000 but he shall have that as he has behaved well ill show him that i can behave well too ive half a mind to go up to london and stay till its all through  youd only worry yourself  i should worry myself no doubt and do you know i love the place so much better than i did that i can hardly bear to tear myself away from it the first mark of my handiwork now that i can work shall be put upon darvells farm ill have the old place about his ears before i am a day older  youll not get it through before winter  yes i will if it costs me an extra £50 i shant begrudge it it shall be a sort of memorial building a farmhouse of thanksgiving ill make it as snug a place as there is about the property it has made me wretched for these two years  i hope all that kind of wretchedness will be over now  thank godyes i was looking at brownriggs todayand ingrams i dont think well sell either i have a plan and i think we can pull through without it it is so much easier to sell than to buy  youd be more comfortable if you sold one of them  of course i must borrow a few thousandsbut why not i doubt whether at this moment theres a property in all hampshire so free as this i have always lived on less than the income and i can continue to do so easier than before you are provided for now old fellow  yes indeedand why should you pinch yourself  i shant be pinched i havent got a score of women about me as youll have before long theres nothing in the world like having a wife i am quite sure of that but if you want to save money the way to do it is not to have a nursery youll marry of course now  i suppose i shall some day  the sooner the better take my word for it  perhaps youd alter your opinion if i came upon you before christmas for your sanction  no by jove that i shouldnt i should be delighted you dont mean to say youve got anybody in your eye theres only one thing i ask ralphopen outandout confidence  you shall have it sir  there is somebody then  well no there isnt anybody it would be impudence in me to say there was  then i know there is upon this encouragement ralph told his father that on his two last visits to london he had seen a girl whom he thought that he would like to ask to be his wife he had been at fulham on three or four occasionsit was so he put it but his visits had in truth been only threeand he thought that this niece of sir thomas underwood possessed every charm that a woman need possessexcept money said ralph she has no fortune if you care about that  i dont care about money said the squire it is for the man to have thatat any rate for one so circumstanced as you the end of all this was that ralph was authorised to please himself if he really felt that he liked miss bonner well enough he might ask her to be his wife tomorrow  the difficulty is to get at her said ralph  ask the uncle for his permission thats the manliest and the fittest way to do it tell him everything take my word for it he wont turn his face against you as for me nothing on earth would make me so happy as to see your children if there were a dozen i would not think them one too many but mark you this ralph it will be easier for usfor you and me if i liveand for you without me if i go to make all things clear and square and free while the bairns are little than when they have to go to school and college or perhaps want to get married  aint we counting our chickens before they are hatched said ralph laughing  when they parted for the night which they did not do till after the squire had slept for an hour on his chair there was one other speech madea speech which ralph was likely to remember to the latest day of his life his father had taken his candlestick in his right hand and had laid his left upon his sons collar ralph said he for the first time in my life i can look you in the face and not feel a pang of remorse you will understand it when you have a son of your own goodnight my boy then he hurried off without waiting to hear a word if there was any word that ralph could have spoken  on the next morning they were both out early at darvells farm surrounded by bricklayers and carpenters and before the week was over the work was in progress poor darvell half elated and half troubled knew but little of the cause of this new vehemence something we suppose he did know for the news was soon spread over the estate that the squire had bought out mr ralph and that this other mr ralph was now to be mr ralph the heir that the old butler should not be toldthe butler who had lived in the house when the present squire was a boywas out of the question and though the communication had been made in confidence the confidence was not hermetical the squire after all was glad that it should be so the thing had to be made knownand why not after this fashion among the labourers and poor there was no doubt as to the joy felt that other mr ralph who had always been up in town was unknown to them and this mr ralph had ever been popular with them all with the tenants the feeling was perhaps more doubtful i wish you joy mr newton with all my heart said mr walker who was the richest and the most intelligent among them the squire has worked for you like a man and i hope it will come to good  i will do my best said ralph  i am sure you will there will be a feeling you know you mustnt be angry at that  i understand said ralph  you wont be vexed with me for just saying so ralph promised that he would not be vexed but he thought very much of what mr walker had said to him after all such a property as newton does not in england belong altogether to the owner of it those who live upon it and are closely concerned in it with reference to all that they have in the world have a part property in it they make it what it is and will not make it what it should be unless in their hearts they are proud of it you know he cant be the real squire said one old farmer to mr walker they may huggermugger it this way and that but this mr ralph cant be like tother young gentleman  nevertheless the squire himself was very happy these things were not said to him and he had been successful he took an interest in all things keener than he had felt for years past one day he was in the stables with his son and spoke about the hunting for the coming season he had an irish horse of which he was proud an old hunter that had carried him for the last seven years and of which he had often declared that under no consideration would he part with it dear old fellow he said putting his hand on the animals neck you shall work for your bread one other winter and then you shall give over for the rest of your life  i never saw him look better said ralph  hes like his masternot quite so young as he was once he never made a mistake yet that i know of  ralph when he saw how full of joy was his father could not but rejoice also that the thing so ardently desired had been at last accomplished     chapter xxix  the election   the day of the nomination at percycross came at last and it was manifest to everybody that there was a very unpleasant feeling in the town it was not only that party was arrayed against party that would have been a state of things not held to be undesirable and at any rate would have been natural but at present things were so divided that there was no saying which were the existing parties moggs was separated from westmacott quite as absolutely as was westmacott from the two conservative candidates the old liberals of the borough were full of ridicule for poor moggs of whom all absurd stories were told by them both publicly and privately but still he was there the darling of the workmen it was indeed asserted by the members of mr westmacotts committee that moggss popularity would secure for him but very few votes a great proportion of the working men of percycross were freemen of the boroughold voters who were on the register by right of their birth and family connection in the place independent of householdership and ratesand quite accustomed to the old ways of manipulation the younger of these men might be seduced into listening to moggs the excitement was pleasant to them but they were too well trained to be led away on the day of election moggs would give them no beer and they had always been accustomed to their three halfcrowns a head in consideration for the days work not a dozen freemen of the borough would vote for moggs so said mr kirkham mr westmacotts managing man and no man knew the borough quite so well as did mr kirkham theyll fight for him at the hustings said mr kirkham but theyll take their beer and their money and theyll vote for us and griffenbottom  this might be true enough as regarded the freementhe men who had been as it were educated to political lifebut there was much doubt as to the new voters there were about a thousand of these in the borough and it had certainly not been the intention of either party that these men should have the halfcrowns it was from these men and their leadersthe secretaries and chairmen and presidentsthat had come the cry for a second liberal candidate and the consequent necessity of putting forward two conservatives they were equally odious to the supporters of westmacott and of griffenbottom they must have the halfcrowns trigger had said to old pile the bootmaker pile thought that every working man was entitled to the three halfcrowns and said as much very clearly i suppose old griff aint going to turn hunks at this time o day said mr pile but the difficulties were endless and were much better understood by mr trigger than by mr pile the manner of conveying the halfcrowns to the three hundred and twentyfour freemen who would take them and vote honestly afterwards for griffenbottom and underwood was perfectly well understood but among that godless riotous ungoverned and ungovernable set of new householders there was no knowing how to act they would take the money and then vote wrong they would take the money and then split the freemen were known three hundred and twentyfour would take griffenbottoms beer and halfcrowns two hundred and seventytwo would be equally complaisant with mr westmacott but of these householders nothing was known they could not be handled some thirty or forty of them would probably have the turning of the election at the last hour must then be paid at their own prices and after that would not be safe mr trigger in his disgust declared that things had got into so vile a form that he didnt care if he never had anything to do with an election in percycross again  and then there was almost as much illfeeling between the oldfashioned griffenbottomites and the underwooders as there was between westmacotts liberals and moggss radicals the two gentlemen themselves still eat their breakfasts and dinners together and still paraded the streets of percycross in each others company but sir thomas had made himself very odious even to mr griffenbottom himself he was always protesting against beer which he did see and bribery which he did not see but did suspect he swore that he would pay not a shilling as to which the cause of the expenditure was not explained to him griffenbottom snarled at him and expressed an opinion that sir thomas would of course do the same as any other gentleman mr trigger with much dignity in his mien as he spoke declared that the discussion of any such matter at the present moment was indecorous mr pile was for sending sir thomas back to town and very strongly advocated that measure mr spicer as to whom there was a story abroad in the borough in respect of a large order for mustard supposed to have reached him from new york through liverpool by the influence of sir thomas underwood thought that the borough should return the two conservative candidates sir thomas might be a little indiscreet but upon the whole his principles did him honour so thought mr spicer who perhaps believed that the order for the mustard was coming we need hardly say that the story at any rate in so far as it regarded sir thomas underwood was altogether untrue yes principles said mr pile i think we all know sam spicers principles all for hisself and nothing for a poor man thats sam spicer of mr pile it must be acknowledged that he was not a pureminded politician he loved bribery in his very heart but it is equally true that he did not want to be bribed himself it was the oldfashioned privilege of a poor man to receive some small consideration for his vote in percycross and mr pile could not endure to think that the poor man should be robbed of his little comforts  in the meantime sir thomas himself was in a state of great misery from hour to hour he was fluctuating between a desire to run away from the accursed borough and the shame of taking such a step the desire for the seat which had brought him to percycross had almost died out amidst the misery of his position among all the men of his party with whom he was associating there was not one whom he did not dislike and by whom he was not snubbed and contradicted griffenbottom who went through his canvass under circumstances of coming gout and colchicum with a courage and pertinacity that were heroic was painfully cross to every one who was not a voter whats the use of all that dd nonsense now he said to sir thomas the evening before the nomination day there were halfadozen leading conservatives in the room and sir thomas was making a final protest against bribery he rose from his chair when so addressed and left the room never in his life before had he been so insulted trigger followed him to his bedroom knowing well that a quarrel at this moment would be absolutely suicidal its the gout sir thomas said mr trigger do remember what hes going through this was so true that sir thomas returned to the room it was almost impossible not to forgive anything in a man who was suffering agonies but could still wheedle a voter there were three conservative doctors with mr griffenbottom each of them twice daily and there was an opinion prevalent through the borough that the gout would be in his stomach before the election was over sir thomas did return to the room and sat himself down without saying a word sir thomas said mr griffenbottom a man with the gout is always allowed a little liberty  i admit the claim said sir thomas bowing  and believe me i know this game better than you do its of no use saying these things no man should ever foul his own nest give me a little drop more brandy trigger and then ill get myself to bed when he was gone they all sang griffenbottoms praises in staunch pluck good humour and manly fighting no man was his superior give and takethe english bulldog all over i do like old griffenbottom said spiveycomb the papermaker  on the day of nomination griffenbottom was carried up on the hustings this carrying did him good in the borough but it should be acknowledged on his behalf that he did his best to walk in the extreme agony of his attack he had to make his speech and he made it the hustings stood in the marketsquare and straight in front of the wooden erection standing at right angles to it was a stout rail dividing the space for the distance of fifty or sixty yards so that the supporters of one set of candidates might congregate on one side and the supporters of the other candidates on the other side in this way would the weaker part whichever might be the weaker be protected from the violence of the stronger on the present occasion it seemed that the friends of mr westmacott congregated with the conservatives moggss allies alone filled one side of the partition there were a great many speeches made that day from the hustingsthirteen in all first the mayor and then the four proposers and four seconders of the candidates during these performances though there was so much noise from the crowd below that not a word could be heard there was no violence when old griffenbottom got up supporting himself by an arm round one of the posts he was loudly cheered from both sides his personal popularity in the borough was undoubted and his gout made him almost a demigod nobody heard a word that he said but then he had no desire to be heard to be seen standing up there a martyr to the gout but still shouting for percycross was enough for his purpose sir thomas encountered a very different reception he was received with yells apparently from the whole crowd what he said was of no matter as not a word was audible but he did continue to inveigh against bribery before he had ceased a huge stone was thrown at him and hit him heavily on the arm he continued speaking however and did not himself know till afterwards that his arm was broken between the shoulder and the elbow mr westmacott was very short and goodhumoured he intended to be funny about poor moggsand perhaps was funny but his fun was of no avail the moggite crowd had determined that no men should be heard till their own candidate should open his mouth  at last ontarios turn had come at first the roar from the crowd was so great that it seemed that it was to be with him as it had been with the others but by degrees though there was still a roaras of the seamoggss words became audible the voices of assent and dissent are very different even though they be equally loud men desirous of interrupting do interrupt but cheers though they be continuous and loud as thunder are compatible with a hearing moggs by this time too had learned to pitch his voice for an outofdoor multitude he preached his sermon his old sermon about the rights of labour and the salt of the earth the tyranny of capital and the majesty of the workmen with an enthusiasm that made him for the moment supremely happy he was certainly the hero of the tour in percycross and he allowed himself to believejust for that hourthat he was about to become the hero of a new doctrine throughout england he spoke for over half an hour while poor griffenbottom seated in a chair that had been brought to him was suffering almost the pains of hell during this speech sir thomas who had also suffered greatly but had at first endeavoured to conceal that he was suffering discovered the extent of his misfortune and allowed himself to be taken out from the hustings to his inn there was an effort made to induce mr griffenbottom to retire at the same time but mr griffenbottom not quite understanding the extent of his colleagues misfortune and thinking that it became him to remain and to endure was obdurate and would not be moved he did not care for stones or threatsdid not care even for the gout that was his place till after the show of hands and there he would remain the populace seeing this commotion on the hustings began to fear that there was an intention to stop the oratory of their popular candidate and called loudly upon moggs to go on moggs did go onand was happy  at last there came the show of hands it was declared to be in favour of moggs and westmacott that it was very much in favour of moggsin favour of moggs by five to one there was no doubt among the other candidates there was not perhaps much to choose a poll was of course demanded for the two conservatives and then the mayor complimenting the people on their good behaviourin spite of poor sir thomass broken armbegged them to go away that was all very well of course they would go away but not till they had driven their enemies from the field in half a minute the dividing railthe rail that had divided the blue from the yellowwas down and all those who had dared to show themselves there as supporters of griffenbottom and underwood were driven ignominiously from the marketplace they fled at all corners and in a few seconds not a streak of blue ribbon was to be seen in the square theyll elect that fellow moggs tomorrow said mr westmacott to kirkham  no a bit of it said kirkham i could spot all the ringleaders in the row nine or ten of them are griffenbottoms old men they take his money regularlyget something nearly every year join the rads at the nomination and vote for the squire at the poll the chaps who hollow and throw stones always vote tother side up  mr griffenbottom kept his seat till he could be carried home in safety through the town and was then put to bed the three conservative doctors who had all been setting sir thomass arm sat in consultation upon their old friend and it was acknowledged on every side that mr griffenbottom was very ill indeed all manner of rumours went through the town that night some believed that both griffenbottom and sir thomas were deadand that the mayor had now no choice but to declare moggs and westmacott elected then there arose a suspicion that the polls would be kept open on the morrow on behalf of two defunct candidates so that a further election on behalf of the conservative party might be ensured men swore that they would break into the bedrooms of the standard inn in order that they might satisfy themselves whether the two gentlemen were alive or dead and so the town was in a hubbub  on that evening moggs was called upon again to address his friends at the mechanics institute and to listen to the speeches of all the presidents and secretaries and chairmen but by ten oclock he was alone in his bedroom at the cordwainers arms downstairs men were shouting singing and drinkingshouting in his honour though not drinking at his expense he was alone in his little comfortless room but felt it to be impossible that he should lie down and rest his heart was swelling with the emotions of the day and his mind was full of his coming triumph it was black night and there was a soft drizzling rainbut it was absolutely necessary for his condition that he should go out it seemed to him that his very bosom would burst if he confined himself in that narrow space his thoughts were too big for so small a closet he crept downstairs and out through the narrow passage into the night then by the light of the solitary lamp that stood before the door of the publichouse he could still see those glorious words moggs purity and the rights of labour noble words which had sufficed to bind to him the whole population of that generoushearted borough purity and the rights of labour might it not be that with that cry well cried he might move the very world as he walked the streets of the town he felt a great love for the borough grow within his bosom what would he not owe to the dear place which had first recognised his worth and had enabled him thus early in life to seize hold of those ploughshares which it would be his destiny to hold for all his coming years he had before him a career such as had graced the lives of the men whom he had most loved and admiredof men who had dared to be independent patriotic and philanthropical through all the temptations of political life would he be too vain if he thought to rival a hume or a cobden conceit he said to himself will seek to justify itself who can rise but those who believe their wings strong enough for soaring there might be shipwreck of coursebut he believed that he now saw his way as to the difficulty of speaking in publicthat he had altogether overcome some further education as to facts historical and political might be necessary that he acknowledged to himselfbut he would not spare himself in his efforts to acquire such education he went pacing through the damp muddy dark streets making speeches that were deliciously eloquent to his own ears that night he was certainly the happiest man in percycross never doubting his success on the morrownot questioning that had not the whole town greeted him with loudest acclamation as their chosen member he was deliciously happywhile poor sir thomas was suffering the double pain of his broken arm and his dissipated hopes and griffenbottom was lying in his bed with a doctor on one side and a nurse on the other hardly able to restrain himself from cursing all the world in his agony  at a little after eleven a tall man buttoned up to his chin in an old great coat called at the percy standard and asked after the health of mr griffenbottom and sir thomas they aint neither of them very well then replied the waiter will you say that mr moggs called to inquire with his compliments said the tall man the respect shown to him was immediately visible even the waiter at the percy standard acknowledged that for that day mr moggs must be treated as a great man in percycross after that moggs walked home and crept into bedbut it may be doubted whether he slept a wink that night  and then there came the real daythe day of the election it was a foul rainy muddy sloppy morning without a glimmer of sun with that thick pervading melancholy atmosphere which forces for the time upon imaginative men a conviction that nothing is worth anything griffenbottom was in bed in one room at the percy standard and underwood in the next the three conservative doctors moving from one chamber to another watching each other closely and hardly leaving the hotel had a good time of it mr trigger had already remarked that in one respect the breaking of sir thomass arm was lucky because now there would be no difficulty as to paying the doctors out of the common fund every halfhour the state of the poll was brought to them early in the morning moggs had been in the ascendant at halfpast nine the numbers were as follows      moggs          193    westmacott     172    griffenbottom  162    underwood      147   at ten and at halfpast ten moggs was equally in advance but westmacott had somewhat receded at noon the numbers were considerably altered and were as follows      griffenbottom  892    moggs          777    westmacott     752    underwood      678   these at least were the numbers as they came from the conservative books westmacott was placed nearer to moggs by his own tellers for moggs no special books were kept he was content to abide by the official counting  griffenbottom was consulted privately by trigger and mr spiveycomb as to what steps should be taken in this emergency it was suggested in a whisper that underwood should be thrown over altogether there would be no beating moggsso thought mr spiveycomband unless an effort were made it might be possible that westmacott would creep up trigger in his heart considered that it would be impossible to get enough men at three halfcrowns a piece to bring sir thomas up to a winning condition but griffenbottom now that the fight was forward was unwilling to give way a foot we havent polled half the voters said he  more than half what we shall poll answered trigger  they always hang back growled griffenbottom fight it out i dont believe theyll ever elect a shoemaker here the order was given and it was fought out  moggs early in the morning had been radiant with triumph when he saw his name at the head of the lists displayed from the two inimical committee rooms as he walked the streets with a chairman on one side of him and a president on the other it seemed as though his feet almost disdained to touch the mud these were two happy hours during which he did not allow himself to doubt of his triumph when the presidents and the chairmen spoke to him he could hardly answer them so rapt was he in contemplation of his coming greatness his very soul was full of his seat in parliament but when griffenbottom approached him on the lists and then passed him there came a shadow upon his brow he still felt sure of his election but he would lose that grand place at the top of the poll to which he had taught himself to look so proudly soon after noon a cruel speech was made to him weve about pumped our side dry said a secretary of a young mens association  do you mean weve polled all our friends asked moggs  pretty nearly mr moggs you see our men have nothing to wait for and they came up early then ontarios heart sank within him and he began to think of the shop in bond street  the work of that afternoon in percycross proved how correct mr griffenbottom had been in his judgment he kept his place at the top of the poll it was soon evident that that could not be shaken then westmacott passed by moggs and in the next halfhour sir thomas did so also this was at two when ontario betook himself to the privacy of his bedroom at the cordwainers arms his pluck left him altogether and he found himself unable to face the town as a losing candidate then for two hours there was a terrible struggle between westmacott and underwood during which things were done in the desperation of the moment as to which it might be so difficult to give an account should any subsequent account be required we all know how hard it is to sacrifice the power of winning when during the heat of the contest the power of winning is within our reach at four oclock the state of the poll was as follows      griffenbottom  1402    underwood      1007    westmacott      984    moggs           821   when the chairmen and presidents waited upon moggs telling him of the final result and informing him that he must come to the hustings and make a speech they endeavoured to console him by an assurance that he and he alone had fought the fight fairly theyll both be unseated you know as sure as eggs said the president it cant be otherwise theyve been busy up in a little room in petticoat court all the afternoon and the men have been getting as much as fifteen shillings a head moggs was not consoled but he did make his speech it was poor and vapidbut still there was just enough of manhood left in him for that as soon as his speech had been spoken he escaped up to london by the night mail train westmacott also spoke but announcement was made on behalf of the members of the borough that they were both of them in their beds     chapter xxx  miss mary is in luck   the election took place on a tuesdaytuesday the 17th of october on the following day one of the members received a visit in his bedroom at the percy standard which was very pleasant to him his daughter patience had come down to nurse sir thomas and take him back to fulham sir thomas had refused to allow any message to be sent home on the day on which the accident had occurred on the following morning he had telegraphed to say that his arm had been broken but that he was doing very well and on the wednesday patience was with him  in spite of the broken arm it was a pleasant meeting for the last fortnight sir thomas had not only not seen a human being with whom he could sympathise but had been constrained to associate with people who were detestable to him his horror of griffenbottom his disgust at trigger his fear of mr pabsbys explanations and his inability to cope with messrs spicer and roodylands when they spoke of mustard and boots had been almost too much for him the partial seclusion occasioned by his broken arm had been a godsend to him in such a state he was prepared to feel that his daughters presence was an angels visit and even to him his success had something of the pleasure of a triumph of course he was pleased to have won the seat and though whispers of threats as to a petition had already reached him he was able in these the first hours of his membership to throw his fears on that head behind him the man must be of a most cold temperament who under such circumstances cannot allow himself some short enjoyment of his new toy it was his at least for the time and he probably told himself that threatened folk lived long that patience should take glory in the victory was a matter of course dear papa she said if you can only get your arm well again  i dont suppose there is any cause for fear as to that  but a broken arm is a great misfortune said patience  wellyes one cant deny that and three percycross doctors are three more misfortunes i must get home as soon as i can  you mustnt be rash papa even to escape from percycross but oh papa we are so happy and so proud it is such an excellent thing that you should be in parliament again  i dont know that my dear  we feel it soclary and iand so does mary i cant tell you the sort of anxiety we were in all day yesterday first we got the telegram about your armand then stemm came down at eight and told us that you were returned stemm was quite humane on the occasion  poor stemmi dont know what hell have to do  it wont matter to him papawill it and then he told me another piece of news  what is it  you wont like it papa we didnt like it at all  what is it my dear  stemm says that ralph has sold all the newton priory estate to his uncle  it is the best thing he could do  really papa  i think so he must have done that or made some disreputable marriage  i dont think he would have done that said patience  but he was going to do it he had halfengaged himself to some tailors daughter indeed up to the moment of your telling me this i thought he would marry her poor clary so patience said to herself as she heard this he had got himself into such a mess that the best thing he could do was to sell his interest to his uncle the estate will go to a better fellow though out of the proper line  then patience told her father that she had brought a letter for him which had been given to her that morning by stemm who had met her at the station  i think she said that it comes from some of the newton family because of the crest and the basingstoke postmark then the letter was broughtand as it concerns much the thread of our story it shall be given to the reader      newton priory october 17 186     my dear sir thomas underwood     i write to you with the sanction or rather at the    instigation of my father to ask your permission to become    a suitor to your niece miss bonner you will probably    have heard or at least will hear that my father has made    arrangements with his nephew ralph by which the reversion    of the newton property will belong to my father it is his    intention to leave the estate to me and he permits me to    tell you that he will consent to any such settlement in    the case of my marriage as would have been usual had    i been his legitimate heir i think it best to be frank    about this as i should not have ventured to propose    such a marriage either to you or to miss bonner had    not my fathers solicitude succeeded in placing me in    circumstances which may perhaps be regarded as in part    compensating the great misfortune of my birth     it may probably be right that i should add that i have    said no word on this subject to miss bonner i have    hitherto felt myself constrained by the circumstances to    which i have alluded from acting as other men may act    should you be unwilling to concede that the advantages    of fortune which have now fallen in my way justify me in    proposing to myself such a marriage i hope that you will    at least excuse my application to yourself     very faithfully yours     ralph newton   sir thomas read the letter twice before he spoke a word to his daughter then after pausing with it for a moment in his hand he threw it to her across the bed miss mary is in luck he saidin very great luck it is a magnificent property and as far as i can see one of the finest young fellows i ever met you understand about his birth  yes said patience almost in a whisper  it might be a hindrance to him in some circumstances but not here it is nothing here did you know of this  no indeed  nor mary  it will be quite a surprise to her i am sure it will  you think then that there has been nothing saidnot a word about it  i am sure there has not papa clarissa had some joke with maryquite as a joke  then there has been a joke  it meant nothing and as for mr newton he could not have dreamed of anything of the kind we all liked him  so did i the property will be much better with him than with the other mary is a very lucky girl thats all i can say as for the letter its the best letter i ever read in my life  there was some delay before sir thomas could write an answer to young newton it was indeed his left arm that had suffered but even with so much of power abstracted writing is not an easy task and this was a letter the answering of which could not be deputed to any secretary on the third day after its receipt sir thomas did manage with much difficulty to get a reply written      dear mr newton     i have had my left arm broken in the election here hence    the delay i can have no objection your letter does you    infinite honour i presume you know that my niece has no    fortune     yours most sincerely     thomas underwood   what a pity it is said sir thomas that a man cant have a broken arm in answering all letters i should have had to write ever so much had i been well and yet i could not have said a word more that would have been of any use  sir thomas was kept an entire week at the percycross standard after his election was over before the three doctors and the innkeeper between them would allow him to be moved during this time there was very much discussion between the father and daughter as to marys prospects and a word or two was said inadvertently which almost opened the fathers eyes as to the state of his younger daughters affections it is sometimes impossible to prevent the betrayal of a confidence when the line between betrayal and nonbetrayal is finely drawn it was a matter of course that there should be much said about that other ralph the one now disinherited and dispossessed who had so long and so intimately been known to them and it was almost impossible for patience not to show the cause of her great grief it might be as her father said that the property would be better in the hands of this other young man but patience knew that her sympathies were with the spendthrift and with the dearlyloved sister who loved the spendthrift since clarissa had come to speak so openly of her love to assert it so loudly and to protest that nothing could or should shake it patience had been unable not to hope that the heir might at last prove himself worthy to be her sisters husband then they heard that his inheritance was sold it wont make the slightest difference to me said clary almost triumphantly as she discussed the matter with patience the evening before the journey to percycross if he were a beggar it would be the same to patience however the news of the sale had been a great blow and now her father told her that this young man had been thinking of marrying another girl a tailors daughterthat such a marriage had been almost fixed surely it would be better that steps should be taken to wean her sister from such a passion but yet she did not tell the secret she only allowed a word to escape her from which it might be half surmised that clarissa would be a sufferer what difference will it make to clary asked sir thomas  i have sometimes thought that he cared for her said patience cunningly he would hardly have been so often at the villa unless there had been something  there must be nothing of that kind said sir thomas he is a spendthrift and quite unworthy of her i will not have him at the villa he must be told so if you see anything of that kind you must inform me do you understand patience patience understood well enough but knew not what reply to make she could not tell her sisters secret and if there were faults in the matter was it not her fathers fault why had he not lived with them so that he might see these things with his own eyes there must be nothing of that kind said sir thomas with a look of anger in his eyes  when the week was over the innkeeper and the doctors submitting with but a bad grace the member for percycross returned to london with his arm bound up in a sling the town was by this time quite tranquil the hustings had been taken down and the artizans of the borough were back at their labours almost forgetting moggs and his great doctrines that there was to be a petition was a matter of course it was at least a matter of course that there should be threats of a petition the threat of course reached sir thomass ears but nothing further was said to him when he and his daughter went down to the station in the standard fly it almost seemed that he was no more to the borough than any other man might be with a broken arm i shall not speak of this to mary he said on his journey home nor should you i think my dear  of course not papa  he should have the opportunity of changing his mind after receiving my letter if he so pleases for her sake i hope he will not patience said nothing further she loved her cousin mary and certainly had felt no dislike for this fortunate young man but she could not so quickly bring herself to sympathise with interests which seemed to be opposed to those of her sister     chapter xxxi  it is all settled   in the last half of this month of october the squire at newton was very pressing on his lawyers up in london to settle the affairs of the property he was most anxious to make a new will but could not do so till his nephew had completed the sale and till the money had been paid he had expressed a desire to go up to london and remain there till all was done but against this his son had expostulated urging that his father could not hasten the work up in london by his presence but would certainly annoy and flurry everybody in the lawyers office mr carey had promised that the thing should be done with as little delay as possible but mr carey was not a man to be driven then again the squire would be a miserable man up in london whereas at the priory he might be so happy among the new works which he had already inaugurated the sons arguments prevailedespecially that argument as to the pleasure of the squires present occupationsand the squire consented to remain at home  there seemed to be an infinity of things to be done and to the squire himself the world appeared to require more of happy activity than at any previous time of his life he got up early and was out about the place before breakfast he had endless instructions to give to everybody about the estate the very air of the place was sweeter to him than heretofore the labourers were less melancholy at their work the farmers smiled oftener the women and children were more dear to him everything around him had now been gifted with the grace of established ownership his nephew gregory after that last dinner of which mention was made hardly came near him during the next fortnight once or twice the squire went up to the church during week days that he might catch the parson and even called at the parsonage but gregory was unhappy and would not conceal his unhappiness i suppose it will wear off said the squire to his son  of course it will sir  it shall not be my fault if it does not i wonder whether it would have made him happier to see the property parcelled out and sold to the highest bidder after my death  it is not unnatural if you think of it said ralph  perhaps not and god forbid that i should be angry with him because he cannot share my triumph i feel however that i have done my duty and that nobody has a right to quarrel with me  and then there were the hunters every sportsman knows and the wives and daughters of all sportsmen know how important a month in the calendar is the month of october the real campaign begins in november and even for those who do not personally attend to the earlier work of the kennelor look after cubhunting which during the last ten days of october is apt to take the shape of genuine huntingoctober has charms of its own and peculiar duties it is the busiest month in the year in regard to horses is physic needed in the squires stables physic was much eschewed and the squires horses were usually in good condition but it is needful to know down to a single line on the form whether this or that animal wants more exerciseand if so of what nature we hold that for hunters which are worked regularly throughout the season and which live in loose boxes summer and winter but little exercise is required except in the months of september and october let them have been fed on oats throughout the year and a good groom will bring them into form in two months such at least was the order at the newton stables and during this autumnespecially during these last days of octoberthis order was obeyed with infinite alacrity and with many preparations for coming joys and there are other cares less onerous indeed but still needful what good sportsman is too proud or even too much engaged to inspect his horses gearand his own only let his horses gear stand first in his mind let him be sure that the fit of a saddle is of more moment than the fit of a pair of breechesthat in riding the length strength and nature of the bit will avail moreshould at least avail morethan the depth form and general arrangement of the flask that the question of boots great as it certainly is should be postponed to the question of shoes that a mans seat should be guarded by his girths rather than by his spurs that no run has ever been secured by the brilliancy of the cravat though many a run has been lost by the insufficiency of a stirrupleather in the stables and saddleroom and throughout the whole establishment of the house at newton all these matters were ever sedulously regarded but they had never been regarded with more joyful zeal than was given to them during this happy month there was not a stableboy about the place who did not know and feel that their mr ralph was now to take his place in the huntingfield as the heir to newton priory  and there were other duties at newton of which the crowd of ridingmen know little or nothing were there foxes in the coverts the squire had all his life been a staunch preserver thinking more of a vixen with her young cubs than he would of any lady in the land with her firstborn son during the last spring and summer however things had made him uncomfortable and he had not personally inquired after the wellbeing of each nursery in the woods as had been his wont ralph indeed had been on the alert and the keepers had not become slackbut there had been a whisper about the place that the master didnt care so much about the foxes as he used to do they soon found out that he cared enough now the headkeeper opened his eyes very wide when he was told that the squire would take it as a personal offence if the coverts were ever drawn blank it was to be understood through the county that at newton priory everything now was happy and prosperous well get up a breakfast and a meet on the lawn before the end of the month said the squire to his son i hate hunt breakfasts myself but the farmers like them from all which the reader will perceive that the squire was in earnest  ralph hunted all through the latter days of october but the squire himself would not go out till the first regular day of the season i like a law and i like to stick to it he said five months is enough for the horses in all conscience at last the happy day arrivedwednesday the 2nd of novemberand the father and son started together for the meet in a dogcart on four wheels with two horses on such occasions the squire always drove himself and professed to go no more than eight miles an hour the meet was over in the berkshire county in the neighbourhood of swallowfield about twelve miles distant and the squire was in his seat precisely at halfpast nine four horses had gone on in the charge of two grooms for the squire had insisted on ralph riding with a second horse if you dont i wont he had said and ralph of course had yielded just at this time there had grown up in the young mans mind a feeling that his father was almost excessive in the exuberance of his joythat he was displaying too ostensibly to the world at large the triumph which he had effected but the checking of this elation was almost impossible to the son on whose behalf it was exhibited therefore to ralphs own regret the two horses had on this morning been sent on to barford heath the squire was not kept waiting a moment ralph lit his cigar and jumped in and the squire started in all comfort and joy the road led them by darvells farm and for a moment the carriage was stopped that a word might be spoken to some workman youd better have a couple more men miles it wont do to let the frost catch us said the squire miles touched his hat and assented the house will look very well from here said the squire pointing down through a line of trees ralph assented cheerily and yet he thought that his father was spending more money than darvells house need to have cost him  they reached barford heath a few minutes before eleven and there was a little scene upon the occasion it was the first recognised meet of the season and the squire had not been out before it was now known to almost every man there that the owner of newton priory had at last succeeded in obtaining the reversion of the estate for his own son and though the matter was one which hardly admitted of open congratulation still there were words spoken and looks given and a little additional pressure in the shaking of handsall of which seemed to mark a triumph that other ralph had not been known in the county this ralph was very popular and though of course there was existent some amount of inner unexpressed feeling that the proper line of an old family was being broken that for the moment was kept in abeyance and all mens faces wore smiles as they were turned upon the happy squire he hardly carried himself with as perfect a moderation as his son would have wished he was a little loudnot saying much to any one openly about the property uttering merely a word or two in a low voice in answer to the kind expressions of one or two specially intimate friends but in discussing other mattersthe appearance of the pack the prospects of the season the state of the countyhe was not quite like himself in his ordinary way he was a quiet man not often heard at much distance and contented to be noted as newton of newton rather than as a man commanding attention by his conduct before other men there certainly was a difference today and it was of that kind which wine produces on some who are not habitual drinkers the gases of his life were in exuberance and he was as a balloon insufficiently freighted with ballast his buoyancy unless checked might carry him too high among the clouds all this ralph saw and kept himself a little aloof if there were aught amiss there was no help for it on his part and after all what was amiss was so very little amiss  well draw the small gorses first said the old master addressing himself specially to mr newton and then well go into barford wood  just so said the squire the gorses first by all means i remember when there was always a fox at barford gorse come along i hate to see time wasted youll be glad to hear were full of foxes at newton there were two litters bred in bostock springtwo by jove in that little place dandan was his second horsemanill ride the young one this morning you have paddywhack fresh for me about one paddywhack was the old irish horse which had carried him so long and has been mentioned before there was nothing remarkable in all this there was no word spoken that might not have been said with a good grace by any old sportsman who knew the men around him and who had long preserved foxes for their usebut still it was felt that the squire was a little loud ralph the son on whose behalf all this triumph was felt was silenter than usual and trotted along at the rear of the long line of horsemen  one specially intimate friend of hisa man whom he really lovedhung back with the object of congratulating him ralph said george morris of watheby grove a place about four miles from the priory i must tell you how glad i am of all this  all right old fellow  come you might show out a little to me isnt it grand we shall always have you among us now dont tell me that you are indifferent  i think enough about it god knows george but it seems to me that the less said about it the better my father has behaved nobly to me and of course i like to feel that ive got a place in the world marked out for me but  but what  you understand it all george there shouldnt be rejoicing in a family because the heir has lost his inheritance  i cant look at it in that line  i cant look at it in any other said ralph mind you im not saying that it isnt all right what has happened to him has come of his own doings i only mean that we ought to be quiet about it my fathers spirits are so high that he can hardly control them  by george i dont wonder at it said george morris  there were three little bits of gorse about halfamile from barford wood as to which it seemed that expectation did not run high but from the last of which an old fox broke before the hounds were in it it was so sudden a thing that the pack was on the scent and away before halfadozen men had seen what had happened our squire had been riding with cox the huntsman who had ventured to say how happy he was that the young squire was to be the squire some day so am i cox so am i said the squire and i hope hell be a friend to you for many a year  by the holy theres dick ahallooing said cox forgetting at once the comparatively unimportant affairs of newton priory in the breaking of this unexpected fox gollyif he aint away squire the hounds had gone at once to the whips voice and were in full cry in less time than it has taken to tell the story of the find cox was with them and so was the squire there were two or three others and one of the whips the start indeed was not much but the burst was so sharp and the old fox ran so straight that it sufficed to enable those who had got the lead to keep it tallyho shouted the squire as he saw the animal making across a stubble field before the hounds with only one fence between him and the quarry tallyho it was remarked afterwards that the squire had never been known to halloo to a fox in that way before just like one of the young uns or a fellow out of the town said cox when expressing his astonishment  but the squire never rode a run better in his life he gave a lead to the field and he kept it i wouldnt a spoilt him by putting my nose afore is were it ever so said cox afterwards he went as straight as a schoolboy at christmas and the young horse he rode never made a mistake let men say what they will a young horse will carry a man a brush like that better than an old one it was very short they had run their fox pulled him down broken him up and eaten him within half an hour jack graham who is particular about those things and who was at any rate near enough to see it all said that it was exactly twentytwo minutes and a half he might be right enough in that but when he swore that they had gone over four miles of ground he was certainly wrong they killed within a field of heckfield church and heckfield church cant be four miles from barford gorse that they went as straight as a line everybody knew besides they couldnt have covered the ground in the time the pace was good no doubt but jacky graham is always given to exaggeration  the squire was very proud of his performance and when ralph came up was loud in praise of the young horse never was carried so well in my lifenever said he i knew he was good but i didnt know he would jump like that i wouldnt take a couple of hundred for him this was still a little loud but the squire at this moment had the sense of double triumph within and was to be forgiven it was admitted on all sides that he had ridden the run uncommonly well just like a young man by jove said jack graham like what sort of a young man asked george harris who had come up at the heel of the hunt with ralph  and where were you master ralph said the squire to his son  i fancy i just began to know they were running by the time you were killing your fox said ralph  you should have your eyes better about you my boy shouldnt he cox  the young squire aint often in the wrong box said the huntsman  he wasnt in the right one today said the squire this was still a little loud there was too much of that buoyancy which might have come from drink but which with the squire was the effect of that success for which he had been longing rather than hoping all his life  from heckfield they trotted back to barford wood the master resolving that he would draw his country in the manner he had proposed to himself in the morning there was some little repining at this partly because the distance was long and partly because barford woods were too large to be popular hunting is over for the day said jack graham to this view of the case the squire who had now changed his horse objected greatly we shall find in barford big wood as sure as the sun rises said he yes said jack and run into the little wood and back to the big wood and so on till we hate every foot of the ground i never knew anything from barford woods yet for which a donkey wasnt as good as a horse the squire again objected and told the story of a run from barford woods twenty years ago which had taken them pretty nearly on to ascot heath things have changed since that said jack graham very much for the better said the squire ralph was with him then and still felt that his father was too loud whether he meant that hunting was better now than in the old days twenty years ago or that things as regarded the newton estate were better was not explained but all who heard him speak imagined that he was alluding to the latter subject  drawing barford woods is a very different thing than drawing barford gorses anybody may see a fox found at the gorses who will simply take the trouble to be with the hounds when they go into the covert but in the wood it becomes a great question with a sportsman whether he will stick to the pack or save his horse and loiter about till he hears that a fox has been found the latter is certainly the commoner course and perhaps the wiser and even when the fox has been found it may be better for the expectant sportsman to loiter about till he breaks giving some little attention to the part of the wood in which the work of hunting may be progressing there are those who systematically stand still or roam about very slowlyothers again who ride and cease riding by spurts just as they become weary or impatientand others who with dogged perseverance stick always to the track of the hounds for years past the squire was to have been found among the former and more prudent set of riders but on this occasion he went gallantly through the thickest of the underwood close at the huntsmans heels youll find it rather nasty mr newton among them brakes cox had said to him but the squire had answered that he hadnt got his sunday face on and had persevered  they were soon on a fox in barford woodbut being on a fox in barford wood was very different from finding a fox in barford gorse out of the gorse a fox must go but in the big woods he might choose to remain half the day and then the chances were that he would either beat the hounds at last or else be eaten in covert its a very pretty place to ride about and smoke and drink ones friends sherry that was jack grahams idea of hunting in barford woods and a great deal of that kind of thing was going on today now and then there was a little excitement and cries of away were heard men would burst out of the wood here and there ride about for a few minutes and then go in again cox swore that they had thrice changed their fox and was beginning to be a little short in his temper the whips horses were becoming jaded and the master had once or twice answered very crossly when questioned how the devil do you suppose im to know he had said to a young gentleman who had inquired where they were but still the squire kept on zealously and reminded ralph that some of the best things of the season were often lost by men becoming slack towards evening at that time it was nearly four oclock and cox was clearly of opinion that he couldnt kill a fox in barford woods that day  but still the hounds were hunting darned if they aint back to the little wood again said cox to the squire they were at that moment in an extreme corner of an outlying copse and between them and barford little wood was a narrow strip of meadow over which they had passed halfadozen times that day between the copse and the meadow there ran a broad ditch with a hedgea rotten madeup fence of sticks and bushes which at the corner had been broken down by the constant passing of horses till at this hour of the day there was hardly at that spot anything of a fence to be jumped we must cross with them again cox said the squire at that moment he was nearest to the gap and close to him were ralph and george morris as well as the huntsman but mr newtons horse was standing sideways to the hedge and was not facing the passage he nevertheless prepared to pass it first and turned his horse sharply at it as he did so some bush or stick caught the animal in the flank and he in order to escape the impediment clambered up the bank sideways not taking the gap and then balanced himself to make his jump over the ditch but he was entangled among the sticks and thorns and was on broken ground and jumping short came down into the ditch the squire fell heavily headlong on to the field and the horse with no further effort of his own but unable to restrain himself rolled over his master it was a place as to which any horseman would say that a child might ride through if on a donkey without a chance of danger and yet the three men who saw it knew at once that the squire had had a bad fall ralph was first through the gap and was off his own horse as the old irish hunter with a groan collected himself and got upon his legs in rising the animal was very careful not to strike his late rider with his feet but it was too evident to cox that the beast in his attempt to rise had given a terrible squeeze to the prostrate squire with his saddle  in a moment the three men were on their knees and it was clear that mr newton was insensible im afraid hes hurt said morris cox merely shook his head as he gently attempted to raise the squires shoulder against his own ralph as pale as death held his fathers hand in one of his own and with the other endeavoured to feel the pulse of the heart presently before any one else came up to them a few drops of blood came from between the sufferers lips cox again shook his head wed better get him on to a gate mr ralph and into a house said the huntsman they were quickly surrounded by others and the gate was soon there and within twenty minutes a surgeon was standing over our poor old friend no he wasnt dead the surgeon said but what is it asked ralph impetuously the surgeon took the master of the hunt aside and whispered into his ear that mr newton was a dead man his spine had been so injured by the severity of his own fall and by the weight of the horse rolling on him while he was still doubled up on the ground that it was impossible that he should ever speak again so the surgeon said and squire newton never did speak again   illustration in a moment the three men were on their knees and it was clear that mr newton was insensible   he was carried home to the house of a gentleman who lived in those parts in order that he might be saved the longer journey to the priorybut the length of the road mattered but little to him he never spoke again nor was he sensible for a moment ralph remained with him during the nightof courseand so did the surgeon at five oclock on the following morning his last breath had been drawn and his life had passed away from him george morris also had remained with themor rather had come back to the house after having ridden home and changed his clothes and it was by him that the tidings were at last told to the wretched son it is all over ralph i suppose so said ralph hoarsely there has never been a doubt said george since we heard of the manner of the accident i suppose not said ralph the young man sat silent and composed and made no expression of his grief he did not weep nor did his face even wear that look of woe which is so common to us all when grief comes to us they two were still in the room in which the body lay and were standing close together over the fire ralph was leaning on his elbow upon the chimneypiece and from time to time morris would press his arm they had been standing together thus for some twenty minutes when morris asked a question  the affair of the property had been settled ralph  dont talk of that now said the other angrily then after a pause he put up his face and spoke again nothing has been settled he said the estate belongs to my cousin ralph he should be informed at onceat once he should he telegraphed to to come to newton would you mind doing it he should be informed at once  there is time enough for that said george morris  if you will not i must replied ralph  the telegram was at once sent in duplicate addressed to that other ralphralph who was declared by the squires son to be once more ralph the heiraddressed to him both at his lodgings in london and at the moonbeam when the messenger had been sent to the nearest railway station with the message ralph and his friend started for newton priory together poor ralph still wore his boots and breeches and the red coat in which he had ridden on the former fatal day and in which he had passed the night by the side of his dying fathers bed on their journey homeward they met gregory who had heard of the accident and had at once started to see his uncle  it is all over said ralph gregory who was in his gig dropped the reins and sat in silence it is all done let us get on george it is horrid to me to be in this coat get on quickly yes indeed everything is done now  he had lost a father who had loved him dearly and whom he had dearly loveda father whose opportunities of showing his active love had been greater even than fall to the lot of most parents a father gives naturally to his son but the squire had been almost unnatural in his desire to give there had never been a more devoted father one more intensely anxious for his sons welfareand ralph had known this and loved his father accordingly nevertheless he could not keep himself from remembering that he had now lost more than a father the estate as to which the squire had been so full of interestas to which he ralph had so constantly endeavoured to protect himself from an interest that should be too absorbinghad in the last moment escaped him and now in this sad and solemn hour he could not keep himself from thinking of that loss as he had stood in the room in which the dead body of his father had been lying he had cautioned himself against this feeling but still he had known that it had been present to him let him do what he would with his own thoughts he could not hinder them from running back to the fact that by his fathers sudden death he had lost the possession of the newton estate he hated himself for remembering such a fact at such a time but he could not keep himself from remembering it his father had fought a lifelong battle to make him the heir of newton and had perished in the moment of his victorybut before his victory was achieved ralph had borne his success well while he had thought that his success was certain but now he knew that all such subjects should be absent from his mind with such cause for grief as weighed upon him at this momentbut he could not drive away the reflection that other ralph newton had won upon the post he would endeavour to bear himself well but he could not but remember that he had been beaten and there was the father who had loved him so well lying dead  when he reached the house george morris was still with him gregory to whom he had spoken hardly a word did not come beyond the parsonage ralph could not conceal from himself could hardly conceal from his outward manner the knowledge that gregory must be aware that his cause had triumphed and yet he hated himself for thinking of these things and believed himself to be brutal in that he could not conceal his thoughts ill send over for a few things and stay with you for a day or two said george morris it would be bad that you should be left here alone but ralph would not permit the visit my fathers nephew will be here tomorrow he said and i would rather that he should find me alone in thinking of it all he remembered that he must withdraw his claims to the hand of mary bonner now that he was nobody he could have no pretension now to offer his hand to any such girl as mary bonner     chapter xxxii  sir thomas at home   sir thomas underwood was welcomed home at the villa with a double amount of sympathy and glorythat due to him for his victory being added to that which came to him on the score of his broken arm a hero is never so much a hero among women as when he has been wounded in the battle the very weakness which throws him into female hands imparts a moiety of his greatness to the women who for the while possess him and creates a partnership in heroism in which the feminine half delights to make the most of its own share during the week at percycross and throughout the journey patience had had this half all to herself and there had arisen to her considerable enjoyment from it as soon as she found that her father would probably be none the worse for his accident after a few weeks she saw more of him now than she had done for years and was able after a fashion to work her quiet loving female will with him exacting from him an obedience to feminine sway such as had not been exercised on him since his wifes death he himself had been humbled passive and happy he had taken his gruel grumbled with modesty and consoled himself with constantly reflecting that he was member of parliament for the borough of percycross  during their journey although patience was urgent in requiring from her father quiescence lest he should injure himself by too much exertion there were many words spoken both as to clarissa and mary bonner as to poor clary sir thomas was very decided that if there were any truth in the suspicion which had been now roused in his mind as to ralph the heir the thing must be put an end to at once ralph who had been the heir was now in possession of that mess of pottage for which he had sold his inheritanceso said sir thomas to his daughterand would undoubtedly consume that as he had consumed the other mess which should have lasted him till the inheritance was his own and he told to patience the whole story as to polly neefitthe whole story at least as he had heard it ralph had declared to sir thomas when discussing the expedience of his proposed marriage with the daughter of the breechesmaker that he was attached to polly neefit sir thomas had done all he could to dissuade the young man from a marriage which in his eyes was disgraceful but he could not bring himself to look with favour on affections transferred so quickly from the breechesmakers daughter to his own there must be no question of a love affair between clary and the foolish heir who had disinherited himself by his folly all this was doubly painful to patience she suffered first for her sister the violence of whose feelings were so well known to her and so completely understood and then on her own account she was obliged to endure the conviction that she was deceiving her father although she had allowed something of the truth to escape from her she had not wilfully told her sisters secret but looking at the matter from her fathers point of view and hearing all that her father now said she was brought in guilty of hypocrisy in the court of her own conscience  in that other matter as to mary bonner there was much more of pleasantness there could be no possible reason why that other man to whom fortune was going to be so good should not marry mary bonner if mary could bring herself to take him into her good graces and of course she would such at least was sir thomass opinion how was it possible that a girl like mary who had nothing of her own should fail to like a lover who had everything to recommend himgood looks good character good temper and good fortune patience did make some protest against this for the sake of her sex she didnt think she said that mary had ever thought of mr newton in that light there must be a beginning to such thoughts of course said sir thomas patience explained that she had nothing to say against mr newton it would all be very nice and proper no doubtonly perhaps mary might not care for mr newton psha said sir thomas sir thomas seemed to think that the one girl was as much bound to fall in love as the other was to abstain from so doing patience continued her protestbut very mildly because her fathers arm was in a sling then there arose the question whether mary should be told of the young mans letter patience thought that the young man should be allowed to come and speak for himself sir thomas made no objection to the young mans coming the young man might come when he pleased but sir thomas thought it would be well that mary should know what the young man had written and so they reached home  to be glorified by one worshipping daughter had been pleasant to the wounded hero but to be glorified by two daughters and a niece was almost wearisome on the first evening nothing was said about the love troubles or love prospects of the girls sir thomas permitted to himself the enjoyment of his glory with some few signs of impatience when the admiration became too strong he told the whole story of his election lying back among his cushions on the sofa although patience with mild persistence cautioned him against exertion  it is very bad that you should have your arm broken papa said clarissa  it is a bore my dear  of course it isa dreadful bore but as it is doing so well i am so glad that you went down to percycross it is such a great thing that you should be in the house again it does give so much colour to our lives here  i hope they were not colourless before  you know what i mean it is so nice to feel that you are in parliament  it is quite on the cards that i may lose the seat by petition  they never can be so cruel said mary  cruelty said sir thomas laughing in politics men skin each other without the slightest feeling i do not doubt that mr westmacott would ruin me with the most perfect satisfaction if by doing so he could bring the seat within his own reach again and yet i believe mr westmacott to be a kindhearted good sort of man there is a theory among englishmen that in politics no man need spare another to wish that your opponent should fall dead upon the hustings is not an uncharitable wish at an election  oh papa exclaimed patience  at any rate you are elected said clary  and threatened folk live long uncle said mary bonner  so they say my dear well patience dont look at me with so much reprobation in your eyes and i will go to bed at once being here instead of at the percy standard does make one inclined to take a liberty  oh papa it is such a delight to have you said clary jumping up and kissing her fathers forehead all this was pleasant enough and the first evening came to an end very happily  the next morning patience when she was alone with her father made a request to him with some urgency papa she said do not say anything to clary about ralph  why not  if there is anything in it let it die out of itself  but is there  how am i to say think of it papa if i knew it i could hardly telleven you  why not if i am not to hear the truth from you who is to tell me  dear papa dont be angry there may be a truth which had better not be told what we both want is that clary shouldnt suffer if you question her she will suffer you may be sure of thisthat she will obey your wishes  how can she obey them unless she knows them  she shall know them said patience but sir thomas would give no promise  on that same day sir thomas sent for his niece into his room and there read to her the letter which he had received from the squires son it was now the last week of octoberthat short blessed morsel of time which to the poor squire at newton was the happiest of his life he was now cutting down trees and building farmhouses and looking after his stud in all the glory of his success ralph had written his letter and had received his answerand he also was successful and glorious that fatal day on which the fox would not break from barford woods had not yet arrived mary bonner heard the letter read and listened to sir thomass speech without a word without a blush and without a sign sir thomas began his speech very well but became rather misty towards the end when he found himself unable to reduce mary to a state of feminine confusion my dear he began i have received a letter which i think it is my duty to read to you  a letter uncle  yes my dear sit down while i read it i may as well tell you at once that it is a letter which has given me very great satisfaction it is from a young gentlemanupon hearing this announcement marys face assumed a look of settled collected strength which never left it for a moment during the remainder of the interviewyes from a young gentleman and i may say that i never read a letter which i thought to be more honourable to the writer it is from mr ralph newtonnot the ralph with whom you have found us to be so intimate but from the other who will some day be mr newton of newton priory then sir thomas looked into his nieces face hoping to see there something of the flutter of expectant triumph but there was neither flutter nor triumph in marys countenance he read the letter sitting up in his bed with his left arm in a sling and then he handed it to her you had better look at it yourself my dear mary took the letter and sat as though she were reading it it seemed to sir thomas that she was reading it with the cold accuracy of a cautious attorneybut in truth her eyes did not follow a single word of the letter there was neither flutter nor triumph in her face or in the movement of her limbs or in the quiet almost motionless carriage of her body but nevertheless the pulses of her heart beat so strongly that had all depended on it she could not have read a word of the letter well my dear said sir thomas when he thought that ample time had been given for the perusal mary simply folded the paper together and returned it into his hands i have told him as i was bound to do my dear that as far as i was concerned i should be happy to receive him but that for any other answer i must refer him to you of course it will be for you to give him what answer your heart dictates but i may say thisand it is my duty to say it as your guardian and nearest relativethe way in which he has put forward his request shows him to be a most honourable man all that i have ever heard of him is in his favour he is a gentleman every inch of him and as for his prospects in life they are such that they entitle him to address almost any lady in the land of course you will follow the dictates of your own heart as i said but i cannot myself fancy any greater good fortune that could come in the way of a young woman than the honest affections of such a man as this ralph newton then sir thomas paused for some reply but mary had none ready for him of course i have no questions to ask he said and then again paused but still mary did not speak i dare say he will be here before long and i hope that he may meet with a happy reception i at least shall be glad to see him for i hold him in great honour and as i look upon marriage as the happiest lot for all women and as i think that this would be a happy marriage i do hopei do hope but as i said before all that must be left to yourself mary have you nothing to say  i trust uncle you are not tired of me  tired of you certainly not i have not been with you since you have been here as much as i should have wished becauseindeed for various reasons but we all like you and nobody wants to get rid of you but there is a way in which young ladies leave their own homes which is generally thought to be matter of congratulation but as i said before nobody shall press you  dear uncle i am so full of thanks to you for your kindness  but it is of course my duty as your guardian to tell you that in my opinion this gentleman is entitled to your esteem  after that mary left him without another word and taking her hat and cloak as she passed through the hall went at once out into the garden it was a fine autumn morning almost with a touch of summer in it we do not know here that special season which across the atlantic is called the indian summerthat last glow of the years warmth which always brings with it a half melancholy conviction of the years decaywhich in itself is so delightful would be so full of delight were it not for the consciousness which it seems to contain of being the immediate precursor of winter with all its horrors there is no sufficient constancy with us of the recurrence of such a season to make any special name needful but now and again there comes a day when the winds of the equinox have lulled themselves and the chill of october rains have left the earth and the sun gives a genial luxurious warmth with no power to scorch with strength only to comfort but here as elsewhere this luxury is laden with melancholy because it tells us of decay and is the harbinger of death this was such a day and mary bonner as she hurried into a shrubbery walk where she could wander unseen felt both the sadness and the softness of the season there was a path which ran from the front gate of the villa grounds through shrubs and tall evergreens down to the river and was continued along the riverbank up through the flowergarden to windows opening from the drawingroom here she walked alone for more than an hour turning as she came to the river in order that she might not be seen from the house  mary bonner of whose character hitherto but little has been said was at any rate an acute observer very soon after her first introduction to ralph the heirralph who had for so many years been the intimate friend of the underwood familyshe perceived something in the manner of that very attractive young man which conveyed to her a feeling that if she so pleased she might count him as an admirer of her own she had heard then as was natural much of the brilliance of his prospects and but littleas was also naturalof what he had done to mar them and she also perceived or fancied that she perceived that her cousin clary gave many of her thoughts to the heir now mary bonner understood the importance to herself of a prosperous marriage as well as any girl ever did understand its great significance she was an orphan living in fact on the charity of her uncle and she was aware that having come to her uncles house when all the weakness and attractions of her childhood were passed she could have no hold on him or his such as would have been hers had she grown to be a woman beneath his roof there was a thoughtfulness too about hera thoughtfulness which some perhaps may call worldlinesswhich made it impossible for her not to have her own condition constantly in her mind in her fathers lifetime she had been driven by his thoughtlessness and her own sterner nature to think of these things and in the few months that had passed between her fathers death and her acceptance in her uncles house she had taught herself to regard the world as an arena in which she must fight a battle by her own strength with such weapons as god had given to her god had indeed given to her many weapons but she knew but of one she did know that god had made her very beautiful but she regarded her beauty after an unfeminine fashionas a thing of value but as a chattel of which she could not bring herself to be proud might it be possible that she should win for herself by her beauty some position in the world less burdensome more joyous than that of a governess and less dependent than that of a daily recipient of her uncles charity  she had had lovers in the west indiesperhaps a score of them but they had been nothing to her her fathers house had been so constituted that it had been impossible for her to escape the very plainly spoken admiration of captains lieutenants and colonial secretaries in the west indies gentlemen do speak so very plainly on or without the smallest encouragement that ladies accept such speaking much as they do in england the attention of a handkerchief lifted or an offer for a dance it had all meant nothing to mary bonner who from her earliest years of girlhood had been accustomed to captains lieutenants and even to midshipmen but through it all she had grown up with serious thoughts and something of a conviction that lovemaking was but an ugly amusement as far as it had been possible she had kept herself aloof from it and though run after for her beauty had been unpopular as being a proud cold meaningless minx when her father died she would speak to no one and then it had been settled among the captains lieutenants and colonial secretaries that she was a proud cold meaningless minx and with this character she left the island now there came to her naturally i say this questionwhat lovers might she find in england and should she find lovers how should she deal with them there are among us many who tell us that no pureminded girl should think of finding a lovershould only deal with him when he comes as truth and circumstances and parental control may suggest to her if there be girls so pure it certainly seems that no human being expects to meet them such was not the purity of mary bonnerif pure she was she did think of some coming loverdid hope that there might be for her some prosperity of life as the consequence of the love of some worthy man whom she in return might worship and then there had come ralph newton the heir  now to mary bonneras also to clarissa underwood and to patience and to old mrs brownlow and a great many others ralph the heir did not appear in quite those colours which he probably will in the readers eyes these ladies and a great many other ladies and gentlemen who reckoned him among their acquaintance were not accurately acquainted with his transactions with messrs neefit moggs and horsball nor were they thoroughly acquainted with the easy nature of our heros changing convictions to clarissa he certainly was heroic to patience he was very dear to old mrs brownlow he was almost a demigod to mr poojean he was an object of envy to mary bonner as she first saw him he was infinitely more fascinating than the captains and lieutenants of west indian regiments or than colonial secretaries generally  it was during that evening at mrs brownlows that mary bonner resolutely made up her mind that she would be as stiff and cold to ralph the heir as the nature of their acquaintance would allow she had seen clarissa without watching and without thinking she had resolved mr newton was handsome well to do of good address and cleverhe was also attractive but he should not be attractive for her she would not as her first episode in her english life rob a cousin of a lover and so her mind was made up and no word was spoken to any one she had no confidences there was no one in whom she could confide indeed there was no need for confidence as she left mrs brownlows house on that evening she slipped her arm through that of patience and the happy clarissa was left to walk home with ralph the heiras the reader may perhaps remember  then that other ralph had come and she learned in halfpronounced ambiguous whispers what was the nature of his position in the world she did not knowat that time her cousins did not knowhow nearly successful were the efforts made to dispossess the heir of his inheritance in order that this other newton might possess it but she saw or thought that she saw that this was the gallanter man of the two then he came again and then again and she knew that her own beauty was of avail she encouraged him not at all it was not in her nature to give encouragement to a mans advances it may perhaps be said of her that she had no power to do so what was in her of the graciousness of feminine love of the leaning clinging flattering softness of womans nature required some effort to extract and had never hitherto been extracted but within her own bosom she told herself that she thought that she could give it if the asking for it were duly done then came the first tidings of his heirship of his fathers successand then close upon the heels of those tidings this heirs humbly expressed desire to be permitted to woo her there was all the flutter of triumph in her bosom as that letter was read to her and yet there was no sign of it in her voice or in her countenance  nor could it have been seen had she been met walking in the shade of that shrubbery and yet she was full of triumph here was the man to whom her heart had seemed to turn almost at first sight as it had never turned to man before she had deigned to think of him as of one she could loveand he loved her as she paced the walk it was also much to her that this man who was so generous in her eyes should have provided for him so noble a place in the world she quite understood what it was to be the wife of such a one as the squire of newton she had grieved for clarys sake when she heard that the former heir should be heir no longersuspecting clarys secret but she could not so grieve as to be insensible of her own joy and then there was something in the very manner in which the man approached her which gratified her pride while it touched her heart about that other ralph there was a tone of sustained selfapplause which seemed to declare that he had only to claim any woman and to receive her there was an oldfashioned mode of wooing of which she had read and dreamed that implied a homage which she knew that she desired this homage her ralph was prepared to pay  for an hour she paced the walk not thinking but enjoying what she knew there was nothing in it requiring thought he was to come and till he should come there was nothing that she need either say or do till he should come she would do nothing and say nothing such was her determination when clarissas step was heard and in a moment clarissas arm was round her waist mary she said you must come out with me come and walk with me i am going to mrs brownlows you must come  to walk there and back said mary smiling  we will return in an omnibus but you must come oh i have so much to say to you     chapter xxxiii  tell me and ill tell you   papa has told me all about it were clarissas first words as soon as they were out of the gate on the road to mrs brownlows  all about what clary  oh you knowor rather it was patience told me and then i asked papa i am so glad  mary had as yet hardly had time to think whether the coming of this letter to her uncle would or would not be communicated to her cousins but had she thought she would have been almost sure that sir thomas would be more discreet the whole matter was to her so important so secret almost so solemn that she could hardly imagine that it should be discussed among the whole household and yet she felt a strong longing within herself to be able to talk of it to some one of the two cousins clary was certainly her favourite and had she been forced to consult any one she would have consulted clary but an absolute confidence in such a matter with a chosen friend the more delightful it might appear was on that very account the more difficult of attainment it was an occasion for thought for doubt and almost for dismay and now clary rushed into it as though everything could be settled in a walk from fulham to parsons green it is very good of you to be glad clary said the otherhardly knowing why she said this and yet meaning it if in truth clary was glad it was good of her for this man to whom clary was alluding had won from her own lover all his inheritance  i like him so much you will let me talk about him wont you  oh yes said mary  do pray do there are so many reasons why we should tell each other everything this elicited no promise from mary if i thought that you would care i would tell you all  i care about everything that concerns you clary  but i didnt bring you out to talk about myself now i want to tell you how much i like your ralph newton  but he isnt mine  yes he isat any rate if you like to have him and of course you will like why should you not he is everything that is nice and goodand now he is to be the owner of all the property what i want to tell you is this i do not begrudge it to you  why should clarissa begrudge or not begrudge the property mary understood it all but nothing had been said entitling her to speak as though she understood it i dont think you would begrudge me anything that you thought good for me said mary  and i think that mr ralph newtonthis mr ralph newton is very good for you nothing could be so good in the first place would it not be very nice to have you mistress of newton priory only that shouldnt come properly first  and what should come first clary  ohof course that you should love him better than anything in the world and you dodont you  it is too sudden to say that yet clary  but i am sure you will dont you feel that you will come mary you should tell me something  there is so little to tell  then you are afraid of me i wanted to tell you everything  i am not afraid of you but remember it is hardly more than an hour ago since i first heard of mr newtons wishes and up to that moment nothing was further from my dreams  i was sure of it ever so long ago said clarissa  oh clary  i was i told patience how it was to be i saw it in his eyes one does see these things i knew it would be so and i told patience that we three would be three mrs newtons but that of course was nonsense  nonsense indeed  i mean about patience  and what about yourself clary clarissa made no answer and yet she was burning to tell her own story she was most anxious to tell her own story but only on the condition of reciprocal confidence the very nature of her story required that the confidence should be reciprocal you said that you wanted to tell me everything said mary  and so i do  you know how glad i shall be to hear  that is all very well but and then clarissa paused  but what dear  you do mean to accept mr newton  now it was time for mary to pause if i were to tell you my whole heart she said i should be ashamed of what i was saying and yet i do not know that there is any cause for shame  there can be none said clary i am sure of that  my acquaintance with mr newton is very very slight i liked himoh so much i thought him to be highspirited manly and a fine gentleman i never saw any man who so much impressed me  of course not said clarissa making a gesture as though she would stop on the high road and clasp her hands together in which however she was impeded by her parasol and her remembrance of her present position  but it is so much to say that one will love a man better than all the world and go to him and belong to him and be his wife  ahbut if one does love him  i can hardly believe that love can grow so quickly  tell the truth mary has it not grown  indeed i cannot say there you shall have the whole truth when he comes to meand i suppose he will come  there isnt much doubt of that  if he does come  well  i hardly know what i shall say to him i shall try toto love him  of course you will love himbetter than all the world  i know that he is paying me the greatest compliment that a man can pay to a woman and there is no earthly reason why i should not be proud to accept all that he offers me i have nothing of my own to bestow in return  but you are so beautiful  mary would make no pretence of denying this it was true that that one great feminine possession did belong to her after all she said how little does beauty signify it attracts but it can make no man happy he has everything to give to a wife and he ought to have much in return for what he gives  you dont mean that a girl should refuse a rich man because she has no fortune of her own  no not quite that but she ought to think whether she can be of use to him  of course you will be of use my dearof the greatest use in the world thats his affair and he is the best judge of what will be of use you will love him and other men will envy him and that will be everything oh dear i do so hope he will come soon  and ii almost hope he will not i shall be so afraid to see him the first meeting will be so awful i shall not dare to look him in the face  but it is all settled  nonot settled clary  yes it is settled and now i will tell you what i mean when i say i do not begrudge him to you that is i do not know whether you will care to be told  i care very much clary i should be very unhappy if you did begrudge me anything  of course you know that our ralph newton as we call him ought to have been the heir  oh yes  i neednt explain it all onlyonly  only he is everything to you is it that clary  yes it is that he is everything to me i love him oh yes i do love him but mary i am not such a happy girl as you are sometimes i think he hardly cares for me  but he has asked you to care for him  welli dont know i think he has he has told me i know that he loved me dearlybetter than any one  and what answer did you make to him clary  clarissa had the whole scene on the lawn at popham villa so clearly impressed upon her memory that an eternity of years as she thought could obliterate no one of its incidents and render doubtful no tone of his voice no word that her lover had spoken his conduct had at that time been so violent that she had answered him only with tears and protestations of undying anger but her tears had been dried and her anger had passed awaywhile the love remained ralph her ralph of course knew well enough that the tears were dry and the anger gone she could understand that he would understand that but the love which he had protested if it were real love would remain and why should she doubt him the very fact that he was so dear to her made such doubts almost disgraceful and yet there was so much cause for doubt patience doubted she knew herself that she feared more than she hoped she had resolved gallantly that she would be true to her own heart even though by such truth she should be preparing for herself a life of disappointment she had admitted the passion and she would stand by it in all her fears too she consoled herself by the reflection that her lover was hindered not by want of earnestness or want of truthbut by the state of his affairs while he was still in debt striving to save his inheritance but tormented by the growing certainty that it must pass away from him how could he give himself up to lovemaking and preparations for marriage clary made excuses for him which no one else would have made and so managed to feed her hopes i made him no answer she said at last  and yet you knew you loved him  yes i knew that i can tell you and i told patience but i could not tell him she paused a moment thinking whether she could describe the whole scene but she found that she could not do that i shall tell him perhaps when he comes again that is if he does come  if he loves you he will come  i dont know he has all these troubles on him and he will be very poorwhat will seem to him to be very poor it would not be poor for me but for him it would  would that hinder him  how can i say there are so many things a girl cannot know he may still be in debt and then he has been brought up to want so much but it will make no more difference in me and now you will understand why i should tell you that i will never begrudge you your good fortune if all should come right you shall give us a little cottage near your grand house and you will not despise us poor clary when she spoke of her possible future lord and the little cottage on the newton demesne hardly understood the feelings with which a disinherited heir must regard the property which he has lost  dear dearest clary said mary bonner pressing her cousins arm  they had now reached mrs brownlows house and the old lady was delighted to receive them of course she began to discuss at once the great news sir thomas had had his arm broken and was now again a member of parliament mrs brownlow was a thoroughgoing tory and was in an ecstasy of delight that her old friend should have been successful the success seemed to be so much the greater in that the hero had suffered a broken bone and then there were many questions to be asked would sir thomas again be solicitorgeneral by right of his seat in parliamentfor on such matters mrs brownlow was rather hazy in her conceptions as to the working of the british constitution and would he live at home clarissa would not say that she and patience expected such a result all that she could suggest of comfort on this matter was that there would be now something of a fair cause for excusing their fathers residence at his london chambers  but there was a subject more enticing to the old lady even than sir thomass triumphs a subject as to which there could not be any triumphonly dismay but not on that account the less interesting ralph newton had sold his inheritance i believe it is all settled said clarissa demurely  dear dear dear dear groaned the old lady and while she groaned clarissa furtively cast a smile upon her cousin it is the saddest thing i ever knew said mrs brownlow and after all for a young man who never can be anybody you know  oh yes said clarissa he can be somebody  you know what i mean my dear i think it very shocking and very wrong such a fine estate too  we all like mr newton very much indeed said clarissa papa thinks he is a most charming young man i never knew papa taken with any one so much and so do we allpatience and iand mary  but my dear began mrs brownlowmrs brownlow had always thought that ralph the heir would ultimately marry clarissa underwood and that it was a manifest duty on his part to do so she had fancied that clarissa had expected it herself and had believed that all the underwoods would be brokenhearted at this transfer of the estate i dont think it can be right said mrs brownlow and i must say that it seems to me that old mr newton ought to be ashamed of himself just because this young man happens to be in a sort of a way his own son he is going to destroy the whole family i think that it is very wicked but she had not a word of censure for the heir who had consumed his mess of pottage  wasnt she grand said clary as soon as they were out again upon the road she is such a dear old woman but she doesnt understand anything i couldnt help giving you a look when she was abusing our friend when she knows it all shell have to make you such an apology  i hope she will not do that  she will if she does not forget all about it she does forget things there is one thing i dont agree with her in at all i dont see any shame in your ralph having the property and as to his being nobody that is all nonsense he would be somebody wherever he went if he had not an acre of property he will be mr newton of newton priory just as much as anybody else could be he has never done anything wrong to all which mary bonner had very little to say she certainly was not prepared to blame the present squire for having so managed his affairs as to be able to leave the estate to his own son  the two girls were very energetic and walked back the whole way to popham villa regardless of a dozen omnibuses that passed them i told her all about our ralphmy ralphsaid clary to her sister afterward i could not help telling her now  dear clary said patience i wish you could help thinking of it always  thats quite impossible said clarissa cheerily     chapter xxxiv  alone in the house   young newton at last found himself alone in the house at newton priory after his fathers death he had sent george morris away becoming very stern in his demand to be left to his solitude as long as opposition was made to him gregory had come down to him from the parsonage and had also been dismissed your brother will be here probably today said ralph and then i will send for you  i am thinking more of you than of my brother just now answered the parson  yes i knowand though i cannot talk to you i know how good you are i want to see nobody but him i shall be better alone then gregory had returned to the parsonage  as soon as ralph was alone he crept up to the room in which his fathers body was lying and stood silently by the bedside for above an hour he was struggling to remember the loss he had had in the man and to forget the loss in wealth and station no father had ever been better to a son than his father had been to him in every affair of life his happiness his prosperity and his future condition had given motives to his fathers conduct no lover ever worshipped a mistress more thoroughly than his father had idolised him there had never been love to beat it never solicitude more perfect and devoted and yet as he had been driven home that day he had allowed his mind to revert to the property and his regrets to settle themselves on his lost position it should not be so any longer he could not keep his mind from dwelling on the thing but he would think of it as a trifleas of a thing which he could afford to lose without sorrow whereas he had also lost that which is of all things the most valuable and most impossible to replacea friend whose love was perfect  but then there was another loss he bitterly blamed himself for having written that letter to sir thomas underwood before he was actually in a position to do as he had proposed it must all be unwritten now every resolution hitherto taken as to his future life must be abandoned he must begin again and plan a new life for himself it had all come upon him so suddenly that he was utterly at a loss to think what he would do with himself or with his days there was nothing for him but to go away and be utterly without occupation altogether without friends friends indeed he haddear intimate loving friends gregory newton and george morris were his friends every tenant on the newton property was his friend there was not a man riding with the hunt worth having as a friend who was not on friendly terms with him but all these he must leave altogether in whatever spot he might find for himself a future residence that spot could not be at peele newton after what had occurred he could not remain there now that he was not the heir and then again his thoughts came back from his lost father to his lost inheritance and he was very wretched  between three and four oclock he took his hat and walked out he sauntered down along a small stream which after running through the gardens bordered one of the coverts which came up near to the house he took this path because he knew that he would be alone there unseen it had occurred to him already that it would be well that he should give orders to stop the works which his father had commenced and there had been a moment in which he had almost told one of the servants in the house to do so but he had felt ashamed at seeming to remember so small a thing the owner would be there soon probably in an hour or two and could stop or could continue what he pleased then as he thought of the ownership of the estate he reflected that as the sale had been in truth effected by his namesake the money promised by his father would be legally duewould not now be his money as to the estate itself that of course would go to his namesake as his fathers heir no will had been made leaving the estate to him and his namesake would be the heiratlaw thus he would be utterly beggared it was not that he actually believed that this would be the case but his thoughts were morbid and he took an unwholesome delight in picturing to himself circumstances in their blackest hue then he would strike the ground with his stick in his wrath because he thought of such things at all how was it that he was base enough to think of them while the accident which had robbed him of his father was so recent  as the dusk grew on he emerged out of the copse into the park and crossing at the back of the home paddocks came out upon the road near to darvells farm he passed a few yards up the lane till at a turn he could discern the dismantled house as far as he could see through the gloom of the evening there were no workmen near the place some one he presumed had given directions that nothing further should be done on a day so sad as this he stood for awhile looking and listening and then turned round to enter the park again  it might be that the new squire was already at the house and it would be thought that he ought not to be absent the road from the station to the priory was not that on which he was standing and ralph might have arrived without his knowledge he wandered slowly back but before he could turn in at the parkgate he was met by a man on the road it was mr walker the farmer of brownriggs an old man over seventy who had lived on the property all his life succeeding his father in the same farm walker had known young newton since he had first been brought to the priory as a boy and could speak to him with more freedom than perhaps any other tenant on the estate oh mr ralph he said this has been a dreary thing ralph for the first time since the accident burst out into a flood of tears no wonder you take on mr ralph he was a good father to you and a fine gentleman and one we all respected ralph still sobbed but put his hand on the old mans arm and leaned upon him i hope mr ralph that things was pretty well settled about the property ralph shook his head but did not speak a bargain is a bargain mr ralph and i suppose that this bargain was made the lawyers would know that it had been made  it dont matter about that mr walker said ralph but the estate would go to my fathers nephew as his heir the farmer started as though he had been shot you will have another landlord mr walker he can hardly be better than the one you have lost  then mr ralph you must bear it manly  i think that i can say that i will do that it is not for the property that i am crying i hope you dont think that of me mr walker   illustration it is not for the property that i am crying   no no no  i can bear thatthough it is hard the having to go away and live among strange people i think i shall get a farm somewhere and see if i can take a lesson from you i dont know anything else that i can do  you could have the mordykes mr ralph said mr walker naming a holding on the newton property as to which there were rumours that it would soon be vacant  no mr walker it mustnt be here i couldnt stand that i must go away from thisgod knows where i must go away from this and i shall never see the old place again  bear it manly mr ralph said the farmer  i think i shall after a bit good evening mr walker i expect my fathers nephew every hour and i ought to be up at the house when he comes i shall see you again before i go  yes yes thats for certain said the farmer they were both thinking of the day on which they would follow the old squire to his grave in newton peele churchyard  ralph reentered the park and hurried across to the house as though he were afraid that he would be too late to receive the heir but there had been no arrival nor had there come any message from the other ralph indeed up to this hour the news had not reached the present owner of newton priory the telegram had been duly delivered at the moonbeam where the fortunate youth was staying but he was hunting on this day riding the new horse which he had bought from mr pepper and up to this moment did not know anything of that which chance had done for him nor did he get back to the moonbeam till late at night having made some engagement for dinner after the days sport it was not till noon on the following day the friday that a message was received from him at the priory saying that he would at once hurry down to hampshire  ralph sat down to dinner all alone let what will happen to break hearts and ruin fortunes dinner comes as long as the means last for providing it the old butler waited upon him in absolute silence fearing to speak a word lest the word at such a time should be illspoken no doubt the old man was thinking of the probable expedience of his retiring upon his savings feeling however that it became him to show till the last every respect to all who bore the honoured name of newton when the meat had been eaten the old servant did say a word wont you come round to the fire mr ralph and he placed comfortably before the hearth one of the heavy armchairs with which the corners of the broad fireplace were flanked but ralph only shook his head and muttered some refusal there he sat square to the table with the customary bottle of wine before him leaning back with his hands in his pockets thinking of his condition in life the loneliness of the room the loneliness of the house were horrible to him and yet he would not that his solitude should be interrupted he had been so sitting motionless almost overcome by the gloom of the big dark room for so long a period that he hardly knew whether it was night or not when a note was brought to him from gregory dear ralphshall i not come down to you for an hourg n he read the note and sent back a verbal message tell mr gregory that i had rather not and so he sat motionless till the night had really come till the old butler brought him his candlestick and absolutely bade him betake himself to bed he had watched during the whole of the previous night and now had slumbered in his chair from time to time but his sleeping had been of that painful wakeful nature which brings with it no refreshment it had been full of dreams in all of which there had been some grotesque reference to the property but in none of them had there been any memory of the squires terrible death and yet as he woke and woke and woke again it can hardly be said that the truth had come back upon him as a new blow through such dreams there seems to exist a double memory and a second identity the misery of his isolated position never for a moment left him and yet there were repeated to him over and over again those bungling illarranged impossible pictures of trivial transactions about the place which the slumber of a few seconds sufficed to create in his brain mr ralph you must go to bedyou must indeed sir said the old butler standing over him with a candle during one of these fitful dreamings  yes greyyes i will directly put it down thank you dont mind sitting up said ralph rousing himself in his chair  its past twelve mr ralph  you can go to bed you know grey  no sirno ill see you to bed first itll be better so why mr ralph the fires all out and youre sitting here perished you wasnt in bed last night and you ought to be there now come mr ralph  then ralph rose from his chair and took the candlestick it was true enough that he had better be in bed as he shook himself he felt that he had never been so cold in his life and then as he moved there came upon him that terrible feeling that everything was amiss with him that there was no consolation on any side thatll do grey good night he said as the old man prepared to follow him upstairs but grey was not to be shaken off ill just see you to your room mr ralph he wanted to accompany his young master past the door of that chamber in which was lying all that remained of the old master but ralph would open the door not tonight mr ralph said grey but ralph persisted and stood again by the bedside he would have given me his flesh and bloodhis very life said ralph to the butler i think no father ever so loved a son and yet what has it come to then he stooped down and put his lips to the cold clayblue forehead  it aint come to much surely said old grey to himself as he crept away to his own room and i dont suppose it do come to much mostly when folks go wrong  ralph was out again before breakfast wandering up and down the banks of the stream where the wood hid him and then he made up his mind that he would at once write again to sir thomas underwood he must immediately make it understood that that suggestion which he had made in his illassumed pride of position must be abandoned he had nothing now to offer to that queenly princess worthy of the acceptance of any woman he was a baseborn son about to be turned out of his fathers house because of the disgrace of his birth in the eye of the law he was nobody the law allowed to him not even a namecertainly allowed to him the possession of no relative denied to him the possibility of any family tie his father had succeeded within an ace of giving him that which would have created for him family ties relatives name and all the old squire had understood well how to supersede the law and to make the harshness of mans enactments of no avail had the squire quite succeeded the son would have stood his ground would have called himself newton of newton and nobody would have dared to tell him that he was a nameless bastard but now he could not even wait to be told he must tell it himself and must vanish he had failed to understand it all while his father was struggling and was yet alive but he understood it well now so he came in to his breakfast resolved that he would write that letter at once  and then there were orders to be givenhideous orders and there was that hideous remembrance that legally he was entitled to give no orders gregory came down to him as he sat at breakfast making his way into the parlour without excuse my brother cannot have been at home at either place he said  perhaps not said ralph i suppose not  the message will be sent after him and you will hear today no doubt  i suppose i shall said ralph  then gregory in a low voice made the suggestion in reference to which he had come across from the parsonage i think that perhaps i and larkin had better go over to basingstoke larkin was the steward ralph again burst out into tears but he assented and in this way those hideous orders were given  as soon as gregory was gone he took himself to his desk and did write to sir thomas underwood his letter which was perhaps somewhat too punctilious ran as follows      newton priory 4th november 186     my dear sir     i do not know whether you will have heard before this of    the accident which has made me fatherless the day before    yesterday my father was killed by a fall from his horse in    the huntingfield i should not have ventured to trouble    you with a letter on this subject nor should i myself    have been disposed to write about it at present were    it not that i feel it to be an imperative duty to refer    without delay to my last letter to you and to your very    flattering reply when i wrote to you it was true that    my father had made arrangements for purchasing on my    behalf the reversion to the property that it was so you    doubtless were aware from your own personal knowledge    of the affairs of mr ralph newton whether that sale    was or was not legally completed i do not know probably    notand in regard to my own interests it is to be hoped    that it was not completed but in any event the whole    newton property will pass to your late ward as my father    certainly made no such will as would convey it to me even    if the sale were complete     it is a sad time for explaining all this when the body of    my poor father is still lying unburied in the house and    when as you may imagine i am illfitted to think of    matters of business but after what has passed between    us i conceive myself bound to explain to you that i wrote    my last letter under a false impression and that i can    make no such claim to miss bonners favour as i then set    up i am houseless and nameless and for aught i yet know    to the contrary absolutely penniless the blow has hit    me very hard i have lost my fortune which i can bear    i have lost whatever chance i had of gaining your nieces    hand which i must learn to bear and i have lost the    kindest father a man ever hadwhich is unbearable     yours very faithfully     ralph newton so called   if it be thought that there was something in the letter which should have been suppressedthe allusion for instance to the possible but most improbable loss of his fathers private means and his morbid denial of his own right to a name which he had always borne a right which no one would deny himit must be remembered that the circumstances of the hour bore very heavily on him and that it was hardly possible that he should not nurse the grievance which afflicted him had he not been alone in these hours he might have carried himself more bravely as it was he struggled hard to carry himself well if no one had ever been told how nearly successful the squire had been in his struggle to gain the power of leaving the estate to his son had there been nothing of the triumph of victory he could have left the house in which he had lived and the position which he had filled almost without sorrowcertainly without lamentation in the midst of calamities caused by the loss of fortune it is the knowledge of what the world will say that breaks us downnot regret for those enjoyments which wealth can give and which had been long anticipated  at two oclock on this day he got a telegram i will be at the parsonage this evening and will come down at once ralph the heir on his return home late at night had heard the news and early on the following morning had communicated with his brother and with his namesake in the afternoon after his return from basingstoke gregory again came down to the house desiring to know whether ralph would prefer that the meeting should be at the priory or at the parsonage and on this occasion his cousin bore with him why should not your brother come to his own house asked ralph  i suppose he feels that he should not claim it as his own  that is nonsense it is his own and he knows it does he think that i am likely to raise any question against his right  i do not suppose that my brother has ever looked at the matter in that light said the parson he is the last man in the world to do so for the present at any rate you are living here and he is not in such an emergency perhaps he feels that it would be better that he should come to his brother than intrude here  it would be no intrusion i should wish him to feel that i am prepared to yield to him instantly of course the house cannot be very pleasant for him as yet he must suffer something of the misery of the occasion before he can enjoy his inheritance but it will only be for a day or so  dear ralph said the parson i think you somewhat wrong my brother  i endeavour not to do so i think no ill of him because i presume he should look for enjoyment from what is certainly his own he and my father were not friends and this which has been to me so terrible a calamity in every way cannot affect him with serious sorrow i shall meet him as a friend but i would sooner meet him here than at the parsonage  it was at last settled that the two brothers should come down to the great houseboth ralph the heir and gregory the parson and that the three young men should remain there at any rate till the funeral was over and when this was arranged the two who had really been fast friends for so many years were able to talk to each other in true friendship the solitude which he had endured had been almost too much for the one who had been made so desolate but at last warmed by the comfort of companionship he resumed his manhood and was able to look his affairs in the face free from the morbid feeling which had oppressed him gregory had his own things brought down from the parsonage and in order that there might be no hesitation on his brothers part sent a servant with a note to the station desiring his brother to come at once to the priory they resolved to wait dinner for him till after the arrival of a train leaving london at five pm by that train the heir came and between seven and eight he entered the house which he had not seen since he was a boy and which was now his own  the receipt of the telegram at the moonbeam had affected ralph who was now in truth the squire with absolute awe he had returned late from a somewhat jovial dinner in company with his friend cox who was indeed more jovial than was becoming ralph was not given to drinking more wine than he could carry decently but his friend who was determined to crowd as much enjoyment of life as was possible into the small time allowed him before his disappearance from the world that had known him was noisy and rollicking perhaps it may be acknowledged in plain terms that he was tipsy they both entered together the sittingroom which ralph used and cox was already calling for brandy and water when the telegram was handed to newton he read it twice before he understood it his uncle deadsuddenly dead and the inheritance all his own in doing him justice however we must admit that he did not at the time admit this to be the case he did perceive that there must arise some question but his first feeling as regarded the property was one of intense remorse that he should have sold his rights at a moment in which they would so soon have been realised in his own favour but the awe which struck him was occasioned by the suddenness of the blow which had fallen upon his uncle whats up now old fellow hiccupped mr cox  i wonder whether any polite reader into whose hands this story may fall may ever have possessed a drunken friend and have been struck by some solemn incident at the moment in which his friend is exercising the privileges of intoxication the effect is not pleasant nor conducive of goodhumour ralph turned away in disgust and leaned upon the chimneypiece trying to think of what had occurred to him what ish it old chap shomebody wants shome tin ill stand to you old fellow  take him away said ralph hes drunk then without waiting for further remonstrance from the goodnatured but now indignant cox he went off to his own room  on the following morning he started for london by an early train and by noon was with his lawyer up to that moment he believed that he had lost his inheritance when he sent those two telegrams to his brother and to his namesake he hardly doubted but that the entire property now belonged to his uncles son the idea had never occurred to him that even were the sale complete he might still inherit the property as his uncles heiratlawand that he would do so unless his uncle had already bequeathed it to his son but the attorney soon put him right the sale had not been yet made he ralph had not signed a single legal document to that effect he had done nothing which would have enabled his late uncle to make a will leaving the newton estate to his son the letters which have been written are all wastepaper said the lawyer even if they were to be taken as binding as agreements for a covenant they would operate against your cousinnot in his favour in such case you would demand the specified price and still inherit  that is out of the question said the heir quite out of the question said the attorney no doubt mr newton left a will and under it his son will take whatever property the father had to leave  and so ralph the heir found himself to be the owner of it all just at the moment in which he thought that he had lost all chance of the inheritance as the result of his own folly when he walked out of the lawyers office he was almost wild with amazement this was the prize to which he had been taught to look forward through all his boyish days and all his early manhoodbut to look forward to it as a thing that must be very distant so distant as almost to be lost in the vagueness of the prospect probably his youth would have clean passed from him and he would have entered upon the downhill course of what is called middle life before his inheritance would come to him he had been unable to wait and had wasted everythingnearly everything had at any rate ruined all his hopes before he was sevenandtwenty and yet now at sevenandtwenty it was as his lawyer assured him all his own how nearly had he lost it all how nearly had he married the breechesmakers daughter how close upon the rocks he had been but now all was his own and he was in truth newton of newton with no embarrassments of any kind which could impose a feathers weight upon his back     chapter xxxv  shell accept you of course   we will pass over the solemn sadness of the funeral at newton and the subsequent reading of the old squires will as to the latter the will was as it had been made some six or seven years ago the squire had simply left all that he possessed to his illegitimate son ralph newton there was no difficulty about the will nor was there any difficulty about the estate the two lawyers came down to the funeral sir thomas underwood would have come but that he was prevented by the state of his arm a statement showing all that had been done in the matter was prepared for him but it was agreed on all sides that the sale had not been made and that the legitimate heir must succeed to the property no one was disposed to dispute the decision the squires son had never for a moment supposed that he could claim the estate nor did ralph the heir suppose for a moment that he could surrender it after the explanation which he had received from the lawyer in london  the funeral was over and the will had been read and at the end of november the three young men were still living together in the great house at newton the heir had gone up to london once or twice instigated by the necessity of the now not difficult task of raising a little ready money he must at once pay off all his debts he must especially pay that which he owed to mr neefit and he must do so with many expressions of his gratitudeperhaps with some expressions of polite regret at the hardness of pollys heart towards him but he must do so certainly without any further entreaty that pollys heart might be softened ahwith what marvellous good fortune had he escaped from that pitfall for how much had he not to be thankful to some favouring goddess who must surely have watched over him from his birth from what shipwrecks had he not escaped and now he was squire of newton with wealth and all luxuries at command hampered with no wife oppressed by no debts free from all cares as he thought of his perfect freedom in these respects he remembered his former resolution as to mary bonner that resolution he would carry out it would be well for him now to marry a wife and of all the women he had ever seen mary bonner was certainly the most beautiful with newton all his own with such a string of horses as he would soon possess and with such a wife at the head of his table whom need he envy and how many were there who would not envy him  throughout november he allowed his horses to remain at the moonbeam being somewhat in doubt whether or no he would return to that fascinating hostelrie he received one or two most respectful letters from mr horsball in which glowing accounts were given of the sport of the season and the health of his horses and offers made of most disinterested services rooms should be ready for him at a moments notice if he liked at any time to run over for a weeks hunting it was quite evident that in the eyes of mr horsball newton of newton was a great man and there came congratulations from mr cox in which no allusion whatever was made to the squires somewhat uncivil conduct at their last meeting mr cox trusted that his dearest friend would come over and have another spell at the moonbeam before he settled down for lifeand then hinted in language that was really delicate in the niceness of its expression that if he cox were but invited to spend a week or two at newton priory before he banished himself for life to australia he would be able to make his way over the briny deep with a light heart and an uncomplaining tongue you know old fellow how true ive always been to you wrote cox in language of the purest friendship as true as steelto sausages in the morning and brandy and soda at night said ralph to himself as he read this  he behaved with thorough kindness to his cousin the three men lived together for a month and their intercourse was as pleasant as was possible under the circumstances of course there was no hunting during this month at newton nor indeed did the heir see a hound till december although as the reader is aware he was not particularly bound to revere his uncles memory he made many overtures to his namesake he would be only too happy if his cousinhe always called the squires son his cousinwould make newton his home for the next twelvemonth it was found that the squire had left behind him something like forty thousand pounds so that the son was by no means to be regarded as a poor man it was his idea at present that he would purchase in some pleasant county as much land as he might farm himself and there set up his staff for life and get about twoandahalf per cent for your money said the heir who was beginning to consider himself learned in such matters and could talk of land as a very serious thing in the way of a possession  what else am i to do said the other twoandahalf per cent with an occupation is better than five per cent with none i should make out the remainder too by farming the land myself there is nothing else in the world that i could do  as for remaining twelve months at newton that was of course out of the question nevertheless when december came he was still living in the house and had consented to remain there till christmas should have passed he had already heard of a farm in norfolk the worst county for hunting in england the heir had said then i must try and live without hunting said ralph who was not the heir during all this time not a horse was sent to the meet from the newton stables the owner of newton was contented to see the animals exercised in the park and to amuse himself by schooling them over hurdles and by high jumping at the bar  during the past month the young squire had received various letters from sir thomas underwood and the other ralph had received one with sir thomass caution advice and explanations to his former ward the story has no immediate concern but his letter to him who was to have been mary bonners suitor may concern us more nearly it was very short and the reader shall have it entire      popham villa 10th november 186     my dear mr newton     i have delayed answering your letter for a day or two    in order that it may not disturb you till the last    sad ceremony be over i do not presume to offer you    consolation in your great sorrow such tenders should only    be made by the nearest and the dearest perhaps you will    permit me to say that what little i have seen of you and    what further i have heard of you assure to you my most    perfect sympathy     on that other matter which gave occasion for your two    letters to me i shall best perhaps discharge my duty by    telling you that i showed them both to my niece and that    she feels as do i that they are both honourable to you    and of a nature to confer honour upon her the change    in your position which i acknowledge to be most severe    undoubtedly releases you as it would have released    herhad she been bound and chose to accept such release     whenever you may be in this neighbourhood we shall be    happy to see you     the state of my arm still prevents me from writing with    ease     yours very faithfully     thomas underwood   newton when he received this letter struggled hard to give to it its proper significance but he could bring himself to no conclusion respecting it sir thomas had acknowledged that he was releasedand that mary bonner would also have been released had she placed herself under any obligation but sir thomas did not say a word from which his correspondent might gather whether in his present circumstances he might still be regarded as an acceptable suitor the letter was most civil most courteous almost cordial in its expression of sympathy but yet it did not contain a word of encouragement it may be said that the suitor had himself so written to the ladys uncle as to place himself out of the way of all further encouragementas to have put it beyond the power of his correspondent to write a word to him that should have in it any comfort certainly he had done so he had clearly shown in his second letter that he had abandoned all idea of making the match as to which he had shown so much urgent desire in his first letter he had explained that the marriage would now be impossible and had spoken of himself as a ruined broken man all whose hopes were shipwrecked sir thomas could hardly have told him in reply that mary bonner would still be pleased to see him and yet mary bonner had almost said so she had been very silent when the letter was read to her the news of mr newtons death had already reached the family at popham villa and had struck them all with awe how it might affect the property even sir thomas had not absolutely known at first though he was not slow to make it understood that in all probability this terrible accident would be ruinous to the hopes which his niece had been justified in entertaining at that hour mary had spoken not a wordnor could she be induced to speak respecting it either by patience or clarissa even to them she could not bring herself to say that if the man really loved her he would still come to her and say so there was a feeling of awe upon her which made her mute and stern and altogether unplastic in the hands of her friends it seemed even to patience that mary was struck by a stunning sorrow at the ruin which had come upon her lovers prospects but it was not so at all the thought wronged her utterly what stunned her was thisthat she could not bring herself to express a passion for a man whom she had seen so seldom with whom her conversation had been so slight from whom personally she had received no overtures of attachmenteven though he were ruined she could not bring herself to express such a passionbut yet it was there when clarissa thought that she might obtain if not a word at least a tear mary appeared to be dead to all feeling though crushed by what she had lost she was thinking the while whether it might be possible for such a one as her to send to the man and to tell him that that which had now occurred had of a sudden made him really dear to her thoughts of maiden boldness flitted across her mind but she could not communicate them even to the girls who were her friends yet in silence and in solitude she resolved that the time should come in which she would be bold  then young newtons second letter reached the house and that also had been read to her he is quite right said sir thomas of course it releases both of you  there was nothing to release said mary proudly  i mean to say that having made such a proposition as was contained in his first letter he was bound to explain his altered position  i suppose so said mary  of course he was he had made his offer believing that he could make you mistress of newton prioryand he had made it thinking that he himself could marry in that position and he would have been in that position had not this most unforeseen and terrible calamity have occurred  i do not see that it makes any difference said mary in a whisper  what do you mean my dear  i hardly know uncle  try to explain yourself mary  if i had accepted any man when he was rich i should not go back when he was poorunless he wanted it this also she said in a whisper  but you had not accepted him  no said mary still in a whisper sir thomas who was perhaps not very good at such things did not understand the working of her mind but had she dared she would have asked her uncle to tell mr newton to come and see her sir thomas having some dim inkling of what perhaps might be the case did add a paragraph to his letter in which he notified to his correspondent that a personal visit would be taken in good part  by the end of the first week in december things were beginning to settle into shape at the priory the three young men were still living together at the great house and the tenants on the estate had been taught to recognise the fact that ralph who had ever been the heir was in truth the owner among the labourers and poorer classes there was no doubt much regret and that regret was expressed the tenants though they all liked the squires son were not upon the whole illpleased it was in proper conformity with english habits and english feelings that the real heir should reign among the gentry the young squire was made as welcome as the circumstances of the heir would admit according to their way of thinking personally popular as was the other man it was clearly better that a legitimate descendant of the old family should be installed at newton priory the old squires son rode well to hounds and was loved by all but nothing that all the world could do on his behalf would make him newton of newton if only he would remain in the neighbourhood and take some place suited to his income every house would be open to him he would be received with no diminution of attachment or respect overtures of this nature were made to him this house could be had for him and that farm could be made comfortable he might live among them as a general favourite but he could not under any circumstances have beennewton of newton nothing however was clearer to himself than thisthat as he could not remain in the county as the master of newton priory he would not remain in the county at all  as things settled down and took shape he began to feel that even in his present condition he might possibly make himself acceptable to such a girl as mary bonner in respect of fortune there could be no reason whatever why he should not offer her his hand he was in truth a rich man whereas she had nothing by birth he was nobodyabsolutely nobody but then also would he have been nobody had all the lands of newton belonged to him when he had written that second letter waiving all claim to marys hand because of the inferiority of his position he was suffering from a morbid view which he had taken of his own affairs he was telling himself thenso assuring himself though he did not in truth believe the assurancethat he had lost not only the estate but also his fathers private fortune at that moment he had been unstrung demoralised and unmannedso weak that a feather would have knocked him over the blow had been so sudden the solitude and gloom of the house so depressing and his sorrow so crushing that he was ready to acknowledge that there could be no hope for him in any direction he had fed himself upon his own grief till the idea of any future success in life was almost unpalatable to him but things had mended with him now and he would see whether there might not yet be joys for him in the world he would first see whether there might not be that one great joy which he had promised to himself  and then there came another blow the young squire had resolved that he would not hunt before christmas in the newton country it was felt by him and by his brother that he should abstain from doing so out of respect to the memory of his uncle and he had declared his purpose of course there was neither hunting nor shooting in these days for the other ralph but at the end of a month the young squire began to feel that the days went rather slowly with him and he remembered his stud at the moonbeam he consulted gregory and the parson though he would fain have induced his brother to remain could not say that there was any real objection to a trip to the b and bs ralph would go there on the 10th of december and be back at his own house before christmas when christmas was over the other ralph was to leave newtonperhaps for ever  the two ralphs had become excellent friends and when the one that was to go declared his intention of going with no intention of returning the other pressed him warmly to think better of it and to look upon the priory at any rate as a second home there were reasons why it could not be so said the namesake but in the close confidence of friendship which the giving and the declining of the offer generated came this further blow they were standing together leaning upon a gate and looking at the exhumation of certain vast roots as to which the trees once belonging to them had been made to fall in consequence of the improvements going on at darvells farm i dont mind telling you said ralph the heir that i hope soon to have a mistress here  and who is she  that would be mere tellingwould it not  clarissa underwood asked the unsuspecting ralph  there did come some prick of conscience some qualm of an injury done upon the young squire as he made his answer no not clarissathough she is the dearest sweetest girl that ever lived and would make a better wife perhaps than the girl i think of  and who is the girl you think of  she is to be found in the same house  you do not mean the elder sister said the unfortunate one he had known well that his companion had not alluded to patience underwood but in his agony he had suggested to himself that mode of escape  no not patience underwood though let me tell you a man might do worse than marry patience underwood i have always thought it a pity that patience and gregory would not make a match of it he however would fall in love with clary and she has too much of the rake in her to give herself to a parson i was thinking of mary bonner who to my mind is the handsomest woman i ever saw in my life  i think she is said ralph turning away his face  she hasnt a farthing i fancy continued the happy heir but i dont regard that now a few months ago i had a mind to marry for money but it isnt the sort of thing that any man should do i have almost made up my mind to ask her indeed when i tell you i suppose i have quite made up my mind  shell accept youof course  i can say nothing about that you know a man must take his chance i can offer her a fine position and a girl i think should have some regard to money when she marries though a man should not if theres nobody before me i should have a chance i suppose  his words were not boastful but there was a tone of triumph in his voice and why should he not triumph thought the other ralph of course he would triumph he had everything to recommend him and as for himselffor him the dispossessed oneany particle of a claim which he might have secured by means of that former correspondence had been withdrawn by his own subsequent words i dare say shell take you he said with his face still averted  ralph the heir did indeed think that he would be accepted and he went on to discuss the circumstances of their future home almost as though mary bonner were already employed in getting together her wedding garments his companion said nothing further and ralph the heir did not discover that anything was amiss  on the following day ralph the heir went across the country to the moonbeam in buckinghamshire     chapter xxxvi  neefit means to stick to it   there was some business to be done as a matter of course before the young squire could have all his affairs properly settled there were debts to be paid among which mr neefits stood certainly first it was first in magnitude and first in obligation but it gave ralph no manner of uneasiness he had really done his best to get polly to marry him and luckily for himby the direct interposition of some divine providence as it now seemed to ralphpolly had twice refused him it seemed to him indeed that divine providence looked after him in a special way breaking his uncles neck in the very nick of time and filling a breechesmakers daughters mind with so sound a sense of the propriety of things as to induce her to decline the honour of being a millstone round his neck when positively the offer was pressed upon her as things stood there could be no difficulty with mr neefit the money would be paid of course with all adjuncts of accruing interest and mr neefit should go on making breeches for him to the end of the chapter and for raising this money he had still a remnant of the old property which he could sell so that he need not begin by laying an ounce of encumbrance on his paternal estates he was very clear in his mind at this period of his life that there should never be any such encumbrance in his days that remnant of property should be sold and neefit horsball and others should be paid but it certainly did occur to him in regard to neefit that there had been that between them which made it expedient that the matter should be settled with some greater courtesy than would be shown by a simple transaction through his man of business therefore he wrote a few lines to mr neefit on the day before he left the priorya few lines which he thought to be very civil      newton 9th december 186     my dear mr neefit     you have probably heard before this of the accident which    has happened in my family my uncle has been killed by    a fall from his horse and i have come into my property    earlier than i expected as soon as i could begin to    attend to matters of business i thought of my debt to    you and of all the obligation i owe you i think the debt    is £1000 but whatever it is it can be paid now the    money will be ready early in the year if that will do for    youand i am very much obliged to you would you mind    letting mr carey know how much it is interest and all    he is our family lawyer     remember me very kindly to miss polly i hope she will    always think of me as a friend would you tell bawwah to    put three pairs of breeches in hand for meleather     yours very truly     ralph newton   the wrath of mr neefit on receiving this letter at his shop in conduit street was almost divine he had heard from polly an account of that last interview at ramsgate and polly had told her story as truly as she knew how to tell it but the father had never for a moment allowed himself to conceive that therefore the thing was at an end and had instructed polly that she was not to look upon it in that light he regarded his young customer as absolutely bound to him and would not acknowledge to himself that such obligation could be annulled by pollys girlish folly and he did believe that young newton intended to act as he called it on the square so believing he was ready to make almost any sacrifice of himself but that newton should now go back after having received his hard money was to him a thing quite out of the question he scolded polly with some violence and asked whether she wanted to marry such a lout as moggs polly replied with spirit that she wouldnt marry any man till she found that she could love him and that the man loved her aint he told you as he loves you ever so often said neefit i know what im doing of father said polly and im not going to be drove nevertheless mr neefit had felt certain that if young newton would still act upon the square things would settle themselves rightly there was the money due and as neefit constantly said to himself money was a thing as was not to be got over  then had come upon the tradesman the tidings of the old squires death they were read to him out of a newspaper by his shopman waddle im blessed if he aint been and tumbled all at once into his uncles shoes said waddle the paragraph in question was one which appeared in a weekly newspaper some two days after the squires death neefit who at the moment was turning over the pages of his ledger came down from his desk and stood for about ten minutes in the middle of his shop while the herr ceased from his cutting and waddle read the paragraph over and over again neefit stood stock still with his hands in his breeches pockets and his great staring eyes fixed upon vacancy im blessed if it aint true said waddle convinced by the repetition of his own reading news had previously reached the shop that the squire had had a fall tidings as to troubles in the huntingfield were quick in reaching mr neefits shopbut there had been no idea that the accident would prove to be fatal neefit when he went home that night told his wife and daughter that will be the last of young newton said mrs neefit im d if it will said the breechesmaker polly maintained a discreet silence as to the heir merely remarking that it was very sad for the old gentleman polly at that time was very full of admiration for moggsin regard that is to the political character of her lover moggs had lost his election but was about to petition  neefit was never called upon in the way of his own trade to make funereal garments men when they are bereaved of their friends do not ride in black breeches but he had all a tailors respect for a customer with a dead relation he felt that it would not become him to make an application to the young squire on a subject connected with marriage till the tombstone over the old squire should have been properly adjusted he was a patient man and could wait and he was a man not good at writing letters his customer and future soninlaw would turn up soon or else the expectant fatherinlaw might drop down upon him at the moonbeam or elsewhere as for a final escape polly neefits father hardly feared that any such attempt would be made the young man had acted on the square and had made his offer in good faith  such was mr neefits state of mind when he received the young squires letter the letter almost knocked him down there was a decision about it a confidence that all was over between them except the necessary payment of the money an absence of all doubt as to miss polly which he could not endure and then that order for more breeches included in the very same paragraph with polly was most injurious it must be owned that the letter was a cruel heartrending bad letter for an hour or so it nearly broke mr neefits heart but he resolved that he was not going to be done the young squire should marry his daughter or the whole transaction should be published to the world he would do such things and say such things that the young squire should certainly not have a good time of it he said not a word to polly of the letter that night but he did speak of the young squire when that young man comes again miss polly he said i shall expect you to take him  i dont know anything about that father said polly hes had his answer and im thinking he wont ask for another upon this the breechesmaker looked at his daughter but made no other reply  during the two or three following days neefit made some inquiries and found that his customer was at the moonbeam it was now necessary that he should go to work at once and therefore with many misgivings he took waddle into his confidence he could not himself write such a letter as then must be writtenbut waddle was perfect at the writing of letters waddle shrugged his shoulders and clearly did not believe that polly would ever get the young squire waddle indeed went so far as to hint that his master would be lucky in obtaining payment of his moneybut nevertheless he gave his mind to the writing of the letter the letter was written as follows      conduit street 14th december 186     dear sir     yours of the 9th instant has come to hand and i beg to    say with compliments how shocked we were to hear of the    squires accident it was terribly sudden and we all felt    it very much as in the way of our business we very often    have to     as to the money that can stand between friends such    things neednt be mentioned any accommodation of that    kind was and always will be ready when required as to    that other matter a young gentleman like you wont think    that a young lady is to be taken at her first word a    bargain is a bargain and honourable is honourable which    nobody knows as well as you who was always disposed to    be upon the square our polly hasnt forgotten youand    isnt going   it should be acknowledged on mr waddles behalf that that last assurance was inserted by the unassisted energy of mr neefit himself      we shall expect to see you without delay here or at    hendon as may best suit but pray remember that things    stand just as they was touching other matters as neednt    be named here orders will be attended to as usual if    given separate     yours very truly and obedient     thomas neefit   this letter duly reached the young squire and did not add to his happiness at the moonbeam that he should ever renew his offer to polly neefit was he well knew out of the question but he could see before him an infinity of trouble should the breechesmaker be foolish enough to press him to do so he had acted on the square in compliance with the bargain undoubtedly made by him he had twice proposed to polly and had polly accepted his offer on either of these occasions there wouldhe now acknowledged to himselfhave been very great difficulty in escaping from the difficulty polly had thought fit to refuse him and of course he was free but nevertheless there might be trouble in store for him he had hardly begun to ask himself in what way this trouble might next show itself when neefit was at the moonbeam three days after the receipt of his letter when he rode into the moonbeam yard on his return from hunting there was mr neefit waiting to receive him  he certainly had not answered mr neefits letter having told himself that he might best do so by a personal visit in conduit street but now that neefit was there the personal intercourse did not seem to him to be so easy he greeted the breechesmaker very warmly while pepper cox and mr horsball with sundry grooms and helpers stood by and admired something of mr neefits money and of pollys charms as connected with the young squire had already reached the moonbeam by the tongue of rumour and now mr neefit had been waiting for the last four hours in the little parlour within the moonbeam bar he had eaten his mutton chop and drunk three or four glasses of gin and water but had said nothing of his mission mrs horsball however had already whispered her suspicions to her husbands sister a young lady of forty who dispensed rum gin and brandy with very long ringlets and very small glasses  you want to have a few words with me old fellow said ralph to the breechesmaker with a cheery laugh it was a happy idea that of making them all around conceive that neefit had come after his money only it was not successful men are not dunned so rigorously when they have just fallen into their fortunes neefit hardly speaking above his breath with that owlish stolid look which was always common to him except when he was measuring a man for a pair of breeches acknowledged that he did come along old fellow said ralph taking him by the arm but whatll you take to drink first neefit shook his head and accompanied ralph into the house ralph had a private sittingroom of his own so that there was no difficulty on that score whats all this about he said standing with his back to the fire and still holding neefit by the arm he did it very well but he did not as yet know the depth of neefits obstinacy  whats it all about asked neefit in disgust  well yes have you talked to polly herself about this old fellow  no i aint and i dont mean  twice i went to her and twice she refused me come neefit be reasonable a man cant be running after a girl all his life when she wont have anything to say to him i did all that a man could do and upon my honour i was very fond of her but god bless my soulthere must be an end to everything  there aint to be no end to this mr newton  im to marry the girl whether she will or not  nohow said mr neefit oracularly but when a young gentleman asks a young lady as whether shell have him shes not agoing to jump down his throat you knows that mr newton and as for money did i ask for any settlement id a been ashamed to mention money when are you acoming to see our polly thats the question  i shall come no more mr neefit  you wont  certainly not mr neefit ive been twice rejected  and thats the kind of man you are is it youre one of them sort are you then he looked out of his saucer eyes upon the young squire with a fishy ferocity which was very unpleasant it was quite evident that he meant war if thats your game mr newton ill be even with you  mr neefit ill pay you anything that you say i owe you  damn your money said the breechesmaker walking out of the room when he got down into the bar he told them all there that young newton was engaged to his daughter and that by g he should marry her  stick to that neefit said lieutenant cox  i mean to stick to it said mr neefit he then ordered another glass of gin and water and was driven back to the station     chapter xxxvii  he must marry her   on the day following that on which mr neefit made his journey to the moonbeam sir thomas underwood was at his chambers in london it was now eight weeks since his bone had been broken and though he still carried his arm in a sling he declared of himself that he was able to go about as usualwhich assertion was taken at the villa as meaning that he was now able to live in southampton buildings without further assistance from women when patience reminded him with tears in her eyes that he could not as yet put on his own coat he reminded her that stemm was the most careful of men up to london he went with a full understanding that he was not at any rate to be expected home on that night he had business on hand of great importance which as he declared made his presence in town imperative mr trigger from percycross was to be up with reference to the pestilent petition which had been presented against the return of griffenbottom and himself moggs had petitioned on his own behalf and two of the liberals of the borough had also petitioned in the interest of mr westmacott the two liberal parties who had quarrelled during the contest had now again joined forces in reference to the petition and there was no doubt that the matter would go on before the judge mr trigger was coming up to london with reference to the defence sir thomas gave stemm to understand that mr trigger would call at one oclock  exactly at one oclock the bell was rung at sir thomass outside door and stemm was on the alert to give entrance to mr trigger when the door was opened who should present himself but our unfortunate friend neefit he humbly asked whether sir thomas was within and received a reply which as coming from stemm was courteous in the extreme mr trigger i supposewalk in mr trigger neefit not at all understanding why he was called trigger did walk in stemm opening the door of his masters sanctum announced mr trigger neefit advanced into the middle of the room sir thomas with some solicitude as to the adjustment of his arm rose to greet his agent from percy cross this isnt mr trigger said sir thomas he told me he was anyhow said stemm i didnt tell you nothing of the kind said neefit but you come from percycross said sir thomas no i dont i comes from conduit street said neefit you must go away said stemm leaving the door open and advancing into the room as though to turn the enemys flank  but neefit having made good his point so far did not intend to be dislodged without a struggle on his own part ive something to say to sir thomas about mr newton as i wants to say very particular you cant say it now said stemm oh but i can said neefit and it wont take three minutes wouldnt another day do for it as i am particularly busy now pleaded sir thomas well sir thomasto tell the truth it wouldnt said mr neefit standing his ground then there came another ring at the bell ask mr trigger to sit down in the other room for two minutes stemm said sir thomas and so mr neefit had carried his point and now sir said sir thomas as i am particularly engaged i will ask you to be as quick as possible  my name is neefit began the breechesmakerand then paused sir thomas who had heard the name from ralph but had forgotten it altogether merely bowed his head i am the breechesmaker of conduit street continued mr neefit with a proud conviction that he too had ascended so high in his calling as to be justified in presuming that he was known to mankind sir thomas again bowed neefit went on with his story mr newton is agoing to behave to me very bad  if he owes you money he can pay you now said sir thomas  he do owe me moneya thousand pound he owe me  a thousand pounds for breeches  no sir thomas its most for money lent but its not along of that as id trouble you i know how to get my money or to put up with the loss if i dont a thousand pound aint here nor therenot in what ive got to say i wouldnt demean myself to ring at your bell sir thomasnot in the way of looking for a thousand pounds  in gods name then what is it pray be quick  hes going back from his word as hes promised to my daughter thats what it is as neefit paused again sir thomas remembered ralphs proposition made in his difficulties as to marrying a tradesmans daughter for money and at once fell to the conclusion that mr and miss neefit had been illused sir thomas continued the breechesmaker ive been as good as a father to him i gave him money when nobody else wouldnt  do you mean that he has had money from you  yes in course he has ever so much i paid for him a lot of money to orsball where he unts money i should think so didnt i pay moggs for him the bootmaker the very money as is rattling in his pocket now is my money  and he engaged himself to your daughter  he engaged hisself to me to marry her he wont say no otherwise himself and he asked her twice why sir thomas he was all on the square about it till the old gentleman broke his neck he hadnt nowhere else to go to for a shilling but now the estates come in like hes for behaving dishonourable he dont know me yet thats what he dont but ill make him know me sir thomas  then the door was opened and stemms head appeared mr trigger says as hes in the greatest possible haste sir thomas the reader however may as well be informed that this was pure invention on the part of mr stemm  sir thomas tore his hair and rubbed his face he couldnt bid neefit to call again as he certainly did not desire to have a second visit what can i do for you mr neefit i have no doubt the money will be paid if owing i will guarantee that for you  it aint the money i knows how to get my money  then what can i do for you  make him go upon the square sir thomas  how can i make him hes twentysix years old and hes nothing to me i dont think he should marry the young lady hes not in her rank of life if he has done her an injury he must pay for it  injury shouted neefit upon whose mind the word produced an unintended idea no no our polly aint like that by g id eat him if it was that way there aint a duchess in the land as d ve guv him his answer more ready than polly had he ever spoke to her that way  if he has given rise to hopes which through him will be disappointed said sir thomas gravely he is bound to make what compensation may be in his power  compensation be d said neefit he must marry her  i dont think he will do that  you didnt think he would take my money i suppose but he did you didnt think hed come and spend his sundays out at my cottage but he did you didnt think as hed come after our polly down to ramsgate but he did you didnt think as hed give me his word to make her his wife but he did at every assertion that he made the breechesmaker bobbed forward his bullet head stretched open his eyes and stuck out his under lip during all this excited energy he was not a man pleasant to the eye and now how is it to be sir thomas thats what i want to know  mr newton is nothing to me mr neefit  ohthats all nothing to you aint he wasnt he brought up by you just as a son like and now he aint nothing to you do you mean to say as he didnt ought to marry my girl  i think he ought not to marry her  not arter his promise  sir thomas was driven very hard whereas had the sly old breechesmaker told all his story there would have been no difficulty at all i think such a marriage would lead to the happiness of neither party if an injury has been doneas i fear may be too probablei will advise my young friend to make any reparation in his powershort of marriage i can say nothing further mr neefit  and thats your idea of being on the square sir thomas  i can say nothing further mr neefit as i have an appointment made i must ask you to leave me as sir thomas said this his hand was upon the bell  very wellvery well as sure as my names neefit he shall hear of me and so shall you sir thomas dont you be poking at me in that way old fellow i dont choose to be poked at these last words were addressed to stemm who had entered the room and was holding the door open for mr neefits exit with something more than the energy customary in speeding a parting guest mr neefit however did take his departure and sir thomas joined mr trigger in the other room  we will not be present at that interview sir thomas had been in a great hurry to get rid of mr neefit but it may be doubted whether he found mr trigger much better company mr triggers business chiefly consisted in asking sir thomas for a considerable sum of money and in explaining to him that the petition would certainly cost a large sum beyond thisunless the expenses could be saddled on westmacott and moggs as to which result mr trigger seemed to have considerable doubt but perhaps the bitterest part of mr triggers communication consisted in the expression of his opinion that mr griffenbottom should be held by sir thomas free from any expense as to the petition on the ground that griffenbottom had he stood alone would certainly have carried one of the seats without any fear of a petition i dont think i can undertake that mr trigger said sir thomas mr trigger simply shrugged his shoulders  sir thomas when he was alone was very uncomfortable while at percycross he had extracted from patience an idea that ralph the heir and clarissa were attached to each other and he had very strongly declared that he would not admit an engagement between them at that time ralph was supposed to have sold his inheritance and did not stand well in sir thomass eyes then had come the squires death and the altered position of his late ward sir thomas would be injured would be made subject to unjust reproach if it were thought of him that he would be willing to give his daughter to a young man simply because that young man owned an estate he had no such sordid feeling in regard to his girls but he did feel that all that had occurred at newton had made a great difference ralph would now live at the priory and there would be enough even for his extravagance should the squire of newton ask him for his girls hand with that girls consent he thought that he could hardly refuse it how could he ask clarissa to abandon so much seeming happiness because the man had failed to keep out of debt upon a small income he could not do so and then it came to pass that he was prepared to admit ralph as a suitor to his child should ralph renew his request to that effect they had all loved the lad as a boy and the property was wholly unencumbered of course he said nothing to clarissa but should ralph come to him there could be but one answer such had been the state of his mind before mr neefits visit  but the breechesmakers tale had altered the aspect of things very greatly under no circumstances could sir thomas recommend the young squire to marry the daughter of the man who had been with him but if ralph newton had really engaged himself to this girl and had done so with the purport of borrowing money from the father that might be a reason why notwithstanding the splendour of his prospects he should not be admitted to further intimacy at the villa to borrow money from ones tradesman was in the eyes of sir thomas about as inexcusable an offence as a young man could commit he was too much disturbed in mind to go home on the following day but on the thursday he returned to the villa the following sunday would be christmas day     chapter xxxviii  for two reasons   the young squire as soon as neefit had left him in his own sittingroom at the moonbeam sat himself down and began to think over his affairs seriously one thing was certain to himnothing on earth should induce him to offer his hand again to polly neefit he had had a most miraculous escape and assuredly would run no further risk in that direction but though he had escaped he could perceive that there was considerable trouble before himconsiderable trouble and perhaps some disgrace it certainly could not be proved against him that he had broken any promise as there had been no engagement but it could be made public that he had twice offered himself to polly and could also be made public that he had borrowed the breechesmakers money he kept himself alone on that evening and though he hunted on the following day he was not found to be a lively companion either by cox or pepper the lieutenant was talking about neefit and neefits daughter all day but mr pepper who was more discreet declined to canvass the subject its nothing to me who a man marries and who he dont said mr pepper what sort of horses he ridesthats what i look at during this day and the next ralph did consider the state of his affairs very closely and the conclusion he came to was this that the sooner he could engage himself to marry mary bonner the better if he were once engaged the engagement would not then be broken off because of any previous folly with miss neefit and again if he were once engaged to mary bonner neefit would see the absurdity of torturing him further in regard to polly on the wednesday evening he went up to town and on the thursday morning he put himself into a cab and ordered the man to drive him to popham villa  it was about noon when he started from town and though he never hesitateddid not pause for a moment after he had made up his mind as to the thing that he would do still he felt many misgivings as he was driven down to fulham how should he begin his story to mary bonner and how should he look clary underwood in the face and yet he had not an idea that he was in truth going to behave badly to clarissa there had no doubt been a sort of tenderness in the feeling that had existed between thema something just a little warmer than brotherly regard they had been thrown together and had liked each other and as he was driven nearer to the villa he remembered distinctly that he had kissed her on the lawn but did any one suppose that a man was bound to marry the first girl he kissedor if not the first then why the second or the third clarissa could have no fair ground of complaint against him and yet he was uneasy as he reflected that she too must know the purport of his present visit to the villa  and he was not quite easy about mary the good things which he carried in his hand were so many that he did not conceive that mary would refuse him but yet he wished that the offer had been made and had been accepted hitherto he had taken pleasure in his intercourse with young ladies and had rather enjoyed the excitement of those moments which to some men are troublesome and even painful when he had told clarissa that she was dearer than any one else he had been very happy while he was telling her there had been nothing of embarrassment to him in the work of proposing to polly neefit there may perhaps have been other passages in his life of the same nature and he certainly had not feared them beforehand or been ashamed of them afterwards but now he found himself endeavouring to think what words he would use to mary bonner and in what attitude he would stand or sit as he used them the truth is he said to himself a man should do these kind of things without premeditation but not the less was he resolved and at the gate he jumped out of his cab with a determination to have it over as soon as possible he desired the cabman to wait for him at the nearest stables remarking that he might be there for a few minutes or for a few hours and then turned to the gate as he did so he saw sir thomas walking from the direction of fulham bridge sir thomas had come down by the railway on the other side of the river and was now walking home a sudden thought struck the young squire he would begin his work by telling his tale to sir thomas there could be nothing so fitting as that he should obtain the uncles leave to address the niece  the two men greeted each other and there were many things to be said sir thomas had not seen his ward since the old squires death and ralph had not seen sir thomas since the election at percycross and the accident of the broken arm sir thomas was by far too reticent too timid and too reflective a man to begin at once whatever observations he might have to make ultimately in regard to miss polly neefit he was somewhat slow of speech unless specially aroused and had hardly received the congratulations of his young friend respecting the election and expressed with some difficult decency his sorrow for the old squires death as combined with his satisfaction that the estate had not been sacrificed when ralph stopped him just as they had reached the front door and with much solemnity of manner declared his wish to make a very particular private communication to sir thomas certainly said sir thomas certainly come into my room but there was some delay before this privacy could be achieved for in the hall they were met by the three girls and of course there were many things to be said by them clarissa could hardly repress the flutter of her heart when the reader last saw her flutter and last heard her words as she spoke of her love to her cousin she was taking an opportunity of declaring to mary bonner that she did not begrudge the brilliance of marys present prospectsthough the grand estate which made them brilliant was in a measure taken from her own hopes and she had owned at the same time that she did not dare to feel confidence in her own love because her lover would now be too poor in his own esteem to indulge himself with the luxury of a wife all this mary had accepted from her certainly with no expression of triumph but certainly with some triumph in her heart now this was entirely changedand here was her lover with his fortune restored to him once more beneath her fathers roof she gave him her hand the first of the three she could not repress herself he took it with a smile and pressed it warmly but he turned to patience and took hers as rapidly as he was able then came marys turn i hope you also are glad to see me once again he said clarissas heart sank within her as she heard the words the appreciation of a woman in such matters is as fine as the nose of a hound and is all but unintelligible to a man oh yes mr newton said mary smiling but if he asks her shell take him no such words as these were formed even in clarissas mind but after some fashion such was the ejaculation of her heart marys oh yes had meant little enough but could mary withstand such chances if they were offered to her  sir thomas led the way into his private room and ralph followed him you wont be long papa said patience  i hope not said sir thomas  remember ralph you will be keeping lunch waiting said patience  then the two men were alone sir thomass mind had recurred to neefit at the first moment of ralphs request the young man was going to consult him as to the best mode of getting rid of that embarrassment but in the hall another idea had come upon him he was to be asked for his consent regarding clarissa as he seated himself in one chair and asked ralph to take another he had not quite made up his mind as to the answer he would give there must at any rate be some delay the reader will of course remember that sir thomas was persuaded that ralph had engaged himself to marry polly neefit  ralph rushed boldly at his subject at once sir thomas he said i am going to make a proposition and i wish to ask you for your consent i have made up my mind that the sooner i marry in my present condition the better sir thomas smiled and assented and i want to know whether you will object to my asking miss bonner to be my wife  miss bonner said sir thomas throwing up both his hands  yes siris there any objection on your part  sir thomas hardly knew how to say whether there was or was not an objection on his part in the first place he had made up his mind that the other ralph was to marry marythat he would do so in spite of that disclaimer which had been made in the first moment of the young mans disinheritance he sir thomas however could have no right to object on that score nor could he raise any objection on the score of clarissa it did seem to him that all the young people were at cross purposes that patience must have been very stupid and clarissa most addlepated or else that this ralph was abominably false but still he could say nothing respecting that no tale had reached his ears which made it even possible for him to refer to clarissa but yet he was dissatisfied with the man and was disposed to show it perhaps i ought to tell you said sir thomas that a man calling himself neefit was with me yesterday  oh yes the breechesmaker  i believe he said that such was his trade he assured me that you had borrowed large sums of money from him  i do owe him some money  a thousand pounds i think he said  certainly as much as that  not for breecheswhich i suppose would be impossible but for money advanced  part one and part the other said ralph  and he went on to tell me that you were engagedto marry his daughter  that is untrue  were you never engaged to her  i was never engaged to her sir thomas  and it was all a lie on the part of mr neefit was there no foundation for it you had told me yourself that you thought of such a marriage  there is nothing to justify him in saying that i was ever engaged to the young lady the truth is that i did ask her and sherefused me  you did ask her  i did ask her said ralph  in earnest  well yescertainly in earnest at that time i thought it the only way to save the property i need not tell you how wretched i was at the time you will remember what you yourself had said to me it is true that i asked her and that i did so by agreement with her father she refused metwice she was so good so sensible and so true that she knew she had better not make herself a party to such a bargain whatever you may think of my own conduct i shall not have behaved badly to miss neefit  sir thomas did think very ill of ralphs conduct but he believed him after a while the whole truth came out as to the money lent and as to neefits schemes it was of course understood by both of them that ralph was required neither by honesty nor by honour to renew his offer and then under such circumstances was he or was he not to be allowed to propose to mary bonner at first ralph had been much dismayed at having the neefit mine sprung on him at such a moment but he collected himself very quickly and renewed his demand as to mary sir thomas could not mean to say that because he had been foolish in regard to polly neefit that therefore he was to be debarred from marrying sir thomas did not exactly say that but nevertheless sir thomas showed his displeasure it seems said he particularly easy to you to transfer your affections  my affection for miss neefit was not strong said ralph i did and always shall regard her as a most excellent young woman  she showed her sense in refusing you said sir thomas  i think she did said ralph  and i doubt much whether my niece will not be equallysensible  ahi can say nothing as to that  were she to hear this story of miss neefit i am sure she would refuse you  but you would not tell it to heras yet if all goes well with me i will tell it to her some day come sir thomas you dont mean to be hard upon me at last it cannot be that you should really regret that i have got out of that trouble  but i regret much that you should have borrowed a tradesmans money and more that you should have offered to pay the debt by marrying his daughter through it all however there was a feeling present to sir thomas that he was in truth angry with the squire of newton not so much for his misconduct in coming to propose to mary so soon after the affair with polly neefit but because he had not come to propose to clarissa and sir thomas knew that such a feeling if it did really exist must be overcome mary was entitled to her chance and must make the best of it he would not refuse his sanction to a marriage with his niece on account of ralphs misconduct when he would have sanctioned a marriage with his own daughter in spite of that misconduct the conversation was ended by sir thomas leaving the room with a promise that miss bonner should be sent to fill his place in five minutes miss bonner was there she entered the room very slowly with a countenance that was almost savage and during the few minutes that she remained there she did not sit down  sir thomas has told you why i am here he said advancing towards her and taking her hand  no that isno he has not told me  mary  mr newton my name is miss bonner  and must it between us be so cold as that he still had her by the hand which she did not at the moment attempt to withdraw i have come to tell you at the first moment that was possible to me after my uncles death that of all women in the world i love you the best  then she withdrew her hand mr newton i am sorry to hear you say sovery sorry  why should you be sorry if you are unkind to me like this there may be reason why i should be sorry i shall indeed be very sorry since i first saw you i have hoped that you would be my wife  i never can be your wife mr newton  why not have i done anything to offend you being here as one of the family you must know enough of my affairs to feel surethat i have come to you the first moment that was possible i did not dare to come when i thought that my position was one that was not worthy of you  it would have been the same at any time said mary  and why should you reject melike this without a moments thought  for two reasons said mary slowly and then she paused as though doubting whether she would continue her speech or give the two reasons which now guided her but he stood looking into her face waiting for them in the first place she said i think you are untrue to another person then she paused again as though asking herself whether that reason would not suffice but she resolved that she would be bold and give the other in the next place my heart is not my own to give  is it so asked ralph  i have said as much as can be necessaryperhaps more and i would rather go now then she left the room with the same slow stately step and he saw her no more on that day  then in those short five minutes sir thomas had absolutely told her the whole story about polly neefit and she had come to the conclusion that because in his trouble he had offered to marry a tradesmans daughter therefore he was to be debarred from ever receiving the hand of a lady that was the light in which he looked upon marys first announcement as to the second announcement he was absolutely at a loss there must probably he thought have been some engagement before she left jamaica not the less on that account was it an act of unpardonable illnature on the part of sir thomasthat telling of polly neefits story to mary bonner at such a moment  he was left alone for a few minutes after marys departure and then patience came to him would he stay for dinner even patience was very cold to him sir thomas was fatigued and was lying down but would see him of course if he wished it and where is clarissa asked ralph patience said that clarissa was not very well she also was lying down i see what it is said ralph turning upon her angrily you are all of you determined to quarrel with me because of my uncles death  i do not see why that should make us quarrel said patience i do not know that any one has quarrelled with you  of course he would not wait for dinner nor would he have any lunch he walked out on to the lawn with something of a bluster in his step and stood there for three or four minutes looking up at the house and speaking to patience a young man when he has been rejected by one of the young ladies of a family has rather a hard time of it till he gets away well patience he said at last make my farewells for me and then he was gone     chapter xxxix  horseleeches   the honour of representing the borough of percycross in parliament was very great and sir thomas no doubt did enjoy it after a fashion but it was by no means an unalloyed pleasure while he was still in bed with his broken arm at the percy standard many applications for money had been made to him this man wanted a sovereign that man a fivepoundnote and some poor starving wretch a halfacrown and they all came to him with notes from trigger or messages from spicer or spiveycomb to the effect that as the election was now over the money ought to be given the landlord of the percy standard was on such occasions very hard upon him it really will do good sir thomas it is wanted sir thomas it will make a good feeling in the town sir thomas and we dont know how soon we may have to go to work again sir thomas was too weak in health to refuse he gave the sovereigns the fivepoundnotes and the halfcrowns and hurried back home as quickly as he was able  but things were almost worse with him at home than at percycross the real horseleeches felt that they could hardly get a good hold of him while he was lying at the percycross inn attacks by letter were they well knew more fatal than those made personally and they waited the first that came was from mr pabsby mr pabsby had at last seen his way clear and had voted for underwood and westmacott absolutely throwing away his vote as far as the cause was concerned but mr pabsby had quarrelled with griffenbottom who once when pressed hard for some favours had answered the reverend gentleman somewhat roughly you may go and be  said mr griffenbottom in his wrath and tell everybody in percycross that i said so mr pabsby had smiled had gone away and had now voted for mr westmacott mr pabsby was indeed a horseleech of the severest kind there had been some outward show of reconciliation between griffenbottom and pabsby but pabsby had at last voted for underwood and westmacott sir thomas had not been home two days before he received a letter from mr pabsby it had been with infinite satisfactionso mr pabsby now saidthat he had at length seen his way clearly and found himself able to support his friend sir thomas and he believed that he might take upon himself to say that when he once had seen his way clearly he had put his shoulder to the wheel gallantly in fact it was to be inferred from the contents of mr pabsbys letter that sir thomass return had been due altogether to mr pabsbys flock who had so said mr pabsby been guided in the matter altogether by his advice then he sent a list of his hearers who had voted for sir thomas from this the slight change of subject needed to bring him to the new chapel which he was building and his desire that sir thomas should head the subscriptionlist in so good a cause was easy enough it might be difficult to say in what mr pabsbys strength lay but it certainly was the case that the letter was so written as to defy neglect and almost to defy refusal such is the power of horseleeches sir thomas sent mr pabsby a cheque for twenty pounds and received mr pabsbys acknowledgment thanking him for his first subscription the thanks were not very cordial and it was evident that mr pabsby had expected a good deal more than twenty pounds in return for all that he had done  mr pabsby was simply the first before christmas had come it seemed to sir thomas that there was not a place of divine worship in the whole of percycross that was not falling to the ground in ruins he had not observed it when he was there but now it appeared that funds were wanted for almost every such edifice in the borough and the schools were in a most destitute condition he was informed that the sitting member had always subscribed to all the schools and that if he did not continue such subscription the children would literally be robbed of their education one gentleman whose name he did not even remember to have heard simply suggested to him that he would as a matter of course continue to give the £50 towards the general christmas collection on behalf of the old women of the borough the sitting members had given it time out of mind mr roodylands had a political project of his own which in fact if carried out would amount to a prohibition on the import of french boots and suggested that sir thomas should bring in a bill to that effect on the meeting of parliament if sir thomas would not object to the trouble of visiting amiens lille beauvais and three or four other french towns which mr roodylands mentioned he would be able to ascertain how much injury had been done to percycross by the cobden treaty mr spiveycomb had his own ideas about italian ragsmr spiveycomb being in the paper lineand wrote a very long letter to sir thomas praying the member to make himself master of a subject so vitally important to the borough which he represented mr spicer also communicated to him the astounding fact that some high official connected with the army was undoubtedly misbehaving himself in regard to mustard for the troops the mustard contracts were not open as they should be open the mustard was all supplied by a london house and mr spicer was very anxious that sir thomas should move for a committee to inquire of the members of that london firm as to the manner in which the contracts were obtained by them mr spicer was disposed to think that this was the most important matter that would be brought forward in the next session of parliament  mr pabsby had got his cheque before the other applications were received but when they came in shoals sir thomas thought that it might be well to refer them to mr trigger for advice sir thomas had not loved griffenbottom during the election and was not inclined to ask his colleague for counsel griffenbottom had obtained a name for liberality in percycross and had shown symptomsso thought sir thomasof an intention to use his reputation as a means of throwing off further burdens from his own shoulders i have spent a treasure in the borough let my colleague begin now words spoken by mr griffenbottom in that strain had been repeated to sir thomas and after many such words sir thomas could not go to mr griffenbottom for advice as to what he should give or refuse to give he doubted whether better reliance could be placed on mr triggerbut to some one he must go for direction were he once to let it be known in percycross that demands made would be satisfied he might sign cheques to the extent of his whole fortune during his first session he did write to mr trigger enclosing the various percycross applications and mr trigger duly replied to him mr trigger regretted that money had been given to mr pabsby mr pabsby had been of no use and could be of no use mr griffenbottom who knew the borough better than any one else had understood this well when on one occasion he had been a little short with mr pabsby sir thomas ought not to have sent that cheque to mr pabsby the sending it would do infinite harm and cause dissensions in the borough which might require a considerable expenditure to set right as to the other clerical demands it seemed to sir thomas that mr trigger was of opinion that they should all be gratified he had in fact sent his money to the only person in percycross who ought not to have received money the £50 for the old women was a matter of course and would not be begrudged as it was the only payment which was absolutely annual in regard to the schools sir thomas could do what he pleased but the sitting members had always been liberal to the schools schools were things to which sitting members were no doubt expected to subscribe as to the question of french boots mr trigger thought that there was something in it and said that if sir thomas could devote his christmas holidays to getting up the subject in lille and amiens it would have a good effect in the borough and show that he was in earnest this might be the more desirable as there was no knowing as yet what might be done about the petition there no doubt was a strong feeling in the borough as to the cobden treaty and sir thomas would probably feel it to be his duty to get the question up in regard to the mustard mr trigger suggested that though there was probably nothing in it it might be as well to ask the secretary at war a question or two on the subject mr spicer was no doubt a moving man in percycross sir thomas could at any rate promise that he would ask such questions as mr spicer certainly had friends who might be conducive to the withdrawal of the petition sir thomas could at any rate put himself into correspondence with the war office mr trigger also thought that sir thomas might judiciously study the subject of italian rags in reference to the great paper trade of the country no doubt the manufacture of paper was a growing business at percycross mr trigger returned all the applications and ended his letter by hinting that the cheques might as well be sent at once mr trigger thought that a little money about the borough would do good at the present moment  it need hardly be said that this view of things was not pleasant to the sitting member who was still confined to his house at fulham by an arm broken in the cause sir thomas had at once sent the £50 towards the christmas festivities for the poor of the borough and had declared his purpose of considering the other matters then had come a further letter from mr trigger announcing his journey to london and mr trigger and sir thomas had their first meeting after the election immediately upon mr neefits departure from the chambers and is it to be asked stemm as soon as he had closed the door behind mr triggers back  is what to be  them petitions sir thomas petitions costs a deal of money they tell me sir thomas sir thomas winced i suppose you must go on now as your hand is in continued stemm  i dont know that at all said sir thomas  youll find as you must there aint no way out of itnot now as you are the sitting member  i am not going to ruin myself stemm for the sake of a seat in parliament  i dont know how that may be sir thomas i hope not sir thomas but i dont see how youre not to go on now sir thomas if it wasnt for petitions one wouldnt mind  there must be petitions of course and if there be good cause for them they should succeed  no doubt sir thomas they say the bribery at percycross was tremenjousbut i suppose it was on the other side  if it was on our side stemm it was not so with my knowledge i did all i could to prevent it i spoke against it whenever i opened my mouth i would not have given a shilling for a single vote though it would have got me the election  but they were not all that way sir thomaswas they  how can i tell noi know that they were not i fear they were not i cannot say that money was given but i fear it  you must go on now sir thomas any way said stemm with a groan that was not reassuring  i wish i had never heard the name of percycross said sir thomas  i dare say replied stemm  i went there determined to keep my hands clean  when one puts ones hand into other peoples business they wont come out clean said the judicious stemm but you must go on with it now any way sir thomas  i dont know what i shall do said the unhappy member  on the next morning there came another application from percycross the postmaster in that town had died suddenly and the competitors for the situation which was worth about £150 per annum were very numerous there was a certain mr oblather only known in percycross as cousin to one mrs givantake the wife of a liberal solicitor in the borough of mr oblather the worst that could be said was that at the age of forty he had no income on which to support himself mrs givantake was attached to her cousin and mr givantake had become sensible of a burden that the vacant office was just the thing for him appeared at a glance to all his friends mrs givantake in her energy on the subject expressed an opinion that the whole cabinet should be impeached if the just claims of mr oblather were not conceded but it was felt that the justice of the claims would not prevail without personal interest the liberal party was in power and application hot and instant was made to mr westmacott mr westmacott was happy enough to have his answer ready the treasury had nothing to do with the matter it was a post office concern and he simply as the late liberal member and last liberal candidate for the borough was not entitled to intrude even in a matter of patronage upon the postmastergeneral with whom he was not acquainted but mr westmacott was malicious as well as secure he added a postscript to his letter in which he said that he believed the present sitting member sir thomas underwood was intimately acquainted with the noble lord who presided at the post office there were various interests at percycross moved brought together weighed against each other and balanced to a grain and finally dovetailed if sir thomas underwood would prevail on lord  to appoint mr oblather to the vacant office then all the givantake influence at percycross should be used towards the withdrawal of the petition such was the communication now made to sir thomas by a gentleman who signed his name as peter piper and who professed himself authorised to act on behalf of mr givantake sir thomass answer was as follows      southampton buildings december 31 186     sir     i can have nothing to do with mr oblather and the    postoffice at percycross     i am    your obedient servant     thomas underwood     mr peter piper postoffice percycross   christmas had passedand had passed uncomfortably enough at popham villa in which retreat neither of the three young ladies was at present very happywhen sir thomas was invited by mr trigger to take further steps with reference to the petitions it was thought necessary that there should be a meeting in the conservative interest and it was suggested that this meeting should take place in sir thomass chambers mr trigger in making the proposition seemed to imply that a great favour was thereby conferred on sir thomasas that country is supposed to be most honoured which is selected as the meetingground for plenipotentiaries when some important international point requires to be settled sir thomas could not see the arrangement in that light and would have shuffled out of the honour had it been possible but it was not possible at this period of the year mr griffenbottom had no house in town and mr trigger explained that it was inexpedient that such meetings should take place at hotels there was no place so fitting as a lawyers chambers sir thomas who regarded as a desecration the entrance of one such man as mr trigger into his private room and who was particularly anxious not to fall into any intimacy with mr griffenbottom was driven to consent and at one oclock on the 29th stemm was forced to admit the deputation the deputation from percycross consisted of mr trigger mr spicer and mr pile but with them came also the senior sitting member at first they were all very grave and sir thomas asked them indiscreetly whether they would take a glass of sherry pile and spicer immediately acceded to this proposition and sherry was perhaps efficacious in bringing about speedy conversation  well underwood said mr griffenbottom it seems that after all we are to have these d petitions sir thomas lifted his left foot on his right knee and nursed his legbut said nothing on one point he was resolvednothing on earth should induce him to call his colleague griffenbottom  no doubt about that mr griffenbottom said mr pile that is unless we can make westmacott right tother chap wouldnt be of much account  mr pile youre going a little too fast said trigger  no i aint said mr pile but for the moment he allowed himself to be silenced  we dont like the looks of it at percycross said mr spicer  and why dont we like the looks of it asked sir thomas  i dont know what your idea of pleasure is said mr griffenbottom but i dont take delight in spending money for nothing i have spent enough i can tell you and i dont mean to spend much more my seat was as safe as the church  but they have petitioned against that as well as mine said sir thomas  yesthey have and now whats to be done  i dont know whether sir thomas is willing to take the whole cost of the defence upon himself said mr trigger pouring out for himself a second glass of sherry  no i am not said sir thomas whereupon there was a pause during which pile and spicer also took second glasses of sherry why should i pay the cost of defending mr griffenbottoms seat  why should i pay it said griffenbottom my seat was safe enough the fact is if money was paidas to which i know nothingit was paid to get the second seat everybody knows that why should any one have paid money for me i was safe i never have any difficulty everybody knows that i could come in for percycross twenty times running without buying a vote isnt that true trigger  i believe you could mr griffenbottom  of course i could look here underwood  i beg your pardon for one moment mr griffenbottom said sir thomas will you tell me mr trigger whether votes were bought on my behalf mr trigger smiled and put his head on one side but made no answer i wish i might be allowed to hear the truth continued sir thomas whereupon spicer grinned and mr pile looked as though he were about to be sick how was it that a set of gentlemen who generally knew their business so well as did the political leaders at percycross had got themselves into the same boat with a man silly enough to ask such a question as that  i shant spend money said griffenbottom its out of the question they cant touch me ive spent my money and got my article if others want the article they must spend theirs  mr trigger thought it might be as well to change the subject for a moment or at any rate to pass on to another clause of the same bill i was very sorry sir thomas said he that you wrote that letter to mr givantake  i wrote no letter to mr givantake a man named piper addressed me  well well well thats the same thing it was givantake though of course he isnt going to sign his name to everything if you could just have written a line to your friend the postmastergeneral i really think we could have squared it all  i wouldnt have made a request so improper for all percycross said sir thomas  patronage is open to everybody suggested mr griffenbottom  those sort of favours are asked every day said trigger  we live in a free country said spicer  givantake is a d scoundrel all the same said mr pile and as for his wifes irish cousin i should be very sorry to leave my letters in his hands  it wouldnt have come off mr pile said trigger but the request might have been made if sir thomas will allow me to say as much the request ought to have been made  i will allow nothing of the kind mr trigger said sir thomas with an assumption of personal dignity which caused everyone in the room to alter his position in his chair i understand these things are given by merit mr trigger smiled and mr griffenbottom laughed outright at any rate they ought to be and in this office i believe they are mr griffenbottom who had had the bestowal of some local patronage laughed again  the thing is over now at any rate said mr trigger  i saw givantake yesterday said spicer he wont stir a finger now  he never would have stirred a finger said mr pile and if hed stirred both his fistesses he wouldnt have done a haporth of good givantake indeed he be blowed there was a species of honesty about mr pile which almost endeared him to sir thomas  something must be settled said trigger  i thought youd got a proposition to make said spicer  well sir thomas began mr trigger as it were girding his loins for the task before him we think that your seat wouldnt stand the brunt weve been putting two and two together and thats what we think a very black cloud came over the brow of sir thomas underwood but at the moment he said nothing of course it can be defended if you choose to fight the battle you can defend it it will cost about £1500or perhaps a little more that is the two sides for both will have to be paid mr trigger paused again but still sir thomas said not a word mr griffenbottom thinks that he should not be asked to take any part of this cost  not a shilling said mr griffenbottom  well continued mr trigger that being the case of course we have got to see what will be our best plan of action i suppose sir thomas you are not altogether indifferent about the money  by no means said sir thomas  i dont know who is money is money all the world over  you may say that put in mr spicer  just let me go on for a moment mr spicer till i make this thing clear to sir thomas thats how we stand at present it will cost usthat is to say youabout £1500 and we should do no good i really dont think we should do any good here are these judges and you know that new brooms sweep clean i suppose we may allow that there was a little money spent somewhere they do say now that a glass of beer would lose a seat  sir thomas could not but remember all that he had said to prevent there being even a glass of beer and the way in which he had been treated by all the party in that matter because he had so endeavoured but it was useless to refer to all that at the present moment it seems to me he said that if one seat be vacated both must be vacated  it doesnt follow at all said mr griffenbottom  allow me just for a moment longer continued trigger who rose from his seat as he came to the real gist of his speech a proposition has been made to us sir thomas and i am able to say that it is one which may be trusted of course our chief anxiety is for the party you feel that sir thomas of course sir thomas would not condescend to make any reply to this now the liberals will be content with one seat if we go on it will lead to disfranchising the borough and we none of us want that it would be no satisfaction to you sir thomas to be the means of robbing the borough of its privilege after all that the borough has done for you  go on mr trigger said sir thomas  the liberals only want one seat if youll undertake to accept the hundreds the petition will be withdrawn and mr westmacott will come forward again in that case we shouldnt oppose now sir thomas you know what the borough thinks will be the best course for all of us to pursue  sir thomas did know we may say that he had known for some minutes past he had perceived what was coming and various recollections had floated across his mind he especially remembered that £50 for the poor old women which mr trigger only a week since had recommended that he should giveand he remembered also that he had given it he recollected the sum which he had already paid for his election expenses as to which mr trigger had been very careful to get the money before this new proposition was made he remembered mr pabsby and his cheque for £20 he remembered his broken arm and that fortnight of labour and infinite vexation in the borough he remembered all his hopes and his girls triumph but he remembered also that he had told himself a dozen times since his return that he wished that he might rid himself altogether of percycross and the seat in parliament now a proposition that would have this effect was made to him  well sir thomas what do you think of it asked mr trigger  sir thomas required the passing of a few moments that he might think of it and yet there was a feeling strong at his heart telling him that it behoved him not even to seem to doubt he was a man not deficient in spirit when roused as he now was roused he knew that he was being ill used from the first moment of his entering percycross he had felt that the place was not fit for him that it required a method of canvassing of which he was not only ignorant but desirous to remain ignorantthat at percycross he would only be a catspaw in the hands of other men he knew that he could not safely get into the same boat with mr griffenbottom or trust himself to the steering of such a coxswain as mr trigger he had found that there could be no sympathy between himself and any one of those who constituted his own party in the borough and yet he had persevered he had persevered because in such matters it is so difficult to choose the moment in which to recede he had perseveredand had attained a measure of success as far as had been possible for him to do so he had fought his battle with clean hands and now he was member of parliament for percycross let what end there might come to this petitioneven though his seat should be taken from himhe could be subjected to no personal disgrace he could himself give evidence the truth of which no judge in the land would doubt as to the purity of his own intentions and as to the struggle to be pure which he had made and now they asked him to give way in order that mr griffenbottom might keep his seat  he felt that he and poor moggs had been fools together at this moment there came upon him a reflection that such men as he and moggs were unable to open their mouths in such a borough as percycross without having their teeth picked out of their jaws he remembered well poor moggss legend moggs purity and the rights of labour and he remembered thinking at the time that neither moggs nor he should have come to percycross and now he was told of all that the borough had done for him and was requested to show his gratitude by giving up his seatin order that griffenbottom might still be a member of parliament and that percycross might not be disfranchised did he feel any gratitude to percycross or any love to mr griffenbottom in his heart he desired that mr griffenbottom might be made to retire into private life and he knew that it would be well that the borough should be disfranchised  these horrid men that sat around himhow he hated them he could get rid of them now now and for ever by acceding to the proposition made to him and he thought that in doing so he could speak a few words which would be very agreeable to him in the speaking and then all that mr trigger had said about the £1500 had been doubtless true if he defended his seat money must be spent and he did not know how far he might be able to compel mr griffenbottom to share the expense he was not so rich but what he was bound to think of the money for his childrens sake and he did believe mr trigger when mr trigger told him that the seat could not be saved  yet he could not bring himself to let these men have their way with him to have to confess that he had been their tool went so much against the grain with him that anything seemed to him to be preferable to that the passage across his brain of all these thoughts had not required many seconds and his guests seemed to acknowledge by their silence that some little space of time should be allowed to him mr pile was leaning forward on his stick with his eyes fixed upon sir thomass face mr spicer was amusing himself with a third glass of sherry mr griffenbottom had assumed a look of absolute indifference and was sitting with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling mr trigger with a pleasant smile on his face was leaning back in his chair with his hands in his trousers pockets he had done his disagreeable job of work and upon the whole he thought that he had done it well  i shall do nothing of the kind said sir thomas at last  youll be wrong sir thomas said mr trigger  youll disfranchise the borough said mr spicer  youll not be able to keep your seat said mr trigger  and therell be all the money to pay said mr spicer  sir thomas dont mind that said mr griffenbottom  as for paying the money i do mind it very much said sir thomas as for disfranchising the borough i cannot say that i regard it in the least as to your seat mr griffenbottom  my seat is quite safe said the senior member  as to your seat which i am well aware must be jeopardised if mine be in jeopardy it would have been matter of more regret to me had i experienced from you any similar sympathy for myself as it is it seems that each of us is to do the best he can for himself and i shall do the best i can for myself good morning  what then do you mean to do said mr trigger  on that matter i shall prefer to converse with my friends  you mean said mr trigger that you will put it into other hands  you have made a proposition to me mr trigger and i have given you my answer i have nothing else to say what steps i may take i do not even know at present  you will let us hear from you said mr trigger  i cannot say that i will  this comes of bringing a gentleman learned in the law down into the borough said mr griffenbottom  gentlemen i must ask you to leave me said sir thomas rising from his chair and ringing the bell  look here sir thomas underwood said mr griffenbottom this to me is a very important matter  and to me also said sir thomas  i do not know anything about that like a good many others you may like to have a seat in parliament and may like to get it without any trouble and without any money i have sat for percycross for many years and have spent a treasure and have worked myself off my legs i dont know that i care much for anything except for keeping my place in the house the house is everything to memeat and drink employment and recreation and i can tell you im not going to lose my seat if i can help it you came in for the second chance sir thomas and a very good second chance it was if youd just have allowed others who knew what they were about to manage matters for you that chance is over now and according to all rules that ever i heard of in such matters you ought to surrender isnt that so mr trigger  certainly mr griffenbottom according to my ideas said mr trigger  thats about it said mr spicer  sir thomas was still standing indeed they were all standing now mr griffenbottom he said i have nothing further that i can say at the present moment to the offer made to me by mr trigger i at present positively decline to accede i look upon that offer as unfriendly and can therefore only wish you a good morning  unfriendly said mr griffenbottom with a sneer  goodbye sir thomas said mr pile putting out his hand sir thomas shook hands with mr pile cordially its my opinion that hes right said mr pile i dont like his notions but i do like his pluck goodbye sir thomas then mr pile led the way out of the room and the others followed him  oh said stemm as soon as he had shut the door behind their backs thats a deputation from percycross is it sir thomas you were saying as how you didnt quite approve of the percycrossians to this however sir thomas vouchsafed no reply     chapter xl  what sir thomas thought about it   sir thomas underwood had been engaged upon a very great piece of work ever since he had been called to the bar in the twentyfifth year of his life he had then devoted himself to the writing of a life of lord verulam and had been at it ever since but as yet he had not written a word in early life that is up to his fortieth year he had talked freely enough about his opus magnum to those of his compeers with whom he had been intimate but of late bacons name had never been on his lips patience at home was aware of the name and nature of her fathers occupation but clarissa had not yet learned to know that he who had been the great philosopher and little lord chancellor was not to be lightly mentioned to stemm the matter had become so serious that in speaking of books papers and documents he would have recourse to any periphrasis rather than mention in his masters hearing the name of the fallen angel and yet sir thomas was always talking to himself about sir francis bacon and was always writing his life  there are men who never dream of great work who never realise to themselves the need of work so great as to demand a lifetime but who themselves never fail in accomplishing those secondclass tasks with which they satisfy their own energies men these are who to the world are very useful some few there are who seeing the beauty of a great work and believing in its accomplishment within the years allotted to man are contented to struggle for success and struggling fail here and there comes one who struggles and succeeds but the men are many who see the beauty who adopt the task who promise themselves the triumph and then never struggle at all the task is never abandoned but days go by and weeks and then months and yearsand nothing is done the dream of youth becomes the doubt of middle life and then the despair of age in building a summerhouse it is so easy to plant the first stick but one does not know where to touch the sod when one begins to erect a castle so it had been with sir thomas underwood and his life of bacon it would not suffice to him to scrape together a few facts to indulge in some fiction to tell a few anecdotes and then to call his book a biography here was a man who had risen higher and was reported to have fallen lowerperhaps than any other son of adam with the finest intellect ever given to a man with the purest philanthropy and the most enduring energy he had become a byword for greed and injustice sir thomas had resolved that he would tell the tale as it had never yet been told that he would unravel facts that had never seen the light that he would let the world know of what nature really had been this manand that he would write a book that should live he had never abandoned his purpose and now at sixty years of age his purpose remained with him but not one line of his book was written  and yet the task had divorced him in a measure from the world he had not been an unsuccessful man in life he had made money and had risen nearly to the top of his profession he had been in parliament and was even now a member but yet he had been divorced from the world and bacon had done it by bacon he had justified to himselfor rather had failed to justify to himselfa seclusion from his family and from the world which had been intended for strenuous work but had been devoted to dilettante idleness and he had fallen into those mistakes which such habits and such pursuits are sure to engender he thought much but he thought nothing out and was consequently at sixty still in doubt about almost everything whether christ did or did not die to save sinners was a question with him so painfully obscure that he had been driven to obtain what comfort he might from not thinking of it the assurance of belief certainly was not his to enjoynor yet that absence from fear which may come from assured unbelief and yet none who knew him could say that he was a bad man he robbed no one he never lied he was not selfindulgent he was affectionate but he had spent his life in an intention to write the life of lord verulam and not having done it had missed the comfort of selfrespect he had intended to settle for himself a belief on subjects which are of all to all men the most important and having still postponed the work of inquiry had never attained the security of a faith he was for ever doubting for ever intending and for ever despising himself for his doubts and unaccomplished intentions now at the age of sixty he had thought to lessen these inward disturbances by returning to public life and his most unsatisfactory alliance with mr griffenbottom had been the result  they who know the agonies of an ambitious indolent doubting selfaccusing manof a man who has a skeleton in his cupboard as to which he can ask for sympathy from no onewill understand what feelings were at work within the bosom of sir thomas when his percycross friends left him alone in his chamber the moment that he knew that he was alone he turned the lock of the door and took from out a standing desk a whole heap of loose papers these were the latest of his notes on the great bacon subject for though no line of the book had ever been writtennor had his work even yet taken such form as to enable him to write a linenevertheless he always had by him a large assemblage of documents notes queries extracts innumerable and references which in the course of years had become almost unintelligible to himself upon which from time to time he would set himself to work whenever he was most wretched he would fly at his papers when the qualms of his conscience became very severe he would copy some passage from a dusty book hardly in the belief that it might prove to be useful but with half a hope that he might cheat himself into so believing now in his misery he declared that he would bind himself to his work and never leave it there if anywhere might consolation be found  with rapid hands he moved about the papers and tried to fix his eyes upon the words but how was he to fix his thoughts he could not even begin not to think of those scoundrels who had so misused him it was not a week since they had taken £50 from him for the poor of percycross and now they came to him with a simple statement that he was absolutely to be thrown over he had already paid £900 for his election and was well aware that the account was not closed and he was a man who could not bear to speak about money or to make any complaint as to money even though he was being so abominably misused still he must pay any further claim that might be made on him in respect of the election that was past yeshe must pay for those very purchased votes for that bribery as to which he had so loudly expressed his abhorrence and by reason of which he was now to lose his seat with ignominy  but the money was not the worst of it there was a heavier sorrow than that arising from the loss of his money he alone had been just throughout the contest at percycross he alone had been truthful and he alone straightforward and yet he alone must suffer he began to believe that griffenbottom would keep his seat that he would certainly lose his own he was quite convinced he might lose it by undergoing an adverse petition and paying ever so much more moneyor he might lose it in the manner that mr trigger had so kindly suggested in either way there would be disgrace and contumely and hours of the agony of selfreproach in store for him  what excuse had he for placing himself in contact with such filth of what childishness had he not been the victim when he allowed himself to dream that he a pure and scrupulous man could go among such impurity as he had found at percycross and come out still clean and yet triumphant then he thought of griffenbottom as a member of parliament and of that legislation and that constitution to which griffenbottoms were thought to be essentially necessary that there are always many such men in the house he had always known he had sat there and had seen them he had stood shoulder to shoulder with them through many a division and had thought about themacknowledging their use but now that he was brought into personal contact with such an one his very soul was aghast the griffenbottoms never do anything in politics they are men of whom in the lump it may be surmised that they take up this or that side in politics not from any instructed conviction not from faith in measures or even in men nor from adherence either through reason or prejudice to this or that set of political theoriesbut simply because on this side or on that there is an opening that gradually they do grow into some shape of conviction from the moulds in which they are made to live must be believed of them but these convictions are convictions as to divisions convictions as to patronage convictions as to success convictions as to parliamentary management but not convictions as to the political needs of the people so said sir thomas to himself as he sat thinking of the griffenbottoms in former days he had told himself that a pudding cannot be made without suet or dough and that griffenbottoms were necessary if only for the due adherence of the plums whatever most healthbestowing drug the patient may take would bestow anything but health were it taken undiluted it was thus in former days sir thomas had apologised to himself for the griffenbottoms in the housebut no such apology satisfied him now this log of a man this lump of suet this diluting quantity of most impure watertwas thus that mr griffenbottom was spoken of by sir thomas to himself as he sat there with all the bacon documents before himthis politician whose only real political feeling consisted in a positive love of corruption for itself had not only absolutely got the better of him who regarded himself at any rate as a man of mind and thought but had used him as a puppet and had compelled him to do dirty work ohthat he should have been so lost to his own selfrespect as to have allowed himself to be dragged through the dirt of percycross  but he must do somethinghe must take some step mr griffenbottom had declared that he would put himself to no expense in defending the seat of course he sir thomas could do the same he believed that it might be practicable for him to acknowledge the justice of the petition to declare his belief that his own agents had betrayed him and to acknowledge that his seat was indefensible but as he thought of it he found that he was actually ignorant of the law in the matter that he would make no such bargain as that suggested to him by mr triggerof so much he thought that he was sure at any rate he would do nothing that he himself knew to be dishonourable he must consult his own attorney that was the end of his selfdeliberationthat and a conviction that under no circumstances could he retain his seat  then he struggled hard for an hour to keep his mind fixed on the subject of his great work he had found an unknown memoir respecting bacon written by a german pen in the latin language published at leipzig shortly after the date of bacons fall he could translate that it is always easiest for the mind to work in such emergencies on some matter as to which no creative struggles are demanded from it     chapter xli  a broken heart   it was very bad with clarissa when ralph newton was closeted with mary at popham villa she had suspected what was about to take place when sir thomas and ralph went together into the room but at that moment she said nothing she endeavoured to seem to be cheerful and attempted to joke with mary the three girls were sitting at the table on which lunch was spreada meal which no one was destined to eat at popham villa on that dayand thus they remained till sir thomas joined them mary he had said ralph newton wishes to speak to you you had better go to him  to me uncle  yes to you you had better go to him  but i had rather not  of course you must do as you please but i would advise you to go to him then she had risen very slowly and had gone  all of them had understood what it meant to clarissa the thing was as certain as though she already heard the words spoken with patience even there was no doubt sir thomas though he had told nothing did not pretend that the truth was to be hidden he looked at his younger daughter sorrowfully and laid his hand upon her head caressingly with her there was no longer the possibility of retaining any secret hardly the remembrance that there was a secret to retain oh papa she saidoh papa and burst into tears  my dear he said believe me that it is best that it should be so he is unworthy patience said not a word but was now holding clarissa close to her bosom tell mary continued sir thomas that i will see her when she is at liberty patience you can ask ralph whether it will suit him to stay for dinner i am tired and will go upstairs myself and so the two girls were left together  patty take me away said clarissa i must never see him againnevernor her  she will not accept him clary  yes she will i know she will she is a sly artful creature and i have been so good to her  no claryi think notbut what does it matter he is unworthy he can be nothing to you now papa was right he is unworthy  i care nothing for that i only care for him oh patty take me away i could not bear to see them when they come out  then patience took her sister up to their joint room and laid the poor sufferer on the bed and throwing herself on her knees beside the bed wept over her sister and caressed her that argument of ralphs unworthiness was nothing to clarissa she did not consider herself to be so worthy but what she might forgive any sin if only the chance of forgiving such sin were given to her at this moment in her heart of hearts her anger was more against her rival than against the man she had not yet taught herself to think of all his baseness to herhad only as yet had time to think that that evil had come upon her which she had feared from the first moment of her cousins arrival  presently patience heard the door opened of the room downstairs and heard marys slow step as she crossed the hall she understood well that some one should be below and with another single word of affection to her sister she went downstairs well mary she said looking into her cousins face  there is nothing particular to tell said mary with a gentle smile  of course we all knew what he wanted  then of course you all knew what i should say to him  i knew said patience  i am sure that clary knew said mary but he is all alone there and will not know what to do with himself wont you go to him  you will go up to clary mary nodded her head and then patience crossed the hall to liberate the rejected suitor mary stood for awhile thinking she already knew from what patience had said that clarissa had suspected her and she felt that there should have been no such suspicion clarissa had not understood but ought to have understood for a moment she was angry and was disposed to go to her own room then she remembered all her cousins misery and crept upstairs to the door she had come so softly that though the door was hardly closed nothing had been heard of her approach may i come in dear she said very gently  well mary tell me all said clarissa  there is nothing to tell claryonly this that i fear mr newton is not worthy of your love  he asked you to take him  never mind dearest we will not talk of that dear dearest clary if i only could make you happy  but you have refused him  dont you know me better than to ask me dont you know where my heart is we will carry our burdens together dearest and then they will be lighter  but he will come to you againthat other one  clary dear we will not think about it there are things which should not be thought of we will not talk of it but we will love each other so dearly clarissa now that she was assured that her evil fortune was not to be aggravated by any injury done to her by her cousin allowed herself to be tranquillised if not comforted there was indeed something in her position that did not admit of comfort all the family knew the story of her unrequited love and treated her with a compassion which while its tenderness was pleasant to her was still in itself an injury a vain attachment in a womans heart must ever be a weary load because she can take no step of her own towards that consummation by which the burden may be converted into a joy a man may be active may press his suit even a tenth time may do something towards achieving success a woman can only be still and endure but clarissa had so managed her affairs that even that privilege of being still was hardly left to her her trouble was known to them all she doubted whether even the servants in the house did not know the cause of her woe how all this had come to pass she could not now remember she had told patienceas though in compliance with some compact that each should ever tell the other all things and then circumstances had arisen which made it so natural that she should be open and candid with mary the two ralphs were to be their two lovers that to her had been a delightful dream during the last few months he whose inheritance at that moment was supposed to have been gone had as clarissa thought in plainest language told his love to her dear dear clary you know i love you the words to her sense had been so allimportant had meant so much had seemed to be so final that they hardly wanted further corroboration then indeed had come the great faultthe fault which she had doubted whether she could ever pardon and she because of the heinousness of that offence had been unable to answer the question that had been asked but the offence such as it was had not lightened the solemnity of her assurance as far as love went that ralph ought to be her own after the speaking of such words as he had spoken there were those troubles about money but yet she was entitled to regard him as her own then had come the written offer from the other ralph to marythe offer written in the moment of his believed prosperity and it had been so natural that clarissa should tell her cousin that as regarded the splendour of position there should be no jealousy between them clarissa did not herself think much of a lover who wrote letters instead of coming and speakinghad perhaps an idea that open speech even though offence might follow was better than formal letters but all that was marys affair this very respectful ralph was marys lover and if mary were satisfied she would not quarrel with the wellbehaved young man she would not even quarrel with him because he was taking from her own ralph the inheritance which for so many years had been believed to be his own thus in the plenitude of her affection and in the serenity of her heart she had told everything to her cousin and now also her father knew it all how this had come to pass she did not think to inquire she suspected no harm from patience the thing had been so clear that all the world might see it ralph that false one knew it also who could know it so well as he did had not those very words been spoken by himbeen repeated by him now she was as one stricken where wounds could not be hidden  on that day ralph was driven back to town in his cab in a rather disheartened condition and no more was seen or heard of him for the present at popham villa his late guardian had behaved very ill to him in telling mary bonner the story of polly neefit that was his impressionfeeling sure that mary had alluded to the unfortunate affair with the breechesmakers daughter of which she could have heard tidings only from sir thomas as to clarissa he had not exactly forgotten the little affair on the lawn but to his eyes that affair had been so small as to be almost overlooked amidst larger matters mary he thought had never looked so beautiful as she had done while refusing him he did not mean to give her up her heart she had told him was not her own he thought he had read of young ladies in similar conditions of young ladies who had bestowed their hearts and had afterwards got them back again for the sake of making second bestowals he was not sure but that such an object would lend a zest to life there was his brother gregory in love with clarissa and still true to her he would be true to mary and would see whether in spite of that faraway lover he might not be more successful than his brother at any rate he would not give her upand before he had gone to bed that night he had already concocted a letter to her in his brain explaining the whole of that neefit affair and asking her whether a man should be condemned to misery for life because he had been led by misfortune into such a mistake as that he dined very well at his club and on the following morning went down to the moonbeam by an early train for that days hunting thence he returned to newton priory in time for christmas and as he was driven up to his own house through his own park meeting one or two of his own tenants and encountering now and then his own obsequious labourers he was not an unhappy man in spite of mary bonners cruel answer it may be doubted whether his greatest trouble at this moment did not arise from his dread of neefit he had managed to stay long enough in london to give orders that neefits money should be immediately paid he knew that neefit could not harm him at law but it would not be agreeable if the old man were to go about the country telling everyone that he ralph newton of newton had twice offered to marry polly for the present we will leave him although he is our hero and will return to the girls at popham villa  it is all very well talking patience but i dont mean to try to change clarissa said this was after that visit of the percycross deputation to sir thomas and after christmas more than a week had now passed by since ralph had rushed down to fulham with his offer and the new year had commenced sir thomas had been at home for christmasfor the one dayand had then returned to london he had seen his attorney respecting the petition who was again to see mr griffenbottoms london attorney and mr trigger in the meantime sir thomas was to remain quiet for a few days the petition was not to be tried till the end of february and there was still time for deliberation sir thomas just now very often took out that great heap of baconian papers but still not a word of the biography was written he was alas still very far from writing the first word it is all very well patience but i do not mean to try to change said clarissa  poor patience could make no answer dreadful as was to her such an assertion from a young woman there is a man who clearly does not want to marry you who has declared in the plainest way that he does want to marry some one else who has grossly deceived you and who never means to think of you again and yet you say that you will wilfully adhere to your regard for him such would have been the speech which patience would have made had she openly expressed her thoughts but clarissa was ill and weak and wretched and patience could not bring herself to say a word that should distress her sister  if he came to me tomorrow of course i should forgive him clarissa said again these conversations were never commenced by patience who would rather have omitted any mention of that base young man of course i should men do do those things men are not like women they do all manner of things and everybody forgives them i dont say anything about hoping i dont hope for anything i am not happy enough to hope i shouldnt care if i knew i were going to die tomorrow but there can be no change if you want me to be a hypocrite patience i will but what will be the use the truth will be the same  the two girls let her have her way never contradicted her coaxed her and tried to comfort herbut it was in vain at first she would not go out of the house not even to church and then she took to lying in bed this lasted into the middle of january and still sir thomas did not come home he wrote frequently short notes to patience sending money making excuses making promises always expressing some word of hatred or disgust as to percycross but still he did not come at last when clarissa declared that she preferred lying in bed to getting up patience went up to london and fetched her father home it had gone so far with sir thomas now that he was unable even to attempt to defend himself he humbly said that he was sorry that he had been away so long and returned with patience to the villa  my dear said sir thomas seating himself by clarissas bedside this is very bad  if i had known you were coming papa i would have got up  if you are not well perhaps you are better here dear  i dont think i am quite well papa  what is it my love clarissa looked at him out of her large tearladen eyes but said nothing patience says that you are not happy  i dont know that anybody is happy papa  i wish that you were with all my heart my child can your father do anything that will make you happy  no papa  tell me clary you do not mind my asking you questions  no papa  patience tells me that you are still thinking of ralph newton  of course i think of him  i think of him toobut there are different ways of thinking we have known him all of us a long time  yes papa  i wish with all my heart that we had never seen him he is not worthy of our solicitude  you always liked him i have heard you say you loved him dearly  i have said so and i did love him in a certain way i love him still  so do i papa  but i know him to be unworthy even if he had come here to offer you his hand i doubt whether i could have permitted an engagement do you know that within the last two months he has twice offered to marry another young woman and i doubt whether he is not at this moment engaged to her  another said poor clarissa  yes and that without a pretence of affection on his part simply because he wanted to get money from her father  are you sure papa asked clarissa who was not prepared to believe and did not believe this enormity on the part of the man she loved  i am quite sure the father came to me to complain of him and i had the confession from ralphs own lips the very day that he came here with his insulting offer to mary bonner  did you tell mary  no i knew that it was unnecessary there was no danger as to mary and who do you think this girl was the daughter of a tailor who had made some money it was not that he cared for her claryno more than i do whether he meant to marry her or not i do not know  im sure he didnt papa said clarissa getting up in bed  and will that make it better all that he wanted was the tradesmans money and to get that he was willing either to deceive the girl or to sell himself to her i dont know which would have been the baser mode of traffic is that the conduct of a gentleman clary  poor clarissa was in terrible trouble she hardly believed the story which seemed to tell her of a degree of villany greater than ever her imagination had depicted to herand yet if it were true she would be driven to look for means of excusing it the story as told was indeed hardly just to ralph who in the course of his transactions with mr neefit had almost taught himself to believe that he could love polly very well but it was not in this direction that clarissa looked for an apology for such conduct they say that men do all manner of things she said at last  i can only tell you this said sir thomas very gravely what men may do i will not say but no gentleman can ever have acted after this fashion he has shown himself to be a scoundrel  papa papa dont say that screamed clarissa  my child i can only tell you the truth i know it is hard to bear i would save you if i could but it is better that you should know  will he always be bad papa  who can say my dear god forbid that i should be too severe upon him but he has been so bad now that i am bound to tell you that you should drive him from your thoughts when he told me all smiling that he had come down here to ask your cousin mary to be his wife i was almost minded to spurn him from the door he can have no feeling himself of true attachment and cannot know what it means in others he is heartlessand unprincipled  oh papa spare him it is done now  and you will forget him dearest  i will try papa but i think that i shall die i would rather die what is the good of living when nobody is to care for anybody and people are so bad as that  my clarissa must not say that nobody cares for her has any person ever been false to you but he is not your sister true to you  yes papa  and mary  yes papa he was afraid to ask her whether he also had not been true to her even in that moment there arose in his mind a doubt whether all this evil might not have been avoided had he contented himself to live beneath the same roof with his children he said nothing of himself but she supplied the want i know you love me papa and have always been good to me i did not mean that but i never cared for any one but himin that way  sir thomas in dealing with the character of his late ward had been somewhat too severe it is difficult perhaps to say what amount of misconduct does constitute a scoundrel or justifies the critic in saying that this or that man is not a gentleman there be those who affirm that he who owes a debt for goods which he cannot pay is no gentleman and tradesmen when they cannot get their money are no doubt sometimes inclined to hold that opinion but the opinion is changed when the money comes at lastespecially if it comes with interest ralph had never owed a shilling which he did not intend to pay and had not property to cover that borrowing of money from mr neefit was doubtless bad no one would like to know that his son had borrowed money from his tailor but it is the borrowing of the money that is bad rather than the special dealing with the tradesman and as to that affair with polly some excuse may be made he had meant to be honest to neefit and he had meant to be true to neefits daughter even sir thomas highminded as he was would hardly have passed so severe a sentence had not the great sufferer in the matter been his own daughter  but the words that he spoke were doubtless salutary to poor clarissa she never again said to patience that she would not try to make a change nor did she ever again declare that if ralph came back again she would forgive him on the day after the scene with her father she was up again and she made an effort to employ herself about the house on the next sunday she went to church and then they all knew that she was making the necessary struggle ralphs name was never mentioned nor for a time was any allusion made to the family of the newtons the worst of it i think is over said patience one day to mary  the worst of it is over said mary but it is not all over it is hard to forget when one has loved     chapter xlii  not brokenhearted   christmas had come and gone at newton priory and the late squires son had left the placeprotesting as he did so that he left it for ever to him also life in that particular spot of earth was impossible unless he could live there as the lord and master of all everybody throughout that and neighbouring parishes treated him not only with kindness but with the warmest affection the gentry the farmers and the labourers all men who had known him in the huntingfield in markets on the bench or at church men women and children joined together in forming plans by means of which he could remain at newton the young squire asked him to make the house his home at any rate for the hunting season the parson offered half the parsonage his friend morris who was a bachelor suggested a joint home and joint stables between them but it was all of no avail had it not been for the success which had so nearly crowned the late squires efforts during the last six months it might have been that his friends would have prevailed with him but he had been too near being the master to be able to live at newton in any other capacity the tenants had been told that they were to be his tenants the servants had been told that they were to be his servants during a few short weeks he had almost been master so absolute had been the determination of the old squire to show to all around him that his son in spite of the blot upon the young mans birth was now the heir in all things and possessed of every privilege which would attach itself to an elder son he himself while his father lived had taken these things calmly had shown no elation had even striven to moderate the vehemence of his fathers efforts on his behalfbut not the less had he been conscious of the value of what was being done for him to be the promised future owner of the acres on which he had lived of the coverts through which he had ridden of every tree and bank which he had known from his boyhood had been to him a source of gratified pride not the less strong because he had concealed it the disappointment did hit him sorely his dreams had been of parliament of power in the county of pride of place and popularity he now found that they were to be no more than dreamsbut with this additional sorrow that all around him knew that they had been dreamed nohe could not stay at newton even for the sake of living with friends who loved him so dearly he said little or nothing of this to any one not even to gregory newton or to his friend morris did he tell much of his feeling he was not proud of his dreamings and it seemed to himself that his punishment was just nor could he speak to either of them or to any man of his past ambition or of what hopes might remain to him in reference to mary bonner the young squire had gone forth with the express purpose of wooing her had declared his purpose of doing so and had returned to newton at any rate without any ready tale of triumph on his tongue what had been his fortune the rival would not ask and while the two remained together at the priory no further word was spoken of mary bonner he ralph the dispossessed one while he believed himself to be the heir had intended to bring her home as a fitting queen to share his throne it might be that she would consent to be his without a throne to share but in thinking of her he could not but remember what his ambition had been and he could hardly bring himself now to offer to her that which was comparatively so little worth the having to suppose that she should already be fond of him should already long for him as he longed for her was contrary to his nature hitherto when he had been in her presence he had stood there as a man whose position in life was almost contemptible and though it would be unjust to him to say that he had hoped to win her by his acres still he had felt that his fathers success on his behalf might justify him in that which would otherwise be unjustifiable for the present however he could take no steps in that direction he could only suggest to himself what had already been her answer or what at some future time might be the answer she would make to his rival he had lost a father between whom and himself there had existed ties not only of tender love but of perfect friendship and for awhile he must bewail his loss that he could not bewail his lost father without thinking of his lost property and of the bride that had never been won was an agony to his soul  he had found a farm down in norfolk near to swaffham which he could take for twelve months with the option of purchase at the expiration of that time and thither he betook himself there were about four hundred acres and the place was within his means he did not think it likely that mary bonner would choose to come and live upon a norfolk farm and yet what other work in life was there for which he was fit early in january he went down to beamingham hall as the place was called and there we will leave him for the present consoling himself with oilcake and endeavouring to take a pride in a long row of stallfed cattle  at this time the two brothers were living at newton priory ralph the heir had bought some of his uncles horses and had commenced hunting with the hounds around him though he had not as yet withdrawn his stud from the moonbeam he was not altogether at his ease as he had before the end of february received three or four letters from neefit all of them dictated by waddle in which his conduct was painted not in the most flattering colours neefits money had been repaid but neefit would not understand that the young heirs obligations to him had by any means been acquitted by that very ordinary process he had risked his money when payment was very doubtful and now he intended to have something beyond cash in return for all that he had done there are debts of honour which a real gentleman feels himself more bound to pay than any bills waddle had written and to such dogmatic teachings as these neefit would always add something out of his own head there aint nobody who shant know all about it unless youre on the square again ralph had written one reply since he had been at newton in which he explained at some length that it was impossible that he should renew his addresses to a young lady who had twice rejected them and who had assured him that she did not love him he professed the greatest respect for miss neefit a respect which had if possible been heightened by her behaviour in this matterbut it must now be understood that the whole affair was at an end neefit would not understand this but neefits further letters which had not been unfrequent were left unanswered ralph had now told the whole story to his brother and had written his one reply from newton in conformity with his brothers advice after that they both thought that no further rejoinder could be of any service  the parsonage was for the time deserted gregory having for the present consented to share his brothers house in spite of that little thorn in the flesh which neefit was ralph was able to enjoy his life very thoroughly he went on with all the improvements about the place which the squire had commenced and was active in making acquaintance with every one who lived upon his land he was not without good instincts and understood thoroughly that respectability had many more attractions than a character for evil living he was too easily amenable to influence from those around him and under gregorys auspices was constant at his parish church he told himself at once that he had many duties to perform and he attempted to perform them he did not ask lieutenant cox or captain fooks to the priory and quite prepared himself for the character of henry v in miniature as he walked about his park and rode about his farms and talked with the wealthier farmers on hunting mornings he had a full conception of his own dignity and some not altogether inaccurate idea of the manner in which it would become him to sustain it he was perhaps a little too selfconscious and overinclined to suppose that people were regarding his conduct because he was newton of newtonnewton of newton with no blot on his shield by right of his birth and subject to no mans reproach  he had failed grievously in one matter on which he had set his heart but as to that he was as the reader knows resolved to try again he had declared his passion to the other ralph but his rival had not made the confidence mutual but hitherto he had said nothing on the subject to his brother he had put it by as it were out of his mind for awhile resolving that it should not trouble him immediately in the middle of his new joys it was a thing that would keepa thing at any rate that need not overshadow him night and morning when neefit continued to disturb him with threats of publicity in regard to pollys wrongs he did tell himself that in no way could he so effectually quiet mr neefit as by marrying somebody else and that he would at some very early date have recourse to this measure but in the meantime he would enjoy himself without letting his unrequited passion lie too heavily as a burden on his heart so he eat and drank and rode and prayed and sat with his brother magistrates on the bench and never ceased to think of his good fortune in that he had escaped from the troubles of his youth unscathed and undegraded  then there came a further letter from mr neefit from which there arose some increase of confidence among the brothers there was nothing special in this letter these letters indeed were very like to each other and as had now come to be observed were always received on a tuesday morning it was manifest to them that neefit spent the leisure hours of his sundays in meditating upon the hardness of his position and that as every monday morning came he caused a new letter to be written on this particular tuesday ralph had left home before the post had come and did not get the breechesmakers epistle till his return from hunting he chucked it across the table to gregory when he came down to dinner and the parson read it there was no new attack in it and as the servant was in the room nothing was then said about it but after dinner the subject was discussed  i wish i knew how to stop the fellows mouth said the elder brother  i think i should get carey to see him suggested gregory he would understand a lawyer when he was told that nothing could come of it but trouble to himself and his daughter  she has no hand in it you know  but it must injure her  one would think so but she is a girl whom nothing can injure you cant imagine how good and how great she isgreat in her way that is she is as steady as a rock and nobody who knows her will ever imagine her to be a party to her fathers folly she may pick and choose a husband any day she pleases and the men about her wont mind this kind of thing as we should no doubt all their friends joke him about it but no one will think of blaming polly  it cant do her any good said gregory  it cannot do her any harm she has a strength of her own that even her father cant lessen  all the same i wish there were an end of it  so do i for my own sake said ralph as he spoke he filled his glass and passed the bottle and then was silent for a few moments neefit did help me he continued and i dont want to speak against him but he is the most pigheaded old fool that ever existed nothing will stop him but pollys marriage or mine  i suppose you will marry soon now you ought to be married said gregory in a melancholy tone in which was told something of the disappointment of his own passion  wellyes i believe i might as well tell you a little secret greg  i suppose i can guess it said gregory with still a deeper sound of woe  i dont think you can it is quite possible you may however you know mary bonnerdont you  the cloud upon the parsons brow was at once lightened no said he i have heard of her of course  you have never seen mary bonner  i have not been up in town since she came what should take me up and if i were there i doubt whether i should go out to fulham what is the use of going but still though he spoke thus there was something less of melancholy in his voice than when he had first spoken ralph did not immediately go on with his story and his brother now asked a question but what of mary bonner is she to be the future mistress of the priory  god only knows  but you mean to ask her  i have asked her  and you are engaged  by no means i wish i were you havent seen her but i suppose you have heard of her  ralph spoke of herand told me that she was very lovely  upon my word i dont think that even in a picture i ever saw anything approaching to her beauty youve seen that thing at dresden she is more like that than anything i know she seems almost too grand for a fellow to speak to and yet she looks as if she didnt know it i dont think she does know it gregory said not a word but looked at his brother listening but by george theres a dignity about her a sort of selfpossession a kind of noli me tangere you understand which makes a man almost afraid to come near her she hasnt sixpence in the world  that neednt signify to you now  not in the least i only just mention it to explain and her father was nobody in particularsome old general who used to wear a cocked hat and keep the niggers down out in one of the colonies she herself talked of coming home here to be a governessby jove yes a governess well to look at her youd think she was born a countess in her own right  is she so proud  noits not that i dont know what it is its the way her head is put on upon my word to see her turn her neck is the grandest thing in the world i never saw anything like it i dont know that shes proud by naturethough she has got a dash of that too dont you know there are some horses show their breeding at a glance i dont suppose they feel it themselves but there it is on them like the hallmark on silver i dont know whether you can understand a man being proud of his wife  indeed i can  i dont mean of her personal qualities but of the outside get up some men are proud of their wives clothes or their jewels or their false hair with mary nothing of that sort could have any effect but to see her step or move her head or lift her arm is enough to make a man feelfeelfeel that she beats every other woman in the world by chalks  and she is to be mistress here  indeed she shouldtomorrow if shed come  you did ask her  yesi asked her  and what did she say  nothing that i cared to hear she had just been told all this accursed story about polly neefit ill never forgive sir thomasnever the reader will be pleased to remember that sir thomas did not mention miss neefits name or any of the circumstances of the neefit contract to his niece  he could hardly have wished to set her against you  i dont know but he must have told her she threw it in my teeth that i ought to marry polly  then she did not accept you  by george noanything but that she is one of those women who as i fancy never take a man at the first offer it isnt that they mean to shilly and shally and make a fuss but theres a sort of majesty about them which instinctively declines to yield itself unconsciously they feel something like offence at the suggestion that a man should think enough of himself to ask for such a possession they come to it after a time  and she will come to it after a time  i didnt mean to say that i dont intend however to give it up ralph paused in his story considering whether he would tell his brother what mary had confessed to him as to her affection for some one else but he resolved at last that he would say nothing of that he had himself put less of confidence in that assertion than he did in her rebuke with reference to the other young woman to whom she chose to consider that he owed himself it was his nature to think rather of what absolutely concerned himself than of what related simply to her i shant give her up thats all i can say he continued im not the sort of fellow to give things up readily it did occur to gregory at that moment that his brother had not shown much selfconfidence on that question of giving up the property im pretty constant when ive set my mind on a thing im not going to let any woman break my heart for me but i shall stick to it  he was not going to let any woman break his heart for him gregory as he heard this knew that his brother regarded him as a man whose heart was broken and he could not help asking himself whether or not it was good for a man that he should be able to suffer as he suffered because a woman was fair and yet not fair for him that his own heart was brokenbroken after the fashion of which his brother was speakinghe was driven to confess to himself it was not that he should die or that his existence would be one long continued hour of misery to him he could eat and drink and do his duty and enjoy his life and yet his heart was broken he could not piece it so that it should be fit for any other woman he could not teach himself not to long for that one woman who would not love him the romance of his life had formed itself there and there it must remain in all his solitary walks it was of her that he still thought of all the bright castles in the air which he still continued to build she was ever the mistress and yet he knew that she would never make him happy he had absolutely resolved that he would not torment her by another request but he gave himself no praise for his constancy looking on himself as being somewhat weak in that he could not overcome his longing when ralph declared that he would not break his heart but that nevertheless he would stick to the girl gregory envied him not doubting of his success and believing that it was to men of this calibre that success in love is generally given i hope with all my heart that you may win her he said  i must run my chance like another theres no veni vidi vici about it i can tell you nor is it likely that there should be with such a girl as mary bonner fill your glass old fellow we neednt sit mumchance because were thinking of our loves  i had thought began gregory very slowly  what did you think  i had thought once that you were thinking ofclarissa  what put that into your head  if you had i should never have said a word nor fancied any wrong of course shell marry some one and i dont know why i should ever wish that it should not be you  but what made you think of it  well i did it was just a word that patience said in one of her letters  what sort of word asked ralph with much interest  it was nothing you know i just misunderstood her when one is always thinking of a thing everything turns itself that way i got it into my head that she meant to hint to me that as you and clary were fond of each other i ought to forget it all i made up my mind that i wouldbut it is so much easier to make up ones mind than to do it there came a tear in each eye as he spoke and he turned his face towards the fire that his brother might not see them and there they remained hot and oppressive because he would not raise his hand to rub them away  i wonder what it was she said asked ralph  oh nothing dont you know how a fellow has fancies  there wasnt anything in it said ralph  ohof course not  patience might have imagined it said ralph thats just like such a sister as patience  shes the best woman that ever lived said gregory  as good as gold said ralph i dont think however i shall very soon forgive sir thomas  i dont mind saying now that i am glad it is so said gregory though as regards clary that seems to be cruel but i dont think i could have come much here had she become your wife  nothing shall ever separate us greg  i hope notbut i dont know whether i could have done it i almost think that i oughtnt to live where i should see her and i did fear it at one time  shell come to the parsonage yet old fellow if youll stick to her said ralph  never said gregory then that conversation was over     chapter xliii  once more   at the end of february ralph declared his purpose of returning to the moonbeam for the rest of the hunting season im not going to be such an ass he said to his brother as to keep two sets of horses going i bought my uncles because it seemed to suit just at the time and there are the others at horsballs because ive not had time to settle down yet ill go over for march and take a couple with me and at the end of it ill get rid of those i dont like then thatll be the end of the moonbeam as far as i am concerned so he prepared to start and on the evening before he went his brother declared that he would go as far as london with him thats all right said ralph but whats taking you up now the parson said that he wanted to get a few things and to have his hair cut he shouldnt stay above one night ralph asked no more questions and the two brothers went up to london together  we fear that patience underwood may not have been in all respects a discreet preserver of her sisters secrets but then there is nothing more difficult of attainment than discretion in the preservation of such mysteries to keep a friends secret well the keeper of it should be firmly resolved to act upon it in no waynot even for the advantage of the owner of it if it be confided to you as a secret that your friend is about to make his maiden speech in the house you should not even invite your acquaintances to be in their placesnot if secrecy be the first object in all things the knowledge should be to you as though you had it not great love is hardly capable of such secrecy as this in the fulness of her love patience had allowed her father to learn the secret of poor clarys heart and in the fulness of her love she had endeavoured to make things smooth at newton she had not told the young clergyman that clarissa had given to his brother that which she could not give to him but meaning to do a morsel of service to both of them if that might be possible she had said a word or two with what effect the reader will have seen from the conversation given in the last chapter  shell come to the parsonage yet ralph had said and gregory in one word had implied his assured conviction that any such coming was a thing not to be hoped foran event not even to be regarded as possible nevertheless he made up his mind that he would go up to londonto have his hair cut in so making up his mind he did not for a moment believe that it could be of any use to him he was not quite sure that when in london he would go to popham villa he was quite sure that if he did go to popham villa he would make no further offer to clarissa he knew that his journey was foolish simply the result of an uneasy restless spiritthat it would be better for him to remain in his parish and move about among the old women and bedridden men but still he went he would dine at his club he said and perhaps he might go down to fulham on the following morning and so the brothers parted ralph as a man of property with many weighty matters on hand had of course much to do he desired to inspect some agricultural implements and a new carriagehe had ever so many things to say to carey the lawyer and wanted to order new harnesses for the horses so he went to his club and played whist all the afternoon  gregory as soon as he had secured a bed at a quiet inn walked off to southampton buildings from the direct manner in which this was done it might have been argued that he had come up to london with the purpose of seeing sir thomas but it was not so he turned his steps towards the place where clarys father was generally to be found because he knew not what else to do as he went he told himself that he might as well leave it alonebut still he went stemm at once told him with a candour that was almost marvellous that sir thomas was out of town the hearing of the petition was going on at percycross and sir thomas was there as a matter of course stemm seemed to think it rather odd that an educated man such as was the rev gregory newton should have been unaware that the petition against the late election at percycross was being carried on at this moment weve got serjeant burnaby and little mr joram down to make a fight of it said mr stemm but as far as i can learn they might just as well have remained up in town its only sending good money after bad the young parson hardly expressed that interest in the matter which stemm had expected but turned away thinking whether he had not better have his hair cut at once and then go home  but he did go to popham villa on the same afternoon andsuch was his fortunehe found clarissa alone since her father had seen her in bed and spoken to her of what he had called the folly of her love she had not again given herself up to the life of a sickroom she dressed herself and came down to breakfast of a morning and then would sit with a needle in her hand till she took her book and then with a book till she took her needle she tried to work and tried to read and perhaps she did accomplish a little of each and then when patience would tell her that exercise was necessary she would put on her hat and creep out among the paths she did make some kind of effort to get over the evil that had come upon her but still no one could watch her and not know that she was a wounded deer miss clarissa is at home said the servant who well knew that the young clergyman was one of the rejected suitors there had been hardly a secret in the house in reference to gregory newtons love the two other young ladies the girl said had gone to london but would be home to dinner then with a beating heart gregory was ushered into the drawingroom clarissa was sitting near the window with a novel in her lap having placed herself there with the view of getting what was left of the light of the early spring evening but she had not read a word for the last quarter of an hour she was thinking of that word scoundrel with which her father had spoken of the man she loved could it be that he was in truth so bad as that and if it were true would she not take him scoundrel as he was if he would come to her he might be ascoundrel in that one thing on that one occasion and yet be good to her he might repent his scoundrelism and she certainly would forgive it of one thing she was quite surehe had not looked like a scoundrel when he had given her that assurance on the lawn and so she thought of young men in general it was very easy to call a young man a scoundrel and yet to forgive him all his iniquities when it suited to do so young men might get in debt and gamble and make love wherever they pleased and all at onceand yet be forgiven all these things were very bad it might be just to call a man a scoundrel because he could not pay his debts or because he made bets about horses young men did a great many things which would be horrid indeed were a girl to do them then one papa would call such a man a scoundrel because he was not wanted to come to the house while another papa would make him welcome and give him the best of everything ralph newton might be a scoundrel but if soas clarissa thoughtthere were a great many goodlooking scoundrels about in the world as to whom their scoundrelism did very little to injure them in the esteem of all their friends it was thus that clarissa was thinking over her own affairs when gregory newton was shown into the room  the greeting on both sides was at first formal and almost cold clary had given a little start of surprise and had then subsided into a most demure mode of answering questions yes papa was at percycross she did not know when he was expected back mary and patience were in london yesshe was at home all alone no she had not seen ralph since his uncles death the question which elicited this answer had been asked without any design and clary endeavoured to make her reply without emotion if she displayed any gregory who had his own affairs upon his mind did not see it nothey had not seen the other mr newton as he passed through town they had all understood that he had been very much disturbed by his fathers horrible accident and death then gregory paused in his questions and clarissa expressed a hope that there might be no more hunting in the world  it was very hard work this conversation and gregory was beginning to think that he had done no good by coming when on a sudden he struck a chord from whence came a sound of music ralph and i have been living together at the priory he said  ohindeed yesi think i heard patience say that you were at the priory  i suppose i shall not be telling any secret to you in talking about him and your cousin mary  clarissa felt that she was blushing up to her brow but she made a great effort to compose herself oh no she said we all know of it  i hope he may be successful said gregory  i do not know i cannot tell  i never knew a man more thoroughly in love than he is  i dont believe it said clarissa  not believe it indeed you may clary i have never seen her but from what he says of her i suppose her to be most beautiful  she isvery beautiful this was said with a strong emphasis  and why should you not believe it  it will not be of the slightest use mr newton and you may tell him so though i suppose it is impossible to make a man believe that  are we both so unfortunate he asked  the poor girl with her wounded love and every feeling sore within her had not intended to say anything that should be cruel or injurious to gregory himself and it was not till the words were out of her mouth that she herself perceived their effect oh mr newton i was only thinking of him she said innocently i only meant that ralph is one of those who always think they are to have everything they want  i am not one of those clarissa and yet i am one who seem never to be tired of asking for that which is not to be given to me i said to myself when last i went from here that i would never ask againthat i would never trouble you any more she was sitting with the book in her hand looking out into the gloom and now she made no attempt to answer him and yet you see here i am he continued she was still silent and her head was still turned away from him but he could see that tears were streaming down her cheeks i have not the power not to come to you while yet there is a chance he said i can live and work without you but i can have no life of my own when i first saw you i made a picture to myself of what my life might be and i cannot get that moved from before my eyes i am sorry however that my coming should make you weep  oh mr newton i am so wretched she said turning round sharply upon him for a moment she had thought that she would tell him everything and then she checked herself and remembered how illplaced such a confidence would be  what should make you wretched dearest  i do not know i cannot tell i sometimes think the world is bad altogether and that i had better die people are so cruel and so hard and things are so wrong but you may tell your brother that he need not think of my cousin mary nothing ever would move her hsh here they are do not say that i was crying  he was introduced to the beauty and as the lights came clarissa escaped yesshe was indeed most lovely but as he looked on her gregory felt that he agreed with clarissa that nothing on earth would move her he remained there for another halfhour but clarissa did not return and then he went back to london     chapter xliv  the petition   the time for hearing the petition at percycross had at length come and the judge had gone down to that ancient borough the day fixed was monday the 27th and parliament had then been sitting for three weeks mr griffenbottom had been as constant in his place as though there had been no sword hanging over his head but sir thomas had not as yet even taken the oaths he had made up his mind that he would not even enter the house while this bar against him as a legislator existed and he had not as yet even been seen in the lobby his daughters his colleague mr trigger and stemm had all expostulated with him on the subject assuring him that he should treat the petition with the greatest contempt at any rate till it should have proved itself by its success to be a matter not contemptible but to these counsellors he gave no ear and when he went down to give his evidence before the judge at percycross his seat had as yet availed him nothing  mr griffenbottom had declared that he would not pay a shilling towards the expense of the petition maintaining that his own seat was safe and that any peril incurred had been so incurred simply on behalf of sir thomas nothing according to mr griffenbottoms views could be more unjust than to expect that he should take any part in the matter trigger too had endeavoured to impress this upon sir thomas more than once or twice but this had been all in vain and sir thomas acting under the advice of his own attorney had at last compelled mr griffenbottom to take his share in the matter mr griffenbottom did not scruple to say that he was very illused and to hint that any unfair practices which might possibly have prevailed during the last election at percycross had all been adopted on behalf of sir thomas and in conformity with sir thomass views it will therefore be understood that the two members did not go down to the borough in the best humour with each other mr trigger still nominally acted for both but it had been almost avowed that sir thomas was to be treated as a jonah if by such treatment any salvation might be had for the ship of which griffenbottom was to be regarded as the captain  mr westmacott was also in percycrossand so was moggs reinstated in his old room at the cordwainers arms moggs had not been summoned nor was his presence there required for any purpose immediately connected with the inquiry to be made but purity and the rights of labour may always be advocated and when better than at a moment in which the impurity of a borough is about to be made the subject of public condemnation and moggs moreover had now rankling in his bosom a second cause of enmity against the tories of the borough since the election he had learned that his rival ralph newton was in some way connected with the sitting member sir thomas and he laid upon sir thomass back the weight of his full displeasure in reference to the proposed marriage with polly neefit he had heard that polly had raised some difficultyhad indeed rejected her aristocratic suitor and was therefore not without hope but he had been positively assured by neefit himself that the match would be made and was consequently armed with a double purpose in his desire to drive sir thomas ignominiously out of percycross  sir thomas had had more than one interview with serjeant burnaby and little mr joram than whom two more astute barristers in such matters were not to be found at that time practisingthough perhaps at that time the astuteness of the serjeant was on the wane while that of jacky joram as he was familiarly called was daily rising in repute sir thomas himself barrister and senior to these two gentlemen had endeavoured to hold his own with them and to impress on them the conviction that he had nothing to conceal that he had personally endeavoured as best he knew how to avoid corruption and that if there had been corruption on the part of his own agents he was himself ready to be a party in proclaiming it but he found himself to be absolutely ignored and put out of court by his own counsel they were gentlemen with whom professionally he had had no intercourse as he had practised at the chancery and they at the common law bar but he had been solicitorgeneral and was a bencher of his inn whereas serjeant burnaby was only a serjeant and jacky joram still wore a stuff gown nevertheless he found himself to be nowhere in discussing with them the circumstances of the election even joram whom he seemed to remember having seen only the other day as an ugly shamefaced boy about the courts treated him not exactly with indignity but with patronising goodnature listening with an air of halfattention to what he said and then not taking the slightest heed of a word of it who does not know this transparent pretence of courtesies which of all discourtesies is the most offensive ah just so sir thomas just so and now mr trigger i suppose mr puffers account hasnt yet been settled any word from mr trigger was of infinitely greater value with mr joram than all sir thomass protestations sir thomas could not keep himself from remembering that jacky jorams father was a cheesemonger at gloucester who had married the widow of a jew with a little money twenty times sir thomas made up his mind to retire from the business altogether but he always found himself unable to do so when he mentioned the idea griffenbottom flung up his hands in dismay at such treachery on the part of an allysuch treachery and such cowardice whathad not he sir thomas forced him griffenbottom into all this ruinous expenditure and now to talk of throwing up the sponge it was in vain that sir thomas explained that he had forced nobody into it it was manifestly the case that he had refused to go on with it by himself and on this mr griffenbottom and mr trigger insisted so often and with so much strength that sir thomas felt himself compelled to stand to his guns bad as he believed those guns to be  if sir thomas meant to retreat why had he not retreated when a proposition to that effect was made to him at his own chambers of all the weak vacillating illconditioned men that mr griffenbottom had ever been concerned with sir thomas underwood was the weakest most vacillating and most illconditioned to have to sit in the same boat with such a man was the greatest misfortune that had ever befallen mr griffenbottom in public life mr griffenbottom did not exactly say these hard things in the hearing of sir thomas but he so said them that they became the common property of the jorams triggers spiveycombs and spicers and were repeated piecemeal to the unhappy second member  he had secured for himself a separate sittingroom at the percy standard thinking that thus he would have the advantage of being alone but every one connected with his party came in and out of his room as though it had been specially selected as a chamber for public purposes even griffenbottom came into it to have interviews there with trigger although at the moment griffenbottom and sir thomas were not considered to be on speaking terms griffenbottom in these matters seemed to have the hide of a rhinoceros he had chosen to quarrel with sir thomas he had declared that he would not speak to a colleague whose parliamentary ideas and habits were so repulsive to him he had said quite aloud that trigger had never made a greater mistake in his life than in bringing sir thomas to the borough and that let the petition go as it would sir thomas should never be returned for the borough again he had spoken all these things almost in the hearing of sir thomas and yet he would come to sir thomass private room and sit there half the morning with a cigar in his mouth mr pile would come in and make most unpleasant speeches mr spicer called continually with his own ideas about the borough the thing could be still saved if enough money were spent if mr givantake were properly handled and mr oblather duly provided for the two witnesses upon whom the thing really hung would not be found in percycross when called upon tomorrow that was mr spicers idea and he was very eager to communicate it to serjeant burnaby trigger in his energy told mr spicer to go and be  all this occurred in sir thomass private room and then mr pabsby was there constantly till he at last was turned out by trigger in his agony sir thomas asked for another sittingroom but was informed that the house was full the room intended for the two members was occupied by griffenbottom but nobody ever suggested that the party might meet there when sir thomass vain request was made for further accommodation griffenbottom went on with his cigar and mr pile sat picking his teeth before the fire and making unpleasant little speeches  the judge who had hurried into percycross from another town and who opened the commission on the monday evening did not really begin his work till the tuesday morning jacky joram had declared that the inquiry would last three days he having pledged himself to be at another town early on the following friday serjeant burnaby whose future services were not in such immediate demand was of opinion that they would not get out of percycross till saturday night judge crumbie who was to try the case and who had been trying similar cases ever since christmas was not due at his next town till the monday but it was understood by everybody that he intended if possible to spend his saturday and sunday in the bosom of his family trigger however had magnificent ideas i believe we shall carry them into the middle of next week he said if they choose to go on with it trigger thoroughly enjoyed the petition and even griffenbottom who was no longer troubled by gout and was not now obliged to walk about the borough did not seem to dislike it but to poor sir thomas it was indeed a purgatory  the sitting members were of course accused both as regarded themselves and their agents of every crime known in electioneering tactics votes had been personated votes had been bought votes had been obtained by undue influence on the part of masters and landlords and there had been treating of the most pernicious and corrupt description as to the personating of votes that according to mr trigger had been merely introduced as a pleasant commencing fiction common in parliamentary petitions there had been nothing of the kind and nobody supposed that there had and it did not signify of undue influencewhat purists choose to call undue influencethere had of course been plenty it was not likely that masters paying thousands a year in wages were going to let these men vote against themselves but this influence was so much a matter of course that it could not be proved to the injury of the sitting members such at least was mr triggers opinion mr spicer might have been a little imprudent with his men but no case could be brought up in which a man had been injured undue influence at percycross wasgammon so said mr trigger and jacky joram agreed with mr trigger serjeant burnaby rubbed his hands and would give no opinion till he had heard the evidence that votes had been bought during the day of the election there was no doubt on earth on this matter great secrecy prevailed and sir thomas could not get a word spoken in his own hearing it was admitted however that votes had been bought there were a dozen men perhaps more than a dozen who would prove that one glump had paid them ten shillings a piece between one and two on the day of the election there was a general belief that perhaps over a hundred had been bought at that rate but trigger was ready to swear that he did not know whence glump had got the money and glump himself wasnobody knew where glump was but strange whispers respecting glump were floating about the borough trigger was disposed to believe that they on their side could prove that glump had really been employed by westmacotts people to vitiate the election he was quite sure that nothing could connect glump with him as an agent on behalf of griffenbottom and underwood so mr trigger asserted with the greatest confidence but what was in the bottom of mr triggers mind on this subject no one pretended to know as for glump himself he was a man who would certainly take payment from anybody for any dirty work it was the general impression through the borough that glump had on this occasion been hired by trigger and trigger certainly enjoyed the prestige which was thus conferred upon him  as to the treatingthere could be no doubt about that there had been treating the idea of conducting an election at percycross without beer seemed to be absurd to every male and female percycrossian of course the publicans would open their taps and then send in their bills for beer to the electioneering agents there was a prevailing feeling that any interference with so ancient a practice was not only unenglish but unjust alsothat it was beyond the power of parliament to enforce any law so abominable and unnatural trigger was of opinion that though there had been a great deal of beer no attempt would be made to prove that votes had been influenced by treating there had been beer on both sides and trigger hoped sincerely that there might always be beer on both sides as long as percycross was a borough  sir thomas found that his chance of success was now spoken of in a tone very different from that which had been used when the matter was discussed in his own chamber he had been then told that it was hardly possible that he should keep his seatand he had in fact been asked to resign it though sick enough of percycross this he would not do in the manner then proposed to him now he was encouraged in the fightbut the encouragement was of a nature which gave him no hope which robbed him even of the wish to have a hope it was all dirt from beginning to end whatever might be the verdict of the judgefrom the judge the verdict was now to comehe should still believe that nothing short of absolute disfranchisement would meet the merits of the case  the accusation with regard to the personation of votes was abandonedserjeant burnaby expressing the most extreme disgust that any such charge should have been made without foundationalthough he himself at the borough which he had last left had brought forward the same charge on behalf of his then clients and had abandoned it in the same way then the whole of the remaining hours of the tuesday and half the wednesday were passed in showing that messrs spicer spiveycomb and roodylands had forced their own men to vote blue mr spicer had dismissed one man and mr spiveycomb two men but both these gentlemen swore that the men dismissed were not worth their salt and had been sent adrift upon the world by no means on account of their politics true they had all voted for moggs but then they had done that simply to spite their late master on the middle of wednesday when the matter of intimidation had been completedthe result still lying in the bosom of baron crumbiemr trigger thought that things were looking up that was the report which he brought to mr griffenbottom who was smoking his midday cigar in sir thomass armchair while sir thomas was endeavouring to master the first book of lord verulams later treatise de dignitate scientiarum seated in a canebottomed chair in a very small bedroom upstairs  by consent the question of treating came next heaven and earth were being moved to find glump when the proposition was made that the treating should come before the bribery trigger stated in court that he was himself doing his very best to find the man there might yet be a hope though alas the hope was becoming slighter every hour his own idea was that glump had been sent away to holland bywell he did not care to name the parties by whom he believed that glump had been expatriated however there might be a chance the counsel on the other side remarked that there might indeed be a chance baron crumbie expressed a hope that mr glump might make his appearancefor the sake of the borough which might otherwise fare badly and then the great beer question was discussed for two entire days  there was no doubt about the beer trigger who was examined after some halfscore of publicans said openly that thirsty conservative souls had been allowed to slake their drought at the joint expense of the conservative party in the boroughas thirsty liberal souls had been encouraged to do on the other side when reminded that any malpractice in that direction on the part of a beaten candidate could not affect the status of the elected members he replied that all the beer consumed in percycross during the election had not to the best of his belief affected a vote the percycrossians were not men to vote this way or that because of beer he would not believe it even in regard to a liberal percycrossian it might be so in other boroughs but of other boroughs he knew absolutely nothing who paid for the beer mr trigger at once acknowledged that it was paid for out of the general funds provided for the election who provided those funds there was not a small amount of fencing on this point during the course of which mr joram snapped very sharply and very frequently at the counsel on the other sidehoping thereby somewhat to change the issue but at last there came out these two facts that there was a general fund to which all conservatives might subscribe and that the only known subscribers to this fund were mr griffenbottom sir thomas underwood and old mr pile who had given a £10 noteapparently with the view of proving that there was a fund it was agreed on all hands that treating had been substantiated but it was remarked by some that baron crumbie had not been hard upon treating in other boroughs after all the result would depend upon what the baron thought about mr glump it might be that he would recommend further inquiry under a special commission into the practices of the borough because of the glump iniquities and that he should nevertheless leave the seats to the sitting members that seemed to be mr triggers belief on the evening of the thursday as he took his brandy and water in sir thomass private sittingroom  there is nothing in the world so brisk as the ways and manners of lawyers when in any great case they come to that portion of it which they know to be the real bone of the limb and kernel of the nut the doctor is very brisk when after a dozen moderately dyspeptic patients he comes on some unfortunate gentleman whose gastric apparatus is gone altogether the parson is very brisk when he reaches the minatory clause in his sermon the minister is very brisk when he asks the house for a vote telling his hopedfor followers that this special point is absolutely essential to his government unless he can carry this he and all those hanging on to him must vacate their places the horsedealer is very brisk when after four or five indifferent lots he bids his man bring out from the stable the last thoroughbred that he bought and the very best that he ever put his eye on but the briskness of none of these is equal to the briskness of the barrister who has just got into his hands for crossexamination him whom we may call the centre witness of a great case he plumes himself like a bullfinch going to sing he spreads himself like a peacock on a lawn he perks himself like a sparrow on a paling he crows amidst his attorneys and all the satellites of the court like a cock among his hens he puts his hands this way and that settling even the sunbeams as they enter lest a moat should disturb his intellect or dull the edge of his subtlety there is a modesty in his eye a quiescence in his lips a repose in his limbs under which lie halfconcealednot at all concealed from those who have often watched him at his workthe glance the tone the spring which are to tear that unfortunate witness into pieces without infringing any one of those conventional rules which have been laid down for the guidance of successful wellmannered barristers  serjeant burnaby though astute was not specially brisk by nature but on this friday morning mr joram was very brisk indeed there was a certain mr cavity who had acted as agent for westmacott and whoif anybody on the westmacott side had been so guiltyhad been guilty in the matter of glumps absence perhaps we should not do justice to mr jorams acuteness were we to imagine him as believing that glump was absent under other influence than that used on behalf of the conservative side but there were subsidiary points on which mr cavity might be made to tell tales of course there had been extensive bribery for years past in percycross on the liberal as well as on the conservative side and mr joram thought that he could make mr cavity tell a tale and then too he could be very brisk in that affair of glump he was pretty nearly sure that mr glump could not be connected by evidence with either of the sitting members or with any of their agents he would prove that glump was neutral ground and that as such his services could not be traced to his friend mr trigger mr joram on this occasion was very brisk indeed  a score of men were brought up ignorant halfdumb heavybrowed men all dressed in the amphibious garb of outodoor town labourersof whom there exists a class of hybrids between the rural labourer and the artizaneach one of whom acknowledged that after noon on the election day he received ten shillings with instructions to vote for griffenbottom and underwood and they did vote for griffenbottom and underwood at all elections in percycross they had as they now openly acknowledged waited till about the same hour on the day of election and then somebody had bought their votes for somebody on this occasion the purchase had been made by mr glump there was a small empty house up a little alley in the town to which there was a back door opening on a vacant space in the town known as grinders green they entered this house by one door leaving it by the other and as they passed through glump gave to each man half a sovereign with instructions entering their names in a small bookand then they went in a body and voted for griffenbottom and underwood each of the twenty knew nearly all the other twenty but none of them knew any other men who had been paid by glump of course none of them had the slightest knowledge of glumps present abode it was proved that at the last election glump had acted for the liberals but it was also proved that at the election before he had been active in bribing for the conservatives very many things were provedif a thing be proved when supported by testimony on oath trigger proved that twenty votes alone could have been of no service and would not certainly have been purchased in a manner so detrimental according to triggers views it was as clear as daylight that glump had not been paid by them when asked whether he would cause mr glump to be repaid that sum of ten pounds should mr glump send in any bill to that effect he simply stated that mr glump would certainly send no such bill to him he was then asked whether it might not be possible that the money should be repaid by messrs griffenbottom and underwood through his hands reaching glump again by means of a further middleman mr trigger acknowledged that were such a claim made upon him by any known agent of his party he would endeavour to pass the ten pounds through the accounts as he thought that there should be a certain feeling of honour in these things but he did not for a moment think that any one acting with him would have dealings with glump on the saturday morning when the case was still going on to the great detriment of baron grumbles domestic happiness glump had not yet been caught it seemed that the man had no wife no relative no friend the woman at whose house he lodged declared that he often went and came after this fashion the respect with which glumps name was mentioned as his persistency in disobeying the law and his capability for intrigue were thus proved was so great that it was a pity he could not have been there to enjoy it for the hour he was a great man in percycrossand the greater because baron crumbie did not cease to threaten him with terrible penalties  much other bribery was alleged but none other was distinctly brought home to the agents of the sitting members as to bringing bribery home to mr griffenbottom himselfthat appeared to be out of the question nobody seemed even to wish to do that the judge as it appeared did not contemplate any result so grave and terrible as that there was a band of freemen of whom it was proved that they had all been treated with most excessive liberality by the corporation of the town and it was proved also that a majority of the corporation were supporters of mr griffenbottom a large number of votes had been so secured such at least was the charge made by the petitioners but this allegation jacky joram laughed to scorn the corporation of course used the charities and privileges of the town as they thought right and the men votedas they thought right the only cases of bribery absolutely proved were those manipulated by glump and nothing had been adduced clearly connecting glump and the griffenbottomites mr trigger was in ecstasies but mr joram somewhat repressed him by referring to these oracular words which had fallen from the baron in respect to the corporation a corporation may be guilty as well as an individual the baron had said jacky joram had been very eager in assenting to the baron but in asserting at the same time that the bribery must be proved it wont be assumed my lord that a corporation has bribed because it has political sympathies it should have none said the baron human nature is human nature my lordeven in corporations said jacky joram this took place just before luncheonwhich was made a solemn meal on all sides as the judge had declared his intention of sitting till midnight if necessary  immediately after the solemn meal mr griffenbottom was examined it had been the declared purpose of the other side to turn mr griffenbottom inside out mr griffenbottom and his conduct had on various former occasions been the subject of parliamentary petitions under the old form but on such occasions the chief delinquent himself was never examined now mr griffenbottom would be made to tell all that he knew not only of his present but of his past iniquities and yet mr griffenbottom told very little and it certainly did seem to the bystanders that even the opposing counsel even the judge on the bench abstained from their prey because he was a member of parliament it was notorious to all the world that griffenbottom had debased the borough had so used its venal tendencies as to make that systematic which had before been too frequent indeed but yet not systematized that he had trained the rising generation of percycross politicians to believe in political corruptionand yet he escaped that utter turning inside out of which men had spoken  the borough had cost him a great deal of money certainly but as far as he knew the money had been spent legally it had at least always been his intention before an election was commenced that nothing illegal should be done he had no doubt always afterwards paid sums of money the use of which he did not quite understand and as to some of which he could not but fear that it had been doubtfully applied the final accounts as to the last election had not reached him but he did not expect to be charged with improper expenses there no doubt would be something for beer but that was unavoidable as to mr glump he knew literally nothing of the mannor had he wanted any such mans assistance twenty votes indeed let them look at his place upon the poll there had been a time in the day when twenty votes this way or that might be necessary to sir thomas he had been told that it was so on the day of the election his own position on the poll had been so certain to him that he should not have caredthat is for himselfhad he heard that glump was buying votes against him he considered it to be quite out of the question that glump should have bought votes for himwith any purpose of serving him and so mr griffenbottom escaped from the adverse counsel and from the judge  there was very little in the examination of sir thomas underwood to interest any one no one really suspected him of corrupt practices in all such cases the singular part of the matter is that everybody those who are concerned and those who are not concerned really know the whole truth which is to be investigated and yet that which everybody knows cannot be substantiated there were not five men in court who were not certain that griffenbottom was corrupt and that sir thomas was not that the borough was rotten as a sixmonthsold egg that glump had acted under one of triggers aidesdecamp that intimidation was the law of the borough and that beer was used so that men drunk might not fear that which sober they had not the courage to encounter all this was known to everybody and yet up to the last it was thought by many in percycross that corruption acknowledged transparent egregious corruption would prevail even in the presence of a judge mr trigger believed it to the last  but it was not so thought by the jacky jorams or by the serjeant burnabys they made their final speechesthe leading lawyer on each side but they knew well what was coming at halfpast seven for to so late an hour had the work been continued the judge retired to get a cup of tea and returned at eight to give his award it was as follows  as to the personation of votes there should have been no allegation made in regard to the charge of intimidation it appeared that the system prevailed to such an extent as to make it clear to him that percycross was unfit to return representatives to parliament in the matter of treating he was not quite prepared to say that had no other charge been made he should have declared this election void but of that also there had been sufficient to make him feel it to be his duty to recommend to the speaker of the house of commons that further inquiry should be made as to the practices of the borough and as to direct bribery though he was not prepared to say that he could connect the agents of the members with what had been doneand certainly he could not connect either of the two members themselvesstill quite enough had been proved to make it imperative upon him to declare the election void this he should do in his report to the speaker and should also advise that a commission be held with the view of ascertaining whether the privilege of returning members of parliament should remain with the borough with griffenbottom he dealt as tenderly as he did with sir thomas sending them both forth to the world unseated indeed but as innocent injured men  there was a night train up to london at 10 pm by which on that evening sir thomas underwood travelled shaking off from his feet as he entered the carriage the dust of that most iniquitous borough     chapter xlv  never give a thing up   mr neefits conduct during this period of disappointment was not exactly what it should to have been either in the bosom of his family or among his dependents in conduit street herr bawwah over a pot of beer in the publichouse opposite suggested to mr waddle that the governor might be  in a manner that affected mr waddle greatly it was an eloquent and energetic expression of opinionalmost an expression of a settled purpose as coming from the german as it did come and waddle was bound to admit that cause had been given fritz said waddle pathetically dont think about it you cant better the wages herr bawwah looked up from his pot of beer and muttered a german oath he had been told that he was beastly skulking pigheaded obstinate drunken with some other perhaps stronger epithets which may be omittedand he had been told that he was a german in that had lain the venom there was the word that rankled he had another pot of beer and though it was then only twelve oclock on a monday morning herr bawwah swore that he was going to make a day of it and that old neefit might cut out the stuff for himself if he pleased as they were now at the end of march which is not a busy time of the year in mr neefits trade the great artists defalcation was of less immediate importance but as waddle knew the german was given both to beer and obstinacy when aroused to wrath and what would become of the firm should the obstinacy continue  wheres that pigheaded german brute asked mr neefit when mr waddle returned to the establishment mr waddle made no reply and when neefit repeated the question with a free use of the epithets previously omitted by us waddle still was dumb leaning over his ledger as though in that there were matters so great as to absorb his powers of hearing the two of you may go and be  together said mr neefit if any order requiring immediate obedience were contained in this mr waddle disobeyed that order he still bent himself over the ledger and was dumb waddle had been trusted with his masters private view in the matter of the newton marriage and felt that on this account he owed a debt of forbearance to the unhappy father  the breechesmaker was in truth very unhappy he had accused his german assistant of obstinacy but the german could hardly have been more obstinate than his master mr neefit had set his heart upon making his daughter mrs newton and had persisted in declaring that the marriage should be made to take place the young man had once given him a promise and should be compelled to keep the promise so given and in these days mr neefit seemed to have lost that discretion for which his friends had once given him credit on the occasion of his visit to the moonbeam early in the hunting season he had spoken out very freely among the sportsmen there assembled and from that time all reticence respecting his daughter seemed to have been abandoned he had paid the debts of this young man who was now lord of wide domains when the young man hadnt a red copper in his pocketso did mr neefit explain the matter to his friendsand he didnt intend that the young man should be off his bargain nohe wasnt going to put up with thatnot if he knew it all this he declared freely to his general acquaintance he was very eloquent on the subject in a personal interview which he had with mr moggs senior in consequence of a visit made to hendon by mr moggs junior during which he feared that polly had shown some tendency towards yielding to the young politician mr moggs senior might take this for grantedthat if moggs junior made himself master of polly it would be of polly pure and simple of polly without a shilling of dowry hell have to take her in her smock that was the phrase in which mr neefit was pleased to express his resolution to all of which mr moggs senior answered never a word it was on returning from mr moggss establishment in bond street to his own in conduit street that mr neefit made himself so very unpleasant to the unfortunate german when ontario put on his best clothes and took himself out to hendon on the previous sunday he did not probably calculate that as one consequence of that visit the herr bawwah would pass a whole week of intoxication in the little back parlour of the publichouse near st georges church  it may be imagined how very unpleasant all this must have been to miss neefit herself poor polly indeed suffered many things but she bore them with an admirable and a persistent courage indeed she possessed a courage which greatly mitigated her sufferings let her father be as indiscreet as he might he could not greatly lower her as long as she herself was prudent it was thus that polly argued with herself she knew her own value and was not afraid that she should ever lack a lover when she wanted to find a husband of course it was not a nice thing to be thrown at a mans head as her father was constantly throwing her at the head of young newton but such a man as she would give herself to at last would understand all that ontario moggs could she ever bring herself to accept ontario would not be less devoted to her because of her fathers illarranged ambition polly could be obstinate too but with her obstinacy there was combined a fund of feminine strength which as we think quite justified the devotion of ontario moggs  amidst all these troubles mrs neefit also had a bad time of it so bad a time that she was extremely anxious that ontario should at once carry off the prizeontario or the gasfitter or almost anybody neefit was taking to drink in the midst of all this confusion and was making himself uncommonly unpleasant in the bosom of his family on the sundaythe sunday before the monday on which the herr decided that his wisest course of action would be to abstain from work and make a beast of himself in order that he might spite his mastermr neefit had dined at one oclock and had insisted on his ginandwater and pipe immediately after his dinner now mr neefit when he took too much did not fall into the extreme sins which disgraced his foreman he simply became very cross till he fell asleep very heavy while sleeping and more cross than ever when again awake while he was asleep on this sunday afternoon ontario moggs came down to hendon dressed in his sunday best mrs neefit whispered a word to him before he was left alone with polly you be round with her and run your chance about the money mrs neefit said ontario laying his hand upon his heart all the bullion in the bank of england dont make a feathers weight in the balance you never was mercenary mr ontario said the lady my sweetheart is to me more than a coined hemisphere said ontario the expression may have been absurd but the feeling was there  polly was not at all coy of her presencewas not so though she had been specially ordered by her father not to have anything to say to that longlegged ugly fool handsome is as handsome does polly had answered whereupon mr neefit had shown his teeth and growledbut polly though she loved her father and after a fashion respected him was not afraid of him and now when her mother left her alone with ontario she was free enough of her conversation oh polly he said after a while you know why im here  yes i know said polly  i dont think you do care for that young gentleman  im not going to break my heart about him mr moggs  id try to be the death of him if you did  that would be a right down tragedy because then youd be hungand so thered be an end of us all i dont think id do that mr moggs  polly i sometimes feel as though i didnt know what to do  tell me the whole story of how you went on down at percycross i was so anxious you should get in  were you now  right down sick at heart about itthat i was dont you think we should all be proud to know a member of parliament  oh if thats all  i shouldnt think anything of mr newton for being in parliament whether he was in parliament or out would be all the same of course hes a friend and we like him very well but his being in parliament would be nothing but if you were there  i dont know whats the difference said moggs despondently  because youre one of us  yes i am said moggs rising to his legs and preparing himself for an oration on the rights of labour i thank my god that i am no aristocrat then there came upon him a feeling that this was not a time convenient for political fervour but ill tell you something polly he said interrupting himself  welltell me something mr moggs  id sooner have a kiss from you than be prime minister  kisses mean so much mr moggs said polly  i mean them to mean much said ontario moggs whereupon polly declining further converse on that delicate subject and certainly not intending to grant the request made on the occasion changed the subject  but you will get in stillwont you mr moggs they tell me that those other gentlemen aint to be members any longer because what they did was unfair oughtnt that to make you member  i think it ought if the law was rightbut it doesnt  doesnt it now but youll try againwont you never give a thing up mr moggs if you want it really as the words left her lips she understood their meaningthe meaning in which he must necessarily take themand she blushed up to her forehead then she laughed as she strove to recall the encouragement she had given him you know what i mean mr moggs i dont mean any silly nonsense about being in love  if that is silly i am the silliest man in london  i think you are sometimesso i tell you fairly  in the meantime mr neefit had woke from his slumbers he was in his old armchair in the little back room where they had dined while polly with her lover was in the front parlour mrs neefit was seated opposite to mr neefit with an open bible in her lap which had been as potent for sleep with her as had been the ginandwater with her husband neefit suddenly jumped up and growled wheres polly he demanded  shes in the parlour i suppose said mrs neefit doubtingly  and who is with her  nobody as hadnt ought to be said mrs neefit  whos there i say but without waiting for an answer he stalked into the front room its no use in life your coming here he said addressing himself at once to ontario not the least she aint for you shes for somebody else why cant one word be as good as a thousand moggs stood silent looking sheepish and confounded it was not that he was afraid of the father but that he feared to offend the daughter should he address the father roughly if she goes against me shell have to walk out of the house with just what shes got on her back  i should be quite contented said ontario  but i shouldntso you may just cut it anybody who wants her without my leave must take her in her smock  oh father screamed polly  thats what i meanso lets have done with it what business have you coming to another mans house when youre not welcome when i want you ill send for you and till i do you have my leave to stay away  goodbye polly said ontario offering the girl his hand  goodbye mr moggs said polly and mind you get into parliament you stick to it and youll do it  when she repeated this salutary advice it must have been that she intended to apply to the double event moggs at any rate took it in that light i shall said he as he opened the door and walked triumphantly out of the house  father said polly as soon as they were alone youve behaved very bad to that young man  you be blowed said mr neefit  you have then youll go on till you get me that talked about that i shall be ashamed to show myself whats the good of me trying to behave if you keep going on like that  why didnt you take that chap when he came after you down to margate  because i didnt choose i dont care enough for him and its all no use of you going on i wouldnt have him if he came twenty times ive made up my mind so i tell you  youre a very grand young woman  im grand enough to have a will of my own about that im not going to be made to marry any man i know  and you mean to take that longlegged shoemakers apprentice  hes not a shoemakers apprentice any more than im a breechesmakers apprentice polly was now quite in earnest and in no mood for picking her words he is a bootmaker by his trade and ive never said anything about taking him  youve given him a promise  no ive not  and youd better not unless you want to walk out of this house with nothing but the rags on your back aint i doing it all for you aint i been sweating my life out these thirty years to make you a lady this was hard upon polly as she was not yet oneandtwenty  i dont want to be a lady no more than i am just by myself like if i cant be a lady without being made one i wont be a lady at all  you be blowed  there are different kinds of ladies father i want to be such a one as neither you nor mother shall ever have cause to say i didnt behave myself  youd talk the figures off a milestone said mr neefit as he returned to his armchair to his ginandwater to his growlings and before long to his slumbers throughout the whole evening he was very unpleasant in the bosom of his familywhich consisted on this occasion of his wife only as polly took the opportunity of going out to drink tea with a young lady friend neefit when he heard this suggested that ontario was drinking tea at the same house and would have pursued his daughter but for mingled protestations and menaces which his wife used for preventing such a violation of parental authority moggs dont know from adam where she is and you never knowed her do anything of that kind and youll go about with your mad schemes and jealousies till you about ruin the poor girl thats what you will i wont have it if you go ill go too and ill shame you no you shant have your hat of course shell be off some day if you make the place that wretched that she cant live in it i know i wouldwith the fust man asd ask me by these objurgations by a pertinacious refusal as to his hat and a little yielding in the matter of ginandwater mr neefit was at length persuaded to remain at home  on the following morning he said nothing before he left home but as soon as he had opened his letters and spoken a few sharp things to the two men in conduit street he went off to mr moggs senior of the interview between mr neefit and mr moggs senior sufficient has already been told then it was after his return to his own shop that he so behaved as to drive the german artist into downright mutiny and unlimited beer through the whole afternoon he snarled at waddle but waddle sat silent bending over the ledger one question waddle did answer  wheres that pigheaded german gone asked mr neefit for the tenth time  i believe hes cutting his throat about this time said mr waddle  he may wait till i come and sew it up said the breechesmaker  all this time mr neefit was very unhappy he knew as well as did mr waddle or polly that he was misbehaving himself he was by no means deficient in ideas of duty to his wife to his daughter and to his dependents polly was the apple of his eye his one jewelin his estimation the best girl that ever lived he admired her in all her moods even though she would sometimes oppose his wishes with invincible obstinacy he knew in his heart that were she to marry ontario moggs he would forgive her on the day of her marriage he could not keep himself from forgiving her though she were to marry a chimneysweep but as he thought a great wrong was being done him he could not bring himself to believe that polly would not marry the young squire if the young squire would only be true to his undertaking and then he could not endure that the young squire should escape from him after having been as it were saved from ruin by his money without paying for the accommodation in some shape he had some inkling of an idea that in punishing ralph by making public the whole transaction he would be injuring his daughter as much as he injured ralph but the inkling did not sufficiently establish itself in his mind to cause him to desist ralph newton ought to be made to repeat his offer before all the world even though he should only repeat it to be again refused the whole of that evening he sat brooding over it so that he might come to some great resolution     chapter xlvi  mr neefit again   the last few days in march and the first week in april were devoted by ralph the heir to a final visit to the moonbeam he had resolved to finish the hunting season at his old quarters and then to remove his stud to newton the distinction with which he was welcomed by everybody at the moonbeam must have been very gratifying to him though he had made no response whatever to lieutenant coxs proposition as to a visit to newton that gentleman received him as a hero captain fooks also had escaped from his regiment with the sole object of spending these last days with his dear old friend fred pepper too was very polite though it was not customary with mr pepper to display friendship so enthusiastic as that which warmed the bosoms of the two military gentlemen as to mr horsball one might have thought from his manner that he hoped to engage his customer to remain at the moonbeam for the rest of his life but it was not so it was in mr horsballs nature to be civil to a rich hunting country gentleman and it was the fact also that ralph had ever been popular with the world of the moonbeameven at times when the spasmodic and at length dilatory mode of his payment must have become matter for thought to the master of the establishment there was no doubt about the payments now and ralphs popularity was increased fourfold mrs horsball got out from some secluded nook a special bottle of orangebrandy in his favourwhich lieutenant cox would have consumed on the day of its opening had not mrs horsball with considerable acrimony declined to supply his orders the sister with ringlets smiled and smirked whenever the young squire went near the bar the sister in ringlets was given to flirtations of this kind would listen with sweetest complacency to compliments on her beauty and would return them with interest but she never encouraged this sort of intimacy with gentlemen who did not pay their bills or with those whose dealings with the house were not of a profitable nature the man who expected that miss horsball would smile upon him because he ordered a glass of sherry and bitters or halfapint of pale ale was very much mistaken but the softness of her smiles for those who consumed the moonbeam champagne was unbounded love and commerce with her ran together and regulated each other in a manner that was exceedingly advantageous to her brother if i were about to open such a house as the moonbeam the first thing i should look for would be a discreet pleasantvisaged lady to assist me in the bar department not much under forty with ringlets having no particular leaning towards matrimony who knew how to whisper little speeches while she made a bottle of cherrybrandy serve fiveandtwenty turns at the least she should be honest patient graceful capable of great labour graspingwith that wonderful capability of being greedy for the benefit of another which belongs to womenwilling to accept plentiful meals and a power of saving £20 a year as sufficient remuneration for all hardships with no more susceptibility than a milestone and as indifferent to delicacy in language as a bargee there are such women and very valuable women they are in that trade such a one was miss horsball and in these days the sweetest of her smiles were bestowed upon the young squire  ralph newton certainly liked it though he assumed an air of laughing at it all one would think that old hossy thought that i am going to go on with this kind of thing he said one morning to mr pepper as the two of them were standing about near the stable doors with pipes in their mouths old hossy was the affectionate nickname by which mr horsball was known among the hunting men of the b b mr pepper and ralph had already breakfasted and were dressed for hunting except that they had not yet put on their scarlet coats the meet was within three miles of their headquarters the captain and the lieutenant were taking advantage of the occasion by prolonged slumbers and ralph had passed the morning in discussing hunting matters with mr pepper  he dont think that said mr pepper taking a very convenient little implement out of his pocket contrived for purposes of pipesmoking accommodation he stopped down his tobacco and drew the smoke and seemed by his manner to be giving his undivided attention to his pipe but that was mr peppers manner he was short in speech but always spoke with a meaning  of course he doesnt really said ralph i dont suppose i shall ever see the old house again after next week you see when a man has a place of ones own if there be hunting there one is bound to take it if there isnt one can go elsewhere and pick and choose  just so said mr pepper  i like this kind of thing amazingly you know  it has its advantages  oh dear yes there is no trouble you know everything done for you no servants to look afterexcept just the fellow who brings you your breeches and rides your second horse mr pepper never had a second horse or a man of his own to bring him his breeches but the allusion did not on that account vex him and then you can do what you like a great deal more than you can in a house of your own  i should say so remarked mr pepper  i tell you what it is fred continued ralph becoming very confidential i dont mind telling you because you are a man who understands things there isnt such a great pull after all in having a property of your own  i shouldnt mind trying itjust for a year or so said mr pepper  i suppose not said ralph chuckling in his triumph and yet there isnt so much in it what does it amount to when its all told you keep horses for other fellows to ride you buy wine for other fellows to drink you build a house for other fellows to live in youve a deal of business to do and if you dont mind it you go very soon to the dogs you have to work like a slave and everybody gets a pull at you the chances are you never have any ready money and become as stingy as an old file you have to get married because of the family and the place and all that kind of thing then you have to give dinners to every old fogy male and female within twenty miles of you and before you know where you are you become an old fogy yourself thats about what it is  you ought to know said mr pepper  ive been expecting it all my lifeof course it was what i was born to and everybody has been telling me what a lucky fellow i am since i can remember now ive got it and i dont find it comes to so very much i shall always look back upon the dear old moonbeam and the b b and hossys wonderful port wine with regret it hasnt been very swell you know but its been uncommonly cosy dont you think so  you see i wasnt born to anything better said mr pepper  just at this moment cox and fooks came out of the house they had not as yet breakfasted but had thought that a mouthful of air in the stableyard might enable them to get through their toast and red herrings with an amount of appetite which had not as yet been vouchsafed to them second and third editions of that wonderful port had been produced on the previous evening and the two warriors had played their parts with it manfully fooks was bearing up bravely as he made his way across the yard but cox looked as though his friends ought to see to his making that journey to australia very soon if they intended him to make it at all im blessed if you fellows havent been and breakfasted said captain fooks  thats about it said the squire  you must be uncommon fond of getting up early  do you know who gets the worm asked mr pepper  oh bother that said cox  theres nothing i hate so much as being told about that nasty worm said captain fooks i dont want a worm  but the early birds do said mr pepper  captain fooks was rather given to be cross of mornings i think you know that when fellows say over night theyll breakfast together it isnt just the sort of thing for one or two to have all the things brought up at any unconscionable hour they please eh cox  im sure i dont know said cox i shall just have another go of soda and brandy with a devilled biscuit thats all i want  fooks had better go to bed again and see if he cant get out the other side said ralph  chaff doesnt mean anything said captain fooks  thats as you take it said mr pepper  i shall take it just as i please said captain fooks  just at this moment mr horsball came up to them touching his hat cheerily in sign of the commencement of the day youll ride mr peppers little orse i suppose sir he said addressing himself to the young squire  certainlyi told larking i would  exactly mr newton and banker might as well go out as second  i said brewer banker was out on friday  that wont be no odds mr newton the fact is brewers legs is a little puffed  all right said the squire  well old hossy said lieutenant cox summing up all his energy in an attempt at matutinal joviality as he slapped the landlord on the back how are things going with you  mr horsball knew his customers and did not like being slapped on the back with more than ordinary vigour by such a customer as lieutenant cox pretty well i thank you mr cox said he i didnt take too much last night and i eat my breakfast earty this morning  there is one for you young man said captain fooks whereupon the squire laughed heartily mr horsball went on nodding his head intending to signify his opinion that he had done his work thoroughly mr pepper standing on one foot with the other raised on a horseblock looked on without moving a muscle of his face the lieutenant was disgusted but was too weak in his inner man to be capable of instant raillerywhen on a sudden the whole aspect of things was changed by the appearance of mr neefit in the yard  dtion exclaimed our friend ralph the apparition had been so sudden that the squire was unable to restrain himself mr neefit as the reader will perhaps remember had been at the moonbeam before he had written letters which had been answered and then lettersmany lettersto which no reply had been given in respect of the neefit arrangements ralph newton felt himself to be peculiarly illused by persecutions such as these because he had honestly done his best to make polly his wife no doubt he acknowledged that fortune had favoured him almost miraculously in first saving him from so injurious a marriage by the action of the young lady and then at once bestowing upon him his estate but the escape was the doing of fortune and polly neefit combined and had not come of any intrigue on his own part he was in a positionso he thoughtabsolutely to repudiate neefit and to throw himself upon facts for his protectionbut then it was undoubtedly the case that for a year or two mr neefit could make his life a burden to him he would have bought off neefit at a considerable price had neefit been purchaseable but neefit was not in this matter greedy for himself he wanted to make his daughter a lady and he thought that this was the readiest way to accomplish that object the squire in his unmeasurable disgust uttered the curse aloud but then remembering himself walked up to the breechesmaker with his extended hand he had borrowed the mans money whats in the wind now mr neefit he said  whats in the wind captain oh you know when are you coming to see us at the cottage  i dont think my coming would do any good im not in favour with the ladies there ralph was aware that all the men standing round him had heard the story and that nothing was to be gained by an immediate attempt at concealment it behoved him above all things to be upon his metal to put a good face upon it and to be at any rate equal to the breechesmaker in presence of mind and that kind of courage which he himself would have called cheek  my money was in favour with you captain when you promised as how you would be on the square with me in regard to our polly  mr neefit said ralph speaking in a low voice but still clearly so that all around him could hear him your daughter and i can never be more to each other than we are at present she has decided that but i value her character and good name too highly to allow even you to injure them by such a discussion in a stableyard and having said this he walked away into the house  my pollys character said the infuriated breechesmaker turning round to the audience and neglecting to follow his victim in his determination to vindicate his daughter if my girls character dont stand higher nor his or any ones belonging to him ill eat it  mr newton meant to speak in favour of the young lady not against her said mr pepper  then why dont he come out on the square now gents ill tell you just the whole of it he came down to my little box where i and my missus and my girl lives quiet and decent to borrow moneyand he borrowed it he wont say as that wasnt so  and hes paid you the money back again said mr pepper  he havebut just you listen i know you mr pepper and all about you and do you listen he have paid it back but when he come there borrowing money he saw my girl and says heive got to sell that eritance of mine for just what it ll fetch thats bad captain says i it is bad says he then says he again neefit that girl of yours there is the sweetest girl as ever i put my eyes on and so she isas sweet as a rose and as honest as the sun and as good as gold i says it as oughtnt but she is its a pity neefit says he about the eritance aint it captain says ii used to call him captain cause he come down quite familiar like to eat his bit of salmon and drink his glass of wine lawshe was glad enough to come then mighty grand as he is now  i dont think hes grand at all said mr horsball  welldo you just listen gents captain says i that eritance of yourn mustnt be sold no how i says so whats the figure as is wanted well then he went on to say as how polly was the sweetest girl he ever seeand so we came to an understanding he was to have what money he wanted at once and then £20000 down when he married polly he did have a thousand and nowsee what his little game is  but the young lady wouldnt have anything to say to him suggested captain fooks who even for the sake of his breakfast could not omit to hear the last of so interesting a conversation  laws captain fooks to hear the likes of that from you who is an officer and a gentleman by act of parliament when you have anything sweet to say to a young woman does she always jump down your throat the first go off  if she dont come at the second time of asking i always go elsewhere said captain fooks  then its my opinion you have a deal of travelling to do said mr neefit and dont get much at the end of it its because hes come in for his eritance which he never would have had only for me that hes demeaning himself this fashion it aint acting the gentleman it aint the thing its off the square only for me and my money there wouldnt be an acre his this blessed minutedd if there would i saved it for him by my ready moneyjust that i might see my polly put into a station as shed make more genteel than she found it thats what she wouldshe has that manners not to talk of her being as pretty a girl as there is from here toto anywheres he made me a promise and he shall keep it ill worry the heart out of him else pay me back my money who cares for the money i can tell guineas with him now ill be bound ill put it all in the papersi will there aint a soul shant know it ill put the story of it into the pockets of every pair of breeches as leaves my shop ill send it to every m f h in the kingdom  youll about destroy your trade old fellow said mr pepper  i dont care for the trade mr pepper why have i worked like a orse its only for my girl  i suppose shes not breaking her heart for him said captain fooks  what shes a doing with her heart aint no business of yours captain fooks im her father and i know what im about ill make that young mans life a burden to him if e aint on the square with my girl you see if i dont mr orsball i want a orse to go a unting on today you lets em just tell your man to get me a orse ill pay for him  i didnt know you ever did anything in that way said mr horsball  i may begin if i please i suppose if i cant go no other way ill go on a donkey and ill tell every one thats out oh e dont know me yetdont that young gent  mr neefit did not succeed in getting any animal out of mr horsballs stables nor did he make further attempt to carry his last threat into execution on that morning mr horsball now led the way into the house while mr pepper mounted his nag captain fooks and lieutenant cox went in to their breakfast and the unfortunate father followed them it was now nearly eleven oclock and it was found that ralphs horses had been taken round to the other door and that he had already started he said very little to any one during the day though he was somewhat comforted by information conveyed to him by mr horsball in the course of the afternoon that mr neefit had returned to london you send your lawyer to him squire said mr horsball lawyers cost a deal of money but they do make things straight this suggestion had also been made to him by his brother gregory  on the following day ralph went up to london and explained all the circumstances of the case to mr carey mr carey undertook to do his best to straighten this very crooked episode in his clients life     chapter xlvii  the way which shows that they mean it   if this kind of thing were to go on life wouldnt be worth having that was the feeling of ralph the squire of newton as he returned on that saturday from london to the moonbeam and so far mr neefit had been successful in carrying out his threat neefit had sworn that he would make the young mans life a burden to him and the burden was already becoming unbearable mr carey had promised to do something he would at any rate see the infatuated breechesmaker of conduit street in the meantime he had suggested one remedy of which ralph had thought beforeif you were married to some one else hed give it up mr carey had suggested that no doubt was true  ralph completed his sojourn at the moonbeam leaving that place at the end of the first week in april took a run down to his own place and then settled himself up to london for the season his brother gregory had at this time returned to the parsonage at newton but there was an understanding that he was to come up to london and be his brothers guest for the first fortnight in may ralph the heir had taken larger rooms and had a spare chamber when ralph had given this invitation he had expressed his determination of devoting his spring in town to an assiduous courtship of mary bonner at the moment in which he made that assertion down at newton the nuisance of the neefit affair was less intolerable to him than it had since become he had spoken cheerily of his future prospects declaring himself to be violently in love with mary though he declared at the same time that he had no idea of breaking his heart for any young woman that last assertion was probably true  as for living in the great house at the priory all alone that he had declared to be impossible of course he would be at home for the hunting next winter but he doubted whether he should be there much before that time unless a certain coming event should make it necessary for him to go down and look after things he thought it probable that he should take a run abroad in july perhaps go to norway for the fishing in june he was already making arrangements with two other men for a move in august he might be at home for partridge shooting about the middle of september but he shouldnt go into residence at newton before that thus he had spoken of it in describing his plans to his brother putting great stress on his intention to devote the spring months to the lovely mary gregory had seen nothing wrong in all this ralph was now a rich man and was entitled to amuse himself gregory would have wished that his brother would at once make himself happy among his own tenants and dependents but that no doubt would come soon ralph did spend two nights at newton after the scene with neefit in the moonbeam yardjust that he might see his nags safe in their new quartersand then went up to london he was hardly yet strong in heart because such a trouble as that which vexed him in regard to polly does almost make a mans life a burden ralph was gifted with much aptitude for throwing his troubles behind but he hardly was yet able to rid himself of this special trouble that horrid tradesman was telling his story to everybody sir thomas underwood knew the story and so he thought did mary bonner mary bonner in truth did not know it but she had thrown in ralphs teeth as an accusation against him that he owed himself and his affections to another girl and ralph utterly forgetful of clarissa and that now longdistant scene on the lawn had believed and still did believe that mary had referred to polly neefit on the 10th of april he established himself at his new rooms in spring gardens and was careful in seeing that there was a comfortable little bedroom for his brother greg his uncle had now been dead just six months but he felt as though he had been the owner of the newton estate for years if mr carey could only settle for him that trouble with mr neefit how happy his life would be to him he was very much in love with mary bonner but his trouble with mr neefit was of almost more importance to him than his love for mary bonner  in the meantime the girls were living as usual at popham villa and sir thomas was living as usual in southampton buildings he and his colleague had been unseated but it had already been decided by the house of commons that no new writ should be at once issued and that there should be a commission appointed to make extended inquiry at percycross in reference to the contemplated disfranchisement of the borough there could be no possible connexion between this inquiry and the expediency of sir thomas living at home but after some fashion he reconciled further delay to his conscience by the fact that the percycross election was not even yet quite settled no doubt it would be necessary that he should again go to percycross during the sitting of the commission  the reader will remember the interview between gregory newton and clarissa in which poor clary had declared with so much emphasis her certainty that his brothers suit to mary must be fruitless this she had said with artless energy in no degree on her own behalf she was hopeless now in that direction and had at last taught herself to feel that the man was unworthy the lesson had reached her though she herself was ignorant not only of the manner of the teaching but of the very fact that she had been taught she had pleaded more than once that men did such things and were yet held in favour and forgiven let their iniquities have been what they might she had hoped to move others by the doctrine but gradually it had ceased to be operative even on herself she could not tell how it was that her passion faded and died away it can hardly be said that it died away but it became to herself grievous and a cause of soreness instead of a joy and a triumph she no longer said even to herself that he was to be excused he had come there and had made a mere plaything of herwilfully there was no earnestness in him no manliness and hardly common honesty a conviction that it was so had crept into her poor wounded heart in spite of those repeated assertions which she had made to patience as to the persistency of her own affection first dismay and then wrath had come upon her when the man who ought to be her lover came to the very house in which she was living and there offered his hand to another girl almost in her very presence had the sin been committed elsewhere and with any rival other than her own cousin she might have still clung to that doctrine of forgiveness because the sinner was a man and because it is the way of the world to forgive men but the insult had been too close for pardon and now her wrath was slowly changing itself to contempt had mary accepted the mans offer this phase of feeling would not have occurred clarissa would have hated the woman but still might have loved the man but mary had treated him as a creature absolutely beneath her notice had evidently despised him and marys scorn communicated itself to clarissa the fact that ralph was now newton of newton absolutely in harbour after so many dangers of shipwreck assisted her in this i would have been true to him though he hadnt had a penny she said to herself i would never have given him up though all the world had been against him debts difficulties an inheritance squandered idle habits even profligacy should not have torn him from her heart had he possessed the one virtue of meaning what he said when he told her that he loved her she remembered the noble triumph she had felt when she declared to mary that that other ralph who was to have been marys lover was welcome to the fine property her sole ambition had been to be loved by this man but the man had been incapable of loving her she herself was pretty and soft bright on occasions and graceful she knew so much of herself and she knew also that mary was far prettier than herself and more clever this young man to whom she had devoted herself possessed no power of love for an individualno capability of so joining himself to another human being as to feel that in spite of any superiority visible to the outside world that one should be esteemed by him superior to all othersbecause of his love the young man had liked prettiness and softness and grace and feminine nicenesses and seeing one who was prettier and more gracefulall which poor clary allowed though she was not so sure about the softness and nicenesshad changed his aim without an effort ah how different was poor gregory  she thought much of gregory reminding herself that as was her sorrow in regard to her own crushed hopes so were his his hopes too had been crushed because she had been so obdurate to him but she had never been false she had never whispered a word of love to gregory it might be that his heart was as sore but he had not been injured as she had been injured she despised the owner of newton priory she would scorn him should he come again to her and throw himself at her feet but gregory could not despise her she had indeed preferred the bad to the good there had been lack of judgment but there had been on her side no lack of truth yesshe had been wrong in her choice her judgment had been bad and yet how glorious he had looked as he lay upon the lawn hot from his rowing all unbraced brown and bold and joyous as a young god as he bade her go and fetch him drink to slake his thirst how proud then she had been to be ordered by him as though their mutual intimacies and confidences and loves were sufficient when they too were alone together to justify a reversal of those social rules by which the man is ordered to wait upon the woman there is nothing in the first flush of acknowledged love that is sweeter to the woman than this all the men around her are her servants but in regard to this man she may have the inexpressibly greater pleasure of serving him herself clarissa had now thought much of these things and had endeavoured to define to herself what had been those gifts belonging to ralph which had won from her her heart he was not in truth handsomer than his brother gregory was certainly less clever was selfish in small things from habit whereas gregory had no thought for his own comfort it had all come from thisthat a black coat and a grave manner of life and serious pursuits had been less alluring to her than idleness and pleasure it had suited her that her young god should be joyous unbraced brown bold and thirsty she did not know popes famous line but it all lay in that she was innocent pure unknowing in the ways of vice simple in her tastes conscientious in her duties and yet she was a rake at hearttill at last sorrow and disappointment taught her that it is not enough that a man should lie loose upon the grass with graceful negligence and call for sodawater with a pleasant voice gregory wore black clothes was sombre and was a parsonbut oh what a thing it is that a man should be true at heart  she said nothing of her changing feelings to mary or even to patience the household at this time was not very gay or joyous sir thomas after infinite vexation had lost the seat of which they had all been proud mary bonners condition was not felt to be deplorable as was that of poor clary and she certainly did not carry herself as a lovelorn maiden of mary bonner it may be said that no disappointment of that kind would affect her outward manner nor would she in any strait of love be willing to make a confidence or to discuss her feelings whatever care of that kind might be present to her would be lightened if not made altogether as nothing by her conviction that such loads should be carried in silence and without any visible sign to the world that the muscles are overtaxed but it was known that the banished ralph had in the moment of his expected prosperity declared his purpose of giving all that he had to give to this beauty and it was believed that she would have accepted the gift it had therefore come to pass that the name of neither ralph could be mentioned at the cottage and that life among these maidens was sober sedate and melancholy at last there came a note from sir thomas to patience i shall be home to dinner tomorrow i found the enclosed from r n this morning i suppose he must come affectionately t u the enclosed note was as followsdear sir thomas i called this morning but old stemm was as hard as granite if you do not object i will run down to the villa tomorrow if you are at home i will stay and dine yours ever ralph newton  the mind of sir thomas when he received this had been affected exactly as his words described he had supposed that ralph must come he had learned to hold his late ward in low esteem the man was now beyond all likelihood of want and sailing with propitious winds but sir thomas had he been able to consult his own inclinations would have had no more to do with him and yet the young squire had not done anything which as sir thomas thought would justify him in closing his doors against one to whom he had been bound in a manner peculiarly intimate however if his niece should choose at last to accept ralph the match would be very brilliant and the uncle thought that it was not his duty to interfere between her and so great an advantage sir thomas in truth did not as yet understand mary bonnerknew very little of her character but he did know that it was incumbent on him to give her some opportunity of taking her beauty to market he wrote a line to ralph saying that he himself would dine at home on the day indicated  impossible said clary when she was first told  you may be sure hes coming said patience  then i shall go and spend the day with mrs brownlow i cannot stand it  my dear hell know why you are away  let him know said clarissa and she did as she said she would when sir thomas came home at about four oclock on the thursday which ralph had fixedthursday the fourteenth of aprilhe found that clarissa had flown the fly was to be sent for her at ten and it was calculated that by the time she returned ralph would certainly have taken his leave sir thomas expressed neither anger nor satisfaction at this arrangementoh she has gone to mrs brownlows has she very well i dont suppose it will make much difference to ralph none in the least said patience severely nothing of that kind will make any difference to him but at that time ralph had been above an hour in the house  we will now return to ralph and his adventures he had come up to london with the express object of pressing his suit upon mary bonner but during his first day or two in london had busied himself rather with the affairs of his other love he had been with mr carey and mr carey had been with mr neefit he is the maddest old man that i ever saw said mr carey when i suggested to him that you were willing to make any reasonable arrangementmeaning a thousand pounds or something of that kindi couldnt get him to understand me at all  i dont think he wants money said ralph  let him come down and eat a bit of dinner at the cottage said he and well make it all square then i offered him a thousand pounds down  what did he say  called to a fellow he had there with a knife in his hand cutting leather to turn me out of the shop and the man would have done it too if i hadnt gone  this was not promising but on the following morning ralph received a letter which put him into better heart the letter was from polly herself and was written as follows      alexandra cottage hendon    april 10th 186     my dear sir     father has been going on with all that nonsense of his    and i think it most straightforward to write a letter    to you at once so that things may be understood and    finished father has no right to be angry with you anyway    not about me he says somebody has come and offered him    money i wish they hadnt but perhaps you didnt send    them theres no good in father talking about you and    me of course it was a great honour and all that but    im not at all sure that anybody should try to get above    themselves not in the way of marrying and the heart is    everything so ive told father if ever i bestow mine i    think it will be to somebody in a way of businessjust    like father so i thought i would just write to say that    there couldnt be anything between you and me were it    ever so only that i was very much honoured by your coming    down to margate i write this to you because a very    particular friend advises me and i dont mind telling you    at onceit is mr moggs and i shall show it to father    that is i have written it twice and shall keep the    other its a pity father should go on so but he means it    for the best and as to anything in the way of moneyoh    mr newton hes a deal too proud for that     yours truly     maryanne neefit   as to which letter the little baggage was not altogether true in one respect she did not keep a copy of the whole letter but left out of that which she showed to her father the very material passage in which she referred to the advice of her particular friend mr moggs ralph when he received this letter felt really grateful to polly and wrote to her a pretty note in which he acknowledged her kindness and expressed his hope that she might always be as happy as she deserved to be then it was that he made up his mind to go down at once to popham villa thinking that the neefit nuisance was sufficiently abated to enable him to devote his time to a more pleasurable pursuit  he reached the villa between three and four and learned from the gardeners wife at the lodge that sir thomas had not as yet returned he did not learn that clarissa was away and was not aware of that fact till they all sat down to dinner at seven oclock much had been done and much endured before that time came he sauntered slowly up the road and looked about the grounds hoping to find the young ladies there as he had so often done during his summer visits but there was no one to be seen and he was obliged to knock at the door he was shown into the drawingroom and in a few minutes patience came to him there had been no arrangement between her and mary as to the manner in which he should be received mary on a previous occasion had given him an answer and really did believe that that would be sufficient he was according to her thinking a light inconstant man who would hardly give himself the labour necessary for perseverance in any suit patience at once began to ask him after his brother and the doings at the priory he had been so intimate at the house and so dear to them all that in spite of the disapprobation with which he was now regarded by them it was impossible that there should not be some outer kindness ah said he i do so look forward to the time when you will all be down there i have been so often welcome at your house that it will be my greatest pleasure to make you welcome there  we go so little from home said patience  but i am sure you will come to me i know you would like to see gregs parsonage and gregs church  i should indeed  it is the prettiest church i think in england and the park is very nice the whole house wants a deal of doing to but i shall set about it some day i dont know a pleasanter neighbourhood anywhere it would have been so natural that patience should tell him that he wanted a mistress for such a home but she could not say the words she could not find the proper words and soon left him muttering something as to directions for her fathers room  he had been alone for twenty minutes when mary came into the room she knew that patience was not there and had retreated upstairs but there seemed to be a cowardice in such retreating which displeased herself she at any rate had no cause to be afraid of mr newton so she collected her thoughts and arranged her gait and went down and addressed him with assumed indifferenceas though there had never been anything between them beyond simple acquaintance uncle thomas will be here soon i suppose she said  i hope he will give me halfanhour first ralph answered there was an ease and grace always present in his intercourse with women and a power of saying that which he desired to saywhich perhaps arose from the slightness of his purposes and the want of reality in his character  we see so little of him that we hardly know his hours said mary uncle thomas is a sad truant from home  he always was and i declare i think that patience and clary have been the better for it they have learned things of which they would have known nothing had he been with them every morning and evening i dont know any girls who are so sweet as they are you know they have been like sisters to me  so i have been told  and when you came it would have been like another sister coming only  only what said mary assuming purposely a savage look  that something else intervened  of course it must be very differentand it should be different you have only known me a few months  i have known you enough to wish to know you more closely than anybody else for the rest of my life  mr newton i thought you had understood me before  so i did this he said with an assumed tone of lachrymose complaint i did understand youthoroughly i understood that i was rebuked and rejected and disdained but a man if he is in earnest does not give over on that account indeed there are things which he cant give over you may tell a man that he shouldnt drink or shouldnt gamble but telling will do no good when he has once begun hell go on with it  what does that mean  that love is as strong a passion at any rate as drinking or gambling you did tell me and sent me away and rebuked me because of that tradesmans daughter  what tradesmans daughter asked mary i have spoken of no tradesmans daughter i gave you ample reason why you should not address yourself to me  of course there are ample reasons said ralph looking into his hat which he had taken from the table the onemost ample of all is that you do not care for me  i do not said mary resolutely  exactlybut that is a sort of reason which a man will do his best to conquer do not misunderstand me i am not such a fool as to think that i can prevail in a day i am not vain enough to think that i can prevail at all but i can persist  it will not be of the slightest use indeed it cannot be allowed i will not allow it my uncle will not allow it  when you told me that i was untrue to another person i think that was your phrase  very likely  i supposed you had heard that stupid story which had got round to my uncleabout a mr neefits daughter  i had heard no stupid story  what then did you mean  mary paused a moment thinking whether it might still be possible that a good turn might be done for her cousin that clarissa had loved this man with her whole heart she had herself owned to mary that the man had professed his love for clary clary had also let her know and clarys love had endured even after the blow it had received from ralphs offer to her cousin all this that cousin knew but she did not know how that love had now turned to simple soreness i have heard nothing of the mans daughter said mary  well then  but i do know that before i came here at all you had striven to gain the affections of my cousin  clarissa  yes clarissa is it not so then she paused and ralph remembered the scene on the lawn in very truth it had never been forgotten there had always been present with him when he thought of mary bonner a sort of remembrance of the hour in which he had played the fool with dear clary he had kissed her well yes and with some girls kisses mean so muchas polly neefit had said to her true lover but then with others they mean just nothing if you want to find a wife in this house you had better ask her it is certainly useless that you should ask me  do you mean quite useless asked ralph beginning to be somewhat abashed  absolutely useless did i not tell you something elsesomething that i would not have hinted to you had it not been that i desired to prevent the possibility of a renewal of anything so vain but you think nothing of that all that can be changed with you at a moment if other things suit  that is meant to be severe miss bonner and i have not deserved it from you what has brought me to you but that i admire you above all others  you shouldnt admire me above others is a man to change as he likes because he sees a girl whose hair pleases him for the moment better than does hers to whom he has sworn to be true ralph did not forget at this moment to whisper to himself for his own consolation that he had never sworn to be true to clarissa and indeed he did feel that though there had been a kiss the scene on the lawn was being used unfairly to his prejudice i am afraid you are very fickle mr newton and that your love is not worth much  i hope we may both live till you learn that you have wronged me  i hope so if my opinion be worth anything with you go back to her from whom you have allowed yourself to stray in your folly to me you must not address yourself again if you do it will be an insult then she rose up queenly in her beauty and slowly left the room  there must be an end of that such was ralphs feeling as she left the room in spite of those protestations of constancy and persistence which he had made to himself a fellow has to go on with it and be refused half a dozen times by one of those proud ones he had said but when they do knuckle under they go in harness better than the others it was thus that he had thought of mary bonner but he did not so think of her now no indeed there was an end of that there is a sort of way of doing it which shows that they mean it such was his inward speech and he did believe that miss bonner meant it by jove yes if words and looks ever can mean anything but how about clarissa if it was so as mary bonner had told him would it be the proper kind of thing for him to go back to clarissa his heart toofor he had a heartwas very soft he had always been fond of clarissa and would not for worlds that she should be unhappy how pretty she was and how soft and how loving and how proudly happy she would be to be driven about the newton grounds by him as their mistress then he remembered what gregory had said to him and how he had encouraged gregory to persevere if anything of that kind were to happen gregory must put up with it it was clear that clarissa couldnt marry gregory if she were in love with him but how would he look sir thomas in the face as he thought of this he laughed sir thomas however would be glad enough to give his daughter not to the heir but to the owner of newton who could be that fellow whom mary bonner preferred to himwith all newton to back his suit perhaps mary bonner did not know the meaning of being the mistress of newton priory  after a while the servant came to show him to his chamber sir thomas had come and had gone at once to his room so he went upstairs and dressed expecting to see clarissa when they all assembled before dinner when he went down sir thomas was there and mary and patiencebut not clarissa he had summoned back his courage and spoke jauntily to sir thomas then he turned to patience and asked after her sister clarissa is spending the day with mrs brownlow said patience and will not be home till quite late  oh how unfortunate exclaimed ralph taking all his difficulties into consideration we must admit that he did not do it badly  after dinner sir thomas sat longer over his wine than is at present usual believing perhaps that the young ladies would not want to see much more of ralph on the present occasion the conversation was almost entirely devoted to the affairs of the late election as to which ralph was much interested and very indignant they cannot do you any harm sir by the investigation he said  no i dont think they can hurt me  and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have been the means of exposing corruption and of helping to turn such a man as griffenbottom out of the house upon my word i think it has been worth while  i am not sure that i would do it again at the same cost and with the same object said sir thomas  ralph did have a cup of tea given to him in the drawingroom and then left the villa before clarissas fly had returned     chapter xlviii  mr moggs walks towards edgeware   the judges decision in percycross as to the late election was no sooner known than fresh overtures were made to ontario moggs by the young mens association a letter of triumph was addressed to him at the cheshire cheese in which he was informed that intimidation and corruption had been trodden under foot in the infamous person of mr griffenbottom and that purity and the rights of labour were still the watchwords of that wholesome party in the borough which was determined to send mr moggs to parliament did not mr moggs think it best that he should come down at once to the borough and look after his interests now mr moggs junior when he received this letter had left the borough no more than three or four days since having been summoned there as a witness during the trial of the petitionand such continued attendance to the political interests of a small and otherwise uninteresting town without the advantage of a seat in parliament was felt by mr moggs senior to be a nuisance the expense in all these matters fell of course upon the shoulders of the father i dont believe in them humbugs no longer said mr moggs senior moggs junior who had felt the enthusiasm of the young men of percycross and who had more to get and less to lose than his father did believe although he had been so lately at percycross he went down again and again made speeches to the young men at the mechanics institute nothing could be more triumphant than his speeches nothing more pleasant than his popularity but he could not fail to become aware after a further sojourn of three days at percycross of two things the first was thisthat if the borough were spared there would be a compromise between the leading men on the two sides and mr westmacott would be returned together with a young griffenbottom the second conviction forced upon him was that the borough would not be spared there was no comfort for him at percycrossother than what arose from a pure political conscience on the very morning on which he left he besought his friends the young menthough they were about to be punished degraded and disfranchised for the sins of their elders though it might never be allowed to them again to stir themselves for the political welfare of their own boroughstill to remember that purity and the rights of labour were the two great wants of the world and that no man could make an effort however humble in a good cause without doing something towards bringing nearer to him that millennium of political virtue which was so much wanted and which would certainly come sooner or later he was cheered to the echo and almost carried down to the station on the shoulders of a chairman or president and a secretary but he left percycross with the conviction that that borough would never confer upon him the coveted honour of a seat in parliament  all this had happened early in march previous to that sunday on which mr neefit behaved so rudely to him at the cottage i think as perhaps youd better stick to business now a bit said old moggs at that moment ontario was sitting up at a high desk behind the ledger which he hated and was sticking to business as well as he knew how to stick to it no more cheshire cheeses if you please young man said the father this was felt by the son to be unfair cruel and even corrupt while the election was going on as long as there was a hope of success at percycross moggs senior had connived at the cheshire cheese had said little or nothing about business had even consented on one occasion to hear his son make a speech advocating the propriety of combination among workmen it aint my way of thinking moggs senior had said but then perhaps im old to have had a member of the firm in parliament would have been glorious even to old moggs though he hardly knew in what the glory would have consisted but as soon as he found that his hopes were vain that the cheshire cheese had been no steppingstone to such honour and that his money had been spent for nothing his mind reverted to its old form strikes became to him the work of the devil and unions were once more the bane of trade  i suppose said ontario looking up from his ledger if i work for my bread by day i may do as i please with my evenings at any rate i shall he continued to say after pausing awhile its best we should understand each other father moggs senior growled at a word his son would have been off from him rushing about the country striving to earn a crust as a political lecturer moggs knew his son well and in truth loved him dearly there was too a miss moggs at home who would give her father no peace if ontario were turned adrift there is nothing in the world so cruel as the way in which sons use the natural affections of their fathers obtaining from these very feelings a power of rebelling against authority you must go to the devil if you please i suppose said moggs senior  i dont know why you say that what do i do devilish  them unions is devilish  i think theyre godlike said moggs junior after that they were silent for a while during which moggs senior was cutting his nails with a shoemakers knife by the fading light of the evening and moggs junior was summing up an account against a favoured aristocrat who seemed to have worn a great many boots but who was noticeable to ontario chiefly from the fact that he represented in parliament the division of the county in which percycross was situated i thought you was going to make it all straight by marrying that girl said moggs senior  here was a subject on which the father and the son were in unisonand as to which the romantic heart of miss moggs at home at shepherds bush always glowed with enthusiasm that her brother was in love was to her of whom in truth it must be owned that she was very plain the charm of her life she was fond of poetry and would read to her brother aloud the story of juan and haidee and the melancholy condition of the lady who was loved by the veiled prophet she sympathised with the false queens passion for launcelot and being herself in truth an ugly old maid very far removed from things romantic delighted in the affairs of the heart when they did not run smooth o ontario she would say be true to herif its for twenty years so i willbut id like to begin the twenty years by making her mrs moggs said ontario now mr moggs senior knew to a penny what money old neefit could give his daughter and placed not the slightest trust in that threat about the smock in which she stood upright polly would certainly get the better of her father as ontario always got the better of him ontario made no immediate reply to his father but he found himself getting all wrong among the boots and shoes which had been supplied to that aristocratic young member of parliament you dont mean as its all off asked moggs senior  no it isnt all off  then why dont you go in at it  why dont i go in at it said ontario closing the book in hopeless confusion of mind and figures id give every pair of boots in this place id give all the business to get a kind word from her  isnt she kind  kindyes shes kind enough in a way shes everything just what she ought to be thats what she is dont you go on about it father im as much in earnest as you can be i shant give it up till she calls somebody else her husband and then why then i shall just cut it and go off to uncle in canada ive got my mind made up about all that and so he left the shop somewhat uncourteously perhaps but he had worked his way back into his fathers good graces by his determination to stick to neefits girl a young man ought to be allowed to attend trades unions or any other meetings if he will marry a girl with twenty thousand pounds that evening ontario moggs went to the cheshire cheese and was greater than ever  it has been already told how on a sunday subsequent to this he managed to have himself almost closeted with polly and how he was working himself into her good graces when he was disturbed by mr neefit and turned out of the house pollys heart had been yielding during the whole of that interview there had come upon her once a dream that it would be a fine thing to be the lady of newtonand the chance had been hers but when she set herself to work to weigh it all and to find out what it was that young newton really wantedand what he ought to want she shook off from herself that dream before it had done her any injury she meant to be married certainly as to that she had no doubt but then ontario moggs was such a longlegged awkward ugly shambling fellow and moggs as a name was certainly not euphonious the gasfitter was handsome and was called yallolegs which perhaps was better than moggs he had proposed to her more than once but the gasfitters face meant nothing and the gasfitter himself hadnt much meaning in him as to outside appearance young newtons was just what he ought to bebut that was a dream which she had shaken off onty moggs had some meaning in him and was a man if there was one thing too under the sun of which polly was quite sure it was thisthat onty moggs did really love her she knew that in the heart and mind and eyes of onty moggs she possessed a divinity which made the ground she stood upon holy ground for him now that is a conviction very pleasant to a young woman  ontario was very near his victory on that sunday when he told her that he would compass the death of ralph newton if ralph newton was to cause her to break her heart she believed that he would do it and she felt obliged to himalthough she laughed at him when he declared to her that he didnt know what to do because of his love she was near to telling him what he might do when he told her that he would sooner have a kiss from her than be prime minister she believed him and almost longed to make him happy then she had tripped giving him encouragement which she did not intendand had retreated telling him that he was silly but as she said so she made up her mind that he should be perplexed not much longer after all in spite of his ugliness and awkwardness and long legs this was to be her man she recognised the fact and was happy it is so much for a girl to be sure that she is really loved and there was no word which fell from ontarios mouth which polly did not believe ralph newtons speeches were very pretty but they conveyed no more than his intention to be civil ontarios speeches really brought home to her all that the words could mean when he told her father that he was quite contented to take her just as she was without a shilling she knew that he would do so with the utmost joy then it was that she resolved that he should have her and that for the future all doubtings all flirtations all coyness should be over she had been won and she lowered her flag you stick to it and youll do it she saidand this time she meant it i shall said ontarioand he walked all the way back to london with his head among the clouds disregarding percycross utterly forgetful of all the boots and aristocrats accounts regardless almost of the cheshire cheese not even meditating a new speech in defence of the rights of labour he believed that on that day he had gained the great victory if so life before him was one vista of triumph that he himself was what the world calls romantic he had no ideabut he had lived now for months on the conviction that the only chance of personal happiness to himself was to come from the smiles and kindness and love of a certain human being whom he had chosen to beatify to him polly neefit was divine and round him also there would be a halo of divinity if this goddess would consent to say that she would become his wife  it was impossible that many days should be allowed to pass before he made an effort to learn from her own lips positively the meaning of those last words which she had spoken to him but there was a difficulty neefit had warned him from the house and he felt unwilling to knock at the door of a man in that mans absence who if present would have refused to him the privilege of admittance that mrs neefit would see him and afford him opportunity of pleading his cause with polly he did not doubtbut some idea that a mans house being his castle should not be invaded in the owners absence restrained him that the mans daughter might be the dearer and the choicer and the more sacred castle of the two was true enough but then polly was a castle which as moggs thought ought to belong to him rather than to her father and so he resolved to waylay polly  his weekdays from nine in the morning till seven in the evening were at this time due to booby and moggs and he was at present paying that debt religiously under a conviction that his various absences at percycross had been hard upon his father for there was in truth no booby moggs senior and moggs junior constituted the whole firmin which indeed up to this moment moggs junior had no recognised shareand if one was absent the other must be present but sunday was his own and polly neefit always went to church nevertheless on the first sunday he failed he failed though he saw her walking with two other ladies and though to the best of his judgment she also saw him on the second sunday he was at hendon from ten till three hanging about in the lanes sitting on gates whiling away the time with a treatise on political economy which he had brought down in his pocket thinking of polly while he strove to confine his thoughts to the great subject of mans productive industry is there any law of naturelaw of god ratherby which a man has a right to enough of food enough of raiment enough of shelter and enough of recreation if only he will work but pollys cheeks and pollys lips the eager fire of pollys eye as she would speak and all the elastic beauty of pollys gait as she would walk drove the great question from his mind was he ever destined to hold polly in his armsclose close to his breast if not then the laws of nature and the laws of god let them be what they might would not have been sufficient to protect him from the cruellest wrong of all  it was as she went to afternoon church that he hoped to intercept her morning church with many is a bond afternoon church is a virtue of supererogationpractised often because there is nothing else to do it would be out of the question that he should induce her to give up the morning service but if he could only come upon her in the afternoon a little out of sight of others just as she would turn down a lane with which he was acquainted near to a stile leading across the fields towards edgeware it might be possible that he should prevail as the hour came near he put the useless volume into his pocket and stationed himself on the spot which he had selected almost at the first moment in which he had ventured to hope for her presence polly turned into the lane it was six months after this occurrence that she confessed to him that she had thought it just possible that he might be there of course you would be thereyou old goose as if jemima hadnt told me that youd been about all day but i never should have come if i hadnt quite made up my mind then ontario administered to her one of those bears hugs which were wont to make polly declare that he was an ogre it was thus that polly made her confession after the six months as they were sitting very close to each other on some remote point of the cliffs down on the kentish coast at that time the castle had been altogether transferred out of the keeping of mr neefit  but pollys conduct on this occasion was not at all of a nature to make it supposed that jemimas eyes had been so sharp what mr moggs she said dear me what a place to find you in are you coming to church  i want you just to take a turn with me for a few minutes polly  but im going to church  you can go to church afterwardsthat is if you like i cant come to the house now and i have got something that i must say to you  something that you must say to me and then polly followed him over the stile  they had walked the length of nearly two fields before ontario had commenced to tell the tale which of necessity must be told but polly though she must have known that her chances of getting back to church were becoming more and more remote waited without impatience i want to know he said at last whether you can ever learn to love me  whats the use mr moggs  it will be all the use in the world to me  oh no it wont it cant signify so very much to anybody  nothing i sometimes think can ever be of any use to me but that  as for learning to love a mani suppose i could love a man without any learning if i liked him  but you dont like me polly  i never said i didnt like you father and mother always used to like you  but you polly  oh i like you well enough dont mr moggs  but do you love me then there was a pause as they stood leaning upon a gateway come polly tell a fellow do you love me  i dont know then there was another pause but he was in a seventh heaven with his arm round her waist i suppose i do a little whispered polly  but better than anybody else  you dont think i mean to have two loversdo you  and i am to be your lover  theres father you know im not going to be anybodys wife because he tells me but i wouldnt like to vex him if we could help it  but youll never belong to any one else  never said she solemnly  then ive said what ive got to say and im the happiest man in all the world and you may go to church now if you like but his arm was still tight round her waist  its too late said polly in a melancholy toneand its all your doing  the walk was prolonged not quite to edgeware but so far that mr neefit was called upon to remark that the parson was preaching a very long sermon mrs neefit who perhaps had also had communication with jemima remarked that it was not to be expected but that polly should take a ramble with some of her friends why cant she ramble where i want her to ramble said mr neefit  many things were settled during that walk within five minutes of the time in which she had declared that it was too late for her to go to church she had brought herself to talk to him with all the delightful confidence of a completed engagement she made him understand at once that there was no longer any doubt a girl must have time to know she said when he halfreproached her with the delay a girl wasnt like a man she said who could just make up his mind at oncea girl had to wait and see but she was quite sure of thisthat having once said the word she would never go back from it she didnt quite know when she had first begun to love him but she thought it was when she heard that he had made up his mind to stand for percycross it seemed to her to be such a fine thinghis going to percycross then said ontario gallantly percycross has done ten times more for me than it would have done had it simply made me a member of parliament once twice and oftener he was made happier than he could have been had fortune made him a prime minister for polly now that she had given her heart and promised her hand would not coy her lips to the man she had chosen  many things were settled between them polly told her lover all her trouble about ralph newton and it was now that she received that advice from her very particular friend mr moggs which she followed in writing to her late suitor the letter was to be written and posted that afternoon and then shown to her father we know already that in making the copy for her father she omitted one clausehaving resolved that she would tell her mother of her engagement and that her mother should communicate it to her father as for naming any day for their marriage that was out of the question she said she did not wish to delay it but all that she could do was to swear to her father that she would never marry anybody else and hell believe me too said polly as for eloping she would not hear of it just that he might have an excuse to give his money to somebody else she said  i dont care for his money protested moggs  thats all very well but moneys a good thing in its way i hate a man whod sell himself hes a mean fellowor a girl either money should never be first but as for pitching it away just because youre in a hurry i dont believe in that at all im not going to be an old woman yet and you may wait a few months very well she walked with him direct up to the gate leading up to their own houseso that all the world might see her if all the world pleased and then she bade him goodbye some day before very long no doubt she said when as he left her he asked as to their next meeting  and so polly had engaged herself i do not know that the matter seemed to her to be of so much importance as it does to many girls it was a piece of business which had to be done some day as she had well known for years past and now that it was done she was quite contented with the doing of it but there was not much of that ecstasy in her bosom which was at the present moment sending ontario moggs bounding up to town talking as he went to himselfto the amazement of passers by and assuring himself that he had triumphed like an alexander or a cæsar she made some steady resolves to do her duty by him and told herself again and again that nothing should ever move her now that she had decided as for beauty in a manwhat did it signify he was honest as for awkwardnesswhat did it matter he was clever and in regard to being a gentleman she rather thought that she liked him better because he wasnt exactly what some people call a gentleman whatever sort of a home he would give her to live in nobody would despise her in it because she was not grand enough for her place she was by no means sure that a good deal of misery of that kind might not have fallen to her lot had she become the mistress of newton priory when the beggar woman became a queen how the servants must have snubbed her said polly to herself  that evening she showed her letter to her father you havent sent it you minx said he  yes father its in the iron box  what business had you to write to a young man  come father i had a business  i believe you want to break my heart said old neefit  that evening her mother asked her what she had been doing that afternoon i just took a walk with ontario moggs said polly  well  and ive just engaged myself straight off and you had better tell father i mean to keep to it mother let anybody say anything i wouldnt go back from my promise if they were to drag me so father may as well know at once     chapter xlix  among the pictures   norfolk is a county by no means devoted to hunting and ralph newtonthe disinherited ralph as we may call himhad been advised by some of his friends round newton to pitch his tent elsewherebecause of his love of that sport youll get a bit of land just as cheap in the shires morris had said to him and if i were you i wouldnt go among a set of fellows who dont think of anything in the world except partridges mr morris who was a very good fellow in his way devoted a considerable portion of his mental and physical energies to the birth rearing education preservation and subsequent use of the foxthinking that in so doing he employed himself nobly as a country gentleman but he thoroughly despised a county in which partridges were worshipped  they do preserve foxes pleaded ralph  one man does and the next dont you ought to know what that means its the most heartbreaking kind of thing in the world id sooner be without foxes altogether and ride to a dragi would indeed this assertion mr morris made in a sadly solemn tone such as men use when they speak of some adversity which fate and fortune may be preparing for them id a deal rather die than bear it says the melancholy friend orid much sooner put up with a crust in a corner id rather ride to a dragi would indeed said mr morris with a shake of the head and a low sigh as for life without riding to hounds at all mr morris did not for a moment suppose that his friend contemplated such an existence  but ralph had made up his mind that in going out into the world to do something foxes should not be his first object he had to seek a home certainly but more important than his home was the work to which he should give himself and as he had once said he knew nothing useful that he could do except till the land so he went down into norfolk among the intermittent fox preservers and took beamingham hall  almost every place in norfolk is a ham and almost every house is a hall there was a parish of beamingham four miles from swaffham lying between tillham soham reepham and grindham its down in all the maps its as flat as a pancake it has a church with a magnificent square tower and a new chancel there is a resident parson and there are four or five farmers in it it is under the plough throughout and is famous for its turnips half the parish belongs to a big lord who lives in the county and who does preserve foxes but not with all his heart two other farms are owned by the yeomen who farm themmen who have been brought up to shoot and who hate the very name of hunting beamingham hall was to be sold and by the beginning of may ralph newton had bought it beamingham little wood belonged to the estate and as it contained about thirty acres ralph determined that he would endeavour to have a fox there  by the middle of may he had been four months in his new home the house itself was not bad it was spacious and the rooms though low were large and it had been built with considerable idea of architectural beauty the windows were all set in stone and mullionedlong low windows very beautiful in form which had till some fifteen years back been filled with a multitude of small diamond panesbut now the diamond panes had given way to plate glass there were three gables to the hall all facing an oldfashioned large garden in which the fruit trees came close up to the house and that which perhaps ought to have been a lawn was almost an orchard but there were trim gravel walks and trim flowerbeds and a trim fishpond and a small walled kitchengarden with very old peaches and very old apricots and very old plums the plums however were at present better than the peaches or the apricots the fault of the house as a modern residence consisted in thisthat the farmyard with all its appurtenances was very close to the back door ralph told himself when he first saw it that mary bonner would never consent to live in a house so placed  for whom was such a house as beamingham hall originally builta house not grand enough for a squires mansion and too large for a farmers homestead such houses throughout england are much more numerous than englishmen thinkeither still in good repair as was beamingham hall or going into decay under the lessened domestic wants of the present holders it is especially so in the eastern counties and may be taken as one proof among many that the broadacred squire with his throng of tenants is comparatively a modern invention the country gentleman of two hundred years ago farmed the land he held as years have rolled on the strong have swallowed the weakone strong man having eaten up halfadozen weak men and so the squire has been made then the strong squire becomes a baronet and a lordtill he lords it a little too much and a manchester warehouseman buys him out the strength of the country probably lies in the fact that the change is ever being made but is never made suddenly  to ralph the great objection to beamingham hall lay in that fearor rather certaintythat it could not be made a fitting home for mary bonner when he first decided on taking it and even when he decided on buying it he assured himself that mary bonners taste might be quite indifferent to him in the first place he had himself written to her uncle to withdraw his claim as soon as he found that newton would never belong to him and then he had been told by the happy owner of newton that mary was still to be asked to share the throne of that principality when so told he had said nothing of his own ambition but had felt that there was another reason why he should leave newton and its neighbourhood for him as a bachelor beamingham hall would be only too good a house he as a farmer did not mean to be ashamed of his own dunghill  by the middle of may he had heard nothing either of his namesake or of mary bonner he did correspond with gregory newton and thus received tidings of the parish of the church of the horsesand even of the foxes but of the heirs matrimonial intentions he heard nothing gregory did write of his own visits to the metropolis past and future and ralph knew that the young parson would again singe his wings in the flames that were burning at popham villa but nothing was said of the heir through march and april that trouble respecting polly neefit was continued and gregory in his letter of course did not speak of the neefits at last may was come and ralph from beamingham made up his mind that he also would go up to london he had been hard at work during the last four months doing all those wonderfully attractive things with his new property which a man can do when he has money in his pocketknocking down hedges planting young trees or preparing for the planting of them buying stock building or preparing to build shedsand the rest of it there is hardly a pleasure in life equal to that of laying out money with a conviction that it will come back again the conviction alas is so often ill foundedbut the pleasure is the same in regard to the house itself he would do nothing not even form a planas yet it might be possible that some taste other than his own should be consulted  in the second week in may he went up to london having heard that gregory would be there at the same time and he at once found himself consorting with his namesake almost as much as with the parson it was now a month since the heir had been dismissed from popham villa and he had not since that date renewed his visit nor from that day to the present had he seen sir thomas it cannot be said with exact truth that he was afraid of sir thomas or ashamed to see the girls he had no idea that he had behaved badly to anybody and if he had he was almost disposed to make amends for such sin by marrying clarissa but he felt that should he ultimately make up his mind in clarissas favour a little time should elapse for the gradual cure of his former passion no doubt he placed reliance on his position as a man of property feeling that by his strength in that direction he would be pulled through all his little difficulties but it was an unconscious reliance he believed that he was perfectly free from what he himself would have called the dirt and littleness of purseprideor acrepride and would on some occasions assert that he really thought nothing of himself because he was newton of newton and he meant to be true nevertheless in the bottom of his heart there was a confidence that he might do this and that because of his acres and among the things which might be thus done but which could not otherwise have been done was this return to clarissa after his little lapse in regard to mary bonner  he was delighted to welcome ralph from norfolk to all the pleasures of the metropolis should he put down ralphs name at the famous carlton of which he had lately become a member ralph already belonged to an oldfashioned club of which his father had been long a member and declined the new honour as for balls evening crushes and large dinnerparties our norfolk ralph thought himself to be unsuited for them just at present because of his fathers death it was not for the nephew of the dead man to tell the son that eight months of mourning for a father was more than the world now required he could only take the excuse and suggest the play and a little dinner at richmond and a small party to maidenhead as compromises i dont know that there is any good in a fellow being so heavy in hand because his father is dead the squire said to his brother  they were so much to each other pleaded gregory in return the squire accepted the excuse and offered his namesake a horse for the park would he make one of the party for the moors in august the squire asserted that he had room for another gun without entailing any additional expense upon himself this indeed was not strictly true as it had been arranged that the cost should be paid per gun but there was a vacancy still and ralph the heir being quite willing to pay for his cousin thought no harm to cover his generosity under a venial falsehood the disinherited one however declined the offer with many thanks there is nothing old fellow i wouldnt do for you if i knew how said the happy heir whereupon the norfolk ralph unconsciously resolved that he would accept nothingor as little as possibleat the hands of the squire  all this happened during the three or four first days of his sojourn in london in which he hardly knew why he had gone neither to the villa nor to sir thomas in southampton buildings he meant to do so but from day to day he put it off as regarded the ladies at the villa the three young men now never spoke to each other respecting them gregory believed that his brother had failed and so believing did not recur to the subject gregory himself had already been at fulham once or twice since his arrival in town but had nothing to sayor at least did say nothingof what happened there he intended to remain away from his parish for no more than the parsons normal thirteen days and was by no means sure that he would make any further formal offer when at the villa he found that clarissa was sad and sober and almost silent and he knew that something was wrong it hardly occurred to him to believe that after all he might perhaps cure the evil  one morning early gregory and ralph from norfolk were together at the royal academy although it was not yet ten when they entered the gallery the rooms were already so crowded that it was difficult to get near the line and almost impossible either to get into or to get out of a corner gregory had been there before and knew the pictures he also was supposed by his friends to understand something of the subject whereas ralph did not know a cooke from a hook and possessed no more than a dim idea that landseer painted all the wild beasts and millais all the little children thats a fine picture he said pointing up at an enormous portrait of the master of the b b in a red coat seated square on a seventeenhand high horse with his hat off and the favourite hounds of his pack around him thats by grant said gregory i dont know that i care for that kind of thing its as like as it can stare said ralph who appreciated the red coat and the wellgroomed horse and the finelyshaped hounds he backed a few steps to see the picture better and found himself encroaching upon a ladys dress he turned round and found that the lady was mary bonner together with her were both clarissa and patience underwood  the greetings between them all were pleasant and the girls were unaffectedly pleased to find friends whom they knew well enough to accept as guides and monitors in the room now we shall be told all about everything said clarissa as the young parson shook hands first with her sister and then with her do take us round to the best dozen mr newton thats the way i like to begin her tone was completely different from what it had been down at the villa  that gentleman in the red coat is my cousins favourite said gregory  i dont care a bit about that said clarissa  thats because you dont hunt said ralph  i wish i hunted said mary bonner  mary when she first saw the man of whom she had once been told that he was to be her lover and when so told had at least been proud that she was so chosenfelt that she was blushing slightly but she recovered herself instantly and greeted him as though there had been no cause whatever for disturbance he was struck almost dumb at seeing her and it was her tranquillity which restored him to composure after the first greetings were over he found himself walking by her side without any effort on her part to avoid him while gregory and the two sisters went on in advance poor ralph had not a word to say about the pictures have you been long in london she asked  just four days  we heard that you were coming and did think that perhaps you and your cousin might find a morning to come down and see usyour cousin gregory i mean  of course i shall come  my uncle will be so glad to see youonly you know you cant always find him at home and so will patience you are a great favourite with patience you have gone down to live in norfolkhavent you  yesin norfolk  you have bought an estate there  just one farm that i look after myself its no estate miss bonnerjust a farmhouse with barns and stables and a horsepond and the rest of it this was by no means a fair account of the place but it suited him so to speak of it my days for having an estate were quickly brought to a closewere they not this he said with a little laugh and then hated himself for having spoken so foolishly  does that make you unhappy mr newton she asked he did not answer her at once and she continued i should have thought that you were above being made unhappy by that  such disappointments carry many things with them of which people outside see nothing  that is true no doubt  a man may be separated from every friend he has in the world by such a change of circumstances  i had not thought of that i beg your pardon said she looking into his face almost imploringly  and there may be worse than that he said of course she knew what he meant but he did not know how much she knew it is easy to say that a man should stand up against reversesbut there are some reverses a man cannot bear without suffering she had quite made up her mind that the one reverse of which she was thinking should be cured but she could take no prominent step towards curing it yet but that some step should be taken sooner or later she was resolved it might be taken now indeed if he would only speak out but she quite understood that he would not speak out now because that house down in norfolk was no more than a farm but i didnt mean to trouble you with all that nonsense he said  it doesnt trouble me at all of course you will tell us everything when you come to see us  there is very little to tellunless you care for cows and pigs and sheep and horses  i do care for cows and pigs and sheep and horses she said  all the same they are not pleasant subjects of conversation a man may do as much good with a single farm as he can with a large estate but he cant make his affairs as interesting to other people there was present to his own mind the knowledge that he and his rich namesake were rivals in regard to the affections of this beautiful girl and he could not avoid allusions to his own inferiority and yet his own words as soon as they were spoken and had sounded in his ear were recognised by himself as being mean and pitifulas whining words and sorry plaints against the trick which fortune had played him he did not know how to tell her boldly that he lamented this change from the estate to the farm because he had hoped that she would share the one with him and did not dare even to ask her to share the other she understood it all down to the look of displeasure which crossed his face as he felt the possible effect of his own speech she understood it all but she could not give him much helpas yet there might perhaps come a moment in which she could explain to him her own ideas about farms and estates and the reasons in accordance with which these might be selected and those rejected have you seen much of ralph newton lately asked the other ralph  of your cousin  yesonly i do not call him so i have no right to call him my cousin  no we do not see much of him this was said in a tone of voice which ought to have sufficed for curing any anxiety in ralphs bosom respecting his rival had he not been sore and nervous and as it must be admitted almost stupid in the matter he could not but have gathered from that tone that his namesake was at least no favourite with miss bonner he used to be a great deal at popham villa said ralph  we do not see him often now i fancy there has been some cause of displeasure between him and my uncle his brother has been with us once or twice i do like mr gregory newton  he is the best fellow that ever lived exclaimed ralph with energy  so much nicer than his brother said marythough perhaps i ought not to say so to you  this at any rate could not but be satisfactory to him i like them both he said but i love greg dearly he and i have lived together like brothers for years whereas it is only quite lately that i have known the other  it is only lately that i have known eitherbut they seem to me to be so different is not that a wonderfully beautiful picture mr newton cant you almost fancy yourself sitting down and throwing stones into the river or dabbling your feet in it  it is very pretty said he not caring a penny for the picture  have you any river at beamingham  theres a muddy little brook that you could almost jump over you wouldnt want to dabble in that  has it got a name  i think they call it the wissey its not at all a river to be proud ofexcept in the way of eels and waterrats  is there nothing to be proud of at beamingham  theres the church towerthats all  a church tower is somethingbut i meant as to beamingham hall  that word hall misleads people said ralph its a kind of upperclass farmhouse with a lot of low rooms and intricate passages and chambers here and there smelling of apples and a huge kitchen and an oven big enough for a small dinnerparty  i should like the oven  and a laundry and a dairy and a cheesehouseonly we never make any cheese and a horsepond and a dunghill and a cabbagegarden  is that all you can say for your new purchase mr newton  the house itself isnt ugly  comethats better  and it might be made fairly comfortable if there were any use in doing it  of course there will be use  i dont know that there will said ralph sometimes i think one thing and sometimes another one week im full of a scheme about a new garden and a conservatory and a bowwindow to the drawingroom and then the next week i think that the two rooms i live in at present will be enough for me  stick to the conservatory mr newton but here are the girls and i suppose it is about time for us to go  mary where have you been said clarissa  looking at landscapes said mary  mr newton has shown us every picture worth seeing and described everything and we havent had to look at the catalogue once thats just what i like at the academy i dont know whether youve been as lucky  ive had a great deal described to me too said mary but im afraid weve forgotten the particular duty that brought us here then they parted the two men promising that they would be at the villa before long and the girls preparing themselves for their return home  that cousin of theirs is certainly very beautiful said gregory after some short tribute to the merits of the two sisters  i think she is said ralph  i do not wonder that my brother has been struck with her  nor do i then after a pause he continued she said something which made me think that she and your brother havent quite hit it off together  i dont know that they have said gregory ralph does change his mind sometimes he hasnt said a word about her to me lately     chapter l  another failure   the day after the meeting at the academy as ralph the young squire was sitting alone in his room over a late breakfast a maidservant belonging to the house opened the door and introduced mr neefit it was now the middle of may and ralph had seen nothing of the breechesmaker since the morning on which he had made his appearance in the yard of the moonbeam there had been messages and mr carey had been very busy endeavouring to persuade the father that he could benefit neither himself nor his daughter by persistence in so extravagant a scheme money had been offered to mr neefitmost unfortunately and this offer had added to his wrongs and he had been told by his wife that polly had at last decided in regard to her own affections and had accepted her old lover mr moggs he had raved at polly to her face he had sworn at moggs behind his back he had called mr carey very hard namesand now he forced himself once more upon the presence of the young squire captain he said as soon as he had carefully closed the door behind him are you going to be upon the square newton had given special orders that neefit should not be admitted to his presence but here he was having made his way into the chamber in the temporary absence of the squires own servant  mr neefit said newton i cannot allow this  not allow it captain  noi cannot i will not be persecuted i have received favours from you  yes you have captain  and i will do anything in reason to repay them  will you come out and see our polly  no i wont  you wont  certainly not i dont believe your daughter wants to see me she is engaged to another man so much mr carey had learned from mrs neefit i have a great regard for your daughter but i will not go to see her  engaged to another manis she  i am told so  ohthats your little game is it and you wont see me when i callwont you i wont stir out of this room unless you sends for the police and so well get it all into one of the courts of law i shall just like to see how youll look when youre being crosshackled by one of them learned gents therell be a question or two about the old breechesmaker as the squire of newton maynt like to see in the papers the next morning i shall take the liberty of ringing the bell and ordering a bit of dinner here if you dont mind i shant go when the police comes without a deal of row and then we shall have it all out in the courts  this was monstrously absurd but at the same time very annoying even though he should disregard that threat of being crosshackled by a learned gent and of being afterwards made notorious in the newspaperswhich it must be confessed he did not find himself able to disregardstill independently of that feeling he was very unwilling to call for brute force to remove mr neefit from the armchair in which that worthy tradesman had seated himself he had treated the man otherwise than as a tradesman he had borrowed the mans money and eaten the mans dinners visited the man at ramsgate and twice offered his hand to the mans daughter you are very welcome to dine here he said only i am sorry that i cannot dine here with you  i wont stir from the place for a week  that will be inconvenient said ralph  uncommon inconvenient i should say to a gent like youespecially as i shall tell everybody that im on a visit to my soninlaw  i meant to yourselfand to the business  never you mind the business captain therell be enough left to give my girl all the money i promised her and i dont think i shall have to ask you to keep your fatherinlaw neither sending an attorney to offer me a thousand pounds its my belief i could buy you out yet captain in regard to ready money  i daresay you could mr neefit  and i wont stir from here till you name a day to come and see me and my missus and polly  this is sheer madness mr neefit  you think sodo you captain youll find me madder nor you think for yet im not agoing to be put upon by you and nothing come of it ill have it out of you in money or marbles as the saying is just order me a glass of sherry wine will you im a thirsty talking when you came a visiting me i always give you lashings of drink this was so true that ralph felt himself compelled to ring the bell and order up some wine soda and brandy let it be jack said mr neefit to mr newtons own man itll be more comfortable like between near relations  sodawater and brandy for mr neefit said the young squire turning angrily to the man mr neefit you are perfectly welcome to as much brandy as you can drink and my man will wait upon you while im away good morning whereupon newton took up his hat and left the room he had not passed into the little back room in which he knew that the servant would be looking for sodawater before he heard a sound as of smashed crockery and he was convinced that mr neefit was preparing himself for forcible eviction by breaking his ornaments let the ornaments go and the mirror and the clock on the chimneypiece and the windows it was a frightful nuisance but anything would be better than sending for the police to take away mr neefit keep your eye on that man in the front room said he to his swiss valet  on mr neefit saar  yes on mr neefit he wants me to marry his daughter and i cant oblige him let him have what he wants to eat and drink get rid of him if you can but dont send for the police hes smashing all the things and you must save as many as you can so saying he hurried down the stairs and out of the house but what was he to do next if mr neefit chose to carry out his threat by staying in the rooms mr neefit must be allowed to have his own way if he chose to amuse himself by breaking the things the things must be broken if he got very drunk he might probably be taken home in a cab and deposited at the cottage at hendon but what should ralph do at this moment he sauntered sadly down st jamess street with his hands in his trouserspockets and finding a crawling hansom at the palacegate he got into it and ordered the man to drive him down to fulham he had already made up his mind about dear little clary and the thing might as well be done at once none of the girls were at home miss underwood and miss bonner had gone up to london to see sir thomas miss clarissa was spending the day with mrs brownlow that will just be right said ralph to himself as he ordered the cabman to drive him to the old ladys house on the brompton road  mrs brownlow had ever been a great admirer of the young squire and did not admire him less now that he had come to his squireship she had always hoped that clary would marry the real heir and was sounding his praises while ralph was knocking at her door he is not half so fine a fellow as his brother said clarissa  you did not use to think so said mrs brownlow then the door was opened and ralph was announced  with his usual easy mannerwith that unabashed grace which clarissa used to think so charminghe soon explained that he had been to fulham and had had himself driven back to bolsover house because clarissa was there clarissa as she heard this felt the blood tingle in her cheeks his manner now did not seem to her to be so full of grace was it not all selfishness mrs brownlow purred out her applause it was not to be supposed that he came to see an old womanbut his coming to see a young woman with adequate intentions was quite the proper thing for such a young man to do they were just going to take lunch of course he would stop and lunch with them he declared that he would like nothing better mrs brownlow rang the bell and gave her little orders clarissas thoughts referred quickly to various mattersto the scene on the lawn to a certain evening on which she had walked home with him from this very house to the confessions which she had made to her sister to her confidence with her cousinand then to the offer that had been made to mary now only a few weeks since she looked at him though she did not seem to be looking at him and told herself that the man was nothing to her he had caused her unutterable sorrow with which her heart was still sorebut he was nothing to her she would eat her lunch with him and endeavour to talk to him but the less she might see of him henceforth the better he was selfish heartless weak and unworthy  the lunch was eaten and within three minutes afterwards mrs brownlow was away as they were returning to the little parlour in which they had been sitting during the morning she contrived to escape and ralph found himself alone with his dear darling little clary in spite of his graceful ease the task before him was not without difficulty clarissa of course knew that he had proposed to mary and probably knew that he had proposed to polly but mary had told him that clarissa was devoted to himhad told him at least that which amounted to almost as much and then it was incumbent on him to do something that might put an end to the neefit abomination clarissa would be contented to look back upon that episode with mary bonner as a dream that meant nothingjust as he himself was already learning to look at it clary he said i have hardly seen you to speak to you since the night we walked home together from this house  no indeed mr newton she said hitherto she had always called him ralph he did not observe the change having too many things of his own to think of at the moment  how much has happened since that  very much indeed mr newton  and yet it seems to be such a short time agoalmost yesterday my poor uncle was alive then  yes he was  he did not seem to be getting any nearer to his object by these references to past events clary he said there are many things which i wish to have forgotten and some perhaps which i would have forgiven  i suppose that is so with all of us said clarissa  just so though i dont know that any of us have ever been so absurdly foolish as i havethrowing away what was of the greatest value in the world for the sake of something that seemed to be precious just for a moment it was very difficult and he already began to feel that the nature of the girl was altered towards him she had suddenly become hard undemonstrative and almost unkind hitherto he had always regarded her without much conscious thought about it as a soft sweet pleasant thing that might at any moment be his for the asking and mary bonner had told him that he ought to ask now he was willing to beseech her pardon to be in very truth her lover and to share with her all his prosperity but she would give him no assistance in his difficulty he was determined that she should speak and trusting to mrs brownlows absence he sat still waiting for her  i hope you have thrown away nothing that you ought to keep she said at last it seems to me that you have got everything  nonot as yet everything i do not know whether i shall ever get that which i desire the most of course she understood him now but she sat hard and fixed and sternso absolutely unlike the clarissa whom he had known since they were hardly more than children together you know what i mean clarissa  noi do not she said  i fear you mean that you cannot forgive me  i have nothing to forgive  oh yes you have whether you will ever forgive me i cannot say but there is much to forgivevery much your cousin mary for a short moment ran away with us all  she is welcomefor me  what do you mean clarissa  just what i say she is welcome for me she has taken nothing that i prize indeed i do not think she has condescended to take anythinganything of the sort you mean mary and i love each other dearly there is no danger of our quarrelling  come clary he got up as he spoke and stood over her close to her shoulder you understand well enough what i mean we have known each other so long and i think we have loved each other so well that you ought to say that you will forgive me i have been foolish i have been wrong i have been false if you will cannot you forgive me  not for a moment was there a look of forgiveness in her eye or a sign of pardon in the lines of her face but in her heart there was a contest something of the old passion remained there though it was no more than the soreness it had caused for half a moment she thought whether it might not be as he would have it but if so how could she again look any of her friends in the face and admit that she had surrendered herself to so much unworthiness how could she tell patience who was beginning to be full of renewed hope for gregory how could she confess such a weakness to her father how could she stand up before mary bonner and was it possible that she should really give herself her whole life and all her future hopes to one so weak and worthless as this man there is nothing to forgive she said but i certainly cannot forget  you know that i love you he protested  love meyes with what sort of love but it does not matter there need be no further talk about it your love to me can be nothing  clarissa  and to you it will be quite as little your heart will never suffer much ralph how long is it since you offered your hand to my cousin only that you are just a boy playing at love this would be an insult then she saw her old friend through the window mrs brownlow she said mr newton is going and i am ready for our walk whenever you please  think of it twice clarissamust this be the end of it pleaded ralph  as far as i am concerned it must be the end of it when i get home i shall probably find that you have already made an offer to patience then he got up took his hat and having shaken hands cordially with mrs brownlow through the window went out to his hansom cab which was earning sixpence a quarter of an hour out on the road while he had been so absolutely wasting his quarter of an hour within the house  has he said anything my dear asked mrs brownlow  he has said a great deal  well my dear  he is an empty vain inconstant man  is he clarissa  and yet he is so goodhumoured and so gay and so pleasant that i do not see why he should not make a very good husband to some girl  what do you mean clarissa you have not refused him  i did not say he had offereddid i  but he has  if he didthen i refused him he is goodnatured but he has no more heart than a log of wood dont talk about it any more dear mrs brownlow i dare say we shall all be friends again before long and hell almost forget everything that he said this morning  throughout the afternoon she was gay and almost happy and before she went home she had made up her mind that she would tell patience and then get rid of it from her thoughts for ever not to tell patience would be a breach of faith between them and would moreover render future sisterly intercourse between them very difficult but had it been possible she would have avoided the expression of triumph without which it would be almost impossible for her to tell the story within her own bosom certainly there was some triumph the man for whose love she had sighed and been sick had surrendered to her at last the prize had been at her feet but she had not chosen to lift it poor ralph she said to herself he means to do as well as he can but he is so feeble she certainly would not tell mary bonner nor would she say a word to her father and when she should meet ralph againas she did not doubt but that she would meet him shortly she would be very careful to give no sign that she was thinking of his disgrace he should still be called ralphtill he was a married man and when it should come to pass that he was about to marry she would congratulate him with all the warmth of old friendship  that night she did tell it all to patience you dont mean she said that i have not done right  i am sure you have done quite right  then why are you so sober about it patty  only if you do love him i would give my right hand clary that you might have that which shall make you happy in life  if you were to give your right and left hand too a marriage with ralph newton would not make me happy think of it pattyto both of us within two months he is just like a child how could i ever have respected him or believed in him i could never have respected myself again no patty i did love him dearly i fancied that life without him must all be a dreary blank i made him into a godbut his feet are of the poorest clay kiss me dear and congratulate mebecause i have escaped  her sister did kiss her and did congratulate herbut still there was a something of regret in the sisters heart clarissa was to her thinking so fit to be the mistress of newton priory     chapter li  music has charms   the commission appointed to examine into the condition of the borough of percycross cannot exactly be said to have made short work of it for it sat daily for many consecutive weeks and examined half the voters in the town but it made sharp work and reported to the speaker of the house such a tale of continual corruption that all the world knew that the borough would be disfranchised the glory of percycross was gone and in regard to political influence it was to be treated as the cities of the plain and blotted from off the face of existence the learned gentlemen who formed the commission had traced home to mr griffenbottoms breechespockets large sums of money which had been expended in the borough for purposes of systematised corruption during the whole term of his connection with itand yet they were not very hard upon mr griffenbottom personally in their report he had spent the money no doubt but had so spent it that at every election it appeared that he had not expected to spend it till the bills were sent to him he frankly owned that the borough had been ruinous to him had made a poor man of himbut assured the commission at the same time that all this had come from his continued innocence as every new election came round he had hoped that that would at least be pure and had been urgent in his instructions to his agents to that effect he had at last learned he said that he was not a sufficient hercules to cleanse so foul a stable all this created no animosity against him in percycross during the sitting of the commission his old friends the triggers and piles and spiveycombs clung to him as closely as ever every man in percycross knew that the borough was gone and there really seemed at last to be something of actual gratitude in their farewell behaviour to the man who had treated the place as it liked to be treated as the end of it all the borough was undoubtedly to be disfranchised and mr griffenbottom left ita ruined man indeed according to his own statementbut still with his colours flying and to a certain extent triumphantly so we will leave him trustingor perhaps rather hopingthat the days of mr griffenbottom are nearly at an end  his colleague sir thomas on the occasion of his third visit to percycrossa visit which he was constrained to make sorely against his will in order that he might give his evidence before the commissionremained there but a very short time but while there he made a clean breast of it he had gone down to the borough with the most steadfast purpose to avoid corruption and had done his best in that direction but he had failed there had been corruption for which he had himself paid in part there had been treating of the grossest kind money had been demanded from him since the election as to the actual destination of which he was profoundly ignorant he did not however doubt but that this money had been spent in the purchase of votes sir thomas was supposed to have betrayed the borough in his evidence and was hooted out of the town on this occasion he only remained there one night and left percycross for ever after giving his evidence  this happened during the second week in may on his return to london he did not go down to fulham but remained at his chambers in a most unhappy frame of mind this renewed attempt of his to enter the world and to go among men that he might do a mans work had resulted in the loss of a great many hundred pounds in absolute failure and as he wrongly told himself in personal disgrace he was almost ashamed to show himself at his club and did for two days absolutely have his dinner brought to him in his chambers from an eatinghouse  im sure you wont like that sir thomas stemm had said to him expostulating and knowing very well the nature of his masters sufferings  i dont know that i like anything very much said sir thomas  i wouldnt go and not show my face because of other peoples roguery rejoined stemm with cruel audacity sir thomas looked at him but did not answer a word and stemm fetched the food  stemm said sir thomas the same evening its getting to be fine weather now  its fine enough said stemm  do you take your nieces down to southend for an outing go down on thursday and come back on saturday i shall be at home theres a fivepound note for the expenses stemm slowly took the note but grunted and grumbled the girls were nuisances to him and he didnt want to take them an outing they wouldnt care to go before july and he didnt care to go at all you can go when you please said sir thomas stemm growled and grumbled and at last left the room with the money  the morning afterwards sir thomas was sitting alone in his room absolutely wretched he had so managed his life that there seemed to be nothing left to him in it worth the having he had raised himself to public repute by his intellect and industry and had then almost at once allowed himself to be hustled out of the throng simply because others had been rougher than hebecause other men had pushed and shouldered while he had been quiet and unpretending then he had resolved to make up for this disappointment by work of another kindby work which would after all be more congenial to him he would go back to the dream of his youth to the labours of former days and would in truth write his life of bacon he had then surrounded himself with his papers had gotten his books together and read up his old notes had planned chapters and sections and settled divisions had drawn up headings and revelled in those paraphernalia of work which are so dear to wouldbe working menand then nothing had come of it of what use was it that he went about ever with a volume in his pocket and read a page or two as he sat over his wine when sitting alone in his room he did read but when reading he knew that he was not working he went as it were round and round the thing never touching it till the labour which he longed to commence became so frightful to him that he did not dare to touch it to do that thing was the settled purpose of his life and yet from day to day and from month to month it became more impossible to him even to make a beginning there is a misery in this which only they who have endured it can understand there are idle men who rejoice in idleness their name is legion idleness even when it is ruinous is delightful to them they revel in it look forward to it and almost take a pride in it when it can be had without pecuniary detriment it is to such men a thing absolutely good in itself but such a one was not sir thomas underwood and there are men who love work who revel in that who attack it daily with renewed energy almost wallowing in it greedy of work who go to it almost as the drunkard goes to his bottle or the gambler to his gamingtable these are not unhappy men though they are perhaps apt to make those around them unhappy but such a one was not sir thomas underwood and again there are men fewer in number who will work though they hate it from sheer conscience and from conviction that idleness will not suit them or make them happy strong men these arebut such a one certainly was not sir thomas underwood then there are they who love the idea of work but want the fibre needful for the doing it it may be that such a one will earn his bread as sir thomas underwood had earned his not flinching from routine task or even from the healthy efforts necessary for subsistence but there will ever be present to the mind of the ambitious man the idea of something to be done over and above the mere earning of his breadand the ambition may be very strong though the fibre be lacking such a one will endure an agony protracted for years always intending never performing selfaccusing through every wakeful hour selfaccusing almost through every sleeping hour the work to be done is close there by the hand but the tools are loathed and the paraphernalia of it become hateful and yet it can never be put aside it is to be grasped tomorrow but on every morrow the grasping of it becomes more difficult more impossible more revolting there is no peace no happiness for such a manand such a one was sir thomas underwood  in this strait he had been tempted to make another effort in political life and he had made it there had been no difficulty in thisonly that the work itself had been so disagreeable and that he had failed in it so egregiously during his canvass and in all his intercourse with the griffenbottomites he had told himself falsely how pleasant to him it would be to return to his bookshow much better for him would be a sedentary life if he could only bring himself to do or even attempt to do the work which he had appointed for himself now he had returned to his solitude had again dragged out his papers his notebook his memoranda his dates and yet he could not in truth get into his harness put his neck to the collar and attempt to drag the burden up the hill  he was sitting alone in his room in this condition with a book in his hand of no value to his great purpose hating himself and wretched when stemm opened his door ushering patience and mary bonner into his room ah my dears he said what has brought you up to london i did not think of seeing you here there was no expression of positive displeasure in his voice but it was understood by them all by the daughter by the cousin by old stemm and by sir thomas himself that such a visit as this was always to be regarded more or less as an intrusion however he kissed them both and handed them chairs and was more than usually civil to them  we do so want to hear about percycross papa said patience  there is nothing to be told about percycross  are you to stand again papa  nobody will ever stand for percycross again it will lose its members altogether the thing is settled  and you have had all the trouble for nothing uncle mary asked  all for nothingand the expense but that is a very common thing and i have no ground of complaint beyond many others  it does seem so hard said patience  so very hard said mary and then they were silent they had not come without a purpose but as is common with young ladies they kept their purpose for the end of the interview  are you coming home papa patience asked  well yes i wont settle any day now because i am very busy just at present but i shall be home soonvery soon  i do so hope youll stay some time with us papa  my dear you know and then he stopped having been pounced upon so suddenly that he had not resolved what excuse he would for the moment put forward ive got my papers and things in such confusion here at presentbecause of percycross and the trouble i have hadthat i cannot leave them just now  but why not bring the papers with you papa  my dear you know i cant  then there was another pause papa i think you ought said patience indeed i do for clarys sakeand ours but even this was not the subject which had specially brought them on that morning to southampton buildings  what is there wrong with clary asked sir thomas  there is nothing wrong said patience  what do you mean then  i think it would be so much more comfortable for her that you should see things as they are going on  i declare i dont know what she means do you know what she means mary  clary has not been quite herself lately said mary  i suppose its something about that scamp ralph newton said sir thomas  no indeed papa i am sure she does not think of him now on this very morning as the reader may perhaps remember the scamp had gone down to fulham and from fulham back to brompton in search of clarissa but of the scamps energy and renewed affections patience as yet knew nothing gregory has been up in london and has been down at fulham once or twice we want him to come again before he goes back on saturday and we thought if you would come home on thursday we could ask him to dinner sir thomas scratched his head and fidgeted in his chair their cousin is in london also continued patience  the other ralph he who has bought beamingham hall  yes papa we saw him at the academy i told him how happy you would be to see him at fulham  of course i should be glad to see him that is if i happened to be at home said sir thomas  but i could not name a day without asking you papa  he will have gone back by this time said sir thomas  i think not papa  and what do you say mary  i have nothing to say at all uncle if mr newton likes to come to the villa i shall be glad to see him why should i not he has done nothing to offend me there was a slight smile on her face as she spoke and the merest hint of a blush on her cheek  they tell me that beamingham hall isnt much of a place after all said sir thomas  from what mr newton says it must be a very ugly place said mary with still the same smile and the same hint of a blushonly i dont quite credit all he tells us  if there is anything settled you ought to tell me said sir thomas  there is nothing settled uncle or in any way of being settled it so happened that mr newton did speak to me about his new house there is nothing more  nevertheless papa pray let us ask him to dinner on thursday it was for the purpose of making this request that patience had come to southampton buildings braving her fathers displeasure sir thomas scratched his head and rubbed his face and yielded of course he had no alternative but to yield and yet he did it with a bad grace permission however was given and it was understood that patience would write to the two young men ralph of beamingham hall and the parson asking them to dinner for the day but one following as the time is so short ive written the notes ready said patience producing them from her pocket then the bell was rung and the two notes were confided to stemm patience as she was going found a moment in which to be alone with her father and to speak one more word to him dear papa it would be so much better for us that you should come and live at home think of those two with nobody as it were to say a word for them sir thomas groaned and again scratched his head but patience left him before he had arranged his words for an answer  when they were gone sir thomas sat for hours in his chair without moving making the while one or two faint attempts at the book before him but in truth giving up his mind to contemplation of the past and to conjectures as to the future burdened by heavy regrets and with hopes too weak to afford him any solace the last words which patience had spoken rang in his earsthink of those two with nobody as it were to say a word for them he did think of them and of the speaker also and knew that he had neglected his duty he could understand that such a girl as his own clarissa did require some one to say a word for her some stalwart arm to hold her up some loving strength to support her some counsel to direct her of course those three girls were as other girls looking forward to matrimony as their future lot in life and it would not be well that they should be left to choose or to be chosen or left to reject and be rejected without any aid from their remaining parent he knew that he had been wrong and he almost resolved that the chambers in southampton buildings should be altogether abandoned and his books removed to popham villa  but such men do not quite resolve before he could lay his hand upon the table and assure himself that the thing should be done the volume had been taken up again used for a few minutes and then the mans mind had run away again to that vague contemplation which is so much easier than the forming of a steady purpose it was one of those almost sultry days which do come to us occasionally amidst the ordinary inclemency of a london may and he was sitting with his window open though there was a fire in the grate as he sat dreaming rather than thinking there came upon his ear the weak wailing puny sound of a distant melancholy flute he had heard it often before and had been roused by it to evil wishes and sometimes even to evil words against the musician it was the effort of some youth in the direction of staples inn to soothe with music the savageness of his own bosom it was borne usually on the evening air but on this occasion the idle swain had taken up his instrument within an hour or two of his early dinner his melody was burdened with no peculiar tune but consisted of a few low wailing melancholy notes such as may be extracted from the reed by a breath and the slow raising and falling of the little finger much we believe to the comfort of the player but to the ineffable disgust of too often a large circle of hearers  sir thomas was affected by the sound long before he was aware that he was listening to it towhew towhew towhew towhew whewtoto whewtoto whew towhew on the present occasion the variation was hardly carried beyond that but so much was repeated with a persistency which at last seemed to burden the whole air round southampton buildings the little thing might have been excluded by the closing of the window but sir thomas though he suffered did not reflect for a while whence the suffering came who does not know how such sounds may serve to enhance the bitterness of remorse to add a sorrow to the present thoughts and to rob the future of its hopes  there come upon us all as we grow up in years hours in which it is impossible to keep down the conviction that everything is vanity that the life past has been vain from folly and that the life to come must be vain from impotence it is the presence of thoughts such as these that needs the assurance of a heaven to save the thinker from madness or from suicide it is when the feeling of this pervading vanity is strongest on him that he who doubts of heaven most regrets his incapacity for belief if there be nothing better than this on to the graveand nothing worse beyond the grave why should i bear such fardels  sir thomas as he sat there listening and thinking unable not to think and not to listen found that the fardels were very heavy what good had come to him of his lifeto him or to others and what further good did he dare to promise to himself had it not all been vanity was it not all vain to him now at the present was not life becoming to him vainer and still vainer every day he had promised himself once that books should be the solace of his age and he was beginning to hate his books because he knew that he did no more than trifle with them he had found himself driven to attempt to escape from them back into public life but had failed and had been inexpressibly dismayed in the failure while failing he had promised himself that he would rush at his work on his return to privacy and to quiet but he was still as the shivering coward who stands upon the brink and cannot plunge in among the bathers and then there was sadness beyond this and even deeper than this why should he have dared to arrange for himself a life different from the life of the ordinary men and women who lived around him why had he not contented himself with having his children around him walking with them to church on sunday morning taking them to the theatre on monday evening and allowing them to read him to sleep after tea on the tuesday he had not done these things was not doing them now because he had ventured to think himself capable of something that would justify him in leaving the common circle he had left it but was not justified he had been in parliament had been in office and had tried to write a book but he was not a legislator was not a statesman and was not an author he was simply a weak vain wretched man who through false conceit had been induced to neglect almost every duty of life towhew towhew towhew towhew as the sounds filled his ears such were the thoughts which lay heavy on his bosom so idle as he had been in thinking so inconclusive so frail so subject to gusts of wind so incapable of following his subject to the end why had he dared to leave that sundaykeeping churchgoing domestic decent life which would have become one of so ordinary a calibre as himself there are men who may doubt who may weigh the evidence who may venture to believe or disbelieve in compliance with their own reasoning facultieswho may trust themselves to think it out but he too clearly had not been was not and never would be one of these to walk as he saw other men walking around himbecause he was one of the many to believe that to be good which the teachers appointed for him declared to be good to do prescribed duties without much personal inquiry into the causes which had made them duties to listen patiently and to be content without excitement that was the mode of living for which he should have known himself to be fit but he had not known it and had strayed away and had ventured to think that he could thinkand had been ambitious and now he found himself stranded in the mud of personal condemnationand that so late in life that there remained to him no hope of escape whewtoto whewtoto whewtowhew stemm why do you let that brute go on with his cursed flute stemm at that moment had opened the door to suggest that as he usually dined at one and as it was now past three he would go out and get a bit of something to eat  hes always at it sir said stemm pausing for a moment before he alluded to his own wants  why the deuce is he always at it why isnt he indited for a nuisance whos to do anything with such a noise as that going on for hours together he has nearly driven me mad  its young wobble as has the back attic no 17 in the inn said stemm  they ought to turn him out said sir thomas  i rather like it myself said stemm it suits my disposition sir then he made his little suggestion in regard to his own personal needs and of course was blown up for not having come in two hours ago to remind sir thomas that it was dinnertime its because i wouldnt disturb you when you has the bacon papers out sir thomas said stemm serenely sir thomas winced and shook his head but such scenes as this were too common to have much effect stemm he called aloud as soon as the old clerk had closed the door stemm whereupon stemm reappeared stemm have some one here next week to pack all these books  pack all the books sir thomas  yesto pack all the books there must be cases now go and get your dinner  new cases sir thomas  that will do go and get your dinner and yet his mind was not quite made up     chapter lii  gus eardham   whether mr neefit broke ralph newtons little statuettea miniature copy in porcelain of the apollo belvidere which stood in a corner of ralphs room and in the possession of which he took some pridefrom awkwardness in his wrath or of malice prepense was never known he told the servant that he had whisked it down with his coat tails but ralph always thought that the breechesmaker had intended to make a general ruin but had been cowed by the noise of his first attack he did at any rate abstain from breaking other things and when the servant entered the room condescended to make some careless apology a trifle like that aint nothing between me and your master jack said mr neefit after accounting for the accident by his coattails  i am not jack said the indignant valet with a strong foreign accent i am namedadolphe  adolphe are you i dont think much of adolphe for a namebut it aint no difference to me just pick up them bits will you  the man turned a look of scorn on mr neefit and did pick up the bits he intended to obey his master as far as might be possible but was very unwilling to wait upon the breechesmaker he felt that the order which had been given to him was very cruel it was his dutyand his pleasure to wait upon gentlemen but this man he knew to be a tradesman who measured customers for hunting apparel in his own shop it was hard upon him that his master should go and leave him to be insulted ordered about and trodden upon by a breechesmaker get me a bit of steak will you demanded neefita bit of the rump not too much done with the gravy in itand an onion what are you staring at didnt you hear what your master said to you  onionand rompsteak  yes rumpsteak and onion i aint going out of this till ive had a bit of grub your master knows all about it im going to have more nor that out of him before ive done with him  neefit did at last succeed and had his rumpsteak and onion together with more brandy and sodawater eating and drinking as he sat in ralphs beautiful new easy chairnot very much to his own comfort a steak at the princes feathers in conduit street would have been very much more pleasant to him and he would have preferred halfandhalf in the pewter to brandy and sodawaterbut he felt a pride in using his power in a fashion that would be disgraceful to his host when he had done his steak he pulled his pipe out of his pocket and smoked against this adolphe remonstrated stoutly but quite in vain the captain wont mind a little baccysmoke out of my pipe he said he always has his smoke comfortable when he comes down to me at last about four oclock he did go away assuring adolphe that he would repeat his visit very soon i means to see a deal of the captain this season he said at last however he retreated and adolphe opened the door of the house for him without speaking a word bye bye said neefit ill be here again before long  ralph on that afternoon came home to dress for dinner at about seven in great fear lest neefit should still be found in his rooms no saar he go away at last said adolphe with a melancholy shake of his head  has he done much harm  the apollo goneand he had rompsteakand onionsand a pipe vat vas i to do i hope he vill never come again and so also did mr newton hope that neefit would never come again  he was going to dine with lady eardham the wife of a berkshire baronet who had three fair daughters at this period of his life he found the aristocracy of berkshire and hampshire to be very civil to him and indeed the world at large was disposed to smile on him but there was very much in his lot to make him unhappy he had on that morning been utterly rejected by clarissa underwood it may perhaps be true that he was not a man to break his heart because a girl rejected him he was certainly one who could have sung the old song if she be not fair for me what care i how fair she be and yet clarissas conduct had distressed him and had caused him to go about throughout the whole afternoon with his heart almost in his boots he had felt her coldness to him much more severely than he had that of mary bonner he had taught himself to look upon that little episode with mary as though it had really meant nothing she had just crossed the sky of his heaven like a meteor and for a moment had disturbed its serenity and polly also had been to him a false light leading him astray for awhile under exceptional and as he thought quite pardonable circumstances but dear little clary had been his own peculiar stara star that was bound to have been true to him even though he might have erred for a moment in his worshipa star with a sweet soft enduring light that he had always assured himself he might call his own when he pleased and now this soft sweet star had turned upon him and scorched him when i get home she had said to him i shall find that you have already made an offer to patience he certainly had not expected such scorn from her and then he was so sure in his heart that if she would have accepted him he would have been henceforth so true to her so good to her he would have had such magnanimous pleasure in showering upon her pretty little head all the good things at his disposal that for her own sake the pity was great when he had been five minutes in his cab bowling back towards his club he was almost minded to return and give her one more chance she would just have suited him and as for herwould it not be a heaven on earth for her if she would only consent to forget that foolish unmeaning little episode could clary have forgotten the episode and been content to care little or nothing for that easiness of feeling which made our ralph what he was she might probably have been happy as the mistress of the priory but she would not have forgotten and would not have been content she had made up her little heart stoutly that ralph the heir should sit in it no longer and it was well for him that he did not go back  he went to his club insteadnot daring to go to his rooms the insanity of neefit was becoming to him a terrible bane it was too a cruelty which he certainly had done nothing to deserve he could lay his hand on his heart and assure himself that he had treated that mad pigheaded tradesman well in all respects he knew himself to be the last man to make a promise and then to break it wilfully he had certainly borrowed money of neefitand at the probable cost of all his future happiness he had with a nobleness which he could not himself sufficiently admire done his very best to keep the hard terms which in his distress he had allowed to be imposed upon himself he had been loyal even to the breechesmakerand this was the return which was made to him  what was he to do should neefit cling to his threat and remain permanently at his chambers there were the police and no doubt he could rid himself of his persecutor but he understood well the barbarous power which some underbred welltrained barrister would have of asking him questions which it would be so very disagreeable for him to answer he lacked the courage to send for the police jacky joram had just distinguished himself greatly and nearly exterminated a young gentleman who had married one girl while he was engaged to another jacky joram might ask him questions as to his little dinners at alexandra lodge which it would nearly kill him to answer he was very unhappy and began to think that it might be as well that he should travel for twelve months neefit could not persecute him up the nile or among the rocky mountains and perhaps clarys ferocity would have left her were he to return after twelve months of glorious journeyings still constant to his first affections in the meantime he did not dare to go home till it would be absolutely necessary that he should dress for dinner  in the billiardroom of his club he found lord polperrowthe eldest son of the marquis of megavisseypretty poll as he was called by many young men and by some young ladies about town lord polperrow had become his fast friend since the day on which his heirship was established and now encountered him with friendly intimacy halloa newton said the young lord have you seen old neefit lately there were eight or ten men in the room and suddenly there was silence among the cues  ralph would have given his best horse to be able to laugh it off but he found that he could not laugh he became very hot and knew that he was red in the face what about old neefit he said  ive just come from conduit street and he says that he has been dining with you he swears that you are to marry his daughter  he be d said newton it was a poor way of getting out of the scrape and so ralph felt  but whats the meaning of it all hes telling everybody about london that you went down to stay with him at margate  neefit has gone mad lately said captain fooks with a goodnatured determination to stand by his friend in misfortune  but how about the girl newton asked his lordship  you may have her yourself pollif she dont prefer a young shoemaker to whom i believe shes engaged shes very pretty and has got a lot of moneywhich will suit you to a t he tried to put a good face on it but nevertheless he was very hot and red in the face  id put a stop to this if i were you said another friend confidentially and in a whisper hes not only telling everybody but writing letters about it  oh i know said ralph how can i help what a madman does its a bore of course then he sauntered out again feeling sure that his transactions with mr neefit would form the subject of conversation in the club billiardroom for the next hour and a half it would certainly become expedient that he should travel abroad  he felt it to be quite a relief when he found that mr neefit was not waiting for him at his chambers adolphe he said as soon as he was dressed that man must never be allowed to put his foot inside the door again  ahthe apollo gone and he did it express  i dont mind the figurebut he must never be allowed to enter the place again i shall not stay up long but while we are here you must not leave the place till six he wont come in the evening then he put a sovereign into the mans hand and went out to dine at lady eardhams  lady eardham had three fair daughters with pretty necks and flaxen hair and blue eyes and pug noses all wonderfully alike they ranged from twentyseven to twentyone there being sons betweenand it began to be desirable that they should be married since ralph had been in town the eardham mansion in cavendish square had been opened to him with almost maternal kindness he had accepted the kindness but being fully alive to the purposes of matronly intrigue had had his little jokes in reference to the young ladies he liked young ladies generally but was well aware that a young man is not obliged to offer his hand and heart to every girl that is civil to him he and the eardham girls had been exceedingly intimate but he had had no idea whatever of sharing newton priory with an eardham now however in his misery he was glad to go to a house in which he would be received with an assured welcome  everybody smiled upon him sir george in these days was very cordial greeting him with that genial esoteric warmth which is always felt by one english country gentleman with a large estate for another equally blessed six months ago when it was believed that ralph had sold his inheritance to his uncle sir george when he met the young man addressed him in a very different fashion as he entered the room he felt the warmth of the welcoming the girls one and all had ever so many things to say to him they all hunted and they all wanted him to look at horses for them lady eardham was more matronly than ever and at the same time was a little fussy she would not leave him among the girls and at last succeeded in getting him off into a corner of the back drawingroom now mr newton she said i am going to show you that i put the greatest confidence in you  so you may said ralph wondering whether one of the girls was to be offered to him out of hand at the present moment he was so low in spirits that he would probably have taken either  i have had a letter said lady eardham whispering the words into his earand then she paused such a strange letter and very abominable ive shown it to no onenot even to sir george i wouldnt let one of the girls see it for ever so much then there was another pause i dont believe a word of it mr newton but i think it right to show it to youbecause its about you  about me said ralph with his mind fixed at once upon mr neefit  yes indeedand when i tell you it refers to my girls too you will see how strong is my confidence in you if either had been specially named of course i could not have shown it then she handed him the letter which poor ralph read as follows      my ladyim told as mr ralph newton of newton priory    is sweet upon one of your ladyships daughters i think    it my duty to tell your ladyship hes engaged to marry my    girl maryanne neefit     yours most respectful     thomas neefit    breechesmaker conduit street   its a lie said ralph  im sure its a lie said lady eardham only i thought it right to show it you  ralph took gus eardham down to dinner and did his very best to make himself agreeable gus was the middle one of the three and was certainly a fine girl the eardham girls would have no money but ralph was not a greedy manexcept when he was in great need it must not be supposed however that on this occasion he made up his mind to marry gus eardham but as on previous occasions he had been able to hold all the eardhams in a kind of subjection to himself feeling himself to be bigger than theyas hitherto he had been conscious that he was bestowing and they receivingso now in his present misfortune did he recognise that gus was a little bigger than himself and that it was for her to give and for him to take and gus was able to talk to him as though she also entertained the same conviction gus was very kind to him and he felt grateful to her  lady eardham saw gus alone in her bedroom that night i believe hes a very good young man said lady eardham if hes managed rightly and as for all this about the horrid mans daughter it dont matter at all hed live it down in a month if he were married  i dont think anything about that mamma i dare say hes had his funjust like other men  only my dear hes one of that sort that have to be fixed  its so hard to fix them mamma  it neednt be hard to fix himthat is if youll only be steady hes not sharp and hard and callous like some of them he doesnt mean any harm and if he once speaks out he isnt one that cant be kept to time his manners are nice i dont think the property is involved but ill find out from papa and hes just the man to think his wife the pink of perfection lady eardham had read our heros character not inaccurately     chapter liii  the end of polly neefit   rumours wellsupported rumours as to the kind of life which mr neefit was leading reached alexandra cottage filling mrs neefits mind with dismay and making polly very angry indeed he came home always somewhat the worse for drink and would talk of punching the heads both of mr newton and of mr ontario moggs waddle who was very true to his masters interests had taken an opportunity of seeing mrs neefit and of expressing a very distinct idea that the business was going to the mischief mrs neefit was of opinion that in this emergency the business should be sold and that they might safely remove themselves to some distant countryto tunbridge or perhaps to ware polly however would not accede to her mothers views the evil must she thought be cured at once if father goes on like this i shall just walk straight out of the house and marry moggs at once polly said father makes no account of my name and so i must just look out for myself she had not as yet communicated these intentions to ontario but she was quite sure that she would be supported in her views by him whenever she should choose to do so  once or twice ontario came down to the cottage and when he did so mr neefit was always told of the visit i aint going to keep anything from father mother polly would say if he chooses to misbehave that isnt my fault i mean to have mr moggs and its only natural i should like to see him neefit when informed of these visits after swearing that moggs junior was a sneaking scoundrel to come to his house in his absence would call upon moggs senior and swear with many threats that his daughter should have nothing but what she stood up in moggs senior would stand quite silent cutting the skin on his hand with his shoemakers knife and would simply bid the infuriated breechesmaker good morning when he left the shop but in truth mr moggs senior had begun to doubt id leave it awhile onty if i was you he said may be after all hell give her nothing  ill take her the first day shell come to memoney or no money said moggs junior  foiled ambition had in truth driven the breechesmaker to madness but there were moments in which he was softened melancholy and almost penitent why didnt you have him when he come down to margate he said with the tears running down his cheek that very evening after eating his rumpsteak in mr newtons rooms the sodawater and brandy with a little ginandwater after it had reduced him to an almost maudlin condition so that he was unable to support his parental authority  because i didnt choose father it wasnt his fault he spoke fair enoughthough i dont suppose he ever wanted it why should he  you might have had him then hed ve never dared to go back id a killed him if he had  what good would it have done father hed never have loved me and hed have despised you and mother  i wouldnt ve minded that said mr neefit wiping his eyes  but i should have minded what should i have felt with a husband as wouldnt have wanted me ever to have my own father in his house would that have made me happy  it d ve made me happy to know as you was there  no father there would have been no happiness in it when i came to see what he was i knew i should never love him he was just willing to take me because of his wordand was i going to a man like that no fathercertainly not the poor man was at that moment too far gone in his misery to argue the matter further and he lay on the old sofa very much at pollys mercy drop it father she said it wasnt to be and it couldnt have been youd better say youll drop it but sick and uncomfortable as he was on that evening he couldnt be got to say that he would drop it  nor could he be got to drop it for some ten days after thatbut on a certain evening he had come home very uncomfortable from the effects of ginandwater and had been spoken to very sensibly both by his wife and daughter  by seven on the following morning ontario moggs was sitting in the front parlour of the house at hendon and polly neefit was sitting with him he had never been there at so early an hour before and it was thought afterwards by both mr and mrs neefit that his appearance so unexpected by them had not surprised their daughter polly could it have been possible that she had sent a message to him after that little scene with her father there he was at any rate and polly was up to receive him now onty thatll do i didnt want to talk nonsense but just to settle something  but youll tell a fellow that youre glad to see him  no i wont i wont tell a fellow anything he doesnt know already you and i have got to get married  of course we have  but we want fathers consent im not going to have him made unhappy if i can help it hes that wretched sometimes at present that my heart is half killed about him  the things he says are monstrous asserted moggs thinking of the protestation lately made by the breechesmaker in his own hearing to the effect that ralph newton should yet be made to marry his daughter  all the same ive got to think about him theres a dozen or so of men as would marry me mr moggs but i can never have another father  ill be the first of the dozen any way said the gallant ontario  that depends however mother says so and if father ll consent i wont go against it ill go to him now before hes up and ill tell him youre here ill bring him to his senses if i can i dont know whatever made him think so much about gentlemen  he didnt learn it from you polly  perhaps he did after all and if so thats the more reason why id forgive him so saying polly went upstairs upon her mission on the landing she met her mother and made known the fact that ontario was in the parlour dont you go to him mothernot yet said polly whereby it may be presumed that mrs neefit had been informed of mr moggss visit before polly had gone to him  mr neefit was in bed and his condition apparently was not a happy one he was lying with his head between his hands and was groaning not loudly but very bitterly his mode of life for the last month had not been of a kind to make him comfortable and his conscience too was ill at ease he had been a hardworking man who had loved respectability and been careful of his wife and child he had been proud to think that nobody could say anything against him and that he had always paid his way up to the time of this disastrous fit of ambition on pollys behalf he had never made himself ridiculous and had been a prosperous tradesman well thought of by his customers suddenly he had become mad but not so mad as to be unconscious of his own madness the failure of his hopes joined to the inexpressibly bitter feeling that in their joint transactions young newton had received all that had been necessary to him whereas he neefit had got none of that for which he had bargainedthese together had so upset him that he had lost his balance had travelled out of his usual grooves and had made an ass of himself he knew he had made an ass of himselfand was hopelessly endeavouring to show himself to be less of an ass than people thought him by some success in his violence if he could only punish young newton terribly people would understand why he had done all this but drink had been necessary to give him courage for his violence and now as he lay miserable in bed his courage was very low  father said polly shall i give you a drink neefit muttered something and took the cold tea that was offered to him it was cold tea with just a spoonful of brandy in it to make it acceptable father there ought to be an end of all thisoughtnt there  i dont know about no ends ill be down on him yet  no you wont father and why should you he has done nothing wrong to you or me i wouldnt have him if it was ever so  its all been your fault polly  yesmy fault that i wouldnt be made what you call a lady to be taken away so that id never see any more of you and mother then she put her hand gently on his shoulder i couldnt stand that father  id make him let you come to us  a wife must obey her husband father mother always obeyed you  no she didnt shes again me now  besides i dont want to be a lady said polly seeing that she had better leave that question of marital obedience and i wont be a lady i wont be better than you and mother  youve been brought up better  ill show my breeding then by being true to you and true to the man i love what would you think of your girl if she was to give her hand to agentleman when shed given her heart to ashoemaker  oh d the shoemaker  no father i wont have it what is there against ontario hes a finehearted fellow as isnt greedy after moneyas d kiss the very ground i stand on hes that true to me and is a tradesman as yourself if we had a little place of our own wouldnt ontario be proud to have you there and give you the best of everything and wouldnt i wait upon you just only trying to know beforehand every tittle as youd like to have and if there was to be babies wouldnt they be brought up to love you if id gone with that young man down to his fine place do you think it would have been like that how d ive felt when he was too proud to let his boy know as you was my father neefit turned on his bed and groaned he was too ill at ease as to his inner man to argue the subject from a high point of view or to assert that he was content to be abased himself in order that his child and grandchildren might be raised in the world father said polly you have always been kind to me be kind to me now  the young uns is always to have their own way said neefit  hasnt my way been your way father  not when you wouldnt take the captain when he come to margate  i didnt love him father dear father say the word we havent been happy latelyhave we father  i aint been very appy said neefit bursting out into sobs  she put her face upon his brow and kissed it father let us be happy again ontario is downstairsin the parlour now  ontario moggs in my parlour said neefit jumping up in bed  yes father ontario moggsmy husband as will be the man i honour and love the man that will honour and love you as true a fellow as ever made a young woman happy by taking her let me tell him that you will have him for a son in truth neefit did not speak the wordbut when polly left the room which she presently did after a long embrace mr neefit was aware that his consent to the union would be conveyed to ontario moggs in less than five minutes  and now you can name the day said ontario  i cannot do any such thing replied polly and i think that quite enough has been settled for one morning its give an inch and take an ell with some folks  ontario waited for breakfast and had an interview with his future fatherinlaw it was an hour after the scene upstairs before mr neefit could descend and when he did come down he was not very jovial at the breakfasttable it isnt what i like moggs was the first word that he spoke when the young politician rose to grasp the hand of his future fatherinlaw  i hope youll live to like it mr neefit said ontario who now that he was to have his way in regard to polly was prepared to disregard entirely any minor annoyances  i dont know how that may be i think my girl might have done better i told her so and i just tell you the same she might a done a deal better but women is always restive  we like to have our own way about our young men father said polly who was standing behind her fathers chair  bother young men said the breechesmaker after that the interview passed off if not very pleasantly at least smoothlyand it was understood that mr neefit was to abandon that system of persecution against ralph newton to which his life had been devoted for the last few weeks  after that there was a pretty little correspondence between polly and ralph with which the story of pollys maiden life may be presumed to be ended and which shall be given to the reader although by doing so the facts of our tale will be somewhat anticipated polly with her fathers permission communicated the fact of her engagement to her former lover      hendon saturday     dear sir     father thinks it best that i should tell you that i    am engaged to marry mr ontario moggswhom you will    remember he is a most respectable tradesman and stood    once for a member of parliament and i think he will make    me quite happy and im quite sure thats what im fitted    for   whether polly meant that she was fitted to be made happy or fitted to be the wife of a tradesman who stood for parliament did not appear quite clearly      there have been things which we are very sorry for and    hope youll forgive and forget father bids me say how    sorry he is he broke a figure of a pretty little man in    your room he would get another only he would not know    where to go for it     wishing you always may be happy believe me to remain     yours most respectfully     maryanne neefit   ralphs answer was dated about a fortnight afterwards       cavendish square 1 june 186     my dear polly     i hope you will allow me to call you so now for the    last time i am indeed happy that you are going to    be married i believe mr moggs to be a most excellent    fellow i hope i may often see himand sometimes you    he must allow you to accept a little present which i send    you and never be jealous if you wear it at your waist    the pretty little man that your father broke by accident    in my rooms did not signify at all pray tell him so from    me     believe me to be your very sincere friend     ralph newton     i may as well tell you my own secret i am going to be    married too the young lady lives in this house and her    name is augusta eardham   this letter was sent by messenger from cavendish square with a very handsome watch and chain a month afterwards when he was preparing to leave london for brayboro park he received a little packet with a note as follows      linton devonshire wednesday     dear mr newton     i am so much obliged for the watch and so is ontario who    will never be jealous im sure it is a most beautiful    thing and i shall value it oh so much i am very glad    you are going to be married and should have answered    before only i wanted to finish making with my own hand a    little chain which i send you and i hope your sweetheart    wont be jealous either we looked her out in a book and    found she is the daughter of a great gentleman with a    title that is all just as it should be ontario sends his    respects we have come down here for the honeymoon     i remain yours very sincerely     maryanne moggs     chapter liv  my mary   both the invitations sent by patience underwood were accepted and sir thomas on the day named was at home to receive them nothing had as yet been done as to the constructing of those cases which he so suddenly ordered to be made for his books and indeed stemm had resolved to take the order as meaning nothing it would not be for him to accelerate his masters departure from southampton buildings and he knew enough of the man to be aware that he must have some very strong motive indeed before so great a change could be really made when sir thomas left southampton buildings for fulham on the day named for the dinner not a word further had been said about packing the books  there was no company at the villa besides sir thomas the three girls and the two young men as to clarissa patience said not a word even to her fatherthat must still be left till time should further cure the wound that had been madebut she did venture to suggest in private with sir thomas that it was a pity that he who was certainly the more worthy of the two ralphs should not be made to understand that others did not think so much of the present inferiority of his position in the world as he seemed to think himself  you mean that mary would take him asked sir thomas  why should she not if she likes him he is very good  i cant tell him to offer to her without telling him also that he would be accepted  noi suppose not said patience  nevertheless sir thomas did speak to ralph newton before dinnerstuttering and muttering and only half finishing his sentence we had a correspondence once mr newton i dare say you remember  i remember it very well sir thomas  i only wanted to tell youyou seem to think more about what has taken placei mean as to the propertythan we dothat is than i do  it has made a change  yes of course but i dont know that a large place like newton is sure to make a man happy perhaps youd like to wash your hands before dinner gregory in the meantime was walking round the garden with mary and clarissa  the dinner was very quiet but pleasant and cheerful sir thomas talked a good deal and so did patience mary also was at her ease and able to do all that was required of her ralph certainly was not gay he was seated next to clarissa and spoke a few words now and again but he was arranging matters in his mind and patience who was observing them all knew that he was preoccupied clarissa who now and again would forget her sorrow and revert to her former selfas she had done in the picturegallerycould not now under the eye as it were of her father her sister and her old lover forget her troubles she knew what was expected of her but she could not do itshe could not do it at least as yet nevertheless patience who was the engineer in the present crisis was upon the whole contented with the way in which things were going  the three girls sat with the gentlemen for a quarter of an hour after the decanters were put upon the table and then withdrew sir thomas immediately began to talk about newton priory and to ask questions which might interest the parson without as he thought hurting the feelings of the disinherited ralph this went on for about five minutes during which gregory was very eloquent about his church and his people when suddenly ralph rose from his chair and withdrew have i said anything that annoyed him asked sir thomas anxiously  it is not that i think said gregory  ralph walked across the passage opened the door of the drawingroom in which the three girls were at work walked up to the chair in which mary bonner was sitting and said something in so low a voice that neither of the sisters heard him  certainly i will said mary rising from her chair patience glanced round and could see that the colour always present in her cousins face was heightenedever so little indeed but still the telltale blush had told its tale ralph stood for a moment while mary moved away to the door and then followed her without speaking a word to the other girls or bestowing a glance on either of them  he is going to propose to her said clarissa as soon as the door was shut  no one can be sure said patience  only fancyasking a girl to go out of the roomin that brave manner i shouldnt have gone because im a coward but its just what mary will like  let me get my hat mr newton said mary taking the opportunity to trip upstairs though her hat was hanging in the hall when she was in her room she merely stood upright there for half a minute in the middle of the chamber erect and stiff with her arms and fingers stretched out thinking how she would behave herself half a minute sufficed for her to find her clue and then she came down as quickly as her feet would carry her he had opened the front door and was standing outside upon the gravel and there she joined him  i had no other way but this of speaking to you he said  i dont dislike coming out at all she answered then there was silence for a moment or two as they walked along into the gloom of the shrubbery i suppose you are going down to norfolk soon she said  i do not quite know i thought of going tomorrow  so soon as that  but ive got something that i want to settle i think you must know what it is then he paused again almost as though he expected her to confess that she did know but mary was well aware that it was not for her to say another word till he had fully explained in most open detail what it was that he desired to settle you know a good deal of my history miss newton when i thought that things were going well with memuch better than i had ever allowed myself to expect in early days iibecame acquainted with you again he paused but she had not a word to say i dare say you were not told but i wrote to your uncle then asking him whether i might have his consent tojust to ask you to be my wife again he paused but after that he hurried on speaking the words as quickly as he could throw them forth from his mouth my father died and of course that changed everything i told your uncle that all ground for pretension that i might have had before was cut from under me he knew the circumstances of my birthand i supposed that you would know it also  then she did speak yes i did she said  perhaps i was foolish to think that the property would make a difference but the truth of it is i have not got over the feeling and shall never get over it i love you with all my heartand though it be for no good i must tell you so  the property can make no difference she said you ought to have known that mr newton  ahbut it does i tried to tell you the other day something of my present home  yesi know you didand i remember it all  there is nothing more to be saidonly to ask you to share it with me  she walked on with him in silence for a minute but he said nothing more to press his suit and certainly it was her turn to speak now i will share it with you she said pressing her arm upon his  my mary  yesyour maryif you please then he took her in his arms and pressed her to his bosom and kissed her lips and forehead and threw back her hat and put his fingers among her hair why did you say that the property would make a difference she asked in a whisper to this he made no answer but walked on silently with his arm round her waist till they came out from among the trees and stood upon the bank of the river there are people in the boats you must put your arm down she said  i wonder how you will like to be a farmers wife he asked  i have not an idea  i fear so much that youll find it rough and hard  but i have an idea about something she took his hand and looked up into his face as she continued i have an idea that i shall like to be your wife he was in a seventh heaven of happiness and would have stood there gazing on the river with her all night if she would have allowed him at last they walked back into the house togetherand into the room where the others were assembled with very little outward show of embarrassment mary was the first to enter the room and though she blushed she smiled also and every one knew what had taken place there was no secret or mystery and in five minutes her cousins were congratulating her its all settled for you now said clarissa laughing  yes its all settled for me now and i wouldnt have it unsettled for all the world  while this was being said in the drawingroombeing said even in the presence of poor gregory who could not but have felt how hard it was for him to behold such bliss sir thomas and ralph had withdrawn into the opposite room ralph began to apologise for his own misfortuneshis misfortune in having lost the inheritance his misfortune in being illegitimate but sir thomas soon cut his apologies short you think a great deal more of it than she does or than i do said sir thomas  if she does not regard it i will never think of it again said ralph my greatest glory in what had been promised me was in thinking that it might help to win her  you have won her without such help as that said sir thomas with his arm on the young mans shoulder  there was another delicious hour in store for him as they sat over their late tea do you still think of going to norfolk tomorrow she said to him with that composure which in her was so beautiful and at the same time so expressive  by an early train in the morning  i thought that perhaps you might have stayed another day now  i thought that perhaps you might want me to come back again said ralphand if so i could make arrangementsperhaps for a week or ten days  do come back she said and do stay  ralphs triumph as he returned that evening to london received gregorys fullest sympathy but still it must have been hard to bear perhaps his cousins parting words contained for him some comfort give her a little time and she will be yours yet i shall find it all out from mary and you may be sure we shall help you     chapter lv  cookham   we have been obliged to anticipate in some degree the course of our story by the necessity which weighed upon us of completing the history of polly neefit in regard to her we will only further express an opinionin which we believe that we shall have the concurrence of our readersthat mr moggs junior had chosen well her story could not be adequately told without a revelation of that correspondence which while it has explained the friendly manner in which the neefitnewton embarrassments were at last brought to an end has at the same time disclosed the future lot in life of our heroas far as a heros lot in life may be said to depend on his marriage  mr neefit had been almost heartbroken because he was not satisfied that his victim was really punished by any of those tortures which his imagination invented and his energy executed even when the pretty little man was smashed and was in truth smashed of malice prepense by a swinging blow from neefits umbrella neefit did not feel satisfied that he would thereby reach his victims heart he could project his own mind with sufficient force into the bosom of his enemy to understand that the onions and tobacco consumed in that luxurious chamber would cause annoyancebut he desired more than annoyancehe wanted to tear the very heartstrings of the young man who had as he thought so signally outwitted him he did not believe that he was successful but in truth he did make poor ralph very unhappy the heir felt himself to be wounded and could not eat and drink or walk and talk or ride in the park or play billiards at his club in a manner befitting the owner of newton priory he was so injured by neefit that he became pervious to attacks which would otherwise have altogether failed in reaching him lady eardham would never have prevailed against him as she didconquering by a quick repetition of small blowshad not all his strength been annihilated for the time by the persecutions of the breechesmaker  lady eardham whispered to him as he was taking his departure on the evening of the dinner in cavendish square dear mr newtonjust one word she said confidentiallythat must be a very horrid manalluding to mr neefit  its a horrid bore you know lady eardham  just soand it makes me feelas though i didnt quite know whether something ought not to be done would you mind calling at eleven tomorrow of course i shant tell sir georgeunless you think he ought to be told ralph promised that he would call though he felt at the moment that lady eardham was an interfering old fool why should she want to do anything and why should she give even a hint as to telling sir george as he walked across hanover square and down bond street to his rooms he did assert to himself plainly that the old harridan as he called her was at work for her second girl and he shook his head and winked his eye as he thought of it but even in his solitude he did not feel strong against lady eardham and he moved along the pavement oppressed by a halfformed conviction that her ladyship would prevail against him he did not however think that he had any particular objection to gus eardham there was a deal of style about the girl a merit in which either clarissa or mary would have been sadly deficient and there could be no doubt in thisthat a man in his position ought to marry in his own class the proper thing for him to do was to make the daughter of some country gentlemanor of some nobleman just as it might happenmistress of the priory dear little clary would hardly have known how to take her place properly down in hampshire and then he thought for a moment of polly perhaps after all fate fashion and fortune managed marriage for young men better than they could manage it for themselves what a life would his have been had he really married polly neefit though he did call lady eardham a harridan he resolved that he would keep his promise for the following morning  lady eardham when he arrived was mysterious eulogistic and beneficent she was clearly of opinion that something should be done you know it is so horrid having these kind of things said and yet she was almost equally strong in opinion that nothing could be done you know i wouldnt have my girls name brought up for all the worldthough why the horrid wretch should have named her i cannot even guess the horrid wretch had not in truth named any special her though it suited lady eardham to presume that allusion had been made to that hope of the flock that crowning glory of the eardham family that most graceful of the graces that venus certain to be chosen by any paris her second daughter gus she went on to explain that were she to tell the story to her son marmaduke her son marmaduke would probably kill the breechesmaker as marmaduke eardham was of all young men about town perhaps the most careless the most indifferent and the least ferocious his mother was probably mistaken in her estimate of his resentful feelings as for sir george he would be for taking the law of the wretch for libel and then we should be i dont know where we should be then but my dear girl would die  of course there was nothing done during the whole interview lady eardham continued to press neefits letter under her hand upon the table as though it was of all documents the most precious she handled it as though to tear it would be as bad as to tear an original document bearing the kings signature before the interview was over she had locked it up in her desk as though there were something in it by which the whole eardham race might be blessed or banned and though she spoke no such word she certainly gave ralph to understand that by this letter he ralph newton was in some mysterious manner so connected with the secrets and the interests and the sanctity of the eardham family that whether such connection might be for weal or woe the newtons and the eardhams could never altogether free themselves from the link perhaps you had better come and dine with us in a family way tomorrow said lady eardham giving her invitation as though it must necessarily be tendered and almost necessarily accepted ralph not thanking her but taking it in the same spirit said that he would be there at half past seven just ourselves said lady eardham in a melancholy tone as though they two were doomed to eat family dinners together for ever after  i suppose the property is really his own said lady eardham to her husband that afternoon  sir george was a stout plethoric gentleman with a short temper and many troubles marmaduke was expensive and sir george himself had spent money when he was young the girls who knew that they had no fortunes expected that everything should be done for them at least during the period of their natural harvestand they were successful in having their expectations realised they demanded that there should be horses to ride servants to attend them and dresses to wear and they had horses servants and dresses there were also younger children and sir george was quite as anxious as lady eardham that his daughters should become wives his ownof course its his own who else should it belong to  there was something about that other young man  the bastard it was the greatest sin that ever was thought of to palm such a fellow as that off on the countybut it didnt come to anything  im told too he has been very extravagant no doubt he did get money from thethe tailor who wants to make him marry his daughter  a fleabite said sir george dont you bother about that thus authorised lady eardham went to the work with a clear conscience and a good will  on the next morning ralph received by post an envelope from sir thomas underwood containing a letter addressed to him from mr neefit sirare you going to make your ward act honourable to me and my daughteryours respectful thomas neefit the reader will understand that this was prior to pollys triumph over her father ralph uttered a deep curse and made up his mind that he must either throw himself entirely among the eardhams or else start at once for the rocky mountains he dined in cavendish square that day and again took gus down to dinner  im very glad to see you here said sir george when they two were alone together after the ladies had left them sir george who had been pressed upon home service because of the necessity of the occasion was anxious to get off to his club  you are very kind sir george said ralph  we shall be delighted to see you at brayboro if youll come for a week in september and look at the girls horses they say youre quite a pundit about horseflesh  oh i dont know said ralph  youll like to go up to the girls now i dare say and ive got an engagement then sir george rang the bell for a cab and ralph went upstairs to the girls emily had taken herself away josephine was playing bésique with her mother and gus was thus forced into conversation with the young man bésique is so stupid said gus  horribly stupid said ralph  and what do you like mr newton  i like you said ralph but he did not propose on that evening lady eardham thought he ought to have done so and was angry with him it was becoming almost a matter of necessity with her that young men should not take much time emily was twentyseven and josephine was a most difficult child to managenot pretty but yet giving herself airs and expecting everything she had refused a clergyman with a very good private fortune greatly to her mothers sorrow and gus had already been the source of much weary labour four eldest sons had been brought to her feet and been allowed to slip away and all as lady eardham said because gus would joke with other young men while the one man should have received all her pleasantry emily was quite of opinion that young newton should by no means have been allotted to gus lady eardham who had played bésique with an energy against which josephine would have mutinied but that some promise was made as to marshall and snelgrove could see from her little table that young newton was neither abject nor triumphant in his manner he had not received nor had he even asked when he got up to take his leave lady eardham could have boxed his ears but she smiled upon him ineffably pressed his hand and in the most natural way in the world alluded to some former allusion about riding and the park  i shant ride tomorrow said gus with her back turned to them  do said ralph  no i shant  you see what she says lady eardham said ralph  you promised you would before dinner my dear said lady eardham and you ought not to change your mind if youll be goodnatured enough to come two of them will go of course it was understood that he would come  nothing on earth mamma shall ever induce me to play bésique again said josephine yawning  its not worse for you than for me said the old lady sharply  but it isnt fair said josephine who was supposed to be the clever one of the family i may have to play my bésique a quarter of a century hence  hes an insufferable puppy said emily who had come into the room and had been pretending to be reading  thats because he dont bark at your bidding my dear said gus  it doesnt seem that he means to bark at yours said the elder sister  if you go on like that girls ill tell your papa and well go to brayboro at once its too bad and i wont bear it  what would you have me do said gus standing up for herself fiercely  gus did ride and so did josephine and there was a servant with them of course it had been emilys turnthere being two horses for the three girls but gus had declared that no good could come if emily wentand emilys going had been stopped by parental authority you do as youre bid said sir george or youll get the worst of it sir george suffered much from gout and had obtained from the illtemper which his pangs produced a mastery over his daughters which some fathers might have envied  you behaved badly to me last night mr newton said gus on horseback there was another young man riding with josephine so that the lovers were alone together  behaved badly to you  yes you did and i felt it very muchvery much indeed  how did i behave badly  if you do not know im sure that i shall not tell you ralph did not knowbut he went home from his ride an unengaged man and may perhaps have been thought to behave badly on that occasion also  but lady eardham though she was sometimes despondent and often cross was gifted with perseverance a picnic party up the river from maidenhead to cookham was got up for the 30th of may and ralph newton of course was there just at that time the neefit persecution was at its worst letters directed by various hands came to him daily and in all of them he was asked when he meant to be on the square he knew the meaning of that picnic as well as does the readeras well as did lady eardham but it had come to that with him that he was willing to yield it cannot exactly be said for him that out of all the feminine worth that he had seen he himself had chosen gus eardham as being the most worthyor even that he had chosen her as being to him the most charming but it was evident to him that he must get married and why not to her as well as to another she had style plenty of style and as he told himself style for a man in his position was more than anything else it can hardly be said that he had made up his mind to offer to her before he started for cookhamthough doubtless through all the remaining years of his life he would think that his mind had been so fixedbut he had concluded that if she were thrown at his head very hard he might as well take her i dont think he ever does drink champagne said lady eardham talking it all over with gus on the morning of the picnic  at cookham there is or was a puntperhaps there always will be one kept there for such purposesand into this punt either gus was tempted by ralph or ralph by gus my darling child what are you doing shouted lady eardham from the bank  mr newton says he can take me over said gus standing up in the punt shaking herself with a pretty tremor  dont mr newton pray dont cried lady eardham with affected horror  lunch was over or dinner as it might be more properly called and ralph had taken a glass or two of champagne he was a man whom no one had ever seen the worse for wine but on this occasion that which might have made others drunk had made him bold i will not let you out gus till you have promised me one thing said ralph  what is the one thing  that you will go with me everywhere always  you must let me out said gus  but will you promise then gus promised and lady eardham with true triumph in her voice was able to tell her husband on the following morning that the cost of the picnic had not been thrown away  on the next morning early ralph was in the square neither when he went to bed at night nor when he got up in the morning did he regret what he had done the marriage would be quite a proper marriage nobody could say that he had been mercenary and he hated a mercenary feeling in marriages nobody could say that the match was beneath him and all people were agreed that augusta eardham was a very fine girl as to her style there could be no doubt about it there might be some little unpleasantness in communicating the fact to the underwoodsbut that could be done by letter after all it would signify very little to him what sir thomas thought about him sir thomas might think him feeble but he himself knew very well that there had been no feebleness in it his circumstances had been very peculiar and he really believed that he had made the best of them as squire of newton he was doing quite the proper thing in marrying the daughter of a baronet out of the next county with a light heart a pleased face and with very well gotup morning apparel ralph knocked the next morning at the door in cavendish square and asked for sir george eardham ill just run upstairs for a second said ralph when he was told that sir george was in the small parlour  he did run upstairs and in three minutes had been kissed by lady eardham and all her daughters at this moment gus was the dearest child and the best love of a thing with all of them even emily remembered how pleasant it might be to have a room at newton priory and then success always gives a new charm  have you seen sir george asked lady eardham  not as yetthey said he was there but i had to come up and see her first you know  go down to him said lady eardham patting her prey on the back twice when youve daughters of your own youll expect to be consulted  she couldnt have done better my dear fellow said sir george with kind genial cordiality she couldnt have done better to my thinking even with a peerage i like you and i like your family and i like your property and shes yours with all my heart a better girl never lived  thank you sir george  she has no money you know  i dont care about money sir george  my dear boy shes yours with all my heart and i hope youll make each other happy     chapter lvi  ralph newton is bowled away   a day or two after his engagement ralph did write his letter to sir thomas and found when the moment came that the task was difficult but he wrote it the thing had to be done and there was nothing to be gained by postponing it       club june 2 186     my dear sir thomas     you will i hope be glad to hear that i am engaged to be    married to augusta eardham the second daughter of sir    george eardham of brayboro park in berkshire of course    you will know the name and i rather think you were in    the house when sir george sat for berkshire augusta    has got no money but i have not been placed under the    disagreeable necessity of looking out for a rich wife i    believe we shall be married about the end of august as    the ceremony will take place down at brayboro i fear    that i cannot expect that you or patience and clarissa    should come so far pray tell them my news with my best    love     yours most grateful for all your long kindness     ralph newton     i am very sorry that you should have been troubled by    letters from mr neefit the matter has been arranged at    last   the letter when done was very simple but it took him some time and much consideration should he or should he not allude to his former loves it was certainly much easier to write his letter without any such allusion and he did so  about a week after this sir thomas went home to fulham and took the letter with him clary he said taking his youngest daughter affectionately by the waist when he found himself alone with her ive got a piece of news for you  for me papa  well for all of us somebody is going to be married who do you think it is  not ralph newton said clarissa with a little start  yes ralph newton  how quick he arranges things said clarissa there was some little emotion just a quiver and a quick rush of blood into her cheeks which however left them just as quickly  yeshe is quick  who is it papa  a very proper sort of personthe daughter of a berkshire baronet  but what is her name  augusta eardham  augusta eardham i hope hell be happy papa weve known him a long time  i think he will be happywhat people call happy he is not giftedor cursed as it may bewith fine feelings and is what perhaps may be called thickskinned but he will love his own wife and children i dont think he will be a spendthrift now that he has plenty to spend and he is not subject to what the world calls vices i shouldnt wonder if he becomes a prosperous and most respectable country gentleman and quite a model to his neighbours  it doesnt seem to matter muchdoes it said clarissa when she told the story to mary and patience  what doesnt matter asked mary  whether a man cares for the girl hes going to marry or doesnt care at all ralph newton cannot care very much for miss eardham  i think it matters very much said mary  perhaps after all hell be just as fond of his wife in a way as though he had been making love to heroh for years said clarissa this was nearly all that was said at the villa though no doubt poor clary had many thoughts on the matter in her solitary rambles along the river that picture of the youth as he lay upon the lawn looking up into her eyes and telling her that she was dear to him could not easily be effaced from her memory sir thomas before this had written his congratulations to ralph they had been very short and in them no allusion had been made to the young ladies at popham villa  in the meantime ralph was as happy as the day was long and delighted with his lot in life for some weeks previous to his offer he had been aware that lady eardham had been angling for him as for a fish that he had been as a prey to her and to her daughter and that it behoved him to amuse himself without really taking the hook between his gills he had taken the hook and now had totally forgotten all those former notions of his in regard to a prey and a fish and a mercenary old harridan of a mother he had no sooner been kissed all round by the women and paternally blessed by sir george than he thought that he had exercised a sound judgment and had with true wisdom arranged to ally himself with just the woman most fit to be his wife and the future mistress of newton priory he was proud indeed of his success when he read the paragraph in the morning post announcing as a fact that the alliance had been arranged and was again able to walk about among his comrades as one of those who make circumstances subject to them rather than become subject to circumstances his comrades no doubt saw the matter in another light by jove said pretty poll at his club theres newton been and got caught by old eardham after all the girl has been running ten years and been hawked about like a secondclass racehorse  yes poor fellow said captain fooks neefit has done that for him ralph for a while was so knocked off his pins by the breechesmaker that he didnt know where to look for shelter  whether marriages should be made in heaven or on earth must be a matter of doubt to observerswhether that is men and women are best married by chance which i take to be the real fashion of heavenmade marriages or should be brought into that close link and loving bondage to each other by thought selection and decision that the heavenly mode prevails the oftenest there can hardly be a doubt it takes years to make a friendship but a marriage may be settled in a weekin an hour if you desire to go into partnership with a man in business it is an essential necessity that you should know your partner that he be honestor dishonest if such be your own tendencyindustrious instructed in the skill required and of habits of life fit for the work to be done but into partnerships for lifeof a kind much closer than any business partnershipmen rush without any preliminary inquiries some investigation and anxiety as to means there may be though in this respect the ordinary parlance of the world endows men with more caution or accuses them of more greed than they really possess but in other respects everything is taken for granted let the woman if possible be prettyor if not pretty let her have style let the man if possible not be a fool or if a fool let him not show his folly too plainly as for knowledge of character none is possessed and none is wanted the young people meet each other in their holiday dresses on holiday occasions amidst holiday pleasuresand the thing is arranged such matches may be said to be heavenmade  it is a fair question whether they do not answer better than those which have less of chanceor less of heavenin their manufacture if it be needful that a man and woman take five years to learn whether they will suit each other as husband and wife and that then at the end of the five years they find that they will not suit the freshness of the flower would be gone before it could be worn in the buttonhole there are some leaps which you must take in the dark if you mean to jump at all we can all understand well that a wise man should stand on the brink and hesitate but we can understand also that a very wise man should declare to himself that with no possible amount of hesitation could certainty be achieved let him take the jump or not take itbut let him not presume to think that he can so jump as to land himself in certain bliss it is clearly gods intention that men and women should live together and therefore let the leap in the dark be made  no doubt there had been very much of heaven in ralph newtons last choice it may be acknowledged that in lieu of choosing at all he had left the matter altogether to heaven some attempt he had made at choosingin reference to mary bonner but he had found the attempt simply to be troublesome and futile he had spoken soft loving words to clarissa because she herself had been soft and lovable nature had spokenas she does when the birds sing to each other then again while suffering under pecuniary distress he had endeavoured to make himself believe that polly neefit was just the wife for him then amidst the glories of his emancipation from thraldom he had seen mary bonnerand had actually after a fashion made a choice for himself his choice had brought upon him nothing but disgrace and trouble now he had succumbed at the bidding of heaven and lady eardham and he was about to be provided with a wife exactly suited for him it may be said at the same time that augusta eardham was equally lucky she also had gotten all that she ought to have wanted had she known what to want they were both of them incapable of what men and women call love when they speak of love as a passion linked with romance and in one sense they were coldhearted neither of them was endowed with the privilege of pining because another person had perished but each of them was able to love a mate when assured that that mate must continue to be mate unless separation should come by domestic earthquake they had hearts enough for paternal and maternal duties and would probably agree in thinking that any geese which providence might send them were veritable swans bickerings there might be but they would be bickerings without effect and ralph newton of newton would probably so live with this wife of his bosom that they too might lie at last pleasantly together in the family vault with the record of their homely virtues visible to the survivors of the parish on the same tombstone the means by which each of them would have arrived at these blessings would not redound to the credit of either but the blessings would be there and it may be said of their marriage as of many such marriages that it was made in heaven and was heavenly  the marriage was to take place early in september and the first week in august was passed by sir george and lady eardham and their two younger daughters at newton priory on the 14th ralph was to be allowed to run down to the moors just for one week and then he was to be back passing between newton and brayboro signing deeds and settlements preparing for their wedding tour and obedient in all things to eardham influences it did occur to him that it would be proper that he should go down to fulham to see his old friends once before his marriage but he felt that such a visit would be to himself very unpleasant and therefore he assured himself and moreover made himself believe that if he abstained from the visit he would abstain because it would be unpleasant to them he did abstain but he did call at the chambers in southampton buildings he called however at an hour in which he knew that sir thomas would not be visible and made no second pressing request to stemm for the privilege of entrance  he had great pride in showing his house and park and estate to the eardhams and had some delicious rambles with his augusta through the shrubberies and down by the little brook ralph had an enjoyment in the prettiness of nature and augusta was clever enough to simulate the feeling he was a little annoyed perhaps when he found that the beauty of her morning dresses did not admit of her sitting upon the grass or leaning against gates and once expressed an opinion that she need not be so particular about her gloves in this the hour of their billing and cooing augusta altogether declined to remove her gloves in a place swarming as she said with midges or to undergo any kind of embrace while adorned with that sweetest of all hats which had been purchased for his especial delight but in other respects she was good humoured and tried to please him she learned the names of all his horses and was beginning to remember those of his tenants she smiled upon gregory and behaved with a pretty decorum when the young parson showed her his church altogether her behaviour was much better than might have been expected from the training to which she had been subjected during her seven seasons in london lord polperrow wronged her greatly when he said that she had been running for ten years  there was a little embarrassment in ralphs first interview with gregory he had given his brother notice of his engagement by letter as soon as he had been accepted feeling that any annoyance coming to him might be lessoned in that way unfortunately he had spoken to his brother in what he now felt to have been exaggerated terms of his passion for mary bonner and he himself was aware that that malady had been quickly cured i suppose the news startled you he had said with a forced laugh as soon as he met his brother  wellyes a little i did not know that you were so intimate with them  the truth is i had thought a deal about the matter and i had come to see how essential it was for the interests of us all that i should marry into our own set the moment i saw augusta i felt that she was exactly the girl to make me happy she is very handsome dont you think so  certainly  and then she has just the style which after all does go so far theres nothing dowdy about her a dowdy woman would have killed me she attracted me from the first moment and by jove old fellow i can assure you it was mutual i am the happiest fellow alive and i dont think there is anything i envy anybody in all this ralph believed that he was speaking the simple truth  i hope youll be happy with all my heart said gregory  i am sure i shalland so will you if you will ask that little puss once again i believe in my heart she loves you gregory though he had been informed of his brothers passion for mary had never been told of that other passion for clarissa and ralph could therefore speak of ground for hope in that direction without uncomfortable twinges  there did occur during this fortnight one or two little matters just sufficiently laden with care to ruffle the roseleaves of our heros couch lady eardham thought that both the diningroom and drawingroom should be refurnished that a bowwindow should be thrown out to the breakfastparlour and that a raised conservatory should be constructed into which augustas own morning sittingroom upstairs might be made to open ralph gave way about the furniture with a good grace but he thought that the bowwindow would disfigure the house and suggested that the raised conservatory would cost money augusta thought the bowwindow was the very thing for the house and lady eardham knew as a fact that a similar conservatorythe sweetest thing in the worldwhich she had seen at lord rosebuds had cost almost absolutely nothing and if anything was wellknown in gardening it was this that the erection of such conservatories was a positive saving in garden expenses the men worked under cover during the rainy days and the hotwater served for domestic as well as horticultural purposes there was some debate and a little heat and the matter was at last referred to sir george he voted against ralph on both points and the orders were given  then there was the more important question of the settlements of course there were to be settlements in the arrangement of which ralph was to give everything and to get nothing with highhanded magnanimity he had declared that he wanted no money and therefore the trifle which would have been adjudged to be due to gus was retained to help her as yet less fortunate sisters in truth marmaduke at this time was so expensive that sir george was obliged to be a little hard why however he should have demanded out of such a property as that of newton a jointure of £4000 a year with a house to be found either in town or country as the widow might desire on behalf of a penniless girl no one acting in the newton interest could understand unless sir george might have thought that the sum to be ultimately obtained might depend in some degree on that demanded had he known mr carey he would probably not have subjected himself to the rebuke which he received  ralph when the sum was first named to him by sir georges lawyer who came down purposely to newton looked very blank and said that he had not anticipated any arrangement so destructive to the property the lawyer pointed out that there was unfortunately no dowagers house provided that the property would not be destroyed as the dower would only be an annuity that ladies now were more liberally treated in this matter than formerlyand that the suggestion was quite the usual thing you dont suppose i mean my daughter to be starved said sir george upon whom gout was then coming ralph plucked up spirit and answered him nor do i intend that your daughter sir should be starved dear ralph do be liberal to the dear girl said lady eardham afterwards caressing our hero in the solitude of her bedroom mr carey however arranged the whole matter very quickly the dower must be £2000 out of which the widow must find her own house sir george must be well aware said mr carey that the demand made was preposterous sir george said one or two very nasty things but the dower as fixed by mr carey was accepted and then everything smiled again  when the eardhams were leaving newton the parting between augusta and her lover was quite pretty dear gus he said when next i am here you will be my own own wife and he kissed her dear ralph she said when next i am here you will be my own own husband and kissed him but we have como and florence and rome and naples to do before thatand wont that be nice  it will be very nice to be anywhere with you said the lover  and mind you have your coat made just as i told you said augusta so they parted  early in september they were married with great éclat at brayboro and lady eardham spared nothing on the occasion it was her first maternal triumph and all the country round was made to know of her success the newtons had been at newton forshe did not know how many hundred years in her zeal she declared that the estate had been in the same hands from long before the conquest theres no title she said to her intimate friend lady wiggham but theres that which is better than a title were mushrooms to the newtons you know we only came into berkshire in the reign of henry viii as the wigghams had only come into buckinghamshire in the reign of george iv lady wiggham had she known the facts would probably have reminded her dear friend that the eardhams had in truth first been heard of in those parts in the time of queen annethe original eardham having made his money in following marlboroughs army but lady wiggham had not studied the history of the county gentry the wedding went off very well and the bride and bridegroom were bowled away to the nearest station with four grey posthorses from reading in a manner that was truly delightful to lady eardhams motherly feelings  and with the same grey horses shall the happy bride and bridegroom be bowled out of our sight also the writer of this story feels that some apology is due to his readers for having endeavoured to entertain them so long with the adventures of one of whom it certainly cannot be said that he was fit to be delineated as a hero it is thought by many critics that in the pictures of imaginary life which novelists produce for the amusement and possibly for the instruction of their readers none should be put upon the canvas but the very good who by their noble thoughts and deeds may lead others to nobility or the very bad who by their declared wickedness will make iniquity hideous how can it be worth ones while such critics will saythe writer here speaks of all critical readers and not of professional criticshow can it be worth our while to waste our imaginations our sympathies and our time upon such a one as ralph the heir of the newton property the writer acknowledging the force of these objections and confessing that his young heroes of romance are but seldom heroic makes his apology as follows  the reader of a novelwho has doubtless taken the volume up simply for amusement and who would probably lay it down did he suspect that instruction like a snake in the grass like physic beneath the sugar was to be imposed upon himrequires from his author chiefly this that he shall be amused by a narrative in which elevated sentiment prevails and gratified by being made to feel that the elevated sentiments described are exactly his own when the heroine is nobly true to her lover to her friend or to her duty through all persecution the girl who reads declares to herself that she also would have been a jeannie deans had fate and fortune given her an effie as a sister the baldheaded old lawyerfor baldheaded old lawyers do read novelswho interests himself in the highminded selfdevoting chivalry of a colonel newcombe believes he would have acted as did the colonel had he been so tried what youth in his imagination cannot be as brave and as loving though as hopeless in his love as harry esmond alas no one will wish to be as was ralph newton but for one harry esmond there are fifty ralph newtonsfive hundred and fifty of them and the very youth whose bosom glows with admiration as he reads of harrywho exults in the idea that as harry did so would he have donelives as ralph lived is less noble less persistent less of a man even than was ralph newton  it is the test of a novel writers art that he conceals his snakeinthegrass but the reader may be sure that it is always there no man or woman with a conscienceno man or woman with intellect sufficient to produce amusement can go on from year to year spinning stories without the desire of teaching with no ambition of influencing readers for their good gentle readers the physic is always beneath the sugar hidden or unhidden in writing novels we novelists preach to you from our pulpits and are keenly anxious that our sermons shall not be inefficacious inefficacious they are not unless they be too badly preached to obtain attention injurious they will be unless the lessons taught be good lessons  what a world this would be if every man were a harry esmond or every woman a jeannie deans but then again what a world if every woman were a beckie sharp and every man a varney or a barry lyndon of varneys and harry esmonds there are very few human nature such as it is does not often produce them the portraits of such virtues and such vices serve no doubt to emulate and to deter but are no other portraits necessary should we not be taught to see the men and women among whom we really livemen and women such as we are ourselvesin order that we should know what are the exact failings which oppress ourselves and thus learn to hate and if possible to avoid in life the faults of character which in life are hardly visible but which in portraiture of life can be made to be so transparent  ralph newton did nothing gentle reader which would have caused thee greatly to grieve for him nothing certainly which would have caused thee to repudiate him had he been thy brother and gentlest sweetest reader had he come to thee as thy lover with sufficient protest of love and with all his history written in his hand would that have caused thee to reject his suit had he been thy neighbour thou welltodo reader with a house in the country would he not have been welcome to thy table wouldst thou have avoided him at his club thou reader from the westend has he not settled himself respectably thou greyhaired novelreading paterfamilias thou materfamilias with daughters of thine own to be married in life would he have been held to have disgraced himselfexcept in the very moment in which he seemed to be in danger nevertheless the faults of a ralph newton and not the vices of a varney or a barry lyndon are the evils against which men should in these days be taught to guard themselveswhich women also should be made to hate such is the writers apology for his very indifferent hero ralph the heir     chapter lvii  clarissas fate   in the following october while newton of newton and his bride were making themselves happy amidst the glories of florence she with her finery from paris and he with a newlyacquired taste for michael angelo and the fine arts generally gregory the parson again went up to london he had of course assisted at his brothers marriagein which the heavy burden of the ceremony was imposed on the shoulders of a venerable dean who was related to lady eardhamand had since that time been all alone at his parsonage occasionally he had heard of the underwoods from ralph newton of beamingham whose wedding had been postponed till beamingham hall had been made fit for its mistress and from what he had heard gregory was inducedhardly to hopebut to dream it to be possible that even yet he might prevail in love an idea had grown upon him springing from various sources that clarissa had not been indifferent to his brother and that this feeling on her part had marred and must continue to mar his own happiness he never believed that there had been fault on his brothers part but still if clarissa had been so woundedhe could hardly hopeand perhaps should not even wishthat she would consent to share with him his parsonage in the close neighbourhood of his brothers house during all that september he told himself that the thing should be over and he began to teach himselfto try to teach himselfthat celibacy was the state in which a clergyman might best live and do his duty but the lesson had not gone far with him before he shook himself and determined that he would try yet once again if there had been such a wound why should not the wound be cured clarissa was at any rate true she would not falsely promise him a heart when it was beyond her power to give it in october therefore he went again up to london  the cases for packing the books had not even yet been made and sir thomas was found in southampton buildings the first words had of course reference to the absent squire the squire of ones parish the head of ones family and ones elder brother when the three are united in the same personage will become important to one even though the personage himself be not heroic ralph had written home twice and everything was prospering with him sir thomas who had become tired of his late ward and who had thought worse of the eardham marriage than the thing deserved was indifferent to the joys of the italian honeymoon theyll do very well no doubt said sir thomas i was delighted to learn that augusta bore her journey so well said gregory augustas always do bear their journeys well said sir thomas though sometimes i fancy they find the days a little too long  but his tone was very different when gregory asked his leave to make one more attempt at popham villa i only hope you may succeedfor her sake as well as for your own said sir thomas but when he was asked as to the parsons chance of success he declared that he could say nothing she is changed i think from what she used to beis more thoughtful perhaps and less giddy it may be that such change will turn her towards you i would not have her changed in anything said gregoryexcept in her feelings towards myself  he had been there twice or thrice before he found what he thought to be an opportunity fit for the work that he had on hand and yet both patience and mary did for him and for her all that they knew how to do but in such a matter it is so hard to act without seeming to act she who can manoeuvre on such a field without displaying her manoeuvres is indeed a general no man need ever attempt the execution of a task so delicate mary and patience put their heads together and resolved that they would say nothing nor did they manifestly take steps to leave the two alone together it was a question with them especially with patience whether the lover had not come too soon  but clarissa at last attacked her sister patience she said why do you not speak to me  not speak to you clary  not a wordabout that which is always on my mind you have not mentioned ralph newtons name once since his marriage  i have thought it better not to mention it why should i mention it  if you think that it would pain me you are mistaken it pains me more that you should think that i could not bear it he was welcome to his wife  i know you wish him well clary  well oh yes i wish him well no doubt he will be happy with her she is fit for him and i was not he did quite right  he is not half so good as his brother said patience  certainly he is not so good as his brother men of course will be different but it is not always the best man that one likes the best it ought to be so perhaps  i know which i like the best said patience oh clary if you could but bring yourself to love him  how is one to change like that and i do not know that he cares for me now  ahi think he cares for you  why should he is a man to be sacrificed for always because a girl will not take him his heart is changed he takes care to show me so when he comes here i am glad that it should be changed dear patty if papa would but come and live at home i should want nothing else  i want something else said patience  i want nothing but that you should love meand that papa should be with us but patty do not make me feel that you are afraid to speak to me  on the day following gregory was again at fulham and he had come thither fully determined that he would now for the last time ask that question on the answer to which as it now seemed to him all his future happiness must depend he had told himself that he would shake off this too human longing for a sweet face to be ever present with him at his board for a sweet heart to cherish him with its love for a dear head to lie upon his bosom but he had owned to himself that it could not be shaken off and having so owned was more sick than ever with desire mary and clarissa were both out when he arrived and he was closeted for a while with patience how tired you must be of seeing me he said  tired of seeing you oh no  i feel myself to be going about like a phantom and i am ashamed of myself my brother is successful and happy and has all that he desires  he is easily satisfied said patience with something of sarcasm in her voice  and my cousin ralph is happy and triumphant i ought not to pine but in truth i am so weak that i am always pining tell me at onceis there a chance for me  did it occur to him to think that she to whom he was speaking ever asked herself why it was not given to her to have even a hope of that joy for which he was craving did she ever pine because when others were mating round her flying off in pairs to their warm mutual nests there came to her no such question of mating and flying off to love and happiness if there was such pining it was all inward hidden from her friends so that their mirth should not be lessened by her want of mirth not expressed either by her eye or mouth because she knew that on the expression of her face depended somewhat of the comfort of those who loved her a homely brow and plain features and locks of hair that have not been combed by loves attendant nymphs into soft and winning tresses seems to tell us that love is not wanted by the bosom that owns them we teach ourselves to regard such a one let her be ever so good with ever so sweet temper ever so generous in heart ever so affectionate among her friends as separated alike from the perils and the privileges of that passion without which they who are blessed or banned with beauty would regard life but as a charred and mutilated existence it is as though we should believe that passion springs from the rind which is fair or foul to the eye and not in the heart which is often fairest freshest and most free when the skin is dark and the cheeks are rough this young parson expected patience to sympathise with him to greet for him to aid him if there might be aid and to understand that for him the world would be blank and wretched unless he could get for himself a soft sweet mate to sing when he sang and to wail when he wailed the only mate that patience had was this very girl that was to be thus taken from her but she did sympathise with him did greet for him did give him all her aid knowing what she was herself and how god had formed her she had learned to bury self absolutely and to take all her earthly joy from the joys of others shall it not come to pass that hereafter she too shall have a lover among the cherubim what can i say to you replied patience to the young mans earnest entreaty if she were mine to give i would give her to you instantly  then you think there is no chance if i thought that why should i trouble her again  i do not say so do you not know mr newton that in such matters even sisters can hardly tell their thoughts to each other how can they when they do not even know their own wishes  she does not hate me then  hate you noshe does not hate you but there are so many degrees between hating and that kind of love which you want from her you may be sure of this that she so esteems you that your persistence cannot lessen you in her regard  he was still pleading his case with the elder sistervery uselessly indeed as he was aware but having fallen on the subject of his love it was impossible for him to change it for any otherwhen clarissa came into the room swinging her hat in her hand she had been over at miss spooners house and was full of miss spooners woes and complaints as soon as she had shaken hands with her lover and spoken the few words of courtesy which the meeting demanded of her she threw herself into the affairs of miss spooner as though they were of vital interest she is determined to be unhappy patty and it is no use trying to make her not so she says that jane robs her which i dont believe is true and that sarah has a loverand why shouldnt sarah have a lover but as for curing her grievances it would be the cruellest thing in the world she lives upon her grievances something has happened to the chimneypot and the landlord hasnt sent a mason she is revelling in her chimneypot  poor dear miss spooner said patience getting up and leaving the room as though it were her duty to look at once after her old friend in the midst of these troubles  clarissa had not intended this shes asleep now said clarissa but patience went all the same it might be that miss spooner would require to be watched in her slumbers when patience was gone gregory newton got up from his seat and walked to the window he stood there for what seemed to be an endless number of seconds before he returned and clarissa had time to determine that she would escape i told mary that i would go to her she said you wont mind being left alone for a few minutes mr newton  do not go just now clarissa  only that i said i would she answered pleading that she must keep a promise which she had never made  mary can spare youand i cannot mary is staying with you and i shall be gonealmost immediately i go back to newton tomorrow and who can say when i shall see you again  you will be coming up to london of course  i am here now at any rate he said smiling and will take what advantage of it i can it is the old story clarissaso old that i know you must be sick of it  if you think so you should not tell it again  do not be illnatured to me i dont know why it is but a man gets to be ashamed of himself as though he were doing something mean and paltry when he loves with persistence as i do had it been possible that she should give him so much encouragement she would have told him that the mean man and paltry was he who could love or pretend to love with no capacity for persistency she could not fail to draw a comparison between him and his brother in which there was so much of meanness on the part of him who had at one time been as a god to her and so much nobility in him to whom she was and ever had been as a goddess i suppose a man should take an answer and have done with it he continued but how is a man to have done with it when his heart remains the same  a man should master his heart  i am then to understand that that which you have said so often before must be said again he had never knelt to her and he did not kneel now but he leaned over her so that she hardly knew whether he was on his knees or still seated on his chair and she herself though she answered him brisklyalmost with impertinencewas so little mistress of herself that she knew not what she said she would take him nowif only she knew how to take him without disgracing herself in her own estimation dear clary think of it try to love me i need not tell you again how true is my love for you he had hold of her hand and she did not withdraw it and he ought to have known that the battle was won but he knew nothing he hardly knew that her hand was in his clary you are all the world to me must i go back heartladen but emptyhanded with no comfort  if you knew all she said rising suddenly from her chair  all what  if you knew all you would not take me though i offered myself he stood staring at her not at all comprehending her words and she perceived in the midst of her distress that it was needful that she should explain herself i have loved ralph alwaysyes your brother  and he  i will not accuse him in anything he is married now and it is past  and you can never love again  who would take such a heart as that it would not be worth the giving or worth the taking ohhow i loved him then he left her side and went back to the window while she sank back upon her chair and burying her face in her hands gave way to tears and sobs he stood there perhaps for a minute and then returning to her so gently that she did not hear him he did kneel at her side he knelt and putting his hand upon her arm he kissed the sleeve of her gown you had better go from me now she said amidst her sobs  i will never go from you again he answered gods mercy can cure also that wound and i will be his minister in healing it clarissa i am so glad that you have told me all looking back i can understand it now i once thought that it was so  yes she said yes it was so  gradually one hand of hers fell into his and though no word of acceptance had been spoken he knew that he was at last accepted my own clary he said i may call you my own there was no answer but he knew that it was so nothing shall be done to trouble younothing shall be said to press you you may be sure of this if it be good to be lovedthat no woman was ever loved more tenderly than you are  i do know it she said through her tears  then he rose and stood again at the window looking out upon the lawn and the river she was still weeping but he hardly heeded her tears it was better for her that she should weep than restrain them and as to himself and his own feelingshe tried to question himself whether in truth was he less happy in this great possession which he had at last gained because his brother had for a while interfered with him in gaining it that she would be as true to him now as tender and as loving as though ralph had never crossed her path he did not for a moment doubt that she would be less sweet to him because her sweetness had been offered to another he would not admit to himselfeven though the question were asked she would be all his own and was she not the one thing in the world which he coveted he did think that for such a one as his clarissa he would be a better mate than would have been his brother and he was sure that she herself would learn to know that it was so he stood there long enough to resolve that this which had been told him should be no drawback upon his bliss clary he said returning to her it is settled she made him no answer my darling i am as happy now as though ralph had never seen your sweet face or heard your dear voice look up at me once slowly she looked up into his eyes and then stood before him almost as a suppliant and gave him her face to be kissed so at last they became engaged as man and wifethough it may be doubted whether she spoke another word before he left the room  it was however quite understood that they were engaged and though he did not see clarissa again he received the congratulations both of patience and mary bonner before he left the house and that very night succeeded in hunting down sir thomas so that he might tell the father that the daughter had at last consented to become his wife     chapter lviii  conclusion   clarissa had found it hard to change the object of her love so hard that for a time she had been unwilling even to make the effortand she had been ashamed that those around her should think that she would make it but when the thing was done her second hero was dearer to her than ever had been the first he at least was true with him there was no need of doubt his assurances were not conveyed in words so light that they might mean much or little this second lover was a lover indeed who thought no pains too great to show her that she was ever growing in his heart of hearts for a whilefor a week or twoshe restrained her tongue but when once she had accustomed herself to the coaxing kindness of her sister and her cousin then her eloquence was loosened and gregory newton was a god indeed in the course of time she got a very pretty note from ralph congratulating her as he also had congratulated polly and expressing a fear that he might not be home in time to be present at the wedding augusta was so fond of rome that they did not mean to leave it till the late spring then after a while there came to her also a watch and chain twice as costly as those given to pollywhich however no persuasion from gregory would ever induce clarissa to wear in after time ralph never noticed that the trinkets were not worn  the winter at popham villa went on very much as other winters had gone except that two of the girls living there were full of future hopes and preparing for future cares while the third occupied her heart and mind with the cares and hopes of the other two patience however had one other task in hand a task upon the performance of which her future happiness much depended and in respect to which she now ventured to hope for success wherever her future home might be it would be terrible to her if her father would not consent to occupy it with her it had been settled that both the marriages should take place early in aprilboth on the same day and as a matter of course the weddings would be celebrated at fulham christmas had come and gone and winter was going before sir thomas had absolutely promised to renew that order for the making of the packingcases for his books you wont go back papa after they are married patience said to her father early in march  if i do it shall not be for long  not for a day papa surely you will not leave me alone there will be plenty of room now the air of fulham will be better for your work than those stuffy dark dingy lawyers chambers  my dear all the work of my life that was worth doing was done in those stuffy dingy rooms that was all that sir thomas said but the accusation conveyed to him by his daughters words was very heavy for years past he had sat intending to work purposing to achieve a great task which he set for himself and had donealmost nothing might it be yet possible that that purer air of which patty spoke should produce new energy and lead to better results the promise of it did at least produce new resolutions it was impossible as patience had said that his child should be left to dwell alone while yet she had a father living  stemm he said i told you to get some packingcases made  packingcases sir thomas  yespackingcases for the books it was months ago are they ready  no sir thomas they aint ready  why not  well sir thomasthey aint thats all then the order was repeated in a manner so formal as to make stemm understand that it was intended for a fact you are going away from this are you sir thomas  i believe that i shall give the chambers up altogether at midsummer at any rate i mean to have the books packed at once  very well sir thomas then there was a pause during which stemm did not leave the room nor did sir thomas dismiss him feeling that there might well be other things which would require discussion and about me sir thomas said stemm  i have been thinking about that stemm  so have i sir thomasmore nor once  you can come to fulham if you likeonly you must not scold the maids  very well sir thomas said stemm with hardly any variation in his voice but still with less of care upon his brow  mind i will not have you scolding them at the villa  not unless they deserve it sir thomas said stemm sir thomas could say nothing further for our own part we fear that the maidens at the villa will not be the better in conduct as they certainly will not be more comfortable in their lives in consequence of this change  and the books were moved in large packingcases not one of which had yet been opened when the two brides returned to popham villa after their wedding tours to see patience just for a day before they were taken to their new homes nevertheless let us hope that the change of air and of scene may tend to future diligence and that the magnus opus may yet be achieved we have heard of editions of aristophanes of polybius of the iliad of ovid and what not which have ever been forthcoming under the hands of notable scholars who have grown grey amidst the renewed promises which have been given and some of these works have come forth belying the prophecies of incredulous friends let us hope that the great life of bacon may yet be written
