2163583	turkey a past and a future  by aj toynbee  mcmxvii        contents     i the past   ii the present  iii the future      i   what is turkey it is a name which explains nothing for no formula can embrace the variety of the countries marked ottoman on the map the high yemen with its monsoons and tropical cultivation the tilted rim of the hedjaz one desert in a desert zone that stretches from the sahara to mongolia the mesopotamian rivers breaking the desert with a strip of green the pinecovered mountain terraces of kurdistan which gird in mesopotamia as the hills of the northwest frontier of india gird the plains the armenian highlands bleak as the pamirs which feed mesopotamia with their snows and send it the soil they cannot keep themselves the anatolian peninsulaan offshoot of central europe with its rocks and fine timber and mountain streams but nursing a steppe in its heart more intractable than the puszta of hungary the coastlandstrebizond and ismid and smyrna clinging to the anatolian mainland and syria interposing itself between the desert and the sea but all with their vines and olives and sharp contours keeping true to the mediterranean and then the waterway of narrows and landlocked sea and narrows again which links the mediterranean with the black sea and the russian hinterland and which has not its like in the world  the cities of turkey are as various as the climes with the added impress of many generations of men adrianople set at a junction of rivers within the circle of the thracian downs a fortress since its foundation well chosen for the tombs of the ottoman conquerors constantinople capital of empires where races meet but never mix mistress of trade routes vital to the existence of vast regions beyond her horizoncentral europe trafficking southeastward overland and russia southwestward by sea smyrna the port by which men go up and down between anatolia and the aegean the foothold on the asiatic mainland which the greeks have never lost konia between the mountain girdle and the central steppe where native anatolia has always stood at bay guarding her race and religion against the influences of the coasts aleppo where if turkey were a unity the centre of turkey would be found the city where if anywhere the races of the near east have mingledbuilding their courses into her fortress walls from the polygonal work of the hittite founders to the battlements that kept out the crusadersand now the halfway point of a railway surveyed along an immemorially ancient route but unfinished like the history of aleppo herself van by its upland lake overhanging the mesopotamian lowlands and with the writing of their culture graven on its cliffs yet living a life apart like some swiss canton and half belonging to the infinite north bagdad the incarnation for the last millennium of an eternal city that shifts its site as its rivers shift their bedsfrom seleucia to bagdad from babylon to seleucia from kish to babylonbut which always springs up again like delhi within a few parasangs of its last ruins in an area that is an irresistible focus of population basra amid its palmgroves so far down stream that it belongs to the indian oceanthe port from which sinbad set sail for fairyland and from which less mythical arab seamen spread their religion and civilisation far over african coasts and malayan indies these and besides them almost all the holy cities of mankind kerbela between the euphrates and the desert where under sunni rule the shias of persia and india have still visited the tombs of their saints and buried their dead jerusalem where jew and christian orthodox catholic and protestant armenian and abyssinian have their common shrines and separate quarters mekka and medina in the heart of the desert beyond which their fame would never have passed but for a well and a mart and a precinct of idols and the prophet who overthrew them and there are the cities on the pilgrim road linked now by railway with medina the nearer of the haramein beir√ªt the port with its electric trams and newspapers the smyrna of the arab lands and damascus the oasis looking out over the desert instead of the sea and harbour not of ships but of camelcaravans  the names of these cities call up like an incantation the memory of the civilisations which grew in them to greatness and sank in them to decay mesopotamia a great heart of civilisation which is cold today but which beat so strongly for five thousand years that its pulses were felt from siberia to the pillars of hercules and influenced the taste and technique of the scandinavian bronze age the assyrians who extended the political marches of mesopotamia towards the north and turned them into a military monarchy that devastated the motherland and all other lands and peoples from the tigris to the sea the hebrews discovering a worldreligion in their hillcountry overlooking the coast the sabaeans whose queen made the first pilgrimage to jerusalem coming from yemen across the hedjaz when mekka and medina were still of no account the philistines and phoenicians of the syrian seaboard who were discovering the atlantic and were too busy to listen to the hebrew prophets in their hinterland the ionians who opened up the black sea and created a poetry philosophy science and architecture which are still the lifeblood of ours before they were overwhelmed like the phoenicians before them by a continental military power the hittites who first transmitted the fruitful influences of mesopotamia to the ionian coastsa people as mysterious to their contemporaries as to ourselves maturing unknown in the fastnesses of anatolia raising up a sudden empire that raided mesopotamia and colonised the syrian valleys and then succumbing to waves of northern invasion all these people rose and fell within the boundaries of turkey held the stage of the world for a time and left their mark on its history there is a romance about their names a wonderful variety and intensity in their vanished life yet they are not more diverse than their modern successors in whose veins flows their blood and whose possibilities are only dwarfed by their achievements  there were less than twenty million people in turkey before the war and during it the government has caused a million or so to perish by massacre starvation or disease yet in spite of this daemoniac effort after uniformity they are still the strangest congeries of racial and social types that has ever been placed at a single governments mercy the ottoman empire is named after the osmanli but you might search long before you found one among its inhabitants these osmanlis are a governing class indigenous only in constantinople and a few neighbouring towns but planted here and there as officers and officials over the ottoman territories they come of a clan of turkish nomads recruited since the thirteenth century by converts forced or voluntary from most of christendom and crossed with the blood of slavewomen from all the world they are hardly a race tradition fortified by inertia makes them what they are and also their turkish language which serves them for business of state and for a literature though not without an infusion of persian and arabic idioms said to amount to 95 per cent of the vocabulary1  this artificial language is hardly a link between osmanli officialdom and the turkish peasantry of anatolia which speaks turkish dialects derived from tribes that drifted in some as late as the osmanlis some two centuries before nor has this turkishspeaking peasantry much in common with the turkish nomads who still wander over the central anatolian steppe and have kept their blood pure for the peasantry has reverted physically to the native stock which held anatolia from time immemorial and absorbs all newcomers that mingle with it on its soil thus there are three distinct turkish elements in turkey divided by blood and vocation and social type and even if we reckon all who speak some form of turkish as one group they only amount to 30 or 40 per cent of the whole population of the empire  the rest are alien to the turks and to one another those who speak arabic are as strong numerically as the turks or stronger but they too are divided and their unity is a problem of the future there are purebred arab nomads of the desert there are arabs who have settled in towns or on the land some within the last generation like the muntefik in mesopotamia some a millennium or two ago like the meccan koreish but who still retain their tribal consciousness of race there are arabs in name who have nothing arabic about them but their languagemost of the peasantry of syria are such and the inhabitants of ancient centres of population like damascus or bagdad in syria many of these arabs are christians and some christians though they speak arabic have retained their separate sense of nationalitynotably the roman catholic maronites of the lebanonand would hardly be considered as arabs either by themselves or by their neighbours the same is true of the druses another remnant of an earlier stock which has preserved its identity under the guise of islam so heretically conceived as to rank as an independent religion as for the yemenisthey will resent the imputation for no arabs count up their genealogies so zealously as they but there is more east african than semitic blood in their veins they are men of the moist fertile tropics brown of skin and working half naked in their fields like the peoples of southern india and bengal and on the opposite fringes of the arabicspeaking area there are fragments of population whose language is semitic but prearabic2the jacobite christians of the torabdin and the nestorians of the upper zab who once under the caliphs were the industrious christian peasantry of mesopotamia but now are shepherds and hillmen among the kurds the kurds themselves are more scattered than any other stock in turkey and divided tribe against tribe but taken together they rank third in numerical strength after the arabs and turks there are mountain kurds and kurds of the plain husbandmen and herdsmen kurds who have kept to their original homes along the eastern frontier and kurds who under ottoman auspices have spread themselves over the armenian plateau the north mesopotamian steppes the taurus valleys and the hinterland of the black sea  the chief thing the kurds have in common is the persian dialect they speak but it is usual to class as kurds any and every community in the kurdish area which is not turkish or arab and can by courtesy be called moslem the kurds for that matter are only moslems skindeep such communities abound the dersim highlands in particular are an ethnographical museum kizilbashi is a general name for their kind only the yezidis though they speak good kurdish are distinguished from the rest for their idiosyncrasy of worshipping satan under the form of a peacock allah they argue is goodnatured and does not need to be propitiated and they are repudiated with one accord by moslem and christian  but not all the scattered elements in turkey are isolated or primitive the greeks and armenians for instance are or were the most energetic intellectual liberal elements in turkey the natural intermediaries between the other races and western civilisationwere rather than are because the ottoman government has taken ruthless steps to eliminate just these two most valuable elements among its subjects the urban greeks survive in centres like smyrna and constantinople but the greek peasantry of thrace and anatolia has mostly been driven over the frontier since the second balkan war as for the armenians the government has been destroying them by massacre and deportation since april 1915business and professional men peasants and shepherds women and childrenwithout discrimination or pity a third of the ottoman armenians may still survive a tenth of them are safe within the russian and british lines fortunately half this nation and the majority of the greeks live outside the ottoman frontiers and are beyond the osmanlis power  to compensate for its depopulation of the countries under its dominion the ottoman government during the last fifty years has been settling them with moslem immigrants from its own lost provinces or from other moslem lands that have changed their rulers these mouhadjirs are reckoned from first to last at threequarters of a million drawn from the most diverse stocksbosniaks and pomaks and albanians algerines and tripolitans tchetchens and circassians numbers have been planted recently on the lands of dispossessed armenians and greeks they add many more elements to the confusion of tongues but they are probably destined to be absorbed or to die out the circassians in particular who are the most industrious though most unruly and preserve their nationality best also succumb most easily to transplantation through refusal to adapt their caucasian clothes and habits to anatolian or mesopotamian conditions of life  all this is turkey and we come back to our original question what common factor accounts for the name what has stained this coat of many colours to one political hue the answer is simple blood turkey the ottoman state is not a unity climatic geographical racial or economic it is a pretension enforced by bloodshed and violence whenever and wherever the osmanli government has power  it is a complex pretension the first impulse and the traditional method by which it has been given effect came from a little tribe of pagan nomadic turks who wandered into anatolia from central asia in the thirteenth century ad and were granted camping grounds by the reigning turkish sultan of the countryfor anatolia was already turkish two centuries before the osmanlis appeared on the scene but to call them osmanlis is to anticipate the next stage in their history they are named after osman their first leaders son and he after the third successor of the prophetit was a good moslem name and he took it when he was converted to islam and organised his pagan tentdwellers into a settled mohammedan state in the northwestern hills of anatolia on the borders of christendom a tribe had become a march and the final stage was from march to empire  from this point onwards ottoman history singularly resembles the history of the osmanlis present allies the march of brandenburg the march of austria and the march of osmanthey were each founded as the outer bulwarks of a civilisation and all erected themselves into centres of military ascendancy over their fellowcountrymen and coreligionists to the rear as well as the strangers opposite their front the osmanlis may have been more savage in their methods than the marchmen of germanythough hardly perhaps than the teutonic knights who prepared the soil of prussia for the hohenzollerns the teutonic knights exterminated their victims the osmanlis drained theirs of their blood by taking a tribute of their male children educating them as moslems and training them as recruits for an ottoman standing army their first expansion was forwards into christian europe their capital shifted from a village in the hills to the city of brusa on the asiatic shore of marmora from brusa across the dardanelles to adrianople from adrianople to the imperial city on the bosphorus and with the capture of constantinople the osmanli sultans usurped the pretensions of east rome as the hapsburgs and hohenzollerns the emblems of charlemagne and caesar augustus  byzantium has become a very potent element in the osmanlis character more potent than the habits of the march or the instinct of the steppes it has dictated their system of administration dominated their outlook on life penetrated their blood but the heritage of r√ªm is not the final factor in the ottoman empire as it exists today for after the successors of osman had founded their military monarchy with blood and iron on the ruins of onethird of europe they turned eastwards with a genuinely oriental gesture and overran kingdoms and lands with the apparently mechanical impetus of all asiatic conquerors from sargon of akkad and cyrus the persian to jenghis khan and timur the stoutest opponent of the osmanlis in asia was the anatolian sultanate of karamanmoslem turkish and the legitimate heir of those seljuk turkish sultans who had given osmans father his first footing in the land osmanli and karamanli fought on equal terms but when karaman was overthrown there was no power left in asia that could stop the osmanlis advance the egyptians and persians had no more chance against ottoman discipline and artillery than the last darius had against the macedonians a campaign or two brought sultan selim the first from the taurus to cairo a few more campaigns at intervals during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when ottoman armies could be spared from europe drove the persians successively out of armenia and mosul and bagdad and thus by accident as it were in the pursuit of more coveted things the osmanlis acquired turkeyinasia which is all that remains to them now and all that concerns us here  turkeyinasia is a transitory phenomenon a sort of chrysalis which enshrouded the countries of western asia because they were exhausted and needed torpor as a preliminary to recuperation many calamities had fallen upon them during the five centuries before the chrysalis formed the breakup of the arab caliphate of bagdad had led to an interminable meaningless conflict among a host of petty moslem states the wearing struggle between islam and christendom had been intensified by the crusades and waves of nomadic invaders each more destructive and more irresistible than the last had swept over moslem asia out of the steppes and deserts of the northeast the most terrible were the mongols who sacked bagdad in 1258 and gave the coup de gr√¢ce to the civilisation of mesopotamia and then when the native productiveness of the near east was ruined the transit trade between europe and the indies which had belonged to it from the earliest times and had been the second source of its prosperity was taken from it by the western seafarers who discovered the ocean routes the pall of ottoman dominion only descended when life was extinct  the osmanlis whose nomadic forefathers had fled before the face of the mongols out of central asia took the heritage which had slipped from the mongols grasp and gathered all threads of authority in western asia into their hands the most valuable spoil of their asiatic conquests was the caliphate hulaku the sacker of bagdad had put the caliph mustasim to death and the remnant of the abbasids had kept up a shadowy succession at cairo under the protection of the sultan of egypt selim the osmanli when he entered cairo as a conqueror in 1517 caused the contemporary abbasid to cede his title for what it was worth to him and his successors it was a doubtful title scorned by all shias and regarded coldly by many sunni rulers who were unwilling to recognise a spiritual superior in their most formidable temporal rival but such as it was it strengthened the osmanlis hold on his dominions caliph of islam victorious guardian of the moslem marches and heir by conquest of imperial r√ªm the osmanli sultan held his asiatic provinces with ease but the best security for his tenure was the misery to which they were reduced commerce and cultivation ebbed population dwindled and nomads still drifted in upon what once had been settled lands the ottoman government desiring a barrier against persia encouraged the kurds to spread themselves over armenia it welcomed less the shammar and anazeh arabs who broke over the euphrates about the year 1700 and turned the last fields of northern mesopotamia to desolation but it was too impotent or indifferent to turn them out western asia lay fallow under the ottoman cannonwheels there have been fallow periods before in the slow rhythm of its lifeunder the persians for instance who overran all lands and peoples of the east in the sixth century bc overshadowed the greeks for a moment as the osmanlis overshadowed europe halted too massive for offence but seemingly unassailable and then collapsed pitifully before the probing spears of alexander  the osmanlis are passing at this moment as the achaemenids passed then they lost the last of europe in the balkan war and with it their prestige as increasers of islam the growth of national consciousness among their subjects not least among the turks themselves has loosened the foundations of their military empire as of the other military empires with which they are allied they forfeited the caliphate when they proclaimed the holy war against the allied powersinciting moslems to join one christian coalition against another not in defence of their religion but for ottoman political aggrandisement they lost it morally when this incitement was left unheeded by the moslem world they lost it in deed when the sherif of mekka asserted his rights as the legitimate guardian of the holy cities drove out the ottoman garrison from mekka and allied himself with the other independent princes of arabia all the props of ottoman dominion in asia have fallen away but nothing dooms it so surely as the breath of life that is stirring over the dormant lands and peoples once more the cutting of the suez canal has led the highways of commerce back to the nearer east the democracy and nationalism of europe have been extending their influence over asiatic races on whatever terms the war is concluded one farreaching result is certain already there will be a political and economic revival in western asia and the direction of this will not be in ottoman hands  we are thus witnessing the foundation of a new era as momentous if not as dramatic as alexanders passage of the dardanelles the ottoman vesture has waxed old and something can be discerned of the new forms that are emerging from beneath it their outstanding features are worth our attention     ii   the new turkish nationalism is the immediate factor to be reckoned with it is very newnewer than the young turks and sharply opposed to the original young turkish programmebut it has established its ascendancy it decided turkeys entry into the war and is the key to the current policy of the ottoman government  the young turks were not nationalists from the beginning the committee of union and progress was founded in good faith to liberate and reconcile all the inhabitants of the empire on the principles of the french revolution at the committees congress in 1909 the nationalists were shouted down with the cry our goal is organisation and nothing else3 but young turkish ideals rapidly narrowed liberalism gave way to panislamism panislamism to panturanianism and the ottoman state idea changed from liberty equality and fraternity to the turkification of nonturkish nationalities by force  the french ideal writes the nationalist tekin alp in thoughts on the nature and plan of a greater turkey is in contradiction to the needs and conditions of the age by contrast the turkish national movement does not exhibit the failings of the earlier movements it is in every way adapted to the intellectual standard and feelings of the nation it also keeps pace with the ideas of the age which have for some decades centred round the principle of nationality in adopting turkish nationalism as the basis of their national policy the turks have only abandoned an abnormal state of affairs and thereby placed themselves on a level with modern nations4  the development of nationalism among the turks was a natural phenomenon starting in the west the movement has been spreading for a century through central europe hungary and the balkans till from the turks former subjects it has passed to the turks themselves chance played its part dr nazim bey for instance the general secretary of the union and progress committee is said to have been fired by a work of m l√©on cahuns on the early history of the turks and mongols lent him by the french consulgeneral at salonika and the movement was and still is confined to a small intelligentsia but that is the case with other national movements too and does not hinder them from being powerful forces turkish nationalism was kept alive after 1909 by a small group of enthusiasts at salonikatheir leader was ziya bey who had come up to the young turk congress from diarbekir and was one of the first converts to the new idea it gained ground suddenly during the balkan war the shock of defeat produced a craving for regeneration the final loss of europe turned the minds of the osmanlis to the possibilities of asia and they were struck by the action of several prominent russian subjects of turcotatar nationality who out of racial sympathy had given their services to the ottoman government in this time of adversity as tekin alp expresses it  the turks realised that in order to live they must become essentially turkish become a nation be themselves the turkish nation turned aside its gaze from the lost territory and looked instead upon turania the ideal country of the future  two years later this new orientation had so mastered the ottoman government that it drew them into the european war  there are many aims within the new turkish horizon some of them are negative and nonpolitical some practical and extremely aggressive ziya beys adherents first took in hand the purification of the turkish language a turkish poet had endeavoured before to dispense with the 95 per cent  of the vocabulary that was borrowed from persian and arabic and his poetry had to be published in small provincial papers because the important newspapers of the towns would not accept it the established writers in the traditional style made a hard fight but tekin alp claims that the yeni lisan new language is today in possession of an absolute and unlimited authority borrowed rhythms have been banned as well as borrowed words and there is even an agitation to replace the arabic script by a new turkish alphabetan imitation of the albanian movement which was opposed so fiercely by the turks themselves before the balkan war in 1913 the government stepped in with the foundation of a turkish academy turk bilgi derneyi and the ministry of education started an institute of terminology conservatoire and writing and translation committee the translation of foreign masterpieces as an incentive to a new national literature was in the programme of ziya beys society the yeni hayat new life their most cherished plan was to translate the koran and the friday sermon to have the khutba prayer for the caliph recited in turkish and to remove the arabic texts from the walls of the mosques5 the eyes and ears of turkish moslems were to be saved from the contamination of an antinational language but the campaign against arabic passed over into an attack upon islam  the turkish nationalists tekin alp explains have made great efforts to nationalise religion itself and to give it the impress of the turkish national spirit this idea was zealously supported by a fortnightly periodical and one of the noblest tasks undertaken by it has been the translation of the koran into turkish this is a reform of the greatest importance it is well known that the translation of the koran has hitherto been considered a sin the nationalists have cut themselves off from this superstitious prejudice and have had three translations made the abovementioned and two others  on this issue the nationalists broke a lance with the islamjis or clericals as tekin alp prefers to call them  because it is written in the koran that islam knows no nationalities but only believers the islamjis thought that to occupy oneself with national questions was to act against the interests and principles of islam itself according to the nationalists the pronouncement in the koran was directed exclusively against the very frequent dissensions of clans and parties in the various arab races a sneer which is meant to have a modern application although the nationalists proclaim themselves the most zealous followers of mohammed nevertheless they do not conceal the fact that their interpretation of islam is not the same as that of the arabs they maintain that the turks cannot interpret the koran in the same manner as the arabs their idea of god is also different  this amazing kulturkampf is quite possibly a reminiscence of bismarckian germany for turkish nationalism is saturated with forgotten european moods and its vein of romanticism is as antiquated as the kaisers it has taken attila to its heart and rehabilitated jenghis khan timur oghuz and the rest with the erudition of a turanian walter scott  my attila my jenghis sings ziya g√∂k alp these heroic figures which stand for the proud fame of my race appear on the dry pages of the history books as covered with shame and disgrace while in reality they are no less than alexander and caesar still better known to my heart is oghuz khan6 in me he still lives in all his fame and greatness oghuz khan delights and inspires my heart and causes me to sing psalms of gladness the fatherland of the turks is not turkey or turkestan but the broad eternal land of turania  the ministry of evkaf religious endowments recently made a grant of ¬£50000 turkish towards the publication of works on these worthies the students at the military college in constantinople are alleged to have been diverted from their studies by their devotion to such literature and on the eve of the war the professor of military education there is reported to have delivered the following address to an instruction class of reserve officers  we are gentlemen before all turks i wonder why we are called ottomans for who is osman after whom we are named he is a turk from altai who overran this country with his turkish army therefore it is more of an honour to us to be named after his origin than after himself we have so far been deceived by the ignorance of our forebears and fie on these forebears who made us forget our nationality be sure that turkish nationality is better for us than islam and racial pride is one of the greatest social virtues7  these extravagances must not be taken too literally the young turk politicians though they have embarked on a nationalist policy are not so reckless as to break openly with islam or to denounce the founder of their state they see clearly enough that turkish nationalism carried to a logical extreme is incompatible with the ottoman pretension and they favour the view so severely criticised by tekin alp that all three groups of ideasottomanism islamism and the turkish movementshould work side by side and together but with this reservation they follow the doctrinaires who on their part are quite ready to press islam into their service tekin alp candidly admits that  they sought after a judicious mingling of the religious and national impulses they realised only too clearly that the still abstract ideals of nationalism could not be expected to attract the masses the lower classes composed of uneducated and illiterate people it was found more expedient to reach these classes under the flag of religion  this sentence reveals in a flash one motive of the armenian deportations which followed turkeys intervention in the war and a celebrated german authority in a memorial8 written in 1916 gives this very explanation of their origin  turkeys entry into the war he writes was unwelcome to turkish society in constantinople whose sympathies were with france as well as to the mass of the people but the panislamic propaganda and the military dictatorship were able to stifle all opposition the proclamation of the holy war produced a general agitation of the mohammedan against the christian elements in the empire and the christian nationalities had soon good reason to fear that turkish chauvinism would make use of mohammedan fanaticism to make the war popular with the mass of the mohammedan population  the evidence presented in the british blue book on the treatment of armenians in the ottoman empire9 shows that this explanation is correct the armenians were not massacred spontaneously by the local moslems the initiative came entirely from the central government at constantinople which planned the systematic extermination of the armenian race in the ottoman empire worked out a uniform method of procedure despatched simultaneous orders to the provincial officials and gendarmerie to carry it into effect and cashiered the few who declined to obey the armenians were rounded up and deported by regular troops and gendarmes they were massacred on the road by bands of chettis consisting chiefly of criminals released from prison by the government for this work when the armenians were gone the turkish populace was encouraged to plunder their goods and houses and as the convoys of exiles passed through the villages the bestlooking women and children were sold cheap or even given away for nothing to the turkish peasantry naturally the turkish people accepted the good things the government offered them and naturally this reconciled them momentarily to the war  thus in the armenian atrocities the young turks made panislamism and turkish nationalism work together for their ends but the development of their policy shows the islamic element receding and the nationalist gaining ground  after the deposition of abdulhamid writes the german authority quoted above the committee of union and progress reverted more and more to the exsultans policy to begin with a rigorous party tyranny was set up a power behind the government got the official executive apparatus into its hand and the elections to parliament ceased to be free the appointment of the highest officials in the empire and of all the most important servants of the administration was settled by decrees of the committee all bills had to be debated first by the committee and to receive its approval before they came before the chamber public policy was determined by two main considerations 1 the centralistic idea which claimed for the turkish race not merely preponderant but exclusive power in the empire was to be carried to its logical consequences 2 the empire was to be established on a purely islamic foundation turkish nationalism and the panislamic idea precluded a priori any equality of treatment for the various races and religions of the empire and any movement which looked for the salvation of the empire in the decentralisation or autonomy of its various parts was branded as high treason the nationalistic and centralistic tendency was directed not merely against the various nonmohammedan nationalities greeks armenians syrians and jewsbut also against the nonturkish mohammedan nationsarabs mohammedan syrians kurds and the shia element in the population an idol of panturkism was erected and all nonturkish elements in the population were subjected to the harshest measures the rigorous action which this policy prescribed against the albanians who were mostly mohammedans and had been thorough loyalists till then led to the loss of almost the whole of european turkey the same policy has provoked insurrections in the arab half of the empire which a series of campaigns has failed to suppress the conflict with the arab element continuesthis was written in 1916though the holy war has forced it to a certain extent into the background  the conflict with the arabsthat has been the worst folly of the young turkish politicians and it will perhaps be the most powerful solvent of the empire which the osmanlis have misgoverned so long it is the inevitable consequence of the camarilla government and the panturkish chauvinism for which the committee of union and progress has come to stand  the committee consists by its statutes of turks alone and the election even of one arab was vetoed10 tekin alp informs us that  the portfolio of the minister of trade and agriculture which has been in the hands of greeks and armenians since the time of the constitution and was lately given to a christian arab has at last been handed over to the constantinople deputy ahmed nasimi bey who joined with ziya g√∂k alp in laying the foundations of the turkish movement immediately after the proclamation of the constitution with one exception the members of the cabinet are all imbued with the same ideas and principles  the armenian deportations gave the committee an opportunity of tightening its hold over the provincial officials as well valis who refused to carry out the orders were superseded if they were strongminded enough to persist but more often they were browbeaten by the leaders of the local young turk organisations or even by their own subordinates and let things go their way ways and means of packing the administration with their own henchmen had been discussed by the committee already in their congress of october 1911 and they had defined their policy then in the following remarkable resolutions11  the formation of new parties in the chamber or in the country must be suppressed and the emergence of new liberal ideas prevented turkey must become a really mohammedan country and moslem ideas and moslem influence must be preponderant every other religious propaganda must be suppressed the existence of the empire depends on the strength of the young turkish party and the suppression of all antagonistic ideas  sooner or later the complete ottomanisation of all turkish subjects must be effected it is clear however that this can never be attained by persuasion but that we must resort to armed force the character of the empire must be mohammedan and respect must be secured for mohammedan institutions and traditions other nationalities must be denied the right of organisation for decentralisation and autonomy are treason to the turkish empire the nationalities are a quantit√© n√©gligeable they can keep their religion but not their language the propagation of the turkish language is one of the sovereign means of confirming the mohammedan supremacy and assimilating the other elements  the confusion of aims in these two paragraphs reveals the direction in which young turkish policy has been travelling religion is now secondary to language and the precedence still given to the islamic formula is only in apparent contradiction to this for mohammedan supremacy is equated with the turkish national idea such a version of panislamism leaves no room for an arab race under ottoman rule and the panturanian address given by the turkish professor at the military college in constantinople had a sequel which showed the arabs what they too had to expect from turkeys entrance into the war  there were arabs among the officers whom the professor was addressing and one of them ventured to protest  all ottomans are not turks he said and if the empire were to be considered purely turkish then all the nonturkish elements would be foreign to it instead of being living members of the political body known as the ottoman empire fighting the common fight for it and for islam  to this the professor is reported to have replied  although you are an arab yet you and your race are subject to turkey have not the turks colonised your country and have they not conquered it by the sword the ottoman state which you plead is nothing but a social trick to which you resort in order to attain your ends as to religion it has no connexion with politics we shall soon march forward in the name of turkey and the turkish flag casting aside religion as it is only a personal and secondary question you and your nation must realise that you are turks and that there is no such thing as arab nationality and an arab fatherland  it is said that the arab officers present handed in a joint protest to the minister of war asking for the professors dismissal and that enver beys answer was to have them all sent to the frontline trenches  certainly the turkish nationalists have not concealed their attitude towards the arabs since the war began  the arab lands writes djelal noury bey in a recentlypublished work and above all irak12 and yemen must become turkish colonies in which we shall spread our own language so that at the right moment we may make it the language of religion it is a peculiarly imperious necessity of our existence for us to turkise the arab lands for the particularistic idea of nationality is awaking among the younger generation of arabs and already threatens us with a great catastrophe against this we must be forearmed  and ahmed sherif bey again has written as follows in the tanin  the arabs speak their own language and are as ignorant of turkish as if their country were not a dependency of turkey it is the business of the porte to make them forget their own language and to impose upon them instead that of the nation which rules them if the porte loses sight of this duty it will be digging its grave with its own hands for if the arabs do not forget their language their history and their customs they will seek to restore their ancient empire on the ruins of ottomanism and of turkish rule in asia  a turkish pamphleteer wrote that the arabs have been a misfortune to turkey and that a turkish conquerors warhorse is better than the prophet of any other nation this pamphlet was distributed in the caucasus at the ottoman governments expense as turkish propaganda  but the best proof of the young turks intentions towards the arabs is their actual conduct in the arab provinces of their empire in the spring of 1916 an arab who had escaped from syria published some facts in the egyptian press which the turkish censorship had previously managed to conceal13 business was ruined because the turks had confiscated all gold and forced the people to accept depreciated paper the population was starving and the turks had prohibited the american colony at beir√ªt from organising relief the national susceptibilities of the inhabitants were outraged in petty waysthe railway tickets for instance were no longer printed in arabic but only in turkish and german and spies were active in denouncing the least manifestations of disaffection a turkish courtmartial was sitting in the lebanon and at the time our informant left syria it had 240 persons under arrest 180 of them on political charges these prisoners were the leading men of syriachristians and moslems without distinction for in syria as in armenia the turks put the leaders out of the way before they attacked the nation as a whole most of the syrian bishops had been deported or driven into hiding by the beginning of march 1916 it was reckoned that 816 arabs in syria and 117 in mesopotamia had already been condemned to death with the confiscation of their property a turkish officer taking our informant for a turk too remarked to him those arabs wish to get rid of us and are secretly in sympathy with our enemies but we mean to get rid of them ourselves before they have any chance of translating their sympathy into action this caps what a turkish gendarme in armenia said to a danish sister serving with the german red cross first we kill the armenians then the greeks then the kurds14 every nonturkish nationality in the ottoman empire is threatened with extermination  but the aims of turkish nationalists are not limited by the ottoman frontiers if they are resolved to clear their empire of every nonturkish element that is only a step towards extending it over everything turkish that lies outside the turks have not only aliens to get rid of but an irredenta to win  the ottoman turks tekin alp reminds his readers now only represent a tenth of the whole turkish nation there are now sixty to seventy million turkish subjects of various states in the world who should succeed in giving the nation an important place among the other powers unfortunately there is no connexion between the separate groups which are distributed over great tracts of land their aspirations and national institutions still divide them now that the ottoman turks have awakened from their sleep of centuries they do not only think of themselves but hasten to save the other parts of their race who are living in slavery or ignorance  turkish irredentism may be directed towards material or moral reforms according to circumstances if the geographical position favours the venture the turks can free their brothers from foreign rule in the other case they can carry it on on moral or intellectual lines  irredentism which other nations may regard as a luxurythough often a very terrible and costly oneis a political and social necessity for the turks if all the turks in the world were welded into one huge community a strong nation would be formed worthy to take an important place among the other nations of the world15  this may be a dream but the young turks have used the political and military resources of the ottoman empire to make it a reality at the congress of 1911 it was resolved that immigration from the caucasus and turkestan must be promoted land found for the immigrants and the christians hindered from acquiring real estate turkey was first to be reinforced by the turks abroad in the european war she was to strike out as their liberator the day after their declaration of war the young turkish government issued a proclamation in which the following sentences occur  our participation in the world war represents the vindication of our national ideal the ideal of our nation and people leads us towards the destruction of our muscovite enemy in order to obtain thereby a natural frontier to our empire which should include and unite all branches of our race  when war broke out the dashnaktzaganthe armenian parliamentary party in the ottoman empirewere in congress at erzerum a deputation of young turk propagandists16 presented themselves and urged the armenians to join them in raising a general insurrection in caucasia they sketched their proposed partition of russian territory the tatars 17 were to have this the georgians that the armenians this other autonomy for the new provinces under ottoman suzerainty was to be the reward for cooperation the dasknaktzagan had always worked with the young turks in internal politics but they refused to join them in this aggressive venture the ottoman armenians they said would do their duty as ottoman subjects during the war but they advised the government to preserve peace if that were still possible18 but the turks were past reason and their army was already on the move the main body crossed the russian frontier a second force invaded northern persia and penetrated as far as tabriz tabriz is the capital of azerbaijan a province where the majority of the population is turkish by language and beyond across the river aras lies the russian province of baku also containing a large turkishspeaking population and the vital oilfields the turkish plan of campaign was frustrated by the brilliant russian victory of sarikamysh by the end of january 1915 the turkish army was back within its own frontiers and in this quarter it has not again advanced beyond them but the young turks irredentist ambitions have remained in being during their brief occupation of northern persia they did their best to wipe out the syriac element in the populationthe nestorian christians of urmia their plan was to get rid of all the nonturkish peoples which separate the turks of anatolia from the turks of baku and azerbaijan and this was the second motive of the armenian deportations which they put in hand a month or two after their military projects had failed  the turkish irredentists propose in fact to gain their ends by bloodshed and terrorism tekin alp like most turkish publicists and politicians since 1908 is a macedonian19 and is profoundly impressed by the methods which the other nationalities there employed to the discomfiture of the turks themselves  observers he writes who like myself are macedonians and like myself had ample opportunity of gaining an intimate knowledge of the irredentist propaganda of the bulgars greeks serbs and vlachs are able to judge the significance of this striving after a national ideal and how sweet and inspiring it is to go through the greatest dangers for such a cause this is best illustrated by a few living examples which he proceeds to give  macedonia is soaked in blood atrocities were committed here the mere thought of which makes ones hair stand on end nevertheless the leaders of robber bands and members of the terrible irredentist organisations were not regarded by the public as wild robbers but as heroes fighting for the unity of the nation  will the young turks emulate the selfsacrifice of these men  russia and persia are the fields marked out for such activity  in some places ordinary propaganda is sufficient but in hotlycontested territory recourse is to be had to the more violent measures used in macedonia the neighbouring land of persia is without doubt the best of all countries with turkish population for spreading the new ideas and it has been found that simple propaganda is amply sufficient to produce a satisfactory effect on this fruitful soil  in persia tekin alp reckons onethird of the population is of turkish blood he passes these turkish elements in review and concludes that the spirit of the administration is turkish and also the leading spirit of persian civilisation even though these be clothed in persian guisefor at present the tables are turned all those turkish warriors and heroes shahs and grand viziers thinkers and scholars have lost their turkish consciousness and have become assimilated to the persians in writing speech and literature even the compact two millions and a half of turkishspeaking azerbaijanis will write letters only in persian and will not read a turkish newspaper he omits the most important factthat these turks of persia are shias like their persian fellowcountrymen while the mohammedan institutions and traditions for which the ottoman turks are pledged by the young turk party to secure respect are those of the sunni persuasion but then turkish nationalism depends upon ignoring religion tekin alp sets out confidently to give the turks in persia a turkish soul his model is the rumanian propaganda among the vlachs in macedonia and his expectations are great  there is no power in persia to put down such a movement because it could do no harm to anyone the nationalisation of the persian turks would even be a great and unexpected help to the persian government persia would be situated with regard to the turkish government as bavaria towards prussia  and this is only a stage towards a higher goal  the united turks should form the centre of gravity of the world of islam the arabs of egypt morocco and tunisia the persians afghans etc must enjoy complete independence in their own affairs but outwardly the world of islam must present a perfectly united front  the arabs of north africa and the shias of iran can appraise the independence held out to them by the unity which turkish nationalism has been presenting already to syria and irak the yemen and the hedjaz  but tekin alp deals even less tenderly with russia in explaining the bond of interest between turkish nationalism and germany he remarks that  the panturkish aspirations cannot come to their full development and realisation until the muscovite monster is crushed because the very districts which are the object of turkish irredentismsiberia the caucasus the crimea afghanistan etcare still directly or indirectly under russian rule  the et cetera proves to be nothing less than the province of kazan  the alluvial plains of the volga and the kama in european russia are inhabited by four or five million turks the northern turks are not indeed superior to the ottoman turks but must not therefore be underrated their progressive economic and social organisation is in every way a great help to the national movement  if he concludes the russian despotism is as we hope to be destroyed by the brave german austrian and turkish armies thirty to forty million turks will receive their independence with the ten million ottoman turks this will form a nation of fifty million advancing towards a great civilisation which may perhaps be compared to that of germany in that it will have the strength and energy to rise ever higher in some ways it will be even superior to the degenerate french and english civilisations  this nationalism which dominates turkeys present has also decided the question of her future if such a movement has taken possession of the osmanlis the osmanlis must lose possession of their empire turkish nationalism now directs the ottoman government wields its pretensions is master within its frontiers and how does it use its mastery to make a hell of armenia and syria and to plot out new macedonias in persia and the heart of russia thus turkish nationalism shows where the turk is intolerable and must go but it also shows where he has some right to stay  there are innocent and constructive elements in it as in all movements of the kind as in europe it has forced open the dead hand of the church under its influence the ministry of evkaf which holds the enormous religious endowments of turkey in trust has turned its funds to the founding of a national bank and library and the subsidising of a national architecture it has also started elementary schools like the voluntary schools supported by the christian nationalities in aid of the ministry of education and it has taken up the reform of the moslem seminaries medress√©s which have been one of the strongholds of turkish reaction the welfare of turkish students is a concern of the nationalist society called turk ujaghi the turkish family founded in 1912 and now possessing sixteen branches in various provincial towns of anatoliaonly turks may be memberswith affiliated societies in the caucasus and turkestan the turk ujaghi organises lantern lectures lectures on mediaeval anatolian art and even lectures by a turkish lady on panturanianism and womans rightsshe is said to have had khodjas20 in her audience and if so this certainly shows an unheardof openness to new ideas on the part of the islamji another society the turk g√ºji turkish strength encourages physical culture like the slavonic sokols and there are izdjis or turkish boyscouts under enver beys patronage who take turanian scoutnames blazon the white wolf of turkish paganism on their flags and cheer it is said not for the caliph or the padishah but for the khakan  this jumble of efforts halfadmirable and halfabsurd will justify turkish nationalism if it brings about the regeneration of the anatolian peasantry the anatolians have suffered as much from the ottoman dominion as any of the races which have come under its yoke they have paid for ottoman imperialism with their blood and physique their villages have been ravaged by the syphilis of the garrison towns and the wider the frontiers of the empire the further from their homes the anatolian soldiers have diedin the yemen in albania in irak on the snowcovered armenian plateau two things are necessary for anatolias salvationthe limitation of the turkish state to the lands inhabited by its turkishspeaking population and the replacement of the mongrel osmanli bureaucracy by a cleaner and more democratic political order if the allies can compass this they may claim without hypocrisy to have liberated another nationality for anatolia will be reborn on the day of its escape from the ottoman chrysalis as truly as were serbia and greece and rumania and bulgaria  the beginnings will be difficult as they have been in the balkans whatever frontiers a turkish national state may receive they cannot be drawn without including nonturkish elementsracial geography is nowhere very simple between bagdad and viennaand in view of what the turks racial minorities have suffered during the war and before it those left to him hereafter must be safeguarded by stringent guaranteesfar more stringent than the capitulations which for that matter protected none but the nationals of foreign powers the capitulations are a problem in themselves they were repudiated by the young turkish government at the beginning of the war as well as the conventions regulating the customs tariff it is difficult to see how the peace conference can pass over flagrant violations of international treaties and the nationalists contention that turkish justice has been brought up to a european standard will not bear examination on the contrary the young turkish congress of 1911 passed a resolution that the reorganisation of the administration of justice was less important than the abolition of the capitulations these difficulties however might be settled with a new and better anatolian government and as for the racial question with time and guaranteed tolerance for religion it might solve itself for there is a rude vitality in the turkish language and the greek and armenian minorities in central anatolia have been gradually adopting it in place of their native speech though this tendency is now being counteracted by the spread of national schools among the scattered outposts of the two nationalities in the interior     iii   with these suggestions anatolia and turkish nationalism may be dismissed from our survey shorn of their pretensions in armenia and the countries south of taurus the turks may experiment in the art of government without the tragedies which their present domination has brought upon mankind the other lands and peoples of western asia when they have ceased to be turkey will be restored once more to the civilised world what forces will shape their growth not even indirectly the discrowned turk for if he were not banned by his crimes he would still be doomed by his incapacity  the relative qualities of the different near eastern races are not in doubt a german teacher in the german technical school at aleppo who resigned his appointment as a protest against the armenian atrocities in 1915 thus records his personal judgment in an open letter to the reichstag21  the young turk is afraid of the christian nationalitiesarmenians syrians and greekson account of their cultural and economic superiority and he sees in their religion a hindrance to turkifying them by peaceful means they must therefore be exterminated or converted to islam by force the turks do not suspect that in so doing they are sawing off the branch on which they are sitting themselves yet who is to help turkey forward if not the greeks armenians and syrians who constitute more than a quarter of the population of the empire the turks the least gifted of the races living in turkey are themselves only a minority of the population and are still far behind the arabs in culture where is there any turkish trade turkish handicraft turkish industry turkish art turkish science they have even borrowed their law and religion from the conquered arabs and their language so far as it has been given literary form  we teachers who have been teaching greeks armenians arabs turks and jews in german schools in turkey for years can only pass judgment that of all our pupils the pure turks are the most unwilling and the least talented when for once in a way a turk does achieve something one can be sure in nine cases out of ten that one is dealing with a circassian an albanian or a turk with bulgarian blood in his veins from my personal experience i can only prophesy that the turks proper will never achieve anything in trade industry or science  we are told now in the german press about the turks hunger for education and of how they are thronging eagerly to learn german there is even a report of language courses for adults which have been started in turkey they have certainly been started but with what result one reads of the language course at a technical school which began with twelve turkish teachers as pupils our informant forgets to add however that after four lessons only six pupils presented themselves after five five after six four and after seven only three so that after eight lessons the course broke down through the indolence of the pupils before it had properly commenced if the pupils had been armenians they would have persevered till the end of the school year learnt industriously and finished with a respectable mastery of the german language  from a german teacher who has worked in turkey for three years this verdict is crushing and tekin alp himself virtually admits the charge it is true he writes that the turkish character is usually lacking in the qualities most essential to trade or economic undertakings but these may be acquired by a reasonable and methodical training and organisation the only organisation that seems to occur to him is the boycott which has been popular with the turks since the revolution of 1908  the unaccommodating attitude of the greek government was sufficient excuse he remarks in reference to the boycott of 1912 the real motive however was the longing of the turkish nation for independence in their own country the boycott which was at first directed solely against the greeks was then extended to the armenians and other nonmohammedan circles and was carried out with undiminished energy this movement which lasted in all its rigour for several months caused the ruin of hundreds of small greek and armenian tradesmen the systematic and rigorous boycott is now at an end but the spirit it created in the people still persists it can now be asserted that the movement for restoring the economic life of turkey is on the right road  the real effects of the boycott of 1912 are described by the german authority whose memorial has several times been cited in this article he tells us how under the patronage of the young turkish government associations were formed which intimidated the moslem peasants into buying from them when they came to market instead of from the christians with whom they had formerly dealt  the peasants came to their old dealers the memorial continues lamented their fate and asked their advice as to how they could save themselves from the hands of their fellowcountrymen they were delighted when at last the boycott came to an end and they could once more buy from greeks and armenians where they were well served and got good value for their money  if the turkish nationalists had confined themselves to economic weapons the turks economic ineptitude would have prevented them from doing serious harm but by abusing the political and military powers of the ottoman state to perpetrate the recent atrocities they have struck a mortal blow at the prosperity of western asia  in the whole of asia minor with perhaps one or two exceptions the same german authority states there is not a single pure turkish firm engaged in foreign trade the extermination of the armenian population means not only the loss of from 10 to 25 per cent of the total population of anatolia22 but what is most serious the elimination of those elements in the population which are the most highly developed economically and have the greatest capacity for civilisation  and this is the universal judgment of those in a position to know  the result of the deportations the american consul at aleppo declares in an official report23 is that as 90 per cent of the commerce of the interior is in the hands of the armenians the country is facing ruin the great bulk of business being done on credit hundreds of prominent business men other than armenians are facing bankruptcy there will not be left in the places evacuated a single tanner moulder blacksmith tailor carpenter clayworker weaver shoemaker jeweller pharmacist doctor lawyer or any of the professional people or tradesmen with very few exceptions and the country will be left in a practically helpless state  the german memorialist presses the indictment  you cannot become a merchant by murdering one you cannot master a handicraft if you smash its tools a sparselypopulated country does not become more productive if it destroys its most industrious population you do not advance the progress of civilisation if you drive into the desert as the scapegoat for decades and centuries of wasted opportunities the element in your population which shows the greatest economic ability the greatest progressiveness in education and the greatest energy in every respect and which was fitted by nature to build the bridge between east and west you only corrupt your own sense of right if you tread the rights of others under foot the popularity of an unpopular war may temporarily be promoted among the turkish masses by the destruction and spoliation of the nonmohammedan elementsthe armenians most of all but also in part the syrians greeks maronites and jewsbut thoughtful mohammedans when they realise the whole damage which the empire has sustained will lament the economic ruin of turkey most bitterly and will come to the conclusion that the turkish government has lost infinitely more than it can ever winit is a german writingby victories at the front  we may call it political necessity or what not declared an american travelling in anatolia during the deportations of 1915 but in essence it is a nominally ruling class jealous of a more progressive race striving by methods of primitive savagery to maintain the leading place24  what forces will be released in western asia when the turk has met his fate who will repair the ruin he leaves behind  the germans they have been penetrating turkey economically for the last thirty years they have organised regular steamship services between german and turkish ports multiplied the volume of turcogerman trade and extended their capital investments particularly in the ottoman debt and the construction of railways in 1881 when the debt was first placed under international administration germany held only 47 per cent of it and was the sixth in importance of turkeys creditors by 1912 she held 20 per cent and was second only to france25 her railway enterprises more ambitious than those of any other foreign power have brought valuable concessions in their trainharbour works at haidar pasha and alexandretta irrigation works in the konia oasis and the adana plain and the prospect when the bagdad railway reaches the tigris of tapping the naphtha deposits of kerkuk26 dr rohrbach the german specialist on the near east forecasts the profits of the bagdad railway from the results of russian railwaybuilding in central asia he prophesies the cultivation of cotton in the regions opened up by the line on a scale which will cover an appreciable part of the demands of german industry and will open a corresponding market for german wares among the new cottongrowing population27 yet the decisive factor in the bagdad railway he counsels his german readers is not to be found in these economic considerations but in another sphere  dr wiedenfeld drives this home  germanys relation to turkey his monograph begins belies the doctrine that all modern understandings and differences between nations have an economic origin we are certainly interested in the economic advancement of turkey  but in setting ourselves to make turkey strong we have been influenced far more by our political interests as a state among states das politische das staatlichmachtliche interesse even our economic activity has primarily served this aim and has in fact originated to a large extent in the purely politicomilitary problems aus den unmittelbaren machtaufgaben which confronted the turkish government exclusively economic considerations play a very subordinate part in turcogerman relations our common political aims and germanys interest in keeping open the landroute to the indian ocean will make it more than ever imperative for us to strengthen turkey economically with all our might and to put her in a position to build up on independent economic foundations a body politic strong enough to withstand all external assaults the means will still be economic the goal will be of a political order28  and dr rohrbach formulates the political goal with startling precision after twelve pages of disquisition on recent international diplomacy he brings his thesis to this point the bagdad railway links up with the railways of syria and  the importance of the syrian railway system lies in this that if the need arose it would be the direct instrument for the exercise of pressure upon england  supposing that germanaustroturkish cooperation became necessary in the direction of egypt  written as it was in 1911 this is a remarkable anticipation of turkish strategic railwaybuilding since the outbreak of war but it is infinitely remote in purpose from the economic regeneration of western asia and even when the german publicists reckon in economic values they generally betray their political design  the special point for germany dr wiedenfeld lays down in discussing the agricultural possibilities of the ottoman territories is that to a large extent crops can be grown here which supplement our own economic resources in important respects in peace time of course no one would think of transporting goods of such bulk as agricultural products any way but by sea but the war has impressed on us with brutal clearness the value for us of being able on occasions of extreme necessity to import cotton from turkey by land  thus germanys economic activity in turkey has been not for prosperity but for power not for peace but for war in developing turkey germany is simply developing the central europe scheme of a military combine selfcontained economically and challenging the world in arms29 germany is concerned with turkey not for her splendid past and future but for her miserable present for turkeyas she is and only as she isis a vital chequer on the chessboard where germany has been playing her game of world power or des staatlichmachtlichen interessens as dr wiedenfeld would say therefore germany does not eye the lands and peoples under ottoman dominion with a view to their common advantage and her own she selects a piece among them which she can keep under her thumb and so control the square abdulhamid was her first pawn and when the young turk party swept him off the board she adopted them and their colour30 for by hook or by crook through this agency or that turkey had to be commanded or germanys play was spoilt  germanys control over turkey depends upon the maintenance of a corrupt minority in powertoo weak and corrupt to remain in it without germanys guarantee and corrupt enough when secured in it to put it at germanys disposal a free hand at home in return for servitude in diplomacy and warthe deal is called hegemony and is as old as ancient greece by her hegemony over the ottoman government germany threatens the british and russian empires from all the ottoman frontiers and with the free hand that is their price the young turks inflict on all lands and peoples within those frontiers whatever evils conduce to the maintenance of their pretensions  as rohrbach and wiedenfeld point out this political understanding underlies all germanys economic efforts in western asia and we can see how it has warped them from their proper ends the track of the bagdad railway for example has not been selected in the economic interests of the lands and peoples which it ostensibly serves dr rohrbach himself admits that  the anatolian section of the bagdad railway cannot be described as properly paying its way it is otherwise with the french line from smyrna to afiun kara hissar which links the anatolian railway with the older railway system in the west the parts of asia minor which were thickly populated and prosperous in antiquity lie mostly westward of this first section of the bagdad railway round the rivervalleys and french and english railways leading down to the aegean  there are other onceflourishing parts of the peninsula he continues which the bagdad railway does not touch at allthe vilayet of sivas and the other armenian provinces the original german plan was to carry the railway through armenia from angora to kharput but russia not unnaturally vetoed the construction so near her caucasian frontiers of a line which by the nature of the turcogerman understanding must primarily serve strategic ends31 and the track was therefore deflected to the southeast this took it through the most barren parts of central anatolia and in the next section involved the slow and costly work of tunnelling the taurus and amanus mountains  if merely economic and not political advantages were taken into account dr rohrbach concedes the question might perhaps be raised whether it would not be better to leave the anatolian section alone altogether and begin the bagdad railway from seleucia on the syrian coast the future export trade in grain wool and cotton will in any case do all it can to lengthen the cheap seapassage and shorten correspondingly the section on which it must pay railway freights the fact that the route connecting bagdad with the mediterranean coast in the neighbourhood of antioch is the oldest greatest and still most promising traderoute of western asia is independent of all railway projects  it is worth remembering that a railway following this route from the syrian coast to the persian gulf has more than once been projected by the british government as early as the thirties of last century colonel chesney was sent out to examine the ground and in 1867 the proposal was considered by a committee of the house of commons for the economic development of western asia it is clearly a better plan but then dr rohrbach bases the necessity for the east anatolian section of the bagdad railway on wholly different grounds  the necessity he declares consists in turkeys military interests which obviously would be very poorly served by german railway enterprise if troops could not be transported by train without a break from bagdad and mosul to the extremity of anatolia and vice vers√¢  the bagdad railway is thus acknowledged to be an instrument of strategy for the germans and for the turks of dominationfor vice vers√¢ means that turkish troops can be transported at a moments notice through the tunnels from anatolia to enforce the ottoman pretension over the arab lands militarily these tunnels are the most valuable section of the line economically they are the most costly and unremunerative and the second and longer tunnel could still have been dispensed with if south of taurus the track had been led along the syrian coast economic interests and considerations of expense wiedenfeld concedes32 argued strongly for the latter course butfortunately as we must admit todaythe military point of view prevailed thus the turcogerman understanding prevented the bagdad railway first from beginning at a port on the mediterranean coast and then from touching the coast at all33 the spine of turkey as german writers are fond of calling it distorts the natural articulation of western asia  nemesis has overtaken the germans in the armenian deportationsa political end of turkish nationalism which swept away the economic means towards germanys subtler policy a month or two before the outbreak of war dr rohrbach stated in a public lecture that  germany has an important interest in effecting and maintaining contact with the armenian nation we have set before ourselves the necessary and legitimate aim of spreading and enrooting german influence in turkey not only by military missions and the construction of railways but also by the establishment of intellectual relations by the work of german kulturin a word by moral conquests and we are determined by pacific means to reach an amicable understanding with the turks and the other nations in the turkish empire our ulterior object in this is to strengthen the turkish empire internally with the aid of german science education and training and for this work the armenians are indispensable  a few months later germany as part price of turkeys intervention in the war had to leave the young turks a free hand to exterminate the nation which was the indispensable instrument of her turkish policy on the 9th august 1915 the german ambassador at constantinople handed in a formal protest against the deportations in which his government declined all responsibility for the consequences which might result on the 11th january 1916 in the german reichstag the chief of the political department of the foreign office replied to a question from dr liebknecht that an exchange of views about the reaction of these measures upon the population was taking place and that further information could not be given and while germany was maintaining this correct attitude before the world she was assisting in turkey at the destruction of her own work  even the atrocities of 1909 had damaged the economic prospects of the adapa district from which dr rohrbach34 hoped so much for  the first thing the turkish peasants did was to destroy all the steamploughs and nearly all the threshing machines there were over a hundred of them which the armenian villagers had imported for the cultivation of the civilian plain35  by the atrocities of 1915 the economic life of western asia was completely ruined and the fruits of german enterprise were swept away in the flood  i have before me writes our german memorialised a list of the customers of a single constantinople firm of importers which places its orders principally in germany and austria the accounts which this firm has outstanding amount to date to ¬£13922 turkish owing from 378 customers in 42 towns of the interior in consequence of the armenian deportations these debts are no longer recoverable the 378 customers with all their employees goods and assets have vanished from the face of the earth any of the owners that are still alive are now beggars on the borders of the arabian desert  at urfa after the atrocities of 1896 philanthropists of all nations had founded orphanages and started native industries attached to the german orphanage there was a carpet factory with dyeing vats and a spinnery which dr rohrbach36 after personal investigation describes as an institution to be welcomed as unreservedly from the national as from the humanitarian point of view  the factory he remarks not only provides work and bread for 400 persons but has transplanted one of the most profitable and promising industries of the east into the sphere traversed by the german railway where german interests are predominant  he prophesies that the whole carpet industry of western asia from which english and other foreign firms in smyrna now draw such enormous profits will soon be concentrated round urfa in german hands from armenias evil apparently springs germanys goodbut in 1911 dr rohrbach did not foresee the catastrophe of 1915  for the rise of the carpet industry our german memorialised writes turkey has to thank capitalists and exporters who are almost all armenians greeks jews or europeans like the cotton cultivation introduced by germany into cilicia this carpet industry in the eastern provinces has been deprived of the hands essential to it by the armenian deportations  eyewitnesses at urfa describe how the armenian community there was massacred in 1915the third time in twenty years and this time to extinctionand it points the irony of the situation that the turkish guns were served by german artillerymen37  i have nothing to say writes dr niepage the german teacher from aleppo about the opinion of the german officers in turkey i often noticed among them an ominous silence or a convulsive effort to change the subject when any german of warm feelings and independent judgment talked in their presence of the fearful sufferings of the armenians  this moral bankruptcy is more fatal to the future of germany in western asia than all the material havoc which the armenian deportations have caused for dr niepage is convinced that the blood of the armenians will be on germanys head  the teaching of the germans is the simple turks explanation  and more sensitive mohammedans turks and arabs alike cannot believe that their own government has ordered these horrors they lay all excesses at the germans door for the germans during the war are regarded as turkeys schoolmasters in everything the mollahs declare in the mosques that the german officers and not the sublime porte have ordered the maltreatment and extermination of the armenians others say perhaps the german government has its hands tied by certain agreements defining its powers or perhaps it is not an opportune moment for intervention  our presence had no ameliorating effect and what we could do ourselves was negligible the abusive epithet giaur is heard once more by german ears  we think it our duty to draw attention to the fact that our educational work in turkey forfeits its moral basis and the natives esteem if the german government is not in a position to prevent the brutalities inflicted here upon the wives and children of murdered armenians  the writer considers it out of the question that the german government if it seriously desired to stem the tide of destruction in this eleventh hour would find it impossible to bring the turkish government to reason  if we persist in treating the massacres of christians as an internal affair of turkey which is only important to us because it ensures us the turks friendship then we must change the orientation of our german kulturpolitik we must stop sending german teachers to turkey and we teachers must give up telling our pupils in turkey about german poets and philosophers german culture and german ideals to say nothing of german christianity  three years ago i was sent by the foreign office as highergrade teacher to the german technical school at aleppo the prussian provincial school board at magdeburg specially enjoined upon me when i went out to show myself worthy of the confidence reposed in me in the grant of furlough to take up this post i should not be fulfilling my duty as a german official and an accredited representative of german culture if i consented to keep silence in face of the atrocities of which i was a witness or to look on passively while the pupils entrusted to my charge were driven out into the desert to die of starvation  the things of which everybody here has been a witness for months past remain as a stain on germanys shield in the minds of oriental nations  what will be left to germany in western asia after the war she may keep her trade though wiedenfeld confesses that the exchange of commodities between germany and turkey has never attained any really considerable dimensions and that the german export trade commands no really staple article whatever of the kind exported by england austria and russiaunless we count as such munitions and other materials of war38 except for the last item this german trade will probably remain and grow but the german hegemony based on railway enterprise and reinsured by moral conquests will scarcely survive the ottoman dominion  happily there are other representatives of culture other indigenous nationalities other possibilities of economic development which will remain in western asia when the turk and german have gone and which may be equal to repairing the ruin they will leave behind  for nearly a century now the american evangelical missions have been doing work there which is the greatest conceivable contrast to the german kulturpolitik of the last thirty years a missionary sent out to relieve the first pioneers was given the following instructions by the american board  the object of our missions to the oriental churches is first to revive the knowledge and spirit of the gospel among them and secondly by this means to operate upon the mohammedans  the oriental churches need assistance from their brethren abroad our object is not to subvert them you are not sent among those churches to proselytise let the armenian remain an armenian if he will the greek a greek the nestorian a nestorian the oriental an oriental  your great business is with the fundamental doctrines and duties of the gospel39  in this spirit the american missionaries have worked they have had no warships behind them no diplomatic support no political ambitions no economic concessions as evangelicals their first step was to translate the bible into all the living languages and current scripts of the nearer east for the bulgars and armenians this was the beginning of their modern literature but the jealousy of the orthodox and gregorian clergy was naturally aroused native protestant churches formed themselvesnot by the missionaries initiative but on their own they were trained by the missionaries to selfgovernment and as they spread from centre to centre they grouped themselves in unions with annual meetings to settle their common affairs the missionaries also encouraged them to be selfsupporting and in 1908 the contributions of the native churches to the general expenses of the missions were twice as large as those of the american board40 the ottoman government recognised its protestant subjects as a religious corporation millet in 1853 and in spite of this the jealousy of the national churches was overcome for the work of the americans was not confined to the new protestant community the translation of the bible led them also into educational work they laid the foundations of secondary education in western asia and their schools and collegesstill the only institutions of their kindare attended by gregorians as well as protestants moslems as well as christians moslem girls as well as boys as they opened up remoter districts they added medicine to their activities and their hospitals like their schools have been the first in the field and all this has been built up so unassumingly that its magnitude is hardly realised by the americans themselves in the three turkey missions which cover anatolia and armeniathe whole of turkey except the arab landsthere were on the eve of the war 209 american missionaries with 1299 native helpers 163 protestant churches with 15348 members 450 schools with 25922 pupils constantinople college and 6 other colleges or high schools for girls robert college on the bosphorus and 9 other colleges for men or boys and 11 hospitals  the war when it came seemed to sweep away everything the protestant armenians in spite of a nominal exemption were deported and massacred like their gregorian fellowcountrymen the boys and girls were carried away from the american colleges the nurses and patients from the hospitals the empty buildings were requisitioned by the ottoman authorities the missionaries themselves in their devoted efforts to save a remnant from destruction suffered as many casualties from typhus and physical exhaustion as any proportionate body of workers on the european battlefields the turkish nationalists congratulated themselves that the american work in western asia was destroyed in praising a lecture by a member of the german reichstag who had declared himself opposed to all missionary activities in the turkish empire a constantinople newspaper41 wrote  the suppression of the schools founded and directed by ecclesiastical missions or by individuals belonging to enemy nations is as important a measure as the abolition of the capitulations thanks to their schools foreigners were able to exercise great moral influence over the young men of the country and they were virtually in charge of its spiritual and intellectual guidance by closing them the government has put an end to a situation as humiliating as it was dangerous  but the missionaries spirit was something they could not destroy  when they deported the armenians wrote a missionary and left us without work and without friends we decided to come home and get our vacation and be ready to go wherever we could after the war42  after the war the turks in anatolia may still be infatuated enough to banish their best friends but in armenia when the turk has gone the americans will find more than their former field for in one form or another armenia is certain to rise again the turks have not succeeded in exterminating the armenian nation half of it lives in russia and its colonies are scattered over the world from california to singapore even within the ottoman frontiers the extermination is not complete and the arabian deserts will yield up their living as well as the memory of their dead the relations of armenia with the russian democracy should not be more difficult to settle than those of finland and poland her frontiers cannot be forecast but they must include the six vilayetsso often promised reforms by the concert of europe and so often abandoned to the revenges of the ottoman governmentas well as the civilian highlands and some outlet to the sea one thing is certain that whatever land is restored to them the armenians will turn its resources to good account for while their towndwellers are the merchants and artisans of western asia 80 per cent of them are tillers of the soil  what the americans have done for armenia has been done for syria by the french43 there are half a million maronite catholics in syria and since the seventeenth century france has been the protectress of catholicism in the near east in 1864 when there was trouble in syria and the maronites were being molested by the ottoman government france landed an army corps and secured autonomy for the lebanon under a christian governor but french influence is not limited to the lebanon province all over syria there are french clerical secular and judaic schools beir√ªt and damascus christian and moslemfor there is more religious tolerance in syria than in most near eastern countriesare equally under the spell of french civilisation and france is the chief economic power in the land for french enterprise has built the syrian railways the sufferings of syria during the war have been described the young turks have confiscated the railways and deprived the lebanon of its autonomy even rohrbach deprecates the fact that only a few of the higher officials in syria are chosen from among the natives of the country while almost all from the kaimakam upwards are sent out from constantinople and he attributes to this policy the feeling against the turks which is most acute in damascus this is rohrbachs periphrasis for arab nationalism which will be master in its own house when the turk has been removed the future status and boundaries of syria can no more be forecast than those of armenia at the present stage of the war yet here too certain tendencies are clear in some form or other arab syria will retain her connection with france and her growing population will no longer be driven by misgovernment to emigration  syrians and armenians have been emigrating for the last quarter of a century and during the same period the jews whose birthright in western asia is as ancient as theirs have been returning to their native landnot because ottoman dominion bore less hardly upon them than upon other gifted races but because nothing could well be worse than the conditions they left behind for these jewish immigrants came almost entirely from the russian pale the hearth and hell of modern jewry the movement really began after the assassination of alexander ii in 1881 which threw back reform in russia for thirtysix years the jews were the scapegoats of the reaction new laws deprived them of their last civil rights pogroms of life itself they came to palestine as refugees and between 1881 and 1914 their numbers there increased from 25000 to 120000 souls  the most remarkable result of this movement has been the foundation of flourishing agricultural colonies their struggle for existence has been hard the pioneers were students or tradesfolk of the ghetto unused to outdoor life and ignorant of near eastern conditions baron edmund de rothschild financed them from 1884 to 1899 at a loss then they were taken over by the palestine colonisation association which discovered the secrets of success in selfgovernment and scientific methods  each colony is now governed by an elective council of inhabitants with committees for education police and the arbitration of disputes and they have organised cooperative unions which make them independent of middlemen in the disposal of their produce their production has rapidly risen in quantity and value through the industry and intelligence of the average jewish settler assisted latterly by an agricultural experiment station at atlit near haifa which improves the varieties of indigenous crops and acclimatises others44 there is a palestine land development company which buys land in big estates and resells it in small lots to individual settlers and an anglopalestine bank which makes advances to the new settlers when they take up their holdings as a result of this enlightened policy the number of colonies has risen to about forty with 15000 inhabitants in all and 110000 acres of land and these figures do not do full justice to the importance of the colonising movement the 15000 jewish agriculturists are only 1212 per cent of the jewish population in palestine and 2 per cent of the total population of the country but they are the most active intelligent element and the only element which is rapidly increasing again the land they own is only 2 per cent of the total area of palestine but it is between 8 and 14 per cent of the area under cultivation and there are vast uncultivated tracts which the jews can and will reclaim as their numbers growboth by further colonisation and by natural increase for the first generation of colonists have already proved their ability to multiply in the promised land under this new jewish husbandry palestine has begun to recover its ancient prosperity the jews have sunk artesian wells built dams for water storage fought down malaria by drainage and eucalyptus planting and laid out many miles of roads in 1890 an acre of irrigable land at petachtikweh the earliest colony was worth ¬£3 12s in 1914 ¬£36 and the annual trade of jaffa rose from ¬£760000 to ¬£2080000 between 1904 and 1912 the impetus to agriculture is benefiting the whole economic life of the country wrote the german vicecounsul at jaffa in his report for 1912 and there is no fear that as immigration increases the arab element will be crowded to the wall there are still only two jewish colonies beyond jordan where the hauranunder the roman empire a cornland with a dozen citieshas been opened up by the railway and is waiting again for the plough  but will immigration continue now that the jew of the pale has been turned at a stroke into the free citizen of a democratic country probably it will actually increase for the pale has been ravaged as well as liberated during the war and the jews of germany have based an ingenious policy on this prospect which is expounded thus by dr davistrietsch of berlin45  according to the most recent statistics about 12900000 out of the 14300000 jews in the world speak german or yiddish j√ºdischdeutsch as their mothertongue but its language cultural orientation and business relations the jewish element from eastern europe the pale is an asset to german influence in a certain sense the jews are a near eastern element in germany and a german element in turkey  germany may not relish her kinship with these lost teutonic tribes but dr davistrietsch makes a satirical exposure of such scruples  it used to be a stock argument against the jews that all nations regarded them with equal hostility but the war has brought upon the germans such a superabundance of almost universal execration that the question which is the most despised of all nationsif one goes not by justice and equity but by the violence and extensiveness of the prejudicemight well now be altered to the germans disadvantage  in this unenviable competition for the prize of hate turkey too has a word to say for the unspeakable turk is a rhetorical commonplace of english politics  having thus isolated the jews from humanity and pilloried them with the german and the turk the writer expounds their function in the turcogerman system  hitherto germany has bothered herself very little about the jewish emigration from eastern europe people in germany hardly realised that through the annual exodus of about 100000 germanspeaking jews to the united states and england the empire of the english language and the economic system that goes with it is being enlarged while a german asset is being proportionately depreciated  the war found the jewry of eastern europe in process of being uprooted and has enormously accelerated the catastrophe galicia and the western provinces of russia which between them contain many more than half the jews in the world have suffered more from the war than any other region jewish homes have been broken up by hundreds of thousands and there is no doubt whatever that as a result of the war there will be an emigration of east european jews on an unprecedented scale  the disposal of the east european jews will be a problem for germany it will no longer do simply to close the german frontiers to them and in view of the difficulties which would result from a wholesale migration of eastern jews into germany itself germans will only be too glad to find a way out in the emigration of these jews to turkeya solution extraordinarily favourable to the interests of all three parties concerned  and from this he passes to a wider vision  the germanspeaking jews abroad are a kind of germanspeaking province which is well worth cultivation ninetenths of the jewish world speak german and a good part of the remainder live in the islamic world which is germanys friend so that there are grounds for talking of a german protectorate over the whole of jewry  by this exploitation of aversions dr trietsch expects to deposit the jews of the pale over western asia as culturemanure for a german harvest and if the jewish migration to palestine had remained nothing more than a stream of refugees he might possibly have succeeded in his purpose but in the last twenty years this jewish movement has become a positive thingno longer a flight from the pale but a remembrance of zionand zionism has already challenged and defeated the policy which dr trietsch represents the object of zionism it was announced in the basle programme drawn up by the first zionist congress in 1897 is to establish for the jewish people a publicly and legally assured home in palestine for the zionists jewry is a nation and to become like other nations it needs its motherland in the jewish colonies in palestine they see not merely a successful social enterprise but the visible symbol of a body politic the foundation of a national university in jerusalem is as ultimate a goal for them as the economic development of the land and their greatest achievement has been the revival of hebrew as the living language of the palestinian jews it was this that brought them into conflict with the germanising tendency in 1907 a secondary school was successfully started at jaffa by the initiative of jewish teachers in palestine with hebrew as the language of instruction but in 1914 when a jewish polytechnic was founded at haifa the germanjewish hilfsverein which had taken a leading part refused to follow this precedent and insisted on certain subjects being taught in german not only in the polytechnic but in the hilfsvereins other schools the result was a secession of pupils and teachers purely hebrew schools were opened the zionist organisation gave official support and the germanising party was compelled to accept a compromise which was in effect a victory for the hebrew language  dr trietsch himself accepts this settlement but does not abandon his idea  it was certainly impossible to expect the spanish and arabicspeaking jews46 to submit in their own jewish country to the hegemony of the german language only hebrew could become the common vernacular language of the scattered fragments of jewry drifting back to palestine from all the countries of the world but  in addition to hebrew to which they are more and more inclined the jews must have a worldlanguage weltsprache and this can only be german  anyone acquainted with the languageordinances of central europe will feel that this suggestion veils a threat what has been happening in palestine during the war dr trietsch informs us that the ottoman government has been proceeding with the naturalisation of the palestinian jews and that the local execution of this measure has not been effected without disturbances which are beyond the province of this pamphlet one significant consequence was the appearance in egypt of palestinian refugees who raised a zion mule corps there and fought through the gallipoli campaign what is the outlook for palestine after the war if the ottoman pretension survives the menace from turkish nationalism47 and german resentment48 is grave but if turk and german go there are zionists who would like to see palestine a british protectorate with the prospect of growing into a british dominion certainly if the jewish colonies are to make progress they must be relieved of keeping their own police building their own roads and the other burdens that fall on them under ottoman government and this can only be secured by a better public administration as for the british side of the question we may consult dr trietsch  there are possibilities he urges in a german protectorate over the jews as well as over islam smaller national units than the 14 13 million jews have been able to do germany vital injury or service and while the jews have no national state their dispersion over the whole world their high standard of culture and their peculiar abilities lend them a weight that is worth more in the balance than many larger national masses which occupy a compact area of their own  other powers than germany may take these possibilities to heart  here then are peoples risen from the past to do what the turks cannot and the germans will not in western asia there is much to be donereform of justice to obtain legal release from the capitulations reform in the assessment and collection of the agricultural tithes which have been denounced for a century by every student of ottoman administration agrarian reform to save peasant proprietorship which in syria at any rate is seriously in danger genuine development of economic resources unsectarian and nonnationalistic advancement of education but the jews syrians and armenians are equal to their task and with the aid of the foreign nations on whom they can count they will certainly accomplish it the future of palestine syria and armenia is thus assured but there are other countriesonce as fertile prosperous and populous as theywhich have lost not only their wealth but their inhabitants under the ottoman domination these countries have not the life left in them to reclaim themselves and must look abroad for reconstruction  if you cross the euphrates by the bridge that carries the bagdad railway you enter a vast landscape of steppes as virgin to the eye as any prairie across the mississippi only the tells mounds with which it is studded witness to the density of its ancient populationfor northern mesopotamia was once so populous and full of riches that rome and the rulers of iran fought seven centuries for its possession till the arabs conquered it from both  the railway has now reached nisibin the roman frontier fortress heroically defended and ceded in bitterness of heart and runs past dara which the persians never took westward lies urfanamed edessa by alexanders men after their macedonian city of running waters49 later the seat of a christian syriac culture whose missionaries were heard in china and travancore still famous under arab dominion for its veronica and 300 churches and restored for a moment to christendom as the capital of a crusader principality till the mongols trampled it into oblivion and the osmanlis made it a name for butchery  from urfa to nisibin there can be fields again the climate has not changed and wherever the bedawi pitches his tents and scratches the ground there is proof of the old fertility only anarchy has banished cultivation for since the ottoman pretension was established over the land it has been the battleground of brigand tribeskurds from the hills and arabs from the desert skirmishing or herding their flocks making or breaking alliance but always robbing any tiller of the land of the fruits of his labour  if once dr rohrbach prophesies the peasant population were sure of its life and property it would joyfully expand push out into the desert and bring new land under the plough in a few years the villages would spring up not by dozens but by hundreds  at present cultivation is confined to the armenian foothillsan uncertain arc of green from aleppo to mosul but the railway strikes boldly into the deserted middle of the land giving the arc a chord and when turcogerman strategic interests no longer debar it from being linked up through aleppo with a syrian port it will be the really valuable section of the bagdad system the railway is the only capital enterprise that northern mesopotamia requires for there is rain sufficient for the crops without artificial irrigation reservoirs of population are the need the kurds who come for winter pasture may be induced to stayalready they have been settling down in the western districts and have gained a reputation for industry the bedawin more fickle husbandmen may settle southward along the euphrates and in time there will be a surplus of peasantry from armenia and syria these will add field to field but unless some stronger stream of immigration is led into the land it will take many generations to recover its ancient prosperity for in the ninth century ad northern mesopotamia paid harunalrashid as great a revenue as egypt and its cotton commanded the market of the world50  southern mesopotamiathe irak of the arabs and babylonia of the greekslies desolate like the north but is a contrast to it in every other respect its aspect is towards the persian gulf and rohrbach grudgingly admits51 that down the tigris to basra and not upstream to alexandretta is the natural channel for its trade it gets nothing from the mediterranean neither trade nor rain and every drop of water for cultivation must be led out of the rivers but the rivers in their natural state are worse than the drought their discharge is extremely variableabout eight times as great in april as in october they are always silting up their beds and scooping out others and when there are no men to interfere they leave half the country a desert and make the other half a swamp yet the soil when justly watered is one of the richest in the world for irak is an immense alluvial delta more than five hundred miles from end to end which the tigris and euphrates have deposited in what was originally the head of the persian gulf the arabs call it the saw√¢d or black land and it is a striking change from the bare ledges of arabia and iran which enclose its flanks and from the northern steppeland which it suddenly replacesat samarra if you are descending the tigris and on the euphrates at hit the steppe cannot compare with the saw√¢d in fertility but the saw√¢d does not so readily yield up its wealth to become something better than a wilderness of dust and slime it needs engineering on the grand scale and a mighty populationimmense forces working for immense returns in a strangely different environment it anticipated our modern rhythm of life by four thousand years and then went back to desolation five centuries before industrialism which may repeople it began  the saw√¢d was first reclaimed by men who had already a mastery of metals a system of writing and a mature religionless civilised men would never have attempted the task these sumerians in the fourth millennium bc lived on tells heaped up above floodlevel each tell a citystate with its separate government and gods for centralisation was the one thing needful to the country which the sumerians did not achieve the centralisers were semites from the arabian plateau sargon of akkad and naram sin ruled the whole saw√¢d as early as 2500 bc hammurabi in 1900 already ruled it from babylon and the capital has never shifted more than sixty miles since then babylon on the euphrates and bagdad on the tigris are the alternative points from which the saw√¢d can be controlled just above them the first irrigation canals branch off from the rivers and between them the rivers approach within thirtyfive miles of each other it is the point of vantage for government and engineering  here farsighted engineers and stronghanded rulers turned the waters of babylon into waters of life and the saw√¢d became a great heart of civilisation breathing in manpowersumerians and amorites and kassites and aramaeans and chaldeans and persians and greeks and arabsand breathing out the works of mangrain and wool and babylonish garments inventions still used in our machineshops and emotions still felt in our religion  the land writes herodotus52 who saw it in its prime has a little rain and this nourishes the corn at the root but the crops are matured and brought to harvest by water from the rivernot as in egypt by the river flooding over the fields but by human labour and shadufs53 for babylonia like egypt is one network of canals the largest of which is navigable it is far the best cornland of all the countries i know there is no attempt at arboriculturefigs or vines or olivesbut it is such superb cornland that the average yield is twohundredfold and threehundredfold in the best years the wheat and barley there are a good four inches broad in the blade and millet and sesame grow as big as treesbut i will not state the dimensions i have ascertained because i know that for anyone who has not visited babylonia and witnessed these facts about the crops for himself they would be altogether beyond belief  harnessed in the irrigation channels the tigris and euphrates had become as mighty forces of production as the nile and the ganges the yangtse and the hoangho  this herodotus adds54 is the best demonstration i can give of the wealth of the babylonians all the lands ruled by the king of persia are assessed in addition to their taxes in money for the maintenance of the kings household and army in kind under this assessment the king is maintained for four months out of the twelve by babylonia and for the remaining eight by the rest of asia together so that in wealth the assyrian province is equivalent to a third of all asia  the asia over which the achaemenids ruled included russian central asia and egypt as well as modern turkey and persia and egypt under the same assessment merely maintained the local persian garrison55 its money contribution was inferior too700 talents as compared with assyrias 1000 and though these figures may not be conclusive because the persian province of assyria probably extended over the northern steppes as well as the saw√¢d it is certain that under the arab caliphate when irak and egypt were provinces of one empire for the second time in history irak by itself paid 135 million dirhems francs annually into harunalrashids treasury and egypt no more than 65 million so that a thousand years ago the productiveness of the saw√¢d was more than double that of the nile  another measure of the lands capacity is the greatness of its cities herodotus gives statistics56 of babylon in the fifth century bcwalls 300 feet high 75 feet broad and 58 miles in circuit three and fourstoried houses laid out in blocks broad straight streets intersecting one another at regular intervals at right angles or parallel to the euphrates any one who reads herodotus description of babylon or ibn serapions of bagdad and considers that these vast urban masses were merely centres of collection and distribution for the open country can infer the density of population and intensity of cultivation over the face of the saw√¢d when the caliph omar conquered irak from the persians in the middle of the seventh century ad and took an inventory of what he had acquired he found that there were 5000000 hectares57 of land under cultivation and that the polltax was paid by 550000 householders which implies a total population in town and country of more than 5000000 souls where a bare million and a half maintains itself today in city alleys and nomads tents  and in omars time the saw√¢d was no longer at its best for a few years before the arab conquest abnormally high floods had burst the dykes from below hilla to above basra the euphrates broadened into a swamp and the tigris deserted its former and present bed for the shattelhai leaving the amara district a desert the persian government locked in a suicidal struggle with rome was powerless to make good the damage and the shock of the arab invasion made it irreparable58 under the abbasid caliphs of bagdad the rest of the country preserved its prosperity but in the thirteenth century hulaku the mongol finished the work of the floods and under ottoman dominion the saw√¢d has not recovered  can it still be reclaimed surveys have been taken by sir william willcocks as adviser to the ottoman ministry of public works and his final conclusions and proposals are embodied in a report drawn up at bagdad in 191159  the tigriseuphrates delta he writes may be classed as an arid region of some 5000000 hectares all this land is capable of easy levelling and reclamation the presence of 15 per cent lime in the soil renders reclamation very easy compared with similar work in the dense clays of egypt one is never far away from the giant banks of old canals and the ruins of ancient towns  but he does not expect to make all these 5000000 hectares productive simultaneously as they are said to have been when omar took his inventory it is water not land which measures production and he reckons that the average combined discharge of the rivers would irrigate 3000000 hectares in winter and in summer 400000 of rice or 1250000 of other crops this is the eventual maximum for immediate reclamation he takes 1410000 hectares in hand his project is practically to restore with technical improvements the ancient system of canals and drains using the euphrates water to irrigate everything west of the tigris down to kut and the shattelhai and the water of the tigris and its tributaries for districts east of that line adding 33 per cent for contingencies to his estimate for cost of materials and rates of labour and doubling the total to cover interest on loans and subsequent development he arrives at ¬£29105020 turkish60 as the cost from first to last of irrigation and agricultural works together and he estimates that the 1410000 hectares reclaimed by this outlay will produce crops to the value of ¬£9070000 turkish a year in other words the annual return on the gross expenditure will be more than 31 per cent and under the present tithe system ¬£7256000 turkish of this will remain with the owners of the soil while ¬£1814000 will pass to the government this will give the country itself a net return of 249 per cent on the combined gross cost of irrigation and agricultural works while the government after paying away ¬£443000 turkish out of its tithes for maintenance charges will still receive a clear 9 per cent per annum on the gross cost of irrigation to which its share in the outlay will be confined  unquestionably therefore the enterprise is exceedingly profitable to all parties concerned looking further ahead sir william proposes to supersede the navigation of the tigris61 by railways and so set free the whole discharge of the two rivers for irrigation he contemplates handling annually 375000 tons of cereals and 1250000 cwt of cotton and estimates the future by the effects of the chenab canal in northern india  a canal traversing lands similar to those of mesopotamia in their climate and in the condition in which they found themselves before the canal works were carried out in such a land so like a great part of mesopotamia canals have introduced in a few years nearly a million of inhabitants and the resurrection of the country has been so rapid that its very success was jeopardised by a railway not being able to be made quickly enough to transport the enormous produce  a million of inhabitantsthat is the crux of the problem labour is as necessary as water for the raising of crops sir williams barrages and canals without hands to turn them to account would be a dead loss instead of a profitable investment but from what reservoir of population is this manpower to be introduced the german economists are baffled by the difficulty  it is useless as rohrbach puts it to sink from 150 to 600 million marks in restoring the canal system and then let the land lie idle with all its new dams and channels for lack of cultivators yet turkey can never raise enough settlers for irak by internal colonisation62  she cannot raise them even for the minor enterprises at konia and adapa63 and evidently the saw√¢d must draw its future cultivators from somewhere beyond the bounds of western asia from germany many germans have suggested but german experts curtly dismiss the idea the first point rohrbach makes in his book on the bagdad railway is that german colonisation in anatolia is impossible for political reasons no worse service he declares can be done to the german cause in the east than the propagation of this idea and the rise of turkish nationalism has proved him right64 there remain the arab lands  but even he continues if the turks thought of foreign colonisation in syria and mesopotamia to hold the arabs in check the political factor again that would be little help to us germans for only very limited portions of those countries have a climate in which germans can work on the land or perform any kind of heavy manual labour  and germany herself is hard up for men  for all prospective developments in turkey writes dr trietsch not merely scientific knowledge capital and organisation are wanted but men and germany has no resources in men worth speaking of for opening up the islamic world  it is one of his arguments for bringing in the jews but the colonisation of palestine will leave no jews over for irak rohrbach65 disposes of the mouhadjirsthey are a drop in the bucket and are no more adapted to the climate than the germans themselves there is really nothing for it he bursts out in despair but the introduction of mohammedans from other countries where the climatic conditions of irak prevail  that narrows the field to india and egypt and drives turcogerman policy upon the horns of a dilemma  the colonists must either remain subjects of a foreign power a solution which could not be considered for an instant by any turkish government or else they must become turkish subjects  a condition which to indians and egyptians as well as germans would be prohibitive no one who has known good government would exchange it for ottoman government without the capitulations as a guarantee  the ottoman government has its own characteristic view in a memorandum on railways and reclamation published by the ministry of public works in 1909 a r√©sum√© is given of the willcocks scheme  in due time the memorandum proceeds a comprehensive scheme for the whole of mesopotamia must be carried out but apart from the question of expense it is clear that the public works involved will not be justified until turkey is in a position to colonise these extensive districts and this question cannot be considered till we have succeeded in getting rid of the capitulations  this is the ottoman pretension egypt rid of the osmanli and india where he never ruled have kept their ancient wealth of harvests and population and have manpower to spare for the reclamation of the saw√¢d all the means are at hand for bringing the land to lifethe water the engineer the capital the labour only the ottoman pretension stands in the way and condemns the saw√¢d to lie dead and unharvested so long as it endures  the last voyage i made before coming to this country wrote sir william willcocks at bagdad in 1911 was up the nile from khart√ªm to the great equatorial lakes in this most desperate and forbidden region i was filled with pride to think that i belonged to a race whose sons even in this inhospitable waste of waters were struggling in the face of a thousand discouragements to introduce new forest trees and new agricultural products and ameliorate in some degree the conditions of life of the naked and miserable inhabitants how should i have felt if in traversing the deserts and swamps which today represent what was the richest and most famous tract of the world i had thought that i was a scion of a race in whose hands god had placed for hundreds of years the destinies of this great country and that my countrymen could give no better account of their stewardship than the exhibition of two mighty rivers flowing between deserts to waste themselves in the sea for nine months in the year and desolating everything in their way for the remaining three no effort that turkey can makeshe was then still mistress of the saw√¢dcan be too great to roll away the reproach of these parched and weary lands whose cry ascends to heaven  turkey which claims the present in western asia is nothing but an overthrow of the past and an obstruction of the future     footnote 1 tekin alp the turkish and panturkish ideal weimar gustav

jewish colonisation in palestine was retarded because the leading french and british jews remained under the impression of the armenian massacres of 18957 as presented by the antiturkish french and

falling off in trade last year would have been greater still than it was if the economic penetration of palestine were not reinforced by an idealistic factor in the shape of zionism but he is piqued
