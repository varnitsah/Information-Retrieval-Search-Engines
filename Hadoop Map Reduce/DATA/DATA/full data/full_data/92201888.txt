    the fatal boots     januarythe birth of the year  some poet has observed that if any man would write down what has really happened to him in this mortal life he would be sure to make a good book though he never had met with a single adventure from his birth to his burial how much more then must i who have had adventures most singular pathetic and unparalleled be able to compile an instructive and entertaining volume for the use of the public  i dont mean to say that i have killed lions or seen the wonders of travel in the deserts of arabia or prussia or that i have been a very fashionable character living with dukes and peeresses and writing my recollections of them as the way now is i never left this my native isle nor spoke to a lord except an irish one who had rooms in our house and forgot to pay three weeks lodging and extras but as our immortal bard observes i have in the course of my existence been so eaten up by the slugs and harrows of outrageous fortune and have been the object of such continual and extraordinary illluck that i believe it would melt the heart of a milestone to read of itthat is if a milestone had a heart of anything but stone  twelve of my adventures suitable for meditation and perusal during the twelve months of the year have been arranged by me for this work they contain a part of the history of a great and confidently i may say a good man i was not a spendthrift like other men i never wronged any man of a shilling though i am as sharp a fellow at a bargain as any in europe i never injured a fellowcreature on the contrary on several occasions when injured myself have shown the most wonderful forbearance i come of a tolerably good family and yet born to wealthof an inoffensive disposition careful of the money that i had and eager to get morei have been going down hill ever since my journey of life began and have been pursued by a complication of misfortunes such as surely never happened to any man but the unhappy bob stubbs  bob stubbs is my name and i havent got a shilling i have borne the commission of lieutenant in the service of king george and am nowbut never mind what i am now for the public will know in a few pages more my father was of the suffolk stubbsesa welltodo gentleman of bungay my grandfather had been a respected attorney in that town and left my papa a pretty little fortune i was thus the inheritor of competence and ought to be at this moment a gentleman  my misfortunes may be said to have commenced about a year before my birth when my papa a young fellow pretending to study the law in london fell madly in love with miss smith the daughter of a tradesman who did not give her a sixpence and afterwards became bankrupt my papa married this miss smith and carried her off to the country where i was born in an evil hour for me  were i to attempt to describe my early years you would laugh at me as an impostor but the following letter from mamma to a friend after her marriage will pretty well show you what a poor foolish creature she was and what a reckless extravagant fellow was my other unfortunate parent   to miss eliza kicks in gracechurch street london  oh eliza your susan is the happiest girl under heaven my thomas is an angel not a tall grenadierlike looking fellow such as i always vowed i would marryon the contrary he is what the world would call dumpy and i hesitate not to confess that his eyes have a cast in them but what then when one of his eyes is fixed on me and one on my babe they are lighted up with an affection which my pen cannot describe and which certainly was never bestowed upon any woman so strongly as upon your happy susan stubbs  when he comes home from shooting or the farm if you could see dear thomas with me and our dear little bob as i sit on one knee and baby on the other and as he dances us both about i often wish that we had sir joshua or some great painter to depict the group for sure it is the prettiest picture in the whole world to see three such loving merry people  dear baby is the most lovely little creature that can possibly bethe very image of papa he is cutting his teeth and the delight of everybody nurse says that when he is older he will get rid of his squint and his hair will get a great deal less red doctor bates is as kind and skilful and attentive as we could desire think what a blessing to have had him ever since poor babys birth it has never had a day of quiet and he has been obliged to give it from three to four doses every weekhow thankful ought we to be that the dear thing is as well as it is it got through the measles wonderfully then it had a little rash and then a nasty hoopingcough and then a fever and continual pains in its poor little stomach crying poor dear child from morning till night  but dear tom is an excellent nurse and many and many a night has he had no sleep dear man in consequence of the poor little baby he walks up and down with it for hours singing a kind of song dear fellow he has no more voice than a teakettle and bobbing his head backwards and forwards and looking in his nightcap and dressinggown so droll oh eliza how you would laugh to see him  we have one of the best nursemaids in the worldan irishwoman who is as fond of baby almost as his mother but that can never be she takes it to walk in the park for hours together and i really dont know why thomas dislikes her he says she is tipsy very often and slovenly which i cannot conceiveto be sure the nurse is sadly dirty and sometimes smells very strong of gin  but what of thatthese little drawbacks only make home more pleasant when one thinks how many mothers have no nursemaids how many poor dear children have no doctors ought we not to be thankful for mary malowney and that dr batess bill is fortyseven pounds how ill must dear baby have been to require so much physic  but they are a sad expense these dear babies after all fancy eliza how much this mary malowney costs us ten shillings every week a glass of brandy or gin at dinner three pintbottles of mr thrales best porter every daymaking twentyone in a week and nine hundred and ninety in the eleven months she has been with us then for baby there is dr batess bill of fortyfive guineas two guineas for christening twenty for a grand christening supper and ball rich uncle john mortally offended because he was made godfather and had to give baby a silver cup he has struck thomas out of his will and old mr firkin quite as much hurt because he was not asked he will not speak to me or thomas in consequence twenty guineas for flannels laces little gowns caps napkins and such babys ware and all this out of 300l a year but thomas expects to make a great deal by his farm  we have got the most charming countryhouse you can imagine it is quite shut in by trees and so retired that though only thirty miles from london the post comes to us but once a week the roads it must be confessed are execrable it is winter now and we are up to our knees in mud and snow but oh eliza how happy we are with thomas he has had a sad attack of rheumatism dear man and little bobby and our kind friend dr bates who comes so far to see us i leave you to fancy that we have a charming merry party and do not care for all the gayeties of ranelagh  adieu dear baby is crying for his mamma a thousand kisses from your affectionate  susan stubbs   there it is doctors bills gentlemanfarming twentyone pints of porter a week in this way my unnatural parents were already robbing me of my property     februarycutting weather  i have called this chapter cutting weather partly in compliment to the month of february and partly in respect of my own misfortunes which you are going to read about for i have often thought that january which is mostly twelfthcake and holiday time is like the first four or five years of a little boys life then comes dismal february and the workingdays with it when chaps begin to look out for themselves after the christmas and the new years heyday and merrymaking are over which our infancy may well be said to be well can i recollect that bitter first of february when i first launched out into the world and appeared at doctor swishtails academy  i began at school that life of prudence and economy which i have carried on ever since my mother gave me eighteenpence on setting out poor soul i thought her heart would break as she kissed me and bade god bless me and besides i had a small capital of my own which i had amassed for a year previous ill tell you what i used to do wherever i saw six halfpence i took one if it was asked for i said i had taken it and gave it backif it was not missed i said nothing about it as why should ithose who dont miss their money dont lose their money so i had a little private fortune of three shillings besides mothers eighteenpence at school they called me the coppermerchant i had such lots of it  now even at a preparatory school a wellregulated boy may better himself and i can tell you i did i never was in any quarrels i never was very high in the class or very low but there was no chap so much respectedand why id always money the other boys spent all theirs in the first day or two and they gave me plenty of cakes and barleysugar then i can tell you id no need to spend my own money for they would insist upon treating me well in a week when theirs was gone and they had but their threepence a week to look to for the rest of the halfyear what did i do why i am proud to say that threehalfpence out of the threepence a week of almost all the young gentlemen at dr swishtails came into my pocket suppose for instance tom hicks wanted a slice of gingerbread who had the money little bob stubbs to be sure hicks i used to say ill buy you three halfporth of gingerbread if youll give me threepence next saturday and he agreed and next saturday came and he very often could not pay me more than threehalfpence then there was the threepence i was to have the next saturday ill tell you what i did for a whole halfyeari lent a chap by the name of dick bunting threehalfpence the first saturday for threepence the next he could not pay me more than half when saturday came and im blest if i did not make him pay me threehalfpence for threeandtwenty weeks running making two shillings and tenpencehalfpenny but he was a sad dishonorable fellow dick bunting for after id been so kind to him and let him off for threeandtwentyweeks the money he owed me holidays came and threepence he owed me still well according to the common principles of practice after sixweeks holidays he ought to have paid me exactly sixteen shillings which was my due for the       first week the 3d would be 6d  fourth week           4s      second week            1s  fifth week            8s      third week             2s  sixth week           16s  nothing could be more just and yetwill it be believed when bunting came back he offered me threehalfpence the mean dishonest scoundrel  however i was even with him i can tell youhe spent all his money in a fortnight and then i screwed him down i made him besides giving me a penny for a penny pay me a quarter of his bread and butter at breakfast and a quarter of his cheese at supper and before the halfyear was out i got from him a silver fruitknife a box of compasses and a very pretty silverlaced waistcoat in which i went home as proud as a king and whats more i had no less than three golden guineas in the pocket of it besides fifteen shillings the knife and a brass bottlescrew which i got from another chap it wasnt bad interest for twelve shillingswhich was all the money id had in the yearwas it heigho ive often wished that i could get such a chance again in this wicked world but men are more avaricious now than they used to be in those dear early days  well i went home in my new waistcoat as fine as a peacock and when i gave the bottlescrew to my father begging him to take it as a token of my affection for him my dear mother burst into such a fit of tears as i never saw and kissed and hugged me fit to smother me bless him bless him says she to think of his old father and where did you purchase it bobwhy mother says i i purchased it out of my savings which was as true as the gospelwhen i said this mother looked round to father smiling although she had tears in her eyes and she took his hand and with her other hand drew me to her is he not a noble boy says she to my father and only nine years oldfaith says my father he is a good lad susan thank thee my boy and here is a crownpiece in return for thy bottlescrewit shall open us a bottle of the very best too says my father and he kept his word i always was fond of good wine though never from a motive of proper selfdenial having any in my cellar and by jupiter on this night i had my little skinfulfor there was no stintingso pleased were my dear parents with the bottlescrew the best of it was it only cost me threepence originally which a chap could not pay me  seeing this game was such a good one i became very generous towards my parents and a capital way it is to encourage liberality in children i gave mamma a very neat brass thimble and she gave me a halfguinea piece then i gave her a very pretty needlebook which i made myself with an ace of spades from a new pack of cards we had and i got sally our maid to cover it with a bit of pink satin her mistress had given her and i made the leaves of the book which i vandyked very nicely out of a piece of flannel i had had round my neck for a sore throat it smelt a little of hartshorn but it was a beautiful needlebook and mamma was so delighted with it that she went into town and bought me a goldlaced hat then i bought papa a pretty china tobaccostopper but i am sorry to say of my dear father that he was not so generous as my mamma or myself for he only burst out laughing and did not give me so much as a halfcrown piece which was the least i expected from him i shant give you anything bob this time says he and i wish my boy you would not make any more such presentsfor really they are too expensive expensive indeed i hate meannesseven in a father  i must tell you about the silveredged waistcoat which bunting gave me mamma asked me about it and i told her the truththat it was a present from one of the boys for my kindness to him well what does she do but writes back to dr swishtail when i went to school thanking him for his attention to her dear son and sending a shilling to the good and grateful little boy who had given me the waistcoat  what waistcoat is it says the doctor to me and who gave it to you  bunting gave it me sir says i  call bunting and up the little ungrateful chap came would you believe it he burst into tearstold that the waistcoat had been given him by his mother and that he had been forced to give it for a debt to coppermerchant as the nasty little blackguard called me he then said how for threehalfpence he had been compelled to pay me three shillings the sneak as if he had been obliged to borrow the threehalfpencehow all the other boys had been swindled swindled by me in like mannerand how with only twelve shillings i had managed to scrape together four guineas      my courage almost fails me as i describe the shameful scene that followed the boys were called in my own little accountbook was dragged out of my cupboard to prove how much i had received from each and every farthing of my money was paid back to them the tyrant took the thirty shillings that my dear parents had given me and said he should put them into the poorbox at church and after having made a long discourse to the boys about meanness and usury he said take off your coat mr stubbs and restore bunting his waistcoat i did and stood without coat and waistcoat in the midst of the nasty grinning boys i was going to put on my coat  stop says he take down his breeches  ruthless brutal villain sam hopkins the biggest boy took them downhorsed meand i was flogged sir yes flogged o revenge i robert stubbs who had done nothing but what was right was brutally flogged at ten years of agethough february was the shortest month i remembered it long     marchshowery  when my mamma heard of the treatment of her darling she was for bringing an action against the schoolmaster or else for tearing his eyes out when dear soul she would not have torn the eyes out of a flea had it been her own injury and at the very least for having me removed from the school where i had been so shamefully treated but papa was stern for once and vowed that i had been served quite right declared that i should not be removed from school and sent old swishtail a brace of pheasants for what he called his kindness to me of these the old gentleman invited me to partake and made a very queer speech at dinner as he was cutting them up about the excellence of my parents and his own determination to be kinder still to me if ever i ventured on such practices again so i was obliged to give up my old trade of lending for the doctor declared that any boy who borrowed should be flogged and any one who paid should be flogged twice as much there was no standing against such a prohibition as this and my little commerce was ruined  i was not very high in the school not having been able to get farther than that dreadful propria quae maribus in the latin grammar of which though i have it by heart even now i never could understand a syllable but on account of my size my age and the prayers of my mother was allowed to have the privilege of the bigger boys and on holidays to walk about in the town great dandies we were too when we thus went out i recollect my costume very well a thunderandlightning coat a white waistcoat embroidered neatly at the pockets a lace frill a pair of kneebreeches and elegant white cotton or silk stockings this did very well but still i was dissatisfied i wanted a pair of boots three boys in the school had bootsi was mad to have them too  but my papa when i wrote to him would not hear of it and three pounds the price of a pair was too large a sum for my mother to take from the housekeeping or for me to pay in the present impoverished state of my exchequer but the desire for the boots was so strong that have them i must at any rate  there was a german bootmaker who had just set up in our town in those days who afterwards made his fortune in london i determined to have the boots from him and did not despair before the end of a year or two either to leave the school when i should not mind his dunning me or to screw the money from mamma and so pay him  so i called upon this manstiffelkind was his nameand he took my measure for a pair  you are a vary yong gentleman to wear dopboots said the shoemaker  i suppose fellow says i that is my business and not yours either make the boots or notbut when you speak to a man of my rank speak respectfully and i poured out a number of oaths in order to impress him with a notion of my respectability  they had the desired effect stay sir says he i have a nice littel pair of dopboots dat i tink will jost do for you and he produced sure enough the most elegant things i ever saw day were made said he for de honorable mr stiffney of de gards but were too small  ah indeed said i stiffney is a relation of mine and what you scoundrel will you have the impudence to ask for these things he replied three pounds  well said i they are confoundedly dear but as you will have a long time to wait for your money why i shall have my revenge you see the man looked alarmed and began a speech sarei cannot let dem go vidoutbut a bright thought struck me and i interruptedsir dont sir me take off the boots fellow and hark ye when you speak to a nobleman dont saysir  a hundert tousand pardons my lort says he if i had known you were a lort i vood never have called yousir vat name shall i put down in my books  nameoh why lord cornwallis to be sure said i as i walked off in the boots  and vat shall i do vid my lorts shoes  keep them until i send for them said i and giving him a patronizing bow i walked out of the shop as the german tied up my shoes in paper    this story i would not have told but that my whole life turned upon these accursed boots i walked back to school as proud as a peacock and easily succeeded in satisfying the boys as to the manner in which i came by my new ornaments  well one fatal monday morningthe blackest of all blackmondays that ever i knewas we were all of us playing between schoolhours i saw a posse of boys round a stranger who seemed to be looking out for one of us a sudden trembling seized mei knew it was stiffelkind what had brought him here he talked loud and seemed angry so i rushed into the schoolroom and burying my head between my hands began reading for dear life  i vant lort cornvallis said the horrid bootmaker his lortship belongs i know to dis honorable school for i saw him vid de boys at chorch yesterday  lord who  vy lort cornvallis to be surea very fat yong nobeman vid red hair he squints a little and svears dreadfully  theres no lord cornvallis here said one and there was a pause  stop i have it says that odious bunting it must be stubbs and stubbs stubbs every one cried out while i was so busy at my book as not to hear a word  at last two of the biggest chaps rushed into the schoolroom and seizing each an arm run me into the playgroundbolt up against the shoemaker  dis is my man i beg your lortships pardon says he i have brought your lortships shoes vich you left see dey have been in dis parcel ever since you vent avay in my boots  shoes fellow says i i never saw your face before for i knew there was nothing for it but brazening it out upon the honor of a gentleman said i turning round to the boys they hesitated and if the trick had turned in my favor fifty of them would have seized hold of stiffelkind and drubbed him soundly  stop says bunting hang him lets see the shoes if they fit him why then the cobblers right they did fit me and not only that but the name of stubbs was written in them at full length  vat said stiffelkind is he not a lort so help me himmel i never did vonce tink of looking at de shoes which have been lying ever since in dis piece of brown paper and then gathering anger as he went on he thundered out so much of his abuse of me in his germanenglish that the boys roared with laughter swishtail came in in the midst of the disturbance and asked what the noise meant  its only lord cornwallis sir said the boys battling with his shoemaker about the price of a pair of topboots  oh sir said i it was only in fun that i called myself lord cornwallis  in funwhere are the boots and you sir give me your bill my beautiful boots were brought and stiffelkind produced his bill lord cornwallis to samuel stiffelkind for a pair of bootsfour guineas  you have been fool enough sir says the doctor looking very stern to let this boy impose on you as a lord and knave enough to charge him double the value of the article you sold him take back the boots sir i wont pay a penny of your bill nor can you get a penny as for you sir you miserable swindler and cheat i shall not flog you as i did before but i shall send you home you are not fit to be the companion of honest boys  suppose we duck him before he goes piped out a very small voice the doctor grinned significantly and left the schoolroom and the boys knew by this they might have their will they seized me and carried me to the playground pump they pumped upon me until i was half dead and the monster stiffelkind stood looking on for the halfhour the operation lasted  i suppose the doctor at last thought i had had pumping enough for he rang the schoolbell and the boys were obliged to leave me as i got out of the trough stiffelkind was alone with me vell my lort says he you have paid something for dese boots but not all by jubider you shall never hear de end of dem and i didnt     aprilfooling  after this as you may fancy i left this disgusting establishment and lived for some time along with pa and mamma at home my education was finished at least mamma and i agreed that it was and from boyhood until hobbadyhoyhood which i take to be about the sixteenth year of the life of a young man and may be likened to the month of april when spring begins to bloomfrom fourteen until seventeen i say i remained at home doing nothingfor which i have ever since had a great tastethe idol of my mamma who took part in all my quarrels with father and used regularly to rob the weekly expenses in order to find me in pocketmoney poor soul many and many is the guinea i have had from her in that way and so she enabled me to cut a very pretty figure  papa was for having me at this time articled to a merchant or put to some profession but mamma and i agreed that i was born to be a gentleman and not a tradesman and the army was the only place for me everybody was a soldier in those times for the french war had just begun and the whole country was swarming with militia regiments well get him a commission in a marching regiment said my father as we have no money to purchase him up hell fight his way i make no doubt and papa looked at me with a kind of air of contempt as much as to say he doubted whether i should be very eager for such a dangerous way of bettering myself  i wish you could have heard mammas screech when he talked so coolly of my going out to fight what send him abroad across the horrid horrid seato be wrecked and perhaps drowned and only to land for the purpose of fighting the wicked frenchmento be wounded and perhaps kickkickkilled oh thomas thomas would you murder me and your boy there was a regular scene however it endedas it always didin mothers getting the better and it was settled that i should go into the militia and why not the uniform is just as handsome and the danger not half so great i dont think in the course of my whole military experience i ever fought anything except an old woman who had the impudence to hallo out heads up lobsterwell i joined the north bungays and was fairly launched into the world  i was not a handsome man i know but there was something about methats very evidentfor the girls always laughed when they talked to me and the men though they affected to call me a poor little creature squinteyes knockknees redhead and so on were evidently annoyed by my success for they hated me so confoundedly even at the present time they go on though i have given up gallivanting as i call it but in the april of my existencethat is in anno domini 1791 or soit was a different case and having nothing else to do and being bent upon bettering my condition i did some very pretty things in that way but i was not hotheaded and imprudent like most young fellows dont fancy i looked for beauty pishi wasnt such a fool nor for temper i dont care about a bad temper i could break any womans heart in two years what i wanted was to get on in the world of course i didnt prefer an ugly woman or a shrew and when the choice offered would certainly put up with a handsome goodhumored girl with plenty of money as any honest man would  now there were two tolerably rich girls in our parts miss magdalen crutty with twelve thousand pounds and to do her justice as plain a girl as ever i saw and miss mary waters a fine tall plump smiling peachcheeked goldenhaired whiteskinned lass with only ten mary waters lived with her uncle the doctor who had helped me into the world and who was trusted with this little orphan charge very soon after my mother as you have heard was so fond of bates and bates so fond of little mary that both at first were almost always in our house and i used to call her my little wife as soon as i could speak and before she could walk almost it was beautiful to see us the neighbors said  well when her brother the lieutenant of an india ship came to be captain and actually gave mary five thousand pounds when she was about ten years old and promised her five thousand more there was a great talking and bobbing and smiling between the doctor and my parents and mary and i were left together more than ever and she was told to call me her little husband and she did and it was considered a settled thing from that day she was really amazingly fond of me  can any one call me mercenary after that though miss crutty had twelve thousand and mary only ten five in hand and five in the bush i stuck faithfully to mary as a matter of course miss crutty hated miss waters the fact was mary had all the country dangling after her and not a soul would come to magdalen for all her 12000l i used to be attentive to her though as its always useful to be and mary would sometimes laugh and sometimes cry at my flirting with magdalen this i thought proper very quickly to check mary said i you know that my love for you is disinterestedfor i am faithful to you though miss crutty is richer than you dont fly into a rage then because i pay her attentions when you know that my heart and my promise are engaged to you  the fact is to tell a little bit of a secret there is nothing like the having two strings to your bow who knows thought i mary may die and then where are my 10000l so i used to be very kind indeed to miss crutty and well it was that i was so for when i was twenty and mary eighteen im blest if news did not arrive that captain waters who was coming home to england with all his money in rupees had been takenship rupees self and allby a french privateer and mary instead of 10000l had only 5000l making a difference of no less than 350l per annum betwixt her and miss crutty  i had just joined my regiment the famous north bungay fencibles colonel craw commanding when this news reached me and you may fancy how a young man in an expensive regiment and mess having uniforms and what not to pay for and a figure to cut in the world felt at hearing such news my dearest robert wrote miss waters will deplore my dear brothers loss but not i am sure the money which that kind and generous soul had promised me i have still five thousand pounds and with this and your own little fortune i had 1000l in the five per cents we shall be as happy and contented as possible  happy and contented indeed didnt i know how my father got on with his 300l a year and how it was all he could do out of it to add a hundred a year to my narrow income and live himself my mind was made up i instantly mounted the coach and flew to our villageto mr cruttys of course it was next door to doctor batess but i had no business there  i found magdalen in the garden heavens mr stubbs said she as in my new uniform i appeared before her i really did neversuch a handsome officerexpect to see you and she made as if she would blush and began to tremble violently i led her to a gardenseat i seized her handit was not withdrawn i pressed iti thought the pressure was returned i flung myself on my knees and then i poured into her ear a little speech which i had made on the top of the coach divine miss crutty said i idol of my soul it was but to catch one glimpse of you that i passed through this garden i never intended to breathe the secret passion oh no of course not which was wearing my life away you know my unfortunate preengagementit is broken and for ever i am freefree but to be your slaveyour humblest fondest truest slave and so on      oh mr stubbs said she as i imprinted a kiss upon her cheek i cant refuse you but i fear you are a sad naughty man      absorbed in the delicious reverie which was caused by the dear creatures confusion we were both silent for a while and should have remained so for hours perhaps so lost were we in happiness had i not been suddenly roused by a voice exclaiming from behind us  dont cry mary he is a swindling sneaking scoundrel and you are well rid of him  i turned round o heaven there stood mary weeping on doctor batess arm while that miserable apothecary was looking at me with the utmost scorn the gardener who had let me in had told them of my arrival and now stood grinning behind them imperence was my magdalens only exclamation as she flounced by with the utmost selfpossession while i glancing daggers at the spies followed her we retired to the parlor where she repeated to me the strongest assurances of her love  i thought i was a made man alas i was only an april fool     mayrestoration day  as the month of may is considered by poets and other philosophers to be devoted by nature to the great purpose of lovemaking i may as well take advantage of that season and acquaint you with the result of my amours  young gay fascinating and an ensigni had completely won the heart of my magdalen and as for miss waters and her nasty uncle the doctor there was a complete split between us as you may fancy miss pretending forsooth that she was glad i had broken off the match though she would have given her eyes the little minx to have had it on again but this was out of the question my father who had all sorts of queer notions said i had acted like a rascal in the business my mother took my part in course and declared i acted rightly as i always did and i got leave of absence from the regiment in order to press my beloved magdalen to marry me out of handknowing from reading and experience the extraordinary mutability of human affairs  besides as the dear girl was seventeen years older than myself and as bad in health as she was in temper how was i to know that the grim king of terrors might not carry her off before she became mine with the tenderest warmth then and most delicate ardor i continued to press my suit the happy day was fixedthe ever memorable 10th of may 1792 the weddingclothes were ordered and to make things secure i penned a little paragraph for the county paper to this effectmarriage in high life we understand that ensign stubbs of the north bungay fencibles and son of thomas stubbs of sloffemsquiggle esquire is about to lead to the hymeneal altar the lovely and accomplished daughter of solomon crutty esquire of the same place a fortune of twenty thousand pounds is we hear the ladys portion none but the brave deserve the fair    have you informed your relatives my beloved said i to magdalen one day after sending the above notice will any of them attend at your marriage  uncle sam will i dare say said miss crutty dear mammas brother  and who was your dear mamma said i for miss cruttys respected parent had been long since dead and i never heard her name mentioned in the family  magdalen blushed and cast down her eyes to the ground mamma was a foreigner at last she said  and of what country  a german papa married her when she was very youngshe was not of a very good family said miss crutty hesitating  and what care i for family my love said i tenderly kissing the knuckles of the hand which i held she must have been an angel who gave birth to you  she was a shoemakers daughter  a german shoemaker hang em thought i i have had enough of them and so broke up this conversation which did not somehow please me    well the day was drawing near the clothes were ordered the banns were read my dear mamma had built a cake about the size of a washingtub and i was only waiting for a week to pass to put me in possession of twelve thousand pounds in the five per cents as they were in those days heaven bless em little did i know the storm that was brewing and the disappointment which was to fall upon a young man who really did his best to get a fortune    oh robert said my magdalen to me two days before the match was to come off i have such a kind letter from uncle sam in london i wrote to him as you wished he says that he is coming down tomorrow that he has heard of you often and knows your character very well and that he has got a very handsome present for us what can it be i wonder  is he rich my souls adored says i  he is a bachelor with a fine trade and nobody to leave his money to  his present cant be less than a thousand pounds says i  or perhaps a silver teaset and some cornerdishes says she  but we could not agree to this it was too littletoo mean for a man of her uncles wealth and we both determined it must be the thousand pounds  dear good uncle hes to be here by the coach says magdalen let us ask a little party to meet him and so we did and so they came my father and mother old crutty in his best wig and the parson who was to marry us the next day the coach was to come in at six and there was the teatable and there was the punchbowl and everybody ready and smiling to receive our dear uncle from london  six oclock came and the coach and the man from the green dragon with a portmanteau and a fat old gentleman walking behind of whom i just caught a glimpsea venerable old gentleman i thought id seen him before    then there was a ring at the bell then a scuffling and bumping in the passage then old crutty rushed out and a great laughing and talking and how are you and so on was heard at the door and then the parlordoor was flung open and crutty cried out with a loud voice  good people all my brotherinlaw mr stiffelkind  mr stiffelkindi trembled as i heard the name  miss crutty kissed him mamma made him a curtsy and papa made him a bow and dr snorter the parson seized his hand and shook it most warmly then came my turn  vat says he it is my dear goot yong frend from doctor schvishentails is dis de yong gentlemans honorable moder mamma smiled and made a curtsy and dis his fader sare and madam you should be broud of soch a sonn and you my niece if you have him for a husband you vill be locky dat is all vat dink you broder croty and madame stobbs i ave made your sonns boots haha  my mamma laughed and said i did not know it but i am sure sir he has as pretty a leg for a boot as any in the whole county  old stiffelkind roared louder a very nice leg maam and a very sheap boot too vat did you not know i make his boots perhaps you did not know something else toopraps you did not know and here the monster clapped his hand on the table and made the punchladle tremble in the bowlpraps you did not know as dat yong man dat stobbs dat sneaking baltry squinting fellow is as vicked as he is ogly he bot a pair of boots

ave got five tousand pounds if you marry him i vill not give you a benny but look you what i will gif you i bromised you a bresent and i will give you dese  and the old monster produced those very boots which swishtail had made him take back    i didnt marry miss crutty i am not sorry for it though she was a nasty ugly illtempered wretch and ive always said so ever since  and all this arose from those infernal boots and that unlucky paragraph in the county paperill tell you how  in the first place it was taken up as a quiz by one of the wicked profligate unprincipled organs of the london press who chose to be very facetious about the marriage in high life and made all sorts of jokes about me and my dear miss crutty  secondly it was read in this london paper by my mortal enemy bunting who had been introduced to old stiffelkinds acquaintance by my adventure with him and had his shoes made regularly by that foreign upstart  thirdly he happened to want a pair of shoes mended at this particular period and as he was measured by the disgusting old highdutch cobbler he told him his old friend stubbs was going to be married  and to whom said old stiffelkind to a voman wit geld i vill take my oath  yes says bunting a country girla miss magdalen carotty or crotty at a place called sloffemsquiggle  shloffemschwiegel bursts out the dreadful bootmaker mein gott mein gott das geht nicht i tell you sare it is no go miss crotty is my niece i vill go down myself i vill never let her marry dat gootfornothing schwindler and tief such was the language that the scoundrel ventured to use regarding me     junemarrowbones and cleavers  was there ever such confounded illluck my whole life has been a tissue of illluck although i have labored perhaps harder than any man to make a fortune something always tumbled it down in love and in war i was not like others in my marriages i had an eye to the main chance and you see how some unlucky blow would come and throw them over in the army i was just as prudent and just as unfortunate what with judicious betting and horseswapping goodluck at billiards and economy i do believe i put by my pay every yearand that is what few can say who have but an allowance of a hundred a year  ill tell you how it was i used to be very kind to the young men i chose their horses for them and their wine and showed them how to play billiards or ecarte of long mornings when there was nothing better to do i didnt cheat id rather die than cheatbut if fellows will play i wasnt the man to say nowhy should i there was one young chap in our regiment of whom i really think i cleared 300l a year  his name was dobble he was a tailors son and wanted to be a gentleman a poor weak young creature easy to be made tipsy easy to be cheated and easy to be frightened it was a blessing for him that i found him for if anybody else had they would have plucked him of every shilling  ensign dobble and i were sworn friends i rode his horses for him and chose his champagne and did everything in fact that a superior mind does for an inferiorwhen the inferior has got the money we were inseparableshunting everywhere in couples we even managed to fall in love with two sisters as young soldiers will do you know for the dogs fall in love with every change of quarters  well once in the year 1793 it was just when the french had chopped poor louiss head off dobble and i gay young chaps as ever wore sword by side had cast our eyes upon two young ladies by the name of brisket daughters of a butcher in the town where we were quartered the dear girls fell in love with us of course and many a pleasant walk in the country many a treat to a teagarden many a smart ribbon and brooch used dobble and i for his father allowed him 600l and our purses were in common present to these young ladies one day fancy our pleasure at receiving a note couched thus   deer capting stubbs and dobblemiss briskets presents their compliments and as it is probble that our papa will be till twelve at the corprayshun dinner we request the pleasure of their company to tea   didnt we go punctually at six we were in the little backparlor we quaffed more bohea and made more love than half a dozen ordinary men could at nine a little punchbowl succeeded to the little teapot and bless the girls a nice fresh steak was frizzling on the gridiron for our supper butchers were butchers then and their parlor was their kitchen too at least old briskets wasone door leading into the shop and one into the yard on the other side of which was the slaughterhouse  fancy then our horror when just at this critical time we heard the shopdoor open a heavy staggering step on the flags and a loud husky voice from the shop shouting hallo susan hallo betsy show a light dobble turned as white as a sheet the two girls each as red as a lobster i alone preserved my presence of mind the backdoor says ithe dogs in the court say they hes not so bad as the man said i stop cries susan flinging open the door and rushing to the fire take this and perhaps it will quiet him  what do you think this was im blest if it was not the steak  she pushed us out patted and hushed the dog and was in again in a minute the moon was shining on the court and on the slaughterhouse where there hung the white ghastlylooking carcasses of a couple of sheep a great gutter ran down the courta gutter of blood the dog was devouring his beefsteak our beefsteak in silence and we could see through the little window the girls hustling about to pack up the supperthings and presently the shopdoor being opened old brisket entering staggering angry and drunk whats more we could see perched on a high stool and nodding politely as if to salute old brisket the feather of dobbles cocked hat when dobble saw it he turned white and deadly sick and the poor fellow in an agony of fright sunk shivering down upon one of the butchers cuttingblocks which was in the yard  we saw old brisket look steadily as steadily as he could at the confounded impudent pert waggling feather and then an idea began to dawn upon his mind that there was a head to the hat and then he slowly rose uphe was a man of six feet and fifteen stonehe rose up put on his apron and sleeves and took down his cleaver  betsy says he open the yard door but the poor girls screamed and flung on their knees and begged and wept and did their very best to prevent him open the yard door says he with a thundering loud voice and the great bulldog hearing it started up and uttered a yell which sent me flying to the other end of the courtdobble couldnt move he was sitting on the block blubbering like a baby  the door opened and out mr brisket came  to him jowler says he keep him jowlerand the horrid dog flew at me and i flew back into the corner and drew my sword determining to sell my life dearly  thats it says brisket keep him theregood doggood dog and now sir says he turning round to dobble is this your hat  yes says dobble fit to choke with fright  well then says brisket its myhicmy painful duty tohicto tell you that as ive got your hat i must have your headits painful but it must be done youd betterhicsettle yourself comcomfumarably against thathicthat block and ill chop it off before you can say jackhicno i mean jack robinson  dobble went down on his knees and shrieked out im an only son mr brisket ill marry her sir i will upon my honor sirconsider my mother sir consider my mother  thats it sir says brisket thats a goodhica good boyjust put your head down quietlyand ill have it offyes offas if you were louis the sixthe sixtixthe siktickleteenthill chop the other chap afterwards  when i heard this i made a sudden bound back and gave such a cry as any man might who was in such a way the ferocious jowler thinking i was going to escape flew at my throat screaming furious i flung out my arms in a kind of desperationand to my wonder down fell the dog dead and run through the body    at this moment a posse of people rushed in upon old brisketone of his daughters had had the sense to summon themand dobbles head was saved and when they saw the dog lying dead at my feet my ghastly look my bloody sword they gave me no small credit for my bravery a terrible fellow that stubbs said they and so the mess said the next day  i didnt tell them that the dog had committed suicidewhy should i and i didnt say a word about dobbles cowardice i said he was a brave fellow and fought like a tiger and this prevented him from telling tales i had the dogskin made into a pair of pistolholsters and looked so fierce and got such a name for courage in our regiment that when we had to meet the regulars bob stubbs was always the man put forward to support the honor of the corps the women you know adore courage and such was my reputation at this time that i might have had my pick out of half a dozen with three four or five thousand pounds apiece who were dying for love of me and my red coat but i wasnt such a fool i had been twice on the point of marriage and twice disappointed and i vowed by all the saints to have a wife and a rich one depend upon this as an infallible maxim to guide you through life its as easy to get a rich wife as a poor onethe same bait that will hook a fly will hook a salmon     julysummary proceedings  dobbles reputation for courage was not increased by the butchersdog adventure but mine stood very high little stubbs was voted the boldest chap of all the bold north bungays and though i must confess what was proved by subsequent circumstances that nature has not endowed me with a large or even i may say an average share of bravery yet a man is very willing to flatter himself to the contrary and after a little time i got to believe that my killing the dog was an action of undaunted courage and that i was as gallant as any of the one hundred thousand heroes of our army i always had a military tasteits only the brutal part of the profession the horrid fighting and blood that i dont like  i suppose the regiment was not very brave itselfbeing only militia but certain it was that stubbs was considered a most terrible fellow and i swore so much and looked so fierce that you would have fancied i had made half a hundred campaigns i was second in several duels the umpire in all disputes and such a crackshot myself that fellows were shy of insulting me as for dobble i took him under my protection and he became so attached to me that we ate drank and rode together every day his father didnt care for money so long as his son was in good companyand what so good as that of the celebrated stubbs heigho i was good company in those days and a brave fellow too as i should have remained but forwhat i shall tell the public immediately  it happened in the fatal year ninetysix that the brave north bungays were quartered at portsmouth a maritime place which i need not describe and which i wish i had never seen i might have been a general now or at least a rich man  the redcoats carried everything before them in those days and i such a crack character as i was in my regiment was very well received by the townspeople many dinners i had many teaparties many lovely young ladies did i lead down the pleasant countrydances  well although i had had the two former rebuffs in love which i have described my heart was still young and the fact was knowing that a girl with a fortune was my only chance i made love here as furiously as ever i shant describe the lovely creatures on whom i fixed whilst at portsmouth i tried more thanseveraland it is a singular fact which i never have been able to account for that successful as i was with ladies of maturer age by the young ones i was refused regular  but faint heart never won fair lady and so i went on and on until i had got a miss clopper a tolerable rich navycontractors daughter into such a way that i really dont think she could have refused me her brother captain clopper was in a line regiment and helped me as much as ever he could he swore i was such a brave fellow  as i had received a number of attentions from clopper i determined to invite him to dinner which i could do without any sacrifice of my principle upon this point for the fact is dobble lived at an inn and as he sent all his bills to his father i made no scruple to use his table we dined in the coffeeroom dobble bringing his friend and so we made a party carry as the french say some naval officers were occupied in a similar way at a table next to ours  welli didnt spare the bottle either for myself or for my friends and we grew very talkative and very affectionate as the drinking went on each man told stories of his gallantry in the field or amongst the ladies as officers will after dinner clopper confided to the company his wish that i should marry his sister and vowed that he thought me the best fellow in christendom  ensign dobble assented to this but let miss clopper beware says he for stubbs is a sad fellow he has had i dont know how many liaisons already and he has been engaged to i dont know how many women  indeed says clopper come stubbs tell us your adventures  psha said i modestly there is nothing indeed to tell i have been in love my dear boywho has notand i have been jiltedwho has not  clopper swore he would blow his sisters brains out if ever she served me so  tell him about miss crutty said dobble he he stubbs served that woman out anyhow she didnt jilt him ill be sworn  really dobble you are too bad and should not mention names the fact is the girl was desperately in love with me and had moneysixty thousand pounds upon my reputation well everything was arranged when who should come down from london but a relation  well and did he prevent the match  prevent ityes sir i believe you he did though not in the sense that you mean he would have given his eyesay and ten thousand pounds moreif i would have accepted the girl but i would not  why in the name of goodness  sir her uncle was a shoemaker i never would debase myself by marrying into such a family  of course not said dobble he couldnt you know well nowtell him about the other girl mary waters you know  hush dobble hush dont you see one of those naval officers has turned round and heard you my dear clopper it was a mere childish bagatelle  well but lets have it said clopperlets have it i wont tell my sister you know and he put his hand to his nose and looked monstrous wise  nothing of that sort clopperno nopon honorlittle bob stubbs is no libertine and the story is very simple you see that my father has a small place merely a few hundred acres at sloffemsquiggle isnt it a funny name hang it theres the naval gentleman staring againi looked terribly fierce as i returned this officers stare and continued in a loud careless voice well at this sloffemsquiggle there lived a girl a miss waters the niece of some blackguard apothecary in the neighborhood but my mother took a fancy to the girl and had her up to the park and petted her we were both youngandandthe girl fell in love with me thats the fact i was obliged to repel some rather warm advances that she made me and here upon my honor as a gentleman you have all the story about which that silly dobble makes such a noise  just as i finished this sentence i found myself suddenly taken by the nose and a voice shouting out  mr stubbs you are a liar and a scoundrel take this sirand this for daring to meddle with the name of an innocent lady  i turned round as well as i couldfor the ruffian had pulled me out of my chairand beheld a great marine monster six feet high who was occupied in beating and kicking me in the most ungentlemanly manner on my cheeks my ribs and between the tails of my coat he is a liar gentlemen and a scoundrel the bootmaker had detected him in swindling and so his niece refused him miss waters was engaged to him from childhood and he deserted her for the bootmakers niece who was richerand then sticking a card between my stock and my coatcollar in what is called the scruff of my neck the disgusting brute gave me another blow behind my back and left the coffeeroom with his friends  dobble raised me up and taking the card from my neck read captain waters clopper poured me out a glass of water and said in my ear if this is true you are an infernal scoundrel stubbs and must fight me after captain waters and he flounced out of the room  i had but one course to pursue i sent the captain a short and contemptuous note saying that he was beneath my anger as for clopper i did not condescend to notice his remark but in order to get rid of the troublesome society of these low blackguards i determined to gratify an inclination i had long entertained and make a little tour i applied for leave of absence and set off that very night i can fancy the disappointment of the brutal waters on coming as he did the next morning to my quarters and finding me gone ha ha  after this adventure i became sick of a military lifeat least the life of my own regiment where the officers such was their unaccountable meanness and prejudice against me absolutely refused to see me at mess colonel craw sent me a letter to this effect which i treated as it deservedi never once alluded to it in any way and have since never spoken a single word to any man in the north bungays     augustdogs have their days  see now what life is i have had illluck on illluck from that day to this i have sunk in the world and instead of riding my horse and drinking my wine as a real gentleman should have hardly enough now to buy a pint of ale ay and am very glad when anybody will treat me to one why why was i born to undergo such unmerited misfortunes  you must know that very soon after my adventure with miss crutty and that cowardly ruffian captain waters he sailed the day after his insult to me or i should most certainly have blown his brains out now he is living in england and is my relation but of course i cut the fellowvery soon after these painful events another happened which ended too in a sad disappointment my dear papa died and instead of leaving five thousand pounds as i expected at the very least left only his estate which was worth but two the land and house were left to me to mamma and my sisters he left to be sure a sum of two thousand pounds in the hands of that eminent firm messrs pump aldgate and co which failed within six months after his demise and paid in five years about one shilling and ninepence in the pound which really was all my dear mother and sisters had to live upon  the poor creatures were quite unused to money matters and would you believe it when the news came of pump and aldgates failure mamma only smiled and threw her eyes up to heaven and said blessed be god that we have still wherewithal to live there are tens of thousands in this world dear children who would count our poverty riches and with this she kissed my two sisters who began to blubber as girls always will do and threw their arms round her neck and then round my neck until i was half stifled with their embraces and slobbered all over with their tears  dearest mamma said i i am very glad to see the noble manner in which you bear your loss and more still to know that you are so rich as to be able to put up with it the fact was i really thought the old lady had got a private hoard of her own as many of them havea thousand pounds or so in a stocking had she put by thirty pounds a year as well she might for the thirty years of her marriage there would have been nine hundred pounds clear and no mistake but still i was angry to think that any such paltry concealment had been practisedconcealment too of my money so i turned on her pretty sharply and continued my speech you say maam that you are rich and that pump and aldgates failure has no effect upon you i am very happy to hear you say so maamvery happy that you are rich and i should like to know where your property my fathers property for you had none of your owni should like to know where this money lieswhere you have concealed it maam and permit me to say that when i agreed to board you and my two sisters for eighty pounds a year i did not know that you had other resources than those mentioned in my blessed fathers will  this i said to her because i hated the meanness of concealment not because i lost by the bargain of boarding them for the three poor things did not eat much more than sparrows and ive often since calculated that i had a clear twenty pounds a year profit out of them  mamma and the girls looked quite astonished when i made the speech what does he mean said lucy to eliza  mamma repeated the question my beloved robert what concealment are you talking of  i am talking of concealed property maam says i sternly  and do youwhatcan youdo you really suppose that i have concealedany of that blessed saaaaints propopopoperty screams out mamma robert says shebob my own darling boymy fondest best beloved now he is gone meaning my late governormore tearsyou dont you cannot fancy that your own mother who bore you and nursed you and wept for you and would give her all to save you from a moments harmyou dont suppose that she would cheeeeat you and here she gave a louder screech than ever and flung back on the sofa and one of my sisters went and tumbled into her arms and tother went round and the kissing and slobbering scene went on again only i was left out thank goodness i hate such sentimentality  cheeeeat me says i mocking her what do you mean then by saying youre so rich say have you got money or have you not and i rapped out a good number of oaths too which i dont put in here but i was in a dreadful fury thats the fact  so help me heaven says mamma in answer going down on her knees and smacking her two hands i have but a queen annes guinea in the whole of this wicked world  then what madam induces you to tell these absurd stories to me and to talk about your riches when you know that you and your daughters are beggars maambeggars  my dearest boy have we not got the house and the furniture and a hundred a year still and have you not great talents which will make all our fortunes says mrs stubbs getting up off her knees and making believe to smile as she clawed hold of my hand and kissed it  this was too cool you have got a hundred a year maam says iyou have got a house upon my soul and honor this is the first i ever heard of it and ill tell you what maam says i and it cut her pretty sharply too as youve got it youd better go and live in it ive got quite enough to do with my own house and every penny of my own income  upon this speech the old lady said nothing but she gave a screech loud enough to be heard from here to york and down she fellkicking and struggling in a regular fit    i did not see mrs stubbs for some days after this and the girls used to come down to meals and never speak going up again and stopping with their mother at last one day both of them came in very solemn to my study and eliza the eldest said robert mamma has paid you our board up to michaelmas  she has says i for i always took precious good care to have it in advance  she says robert that on michaelmas daywellwell go away robert  oh shes going to her own house is she lizzy very good shell want the furniture i suppose and that she may have too for im going to sell the place myself and so that matter was settled    on michaelmas dayand during these two months i hadnt i do believe seen my mother twice once about two oclock in the morning i woke and found her sobbing over my bedon michaelmasday morning eliza comes to me and says robert they will come and fetch us at six this evening well as this was the last day i went and got the best goose i could find i dont think i ever saw a primer or ate more hearty myself and had it roasted at three with a good pudding afterwards and a glorious bowl of punch heres a health to you dear girls says i and you ma and good luck to all three and as youve not eaten a morsel i hope you wont object to a glass of punch its the old stuff you know maam that that waters sent to my father fifteen years ago  six oclock came and with it came a fine barouche as i live captain waters was on the box it was his coach that old thief bates jumped out entered my house and before i could say jack robinson whipped off mamma to the carriage the girls followed just giving me a hasty shake of the hand and as mamma was helped in mary waters who was sitting inside flung her arms round her and then round the girls and the doctor who acted footman jumped on the box and off they went taking no more notice of me than if id been a nonentity  heres a picture of the whole businessmamma and miss waters are sitting kissing each other in the carriage with the two girls in the back seat waters is driving a precious bad driver he is too and im standing at the garden door and whistling that old fool mary malowney is crying behind the garden gate she went off next day along with the furniture and i to get into that precious scrape which i shall mention next     septemberplucking a goose  after my papas death as he left me no money and only a little land i put my estate into an auctioneers hands and determined to amuse my solitude with a trip to some of our fashionable wateringplaces my house was now a desert to me i need not say how the departure of my dear parent and her children left me sad and lonely  well i had a little ready money and for the estate expected a couple of thousand pounds i had a good militarylooking person for though i had absolutely cut the old north bungays indeed after my affair with waters colonel craw hinted to me in the most friendly manner that i had better resignthough i had left the army i still retained the rank of captain knowing the advantages attendant upon that title in a wateringplace tour  captain stubbs became a great dandy at cheltenham harrogate bath leamington and other places i was a good whist and billiard player so much so that in many of these towns the people used to refuse at last to play with me knowing how far i was their superior fancy my surprise about five years after the portsmouth affair when strolling one day up the high street in leamington my eyes lighted upon a young man whom i remembered in a certain butchers yard and elsewhereno other in fact than dobble he too was dressed en militaire with a frogged coat and spurs and was walking with a showylooking jewishfaced blackhaired lady glittering with chains and rings with a green bonnet and a birdofparadisea lilac shawl a yellow gown pink silk stockings and lightblue shoes three children and a handsome footman were walking behind her and the party not seeing me entered the royal hotel together  i was known myself at the royal and calling one of the waiters learned the names of the lady and gentleman he was captain dobble the son of the rich armyclothier dobble dobble hobble and co of pall mallthe lady was a mrs manasseh widow of an american jew living quietly at leamington with her children but possessed of an immense property theres no use to give ones self out to be an absolute pauper so the fact is that i myself went everywhere with the character of a man of very large means my father had died leaving me immense sums of money and landed estates ah i was the gentleman then the real gentleman and everybody was too happy to have me at table  well i came the next day and left a card for dobble with a note he neither returned my visit nor answered my note the day after however i met him with the widow as before and going up to him very kindly seized him by the hand and swore i wasas really was the casecharmed to see him dobble hung back to my surprise and i do believe the creature would have cut me if he dared but i gave him a frown and said  what dobble my boy dont you recollect old stubbs and our adventure with the butchers daughtersha  dobble gave a sickly kind of grin and said oh ah yes it isyes it is i believe captain stubbs  an old comrade madam of captain dobbles and one who has heard so much and seen so much of your ladyship that he must take the liberty of begging his friend to introduce him  dobble was obliged to take the hint and captain stubbs was duly presented to mrs manasseh the lady was as gracious as possible and when at the end of the walk we parted she said she hoped captain dobble would bring me to her apartments that evening where she expected a few friends everybody you see knows everybody at leamington and i for my part was well known as a retired officer of the army who on his fathers death had come into seven thousand a year dobbles arrival had been subsequent to mine but putting up as he did at the royal hotel and dining at the ordinary there with the widow he had made her acquaintance before i had i saw however that if i allowed him to talk about me as he could i should be compelled to give up all my hopes and pleasures at leamington and so i determined to be short with him as soon as the lady had gone into the hotel my friend dobble was for leaving me likewise but i stopped him and said mr dobble i saw what you meant just now you wanted to cut me because forsooth i did not choose to fight a duel at portsmouth now look you dobble i am no hero but im not such a coward as youand you know it you are a very different man to deal with from waters and i will fight this time  not perhaps that i would but after the business of the butcher i knew dobble to be as great a coward as ever lived and there never was any harm in threatening for you know you are not obliged to stick to it afterwards my words had their effect upon dobble who stuttered and looked red and then declared he never had the slightest intention of passing me by so we became friends and his mouth was stopped  he was very thick with the widow but that lady had a very capacious heart and there were a number of other gentlemen who seemed equally smitten with her look at that mrs manasseh said a gentleman it was droll he was a jew too sitting at dinner by me she is old and ugly and yet because she has money all the men are flinging themselves at her  she has money has she  eighty thousand pounds and twenty thousand for each of her children i know it for a fact said the strange gentleman i am in the law and we of our faith you know know pretty well what the great families amongst us are worth  who was mr manasseh said i  a man of enormous wealtha tobaccomerchantwest indies a fellow of no birth however and who between ourselves married a woman that is not much better than she should be my dear sir whispered he she is always in love now it is with that captain dobble last week it was somebody elseand it may be you next week ifha ha hayou are disposed to enter the lists i wouldnt for my part have the woman with twice her money  what did it matter to me whether the woman was good or not provided she was rich my course was quite clear i told dobble all that this gentleman had informed me and being a pretty good hand at making a story i made the widow appear so bad that the poor fellow was quite frightened and fairly quitted the field ha ha im dashed if i did not make him believe that mrs manasseh had murdered her last husband  i played my game so well thanks to the information that my friend the lawyer had given me that in a month i had got the widow to show a most decided partiality for me i sat by her at dinner i drank with her at the wellsi rode with her i danced with her and at a picnic to kenilworth where we drank a good deal of champagne i actually popped the question and was accepted in another month robert stubbs esq led to the altar leah widow of the late z manasseh esq of st kitts    we drove up to london in her comfortable chariot the children and servants following in a postchaise i paid of course for everything and until our house in berkeley square was painted we stopped at stevenss hotel    my own estate had been sold and the money was lying at a bank in the city about three days after our arrival as we took our breakfast in the hotel previous to a visit to mrs stubbss banker where certain little transfers were to be made a gentleman was introduced who i saw at a glance was of my wifes persuasion  he looked at mrs stubbs and made a bow perhaps it will be convenient to you to pay this little bill one hundred and fiftytwo pounds  my love says she will you pay thisit is a trifle which i had really forgotten  my soul said i i have really not the money in the house  vel denn captain shtubbsh says he i must do my dutyand arrest youhere is the writ tom keep the door my wife faintedthe children screamed and i fancy my condition as i was obliged to march off to a spunginghouse along with a horrid sheriffs officer     octobermars and venus in opposition  i shall not describe my feelings when i found myself in a cage in cursitor street instead of that fine house in berkeley square which was to have been mine as the husband of mrs manasseh what a placein an odious dismal street leading from chancery lane a hideous jew boy opened the second of three doors and shut it when mr nabb and i almost fainting had entered then he opened the third door and then i was introduced to a filthy place called a coffeeroom which i exchanged for the solitary comfort of a little dingy backparlor where i was left for a while to brood over my miserable fate fancy the change between this and berkeley square was i after all my pains and cleverness and perseverance cheated at last had this mrs manasseh been imposing upon me and were the words of the wretch i met at the tabledhote at leamington only meant to mislead me and take me in i determined to send for my wife and know the whole truth i saw at once that i had been the victim of an infernal plot and that the carriage the house in town the west india fortune were only so many lies which i had blindly believed it was true that the debt was but a hundred and fifty pounds and i had two thousand at my bankers but was the loss of her 80000l nothing was the destruction of my hopes nothing the accursed addition to my family of a jewish wife and three jewish children nothing and all these i was to support out of my two thousand pounds i had better have stopped at home with my mamma and sisters whom i really did love and who produced me eighty pounds a year  i had a furious interview with mrs stubbs and when i charged her the base wretch with cheating me like a brazen serpent as she was she flung back the cheat in my teeth and swore i had swindled her why did i marry her when she might have had twenty others she only took me she said because i had twenty thousand pounds i had said i possessed that sum but in love you know and war alls fair  we parted quite as angrily as we met and i cordially vowed that when i had paid the debt into which i had been swindled by her i would take my 2000l and depart to some desert island or at the very least to america and never see her more or any of her israelitish brood there was no use in remaining in the spunginghouse for i knew that there were such things as detainers and that where mrs stubbs owed a hundred pounds she might owe a thousand so i sent for mr nabb and tendering him a cheque for 150l and his costs requested to be let out forthwith here fellow said i is a cheque on childs for your paltry sum  it may be a sheck on shilds says mr nabb but i should be a baby to let you out on such a paper as dat  well said i childs is but a step from this you may go and get the cashjust give me an acknowledgment  nabb drew out the acknowledgment with great punctuality and set off for the bankers whilst i prepared myself for departure from this abominable prison  he smiled as he came in well said i you have touched your money and now i must tell you that you are the most infernal rogue and extortioner i ever met with  oh no mishter shtubbsh says he grinning still dere is som greater roag dan memosh greater  fellow said i dont stand grinning before a gentleman but give me my hat and cloak and let me leave your filthy den  shtop shtubbsh says he not even mistering me this time here ish a letter vich you had better read  i opened the letter something fell to the groundit was my cheque  the letter ran thus messrs child and co present their compliments to captain stubbs and regret that they have been obliged to refuse payment of the enclosed having been served this day with an attachment by messrs solomonson and co which compels them to retain captain stubbs balance of 2010l 11s 6d until the decision of the suit of solomonson v stubbs  fleet street  you see says mr nabb as i read this dreadful letteryou see shtubbsh dere vas two debtsa little von and a big von so dey arrested you for de little von and attashed your money for de big von  dont laugh at me for telling this story if you knew what tears are blotting over the paper as i write itif you knew that for weeks after i was more like a madman than a sane mana madman in the fleet prison where i went instead of to the desert island what had i done to deserve it hadnt i always kept an eye to the main chance hadnt i lived economically and not like other young men had i ever been known to squander or give away a single penny no i can lay my hand on my heart and thank heaven say no why why was i punished so  let me conclude this miserable history seven monthsmy wife saw me once or twice and then dropped me altogetheri remained in that fatal place i wrote to my dear mamma begging her to sell her furniture but got no answer all my old friends turned their backs upon me my action went against mei had not a penny to defend it solomonson proved my wifes debt and seized my two thousand pounds as for the detainer against me i was obliged to go through the court for the relief of insolvent debtors i passed through it and came out a beggar but fancy the malice of that wicked stiffelkind he appeared in court as my creditor for 3l with sixteen years interest at five per cent for a pair of topboots the old thief produced them in court and told the whole storylord cornwallis the detection the pumping and all  commissioner dubobwig was very funny about it so doctor swishtail would not pay you for the boots eh mr stiffelkind  no he said ven i asked him for payment dey was ordered by a yong boy and i ought to have gone to his schoolmaster  what then you came on a bootless errand ay sir a laugh  bootless no sare i brought de boots back vid me how de devil else could i show dem to you another laugh  youve never soled em since mr tickleshins  i never would sell dem i svore i never vood on porpus to be revenged on dat stobbs  what your wound has never been healed eh  vat do you mean vid your bootless

showed him up in a court of justice dat is vat i ave done and dats enough and then the old wretch went down whilst everybody was giggling and staring at poor meas if i was not miserable enough already  this seems the dearest pair of boots you ever had in your life mr stubbs said commissioner dubobwig very archly and then he began to inquire about the rest of my misfortunes  in the fulness of my heart i told him the whole of them how mr solomonson the attorney had introduced me to the rich widow mrs manasseh who had fifty thousand pounds and an estate in the west indies how i was married and arrested on coming to town and cast in an action for two thousand pounds brought against me by this very solomonson for my wifes debts  stop says a lawyer in the court is this woman a showy blackhaired woman with one eye very often drunk with three childrensolomonson short with red hair  exactly so said i with tears in my eyes  that woman has married three men within the last two years one in ireland and one at bath a solomonson is i believe her husband and they both are off for america ten days ago  but why did you not keep your 2000l said the lawyer  sir they attached it  oh well we may pass you you have been unlucky mr stubbs but it seems as if the biter had been bit in this affair  no said mr dubobwig mr stubbs is the victim of a fatal attachment     novembera general post delivery  i was a free man when i went out of the court but i was a beggari captain stubbs of the bold north bungays did not know where i could get a bed or a dinner  as i was marching sadly down portugal street i felt a hand on my shoulder and a rough voice which i knew well  vell mr stobbs have i not kept my promise i told you dem boots would be your ruin  i was much too miserable to reply and only cast my eyes towards the roofs of the houses which i could not see for the tears  vat you begin to gry and blobber like a shild you vood marry vood you and noting vood do for you but a vife

and boys used to laugh and call me general and lord cornwallis and all sorts of nicknames and old stiffelkind made a thousand new ones for me  one day i can recollectone miserable day as i was

been vid your old friend bunting and he has an uncle in the post office and he has got you de placeeighteen shillings a veek you rogue and your goat you must not oben any of de letters you know  and so it wasi robert stubbs esquire became the vile thing he nameda general postman    i was so disgusted with stiffelkinds brutal jokes which were now more brutal than ever that when i got my place in the post office i never went near the fellow again for though he had done me a favor in keeping me from starvation he certainly had done it in a very rude disagreeable manner and showed a low and mean spirit in shoving me into such a degraded place as that of postman but what had i to do i submitted to fate and for three years or more robert stubbs of the north bungay fencibles was  i wonder nobody recognized me i lived in daily fear the first year but afterwards grew accustomed to my situation as all great men will do and wore my red coat as naturally as if i had been sent into the world only for the purpose of being a lettercarrier  i was first in the whitechapel district where i stayed for nearly three years when i was transferred to jermyn street and duke streetfamous places for lodgings i suppose i left a hundred letters at a house in the latter street where lived some people who must have recognized me had they but once chanced to look at me  you see that when i left sloffemsquiggle and set out in the gay world my mamma had written to me a dozen times at least but i never answered her for i knew she wanted money and i detest writing well she stopped her letters finding she could get none from mebut when i was in the fleet as i told you i wrote repeatedly to my dear mamma and was not a little nettled at her refusing to notice me in my distress which is the very time one most wants notice  stubbs is not an uncommon name and though i saw mrs stubbs on a little bright brass plate in duke street and delivered so many letters to the lodgers in her house i never thought of asking who she was or whether she was my relation or not  one day the young woman who took in the letters had not got change and she called her mistress an old lady in a pokebonnet came out of the parlor and put on her spectacles and looked at the letter and fumbled in her pocket for eightpence and apologized to the postman for keeping him waiting and when i said never mind maam its no trouble the old lady gave a start and then she pulled off her spectacles and staggered back and then she began muttering as if about to choke and then she gave a great screech and flung herself into my arms and roared out my son my son  law mamma said i is that you and i sat down on the hall bench with her and let her kiss me as much as ever she liked hearing the whining and crying down comes another lady from up stairsit was my sister eliza and down come the lodgers and the maid gets water and what not and i was the regular hero of the group i could not stay long then having my letters to deliver but in the evening after mailtime i went back to my mamma and sister and over a bottle of prime old port and a precious good leg of boiled mutton and turnips made myself pretty comfortable i can tell you     decemberthe winter of our discontent  mamma had kept the house in duke street for more than two years i recollected some of the chairs and tables from dear old sloffemsquiggle and the bowl in which i had made that famous rumpunch the evening she went away which she and my sisters left untouched and i was obliged to drink after they were gone but thats not to the purpose  think of my sister lucys luck that chap waters fell in love with her and married her and she now keeps her carriage and lives in state near sloffemsquiggle i offered to make it up with waters but he bears malice and never will see or speak to mehe had the impudence too to say that he took in all letters for mamma at sloffemsquiggle and that as mine were all beggingletters he burned them and never said a word to her concerning them he allowed mamma fifty pounds a year and if she were not such a fool she might have had three times as much but the old lady was high and mighty forsooth and would not be beholden even to her own daughter for more than she actually wanted even this fifty pound she was going to refuse but when i came to live with her of course i wanted pocketmoney as well as board and lodging and so i had the fifty pounds for my share and eked out with it as well as i could  old bates and the captain between them gave mamma a hundred pounds when she left me she had the deuces own luck to be suremuch more than ever fell to me i know and as she said she would try and work for her living it was thought best to take a house and let lodgings which she did our first and second floor paid us four guineas a week on an average and the front parlor and attic made forty pounds more mamma and eliza used to have the front attic but i took that and they slept in the servants bedroom lizzy had a pretty genius for work and earned a guinea a week that way so that we had got nearly two hundred a year over the rent to keep house withand we got on pretty well besides women eat nothing my women didnt care for meat for days together sometimesso that it was only necessary to dress a good steak or so for me  mamma would not think of my continuing in the post office she said her dear robert her husbands son her gallant soldier and all that should remain at home and be a gentlemanwhich i was certainly though i didnt find fifty pounds a year very much to buy clothes and be a gentleman upon to be sure mother found me shirts and linen so that that wasnt in the fifty pounds she kicked a little at paying the washing too but she gave in at last for i was her dear bob you know and im blest if i could not make her give me the gown off her back fancy once she cut up a very nice rich black silk scarf which my sister waters sent her and made me a waistcoat and two stocks of it she was so very soft the old lady    id lived in this way for five years or more making myself content with my fifty pounds a year perhaps i had saved a little out of it but thats neither here nor there from years end to years end i remained faithful to my dear mamma never leaving her except for a month or so in the summerwhen a bachelor may take a trip to gravesend or margate which would be too expensive for a family i say a bachelor for the fact is i dont know whether i am married or notnever having heard a word since of the scoundrelly mrs stubbs  i never went to the publichouse before meals for with my beggarly fifty pounds i could not afford to dine away from home but there i had my regular seat and used to come home pretty glorious i can tell you then bed till eleven then breakfast and the newspaper then a stroll in hyde park or st jamess then home at halfpast three to dinnerwhen i jollied as i call it for the rest of the day i was my mothers delight and thus with a clear conscience i managed to live on    how fond she was of me to be sure being sociable myself and loving to have my friends about me we often used to assemble a company of as hearty fellows as you would wish to sit down with and keep the nights up royally never mind my boys i used to say send the bottle round mammy pays for all as she did sure enough and sure enough we punished her cellar too the good old lady used to wait upon us as if for all the world she had been my servant instead of a lady and my mamma never used she to repine though i often as i must confess gave her occasion keeping her up till four oclock in the morning because she never could sleep until she saw her dear bob in bed and leading her a sad anxious life she was of such a sweet temper the old lady that i think in the course of five years i never knew her in a passion except twice and then with sister lizzy who declared i was ruining the house and driving the lodgers away one by one but mamma would not hear of such envious spite on my sisters part her bob was always right she said at last lizzy fairly retreated and went to the waterssi was glad of it for her temper was dreadful and we used to be squabbling from morning till night  ah those were jolly times but ma was obliged to give up the lodginghouse at lastfor somehow things went wrong after my sisters departurethe nasty uncharitable people said on account of me because i drove away the lodgers by smoking and drinking and kicking up noises in the house and because ma gave me so much of her moneyso she did but if she would give it you know how could i help it heigho i wish id kept it  no such luck the business i thought was to last for ever but at the end of two years came a smashshut up shopsell off everything mamma went to the waterss and will you believe it the ungrateful wretches would not receive me that mary you see was so disappointed at not marrying me twenty pounds a year they allow it is true but whats that for a gentleman for twenty years i have been struggling manfully to gain an honest livelihood and in the course of them have seen a deal of life to be sure ive sold cigars and pockethandkerchiefs at the corners of streets ive been a billiardmarker ive been a director in the panic year of the imperial british consolidated mangle and drying ground company ive been on the stage for two years as an actor and about a month as a cad when i was very low ive been the means of giving to the police of this empire some very valuable information about licensed victuallers gentlemens carts and pawnbrokers names ive been very nearly an officer againthat is an assistant to an officer of the sheriff of middlesex it was my last place  on the last day of the year 1837 even that game was up its a thing that very seldom happened to a gentleman to be kicked out of a spunginghouse but such was my case young nabb who succeeded his father drove me ignominiously from his door because i had charged a gentleman in the coffeerooms sevenandsixpence for a glass of ale and bread and cheese the charge of the house being only six shillings he had the meanness to deduct the eighteenpence from my wages and because i blustered a bit he took me by the shoulders and turned me outme a gentleman and what is more a poor orphan  how i did rage and swear at him when i got out into the street there stood he the hideous jew monster at the double door writhing under the effect of my language i had my revenge heads were thrust out of every bar of his windows laughing at him a crowd gathered round me as i stood pounding him with my satire and they evidently enjoyed his discomfiture i think the mob would have pelted the ruffian to death one or two of their missiles hit me i can tell you when a policeman came up and in reply to a gentleman who was asking what was the disturbance said bless you sir its lord cornwallis move on boots said the fellow to me for the fact is my misfortunes and early life are pretty well knownand so the crowd dispersed  what could have made that policeman call you lord cornwallis and boots said the gentleman who seemed mightily amused and had followed me sir says i i am an unfortunate officer of the north bungay fencibles and ill tell you willingly for a pint of beer he told me to follow him to his chambers in the temple which i did a fivepair back and there sure enough i had the beer and told him this very story youve been reading you see he is what is called a literary manand sold my adventures for me to the booksellers hes a strange chap and says theyre moral    im blest if i can see anything moral in them im sure i ought to have been more lucky through life being so very wide awake and yet here i am without a place or even a friend starving upon a beggarly twenty pounds a yearnot a single sixpence more upon my honor
