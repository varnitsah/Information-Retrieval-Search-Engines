story is complete in itself but forms volume four in a line known by the general title of boy hunters series taking in adventures with rod rifle shotgun and camera in the field the forest and on river and lake both in winter and summer  my main object in writing this series of books is to acquaint lads with life in the open air and cause them to become interested in nature  in the first volume called four boy hunters i told how the youths organized their little club and went forth for a summer vacation in the second book guns and snowshoes i gave the particulars of a midwinter outing with its heavy falls of snow its blizzard and its most remarkable christmas in the wilds  with the coming of another summer the boys determined to go forth once more and what they did then has been told in the third book entitled young hunters of the lake  they had a glorious time in spite of some enemies who tried to do them harm and they settled the matter of certain ghost to their entire satisfaction  the settling of the ghost question took them home before the summer vacation was half over and then the boys began to wonder what they had best do next  but that question was soon answered by an announcement made by the father of one of the lads and once again they went forth this time however to the distant mountains here they hunted and fished to their hearts content and likewise took a large number of photographs some of the pictures causing them a good deal of trouble and peril to obtain  trusting that all boys who love to hunt and to fish and to take pictures with a camera will find this volume to their liking i remain your sincere friend captain ralph bonehill     chapter i  friends and enemies   come on shep  where are you going whopper  for a row on the river  ive been aching for a row for about a year  that suits me answered sheppard reed as he hopped down from the fence upon which he had been sitting  what about the others  snap said he would meet me at the dock continued frank dawson otherwise known as whopper  i dont know where giant is  i saw him about an hour ago  he was on an errand for his mothersaid he was going to perrys store  then we can look in perrys  if he isnt there ill run over to his house for him  its a grand day for a row  yes we must get him if we can went on sheppard reed thoughtfully ive got something to tell the crowd  to tell the crowd repeated frank dawson curiously  what  ill tell you when we are all together whopper  something about ham spink  i met him last night and we almost had a fight  oh that dude makes me sick  no this isnt about ham or any of that crowd  it concerns but ill tell you later and sheppard reed put on an air of great secrecy  all right  if you dont want to tell i suppose ill have to wait said whopper disappointedly  but you might tell me whats on your mind  i want to tell the whole crowd at once answered his chum  then nobody can say somebody else was told first  i see  well you go down to the dock and meet snap and ill hustle around and stir up giant went on frank dawson  i was going to have you all over to my house tonight to tell you explained sheppard  but i might as well speak of it when we are together on the river  say you must have something wonderful on your mind cried whopper im dying by inches to know what it is  ill find giant somehow and have him at the dock inside of a quarter of an hour sure  and away he ran on his errand while the youth who had the important announcement to make turned in the direction of the waterfront  to those who have read the former volumes in this boy hunters series the lads who have been speaking will need no further introduction  for the benefit of others let me state that sheppard reed was the son of a doctor who had a large practice in and around the town of fairview  shep as he was usually called was a bright and manly youth and one who loved life out of doors  frank dawson was a lad who had moved to the town some years before and by his winning manner had made himself many friends  the boy had a habit of exaggerating when telling anything and this had earned for him the nickname of whoppereven though frank never told anything in the shape of a deliberate falsehood  as some of his friends said you could tell franks whoppers a mile off which was a pretty stiff whopper in itself  these two boys had two close chums charley dodge usually called snapwhy nobody could telland will caslette known as giant because of his small stature  charley or snap as i shall call him was the son of one of the richest men of the district his father owning a part interest in a sawmill and a large summer hotel besides many acres of valuable forest and farm lands  giant was the son of a widow who had once been poor but was now in comfortable circumstances  though small for his age the lad was as manly as any of his chums and they thought the world of the little fellow  the town of fairview was a small but prosperous community located on the rocky river ten miles above a sheet of water known as lake cameron  the place boasted of a score of stores several churches a volunteer fire department and a railroad stationthe latter a spot of considerable activity during the summer months  all of the boys loved to camp out and about a year before this tale opens had organized an outing or gun club as related in detail in the volume called four boy hunters  they journeyed to the shores of lake cameron and then to another body of water called firefly lake and had plenty of fun and not a few adventures  during their outing they had considerable trouble with a dudish sportfrom town named hamilton spink and his cronies and were in great peril from a disastrous forest fire  when school opened the young hunters returned to their studies but with the approach of the winter holidays their thoughts turned again to the woods and water and once more they sallied forth as related in full in guns and snowshoes  they found game in plenty and also ran the perils of a great blizzard and got lost in the snow  shall we go out again was the question asked when the next summer vacation was at hand and all answered in the affirmative  this time as related in the volume called young hunters of the lake they ventured considerably farther from hometo the shore of a lake said to be visited by a muchdreaded ghost  there they again went hunting and fishing to their hearts content and once more had trouble with ham spink and his cronies  they saw the ghost and were at first badly scared but in the end solved the awful mystery by proving that the ghost was nothing but a mana relative of giant who had lost his mind and disappeared some time before  the man was restored to reason and through his testimony giants mother obtained some money which had been tied up in the courts  the finding of the man had brought the boy hunters back to fairview before their summer vacation was half finished  what to do next was the question  we ought to go somewherestaying at home is dead slow was the way one of the lads expressed himself but for a week or more nothing was done  whistling gaily to himself shep reed hurried down to the lake front as he came out on one of the docks he caught sight of snap surrounded by half a dozen other lads all carrying various bundles and all equipped with guns and fishingrods  ham spink and his cronies murmured the doctors son to himself wonder where they are bound  oh we are going to have the outing of our lives this trip ham spink was declaring in his usual lordly fashion  its going to be the finest outing ever started from this town  where are you going asked snap curiously  do you suppose we are going to tell you demanded another boy a lad named carl dudder not much  we dont want you to come sneaking after us to shoot the game that we stir up  we never sneaked after you cried snap rather indignantly  and we have always been able to stir up our own game  bah  i know better  of course they have taken our gamemore than once came from ham spink  and if they dont shoot our game they scare it off so that we dont have a chance to bring it down  what you say ham spink is absolutely untrue and you know it put in shep brushing through the crowd  we have never in our lives touched any game that was coming to you or your crowd  we  say do you want to fight cried ham spink working himself up into a quick passion and he doubled up his fists as he spoke  no but i can defend myself answered the doctors son just as quickly  i am not afraid of you  and we are not afraid of ghosts either was snaps sarcastic comment  these last words made ham spink and one or two of his cronies furious they had been up to the distant lake where the ghost had held forth and had been so badly frightened that they had come home on the run as whopper expressed it now that the matter had been fully explained ham and his followers felt decidedly sheepish over it consequently to mention the affair was as bad as to wave a red rag in front of a bull  you shut up about ghosts cried ham shaking his fist in snaps face  say ham let us give em a dressing down before we leave whispered carl dudder  he looked around the dock  nobody here but ourselves  thats the talk put in another of the spink crowd  they deserve it for trying to crow over us  shep and snap heard the talk and looked at each other  they endeavored to back away in the direction of the street but before they could accomplish this the entire spink crowd threw down their guns rods and bundles and advanced upon them  keep back cried the doctors son  if you hit us youll take the consequences added snap  an instant later ham spink and his cohorts closed in  snap and shep were caught front and back and several blows were quickly exchanged it was an uneven contest and the doctors son and his chum might have fared badly had not a sudden cry rang out  look at that giant  they are trying to maul snap and shep  the cry came from whopper  let up there added will caslette  and then as small as he was he ran out on the dock and toward the center of the melee  frank came with him and each caught one of the spink faction by the arm and swung him backward  good  here are the others panted shep  give it to em fellows they started it  the arrival of the pair somewhat disconcerted the spink crowd and they stopped fighting  they were still six to four but to handle four was only half as easy as to handle two  the others looked inquiringly at their leader  give it to em muttered ham but even as he spoke he edged to the upper end of the dock past giant and whopper  give it to em yourself murmured a follower who had received a blow in the eye  i guess i wont fight any more today  as quickly as it could be done whopper and giant ranged alongside of snap and the doctors son  they gazed defiantly at the crowd that confronted them  for a brief spell there was an ominous silence  say did we come here to fight or to start on our outing asked a lad of the spink crowd  he was tall and thin and evidently very nervous  he was a newcomer in the town and knew but little about the quarrels of bygone days  dont waste time here added another youth  we can finish with them when we come back  you are afraid now that we are four to six said snap  you were willing enough to pitch into shep and me when we were alone  oh give us a rest growled ham spink not knowing what else to say  he caught up the things he had been carrying  come on fellows he added and almost ran from the dock  with great rapidity for they were afraid snap and his chums would charge upon them the others of the spink coterie took up their guns rods and bundles and followed their leader  let us go after em cried whopper  we can knock them into the middle of next christmas and i know it  thats the talk cried the plucky giant  lets go and make mincemeat of em  and he started to follow those who had retreated  no use boys called out snap  come back  why not demanded whopper  they are going aboard the mary raymond  ham said so  there she is now with a lot of other passengers  see they are heading for that dock already  where are they going anyway asked giant as he halted  i know whispered whopper  just heard about it  they are going to camp out behind lake narsac in the windy mountains  the windy mountains ejaculated the doctors son in evident astonishment  did you say the windy mountains whopper  i did  why whats the matter shep  well if that dont beat the dutch  and then shep shook his head in a manner that indicated something did not suit him at all     chapter ii  another outing proposed   will you be so highly condescending and much obliging as to open the trapdoor of your mind and let us know what it is that beats the dutch demanded giant after he and his chums had looked at the doctors son for several seconds in silence  why yes of course answered shep  but erit all fits in with what i was going to tell you about in the first place  and that was burst out whopper eagerly  wait till we are out on the river away from the town folks  i dont want everybody to know our business  great scott but sheps got a secret burst out snap  what is ita treasure hunt or a new way to make diamonds  now quit fooling and come on out in the boat and youll soon know all about it replied the doctors son  then we have got to wait asked giant reproachfully  and when we are dying by inches to know added whopper  yes youve got to wait  so the sooner we get out on the river the betterif you are dying as you say responded the doctors son  while talking the four chums had been watching the departure of the ham spink crowd from another dock  soon the boat that carried the dudish bully and his cronies disappeared around a bend of the river  in a very few minutes shep and his chums had their rowboat out  they were used to rowing together and each took his accustomed place at the oars  shep gave the word and like clockwork four blades dropped into the water and the rowboat shot away from the dock  where shall we go asked giant  let us row over to lackneys orchard answered snap  dandy apples thereand mr lackney told me we could help ourselves  suits me cried whopper  id rather eat apples than go to a fire  us three can eat while shep does the spouting  humph perhaps id do a little eating myself came from the doctors son  it was an ideal day in midsummer and all of the lads were in the best of spirits  as they rowed along they discussed the encounter with the spink faction  i wish theyd leave us alone was sheps comment  i am getting so i fairly hate the sight of ham and carl dudder  so do i added whopper  but they dont intend to leave us alone and that is all there is to it  i am sorry they are going up into the windy mountains said shep it will and then he stopped short  say shep if you keep on like that well pitch you overboard cried whopper  if youve got anything to tell tell it or else keep still  wait till we get to lackneys orchard was all the doctors son would reply  they soon came to a bend in the river and crossing here drew up to a spot where some trees and bushes overhung the water  all leaped ashore and snap tied the craft fast to a stake  then the chums strolled up to some nearby apple trees selected some fruit that suited them and threw themselves on the ground to enjoy their feast  now we are ready to listen to your imperial majestys secret observed giant as he munched a juicy apple  yes let us in on it by all means added snap  and dont say its about lessons for the coming fall put in whopper with a mockserious look  lessons burst out giant  perish the thought  well to start with began the doctors son  how would you like to go camping again  fine  great  couldnt be better  just as i thought continued shep  and just what i told my father  he wants us to go out you know and sheps eyes began to twinkle  he wants us to go out asked whopper  you mean he is willing for you to go  no he told me to ask you if you wanted to go outfor him  mystery on mystery came from giant  for him  i dont understand  neither do i came simultaneously from snap and whopper  will its this way to tell you the whole story  can you keep a secret  of course  well then my father has become interested in a big land company that has procured a large reservation of land in and along the windy mountains  the company isnt going to do much with the reservation this year but next year it is going to build camps up by the lake and advertise it as a sort of private hunting and fishing resort they hope to get the better class of sportsmen up here from the cities and make considerable money  yes but how does that affect us asked giant impatiently  wait and youll see  my father says the success of the scheme will depend very largely on how it is presented to the public and he and two of the other men have decided to do some highclass advertising of the projectlittle booklets and folders and all that  these booklets and folders are to be filled with photoengravings showing the pretty spots in the mountains and also pictures of the animals and fish a sportsman can get  and does your father want us to get the photographs asked snap  thats itif we care to do it  he cant go out and neither can those other men and they dont know who to get  of course they could hire a professional photographer but he would only take scenery most likely while what my father wants particularly is pictures of good hunting and fishing and pictures of real camp life  he thinks we are just the boys to get the right kind of pictures  so we are if we had the right kind of cameras broke in whopper  yes give me a highclass camera and plenty of films or plates and ill take all the photos he wants added snap  i havent got to the end of my story yet resumed the doctors son  father knows that the picturesi mean the right kindwill be worth money and so he said if wed go out and do the very best we could about getting the photos he would furnish the cameras and plates and would pay all the expenses of the trip  whoop hurrah that suits me down to the ground cried whopper lets start tomorrowno this afternoon  offer accepted with pleasure came from giant  do you really think we can get the photographs your father wants shep asked snap  it wouldnt be fair to take the offer up and then disappoint him  he thinks we can do it  he says he will get us the proper outfit and before we start hell have a professional photographer who has made a study of landscapes give us pointers on how to get the best results  he knows we can take pretty good pictures already  in that case i say let us accept the offer by all means answered snap  how soon can we start demanded whopper  i asked my father that and he said most likely by next monday  he will want to give us all some instructions before we leave  and he wants us to read this book and shep drew a small volume from his pocket  what is it  a book on how to take the best photographs of wild animals  humph  its easy to get a pictureif you can find the animal was whoppers comment  this tells how to get a picture if you cant find the animal  what  exactly  here are diagrams showing how to rig up a camera and a flashlight so that if the animal comes along in the dark and shoves a certain string the light goes off and so does the camera and the picture is taken  if you want to you can bait the string  say thats great cried giant  id like to lay the game lowafter i had the picture was snaps comment  we can do that toosometimes  after that the doctors son gave his chums more details of what his parent had said  all the boys were sure they could go out again for their return home from their previous trip had not been expected by their parents  were you thinking we might meet ham spink and his crowd asked giant during a short lull in the talk  yes answered shep  and if we do theyll sure try to make trouble for us  i am not afraid of them said snap  if they dont keep their distance well  give em as good as they send finished whopper  but great caesars tombstone  just think of going camping again and in his joy the youth turned a handspring on the grass  as he arose giant threw an apple core that took him in the ear  then whopper threw a core in return hitting shep  a general fusillade of cores followed and the lads ended by chasing each other around the orchard  then they trooped back to the rowboat  shall we go and talk to your father asked snap on the way back  i think hed like it if you would answered the doctors son  ill see if he is disengaged  dr reed was busy with a lady caller and the boys had to wait a quarter of an hour  then he came into the sittingroom and shook hands warmly  so you are willing to undertake the commission to get pictures eh he said after a few words  well i am glad of it for i know you can do it if youll try  the outing ought to just suit you  it certainly will answered snap  ill get the cameras at once and likewise the other things  let me see what cameras have you now  the boys told him and he made some notes in a book  a general talk followed and the physician told the lads just what he would like best to have  he cautioned them to keep quiet concerning the land companys projects  we want to spring this on the general public as a surprise he explained  if we dont keep it quiet some other folks may try to get ahead of us  to my mind our section of the windy mountains is an ideal one for city sportsmen being wild and yet not too wild and having some charming spots for camping  and hunting and fishing ought to be good added whopper  ive heard jed sanborn say so  jed sanborn was an old hunter who knew every foot of territory for miles around the river and its lakes  i suppose we can take along the same general outfit we had before remarked whopper  i will get you a new and larger tent answered the doctor and a few other things i think you ought to have  can you go to rallings tomorrow  rallings asked several  yes  i will pay your way  i want you to go to visit mr jally the photographer  he is the one to give you a few lessons in photography  the boys could all go and it was decided to visit railings early in the morning  the physician said he would give his son a letter of instructions for the photographer  it would be a good thing if you could stay overnight said dr reed  then you could have two days instructions instead of one you could stay at my sisters house  that would be jolly cried shep  he loved his aunt and knew she would make him and his chums welcome  i guess i can stayanyway ill find out answered snap and giant and whopper said the same  little did any of the boys dream of what strange happenings that visit to railings was to bring forth     chapter iii  a lesson in photography   by consulting a timetable the boys found that a train for railings left at ten minutes after eight in the morning  the distance to the city was thirtythree miles and the run on the country railroad took the best part of an hour and a quarter  snap whopper and giant were on hand ten minutes before train time they found the doctors son ahead of them and he had tickets for all  well how did you make out at home was the question asked by several and then it was learned that all had had an easy time of it persuading their parents to let them go on the proposed outing to the windy mountains  my folks told me to beware of ghosts said snap with a grin  we neednt beware if the ghost turns out to be like that other answered giant  my folks told me to keep out of trouble especially with ham spinks crowd said whopper  say fellows i reckon you have forgotten something said shep  forgotten something queried whopper  exactly  what  theres a circus at rallingstoday and tomorrow  why so there is exclaimed giant  how queer we didnt remember it before  cassos united railroad shows  do you suppose it is worth going to see  i dont know  but as the admission is only twentyfive cents we might take it inif we get the chance  oh let us take it in by all means pleaded whopper  why im dying to see the elephants and acrobats and all that  seems to me youre dying pretty often lately answered snap with a smile  you ought to become a dyer by trade  and then he ducked as whopper made a playful pass at his head  when the train came along the lads found it well filled mostly with country folks going to railings to see the circus  they had to stand up part of the distance to the city  maybe the photographer will be so busy he wont want to bother giving us lessons said snap  maybe answered the doctors son  well have to take our chances  reaching rallings the boys hurried at once to the studio of the photographer  they found mr jally taking a family group of father mother and three sons and had to wait until the sitting was over while they waited they watched the crowds on the street  going to be plenty of folks here to see the circus was snaps comment and his words proved true folks flocking in from every quarter of the surrounding districts  when mr jally was at liberty he read dr reeds letter with interest  the doctor mentioned this to me when he was in rallings last saturday said the photographer  i said id do what i could for you lads  i am sorry it is circus day as i am likely to be busy but ill give you all the time i can spare  we can come tomorrow too said shep  we are going to stay in rallings over night  good  i think i can give you quite a few pointers in that time  i believe you all know something about photographs already  yes here are some of our snapshots said the doctors son and he brought forth the pictures the boys had taken on their various outings  these are not bad pronounced the photographer after an examination some of them are very good  they indicate that you have it in you to take some good pictures  and then he went over the prints carefully one by one telling them which seemed to be under exposed and which over and which had not been properly developed and printed then he went into the question of grouping and centering and focusing and told them how best to time their exposures  he was interrupted twice by girls who wanted their pictures taken and then he told them a great deal about the values of lights and shades and about suitable backgrounds  then he brought forth an album of outdoor views and told them to study what was written under each picture  there is the time of day and the day of the month he said and also the condition of the weather  these figures show the stop of the shutter and these the length of the exposure  have you a timecard for exposures  no but we are going to get one answered shep  they are quite valuable but even with a card one must often use his own judgment as to just what stop to use and how much time if you are particularly anxious about a picture you had better take two or three exposures of it instead of only one  even the best of photographers occasionally fail to get good results on a first trial  after that mr jally brought forth several cameras he had used in outdoor work and explained how they might be used to the best advantage in taking different kinds of pictures and under various conditions  strange as it may seem he said no two scenes can be handled alike  in one the background may be very light and in the other very dark  one day the atmosphere may be very clear the next it may be very dense  yes we know that and we have found out that clouds over the sun make a big difference said snap  the boys spent the balance of the morning and nearly all of the afternoon with the photographer and learned many things of which they had been formerly ignorant  he recommended that they purchase and study several books on photography and this they agreed to do  i see by the letter that dr reed wishes me to pick out your cameras said mr jally  i am going to the city saturday and will get them and leave them at the doctors house saturday evening  and will you get the films and plates and other things too questioned whopper  yes  the doctor wants a complete outfit including a daylight developing tank and all the chemicals for developing and printing then you can see what your pictures look like before you leave camp and if a picture doesnt suit you can take it over again  not if its a wild beast answered giant with a grin  in the case of wild animals you had better save your films or plates until you get home  developing in camp is not conducive to the best work and you might lose the very film or plate you wanted the most  yes i know something about that said whopper  i once took a beautiful pictureat least i thought it was beautifulof a flock of sheep and when i tried to develop the plate in a hurry i got one end lightstruck so it was no good  yes and once when i was in a hurry to develop a roll of films i had of a military parade said snap i got the hypo in the tank instead of the developing solution and that was the end of that roll  this is a good rule to remember said the photographer  never open the shutter of your camera until you are certain you are ready to take the picture and never attempt to develop a plate or a film until you are sure your chemicals are properly mixed and until you are sure you have everything at hand with which to work and until you are sure the plate or film is properly protected from the light  the boys were surprised when mr jally announced that it was supper time and that he must go home  gracious  and i told my aunt wed be to supper by six oclock exclaimed shep  well have to leg it to her house  come again tomorrow at nine oclock said the photographer and this the chums promised to do  well ive learned a whole lot today said snap as they walked along  i am sure i can take a much better picture than formerly  and ive learned one little lesson came from whopper  after this i am not going to take so many snapshots of landscapes  i am going to take time exposures and put my camera on a tripod and study the scene through the ground glass to get the best view possible  mrs carson the doctors sister had given the boys their dinner and now she had supper on the table waiting for them  their experiments of the afternoon had made them hungry and all pitched in with a vigor that made the good woman smile  what do you intend to do this evening she asked  we are going to the circus aunt jennie answered shep  father said we might go  i thought as much  dont stay out too late  well come home as soon as the show is over  well if it gets too late ill put the key out for youunder the frontdoor mat said mrs carson  i fancy you can find your way to your rooms  certainly answered snap  you neednt stay up for us aunt jennie said shep who knew his relative was in the habit of retiring early  i am not going to bed so very early shep  i am afraid some of those tramps who follow the circus will come and rob me  i heard the town was full of the goodfornothings  you had better lock up good after we are gone said giant  no fear but what ill do that answered mrs carson  well try not to wake you up when we come in aunty  ill hear you never fear  and shep if you are hungry when you get back youll find a jar of cookies in the pantry and a pitcher of milk in the icebox  good for you cried the doctors son and he ran around the table and gave his aunt a hug and a kiss  you know what boys like dont you  the four chums were soon on their way to the circus grounds located on the outskirts of railings  here they found erected a large main tent and several smaller ones all lit up by numerous gasolene torches  at one side of the main tent was a side show with numerous pictures hung between high poles  near the entrance to the big show was a ticket wagon and here a long line of people were awaiting their turns to get the bits of pasteboard which would admit them to the wonders under the canvases  going to have a big crowd and no mistake observed snap as he looked at the folks flocking to the circus grounds  i heard they had a big crowd this afternoon too said giant  they had a big crowd and a big fight said a man standing near  a fight queried whopper  yes  its a wonder somebody wasnt killed  what was the fight about questioned the doctors son  why it seems the head boss of the show discharged four of the wagon drivers for drunkenness  the fellows wanted their full months wages and the boss wouldnt give it to them  then they got ugly and commenced to tamper with some of the animals  the boss called some of his other men and all hands had a big fight right in the menagerie tent  one boy who was looking on got hit with a club and a lady fainted and they almost had a panic then the police took a hand and one of the fellows who was discharged was arrested the other three got away  yes and those other three men say they are coming back said a farmer who stood near and who had overheard the conversation  i saw them at supper time back of lums hotel  they say they are going to get square on the circus boss even if they have to break up the whole show to do it  i hope they dont come back tonight said snap  i dont want to get mixed up in any quarrel  me either answered the farmer  i want to see the show and thats all  i dont think theyll come back said the first man who had spoken if they did the police would arrest them on sight  theyll go to the next town and lay for the circus there  by this time the boys had worked their way up to the ticket wagon each purchased a ticket of admission and a moment later all passed on to the inside of the main tent     chapter iv  what happened at the circus   the lads had not seen a circus for two years consequently the show had much of the air of novelty about it for them  they spent half an hour in the menagerie tent inspecting the wild animals and then took seats in the main tent as close to the rings as they could get  cassos united railroad shows was quite an affair and the performance was given in two rings at a time as well as upon a trapeze in the air between the tent poles  first there was the usual procession of horses and riders elephants and camels ponies and carts and racing chariots and then came the acts all of more or less thrilling interest  there were six clowns and they kept the audience in a roar of laughter  say this is an allright show remarked giant after witnessing some particularly thrilling bareback riding  i wouldnt try to do that trick on horseback for a thousand dollars  here come the acrobats said snap as four bespangled performers ran into the rings and bowed and kissed their hands  then the acrobats climbed up to two bars and did various turns all more or less hazardous  here comes a boy cried shep as another performer stepped into one of the rings and bowed  just look how thin and pale he is whispered the doctors son who sat not far away from the youthful acrobat  looks as if he had had a spell of sickness added giant  the youthful acrobat did look as if he had been sick and was not yet entirely over it  he walked slowly over to one of the ropes and grasped it in his thin white hands  ii cant go up mr jones the chums heard him whisper to the ringmaster  yes you canand will or ill cut you with the whip was the ringmasters harsh answer and he cracked his lash loudly  iim not well enough yetmy head is dizzy pleaded the young acrobat  up you go snarled the ringmaster and cracked his whip in such a fashion that the end of the lash took the young acrobat in the calf of the leg causing him to cry with pain  what an outrage whispered snap clenching his fists  that ringmaster ought to be cowhided  painfully the young acrobat started to pull himself up on the rope the ringmaster glared at him and then cracked his whip once more taking the young performer in the arm  shame  shame cried snap and shame added the other boys quickly  shut up you boys growled the ringmaster turning quickly  then let that boy alone answered snap loudly  if you dont shut up ill have you put out roared the ringmaster  the young acrobat had climbed the rope a distance of ten feet  now he appeared to grow dizzy and of a sudden he lost his grip and fell in a heap in the sawdust ring  you rat you ill fix you hissed the ringmaster  what do we pay you for anyway  he raised his long lash again but before he could bring it down snap and shep leaped from their seats quickly followed by giant and whopper and two welldressed men  dont you hit that boy cried snap loudly  dont you do it  thats rightlet the kid alone added one of the welldressed men  go back to your seatsthis is none of your affair growled the ringmaster  it is our affair put in the doctors son  that boy is sickeverybody can see it  he cant perform  he purposely spoke in a loud voice so that many heard him  at once a murmur arose on all sides  thats rightthe kid is sicktake him out of the ring  its an outrage to try to make him perform  the society for the prevention of cruelty to children ought to look into this  half a hundred men and boys stepped up to the ring and for a few minutes the discussion waxed warm  in the meantime the young acrobat arose unsteadily to his feet  he was so weak he could hardly stand  get back to the dressingroom and be quick about it growled the ringmaster to him  ill settle with you for this later  down that ringmaster  give him his own lash came from a burly farmer  well teach him to abuse a boy as is sick  this cry was taken up by several  growing alarmed the ringmaster took to his heals and disappeared in the direction of the dressingtent whence his young victim had already gone  then the band struck up and the manager of the show sent out the clowns to do an extra stunt to quiet the audience  im afraid that ringmaster will have it in for that boy said snap to his chums  poor boy murmured the doctors son  he didnt look as if he was used to this hard life  i wish we could do something for him  let us try to look into the dressingroom and see what is going on suggested snap  the four boys watched their chance and walking around the main tent crawled under some slanting seats and then got close to the canvas that divided the main tent from that used by the performers in making up  grandy you must know what became of the little rascal they heard the ringmaster say  he came in here  so he did sir was the answer of a canvasman  but he didnt stay he just caught up some clothing and dusted  what  ran away  he dusted  i dont know where he went  humph  he wouldnt dare to run away  if he tries that game ill take his hide off when  i catch him  he couldnt run very far mr joneshe was too weak  bah  he isnt sick  he wants to shirk his act thats all  just wait till i get hold of himill teach him to get me into hot water with the audience fumed the ringmaster  well i dont know where he went answered the canvasman and resumed his work on the wall of the menagerie tent  then the ringmaster walked to another part of the dressingtent to put on his street clothing for he did not dare appear in the ring again at that performance  i hope that boy did run away said snap as he and his friends turned back to look at the rest of the performance  i dont see why such a nice looking lad should travel with such a crowd as this  oh i suppose some of the circus folks are good people answered whopper  but not that ringmaster  he ought to be tarred and feathered and id like to help do it came from giant  wonder who the boy is asked shep  he is down on the bills as master buzz the human fly  of course buzz isnt his real name  no  it is more likely to be smith or jones answered whopper  id like to see him and have a talk with him  perhaps well get a chance tomorrow  the circus is to stay two days you know said snap  maybe the boy is all alone said shep  if he is it might be that he would like it first rate if we would help him  the boys had lost interest in the show and were not sorry when it came to an end  they were among the first out and hurried directly toward mrs carsons house  in doing this they had to cross the railroad track and here a passing freight train held them up the freight came to a halt and backed to take on some empties then it proceeded slowly on its way  well i never cried snap suddenly as one of the empty cars came into view under the rays of an electric light  look there  he pointed to the open doorway of a car  a figure stood there wrapped in a coat several sizes too large for itthe figure of a slender boy with a whitish face  was that that boy acrobat gasped whopper as the freight train gathered headway and cleared the crossing  i think it was answered snap  so do i put in the doctors son  if it was he is losing no time in getting out of town was giants comment  and i dont blame him  he had on a coat big enough for a man and his trousers were rolled up around his feet observed snap  most likely he grabbed up the first suit he could find when he left the dressingtent  if it really was the boy said whopper  it looked like him but we may be mistaken  it did not take the four youths long to reach mrs carsons home they went in softly and each got a cookie and a drink of milk then they went to bed and slept soundly until morning  promptly on time they presented themselves at mr jallys studio and found not only the photographer but also an assistant present  i am going to leave my assistant in charge said mr jally  ill go out with you and well have a practical lesson in getting outdoor views  taking two cameras with them the photographer and the boys started off to be gone until noon  they walked across the city and along the river and at the latter locality took half a dozen pictures mr jally instructing them all the while  now ill show you how a commonplace bit of scenery can be made to look quite romantic said mr jally presently  let us walk over to the railroad embankment  such an embankment is not pretty in itself but i think we can get quite a pretty view of it  after many instructions they took a view of the embankment  their walk had tired the photographer who was rather stout and he proposed that they rest  near at hand was a section shed with some lumber piles and there they took it easy  during a lull in the conversation the boys noticed three men approaching  they were rather toughlooking characters and at first the lads took them to be tramps  the men walked behind the lumber piles without noticing our friends  some fellows that followed up the circus i suppose said snap  yes the kind my aunt was afraid of added the doctors son  we can do it jest as well as not they heard one of the men say an we got a right too  sure we got a right said another of the trio in a heavy rasplike voice  well show casso what it means to do a feller out o his lawful wages  yes but you look out you aint caught added the third man  hes got all hands watching to spot us  well bust up his show see if we dont growled the first speaker  they must be the fellows who were discharged for drunkenness whispered snap  yes and they are laying plans to square up with the proprietor added whopper  wonder what they will do  if they are up to anything unlawful they ought to be exposed was mr jallys comment  he too had heard of the quarrel of the afternoon before  i dont care to put myself out to help that circus man said snap  he is responsible for what happened to that sick boy  at the same time i know two wrongs dont make a right  the men continued to talk but in such low tones that the others could only catch a word or two  something was said about a lion and a chimpanzee and a toolhouse but the boys could not imagine what the circus men had in mind to do  presently one of the circus men got up from his seat and walked around the lumber piles  when he saw the boys and mr jally he uttered a whistle of surprise  then he turned back to his companions and all three of the men hurried away into the woods skirting the railroad tracks     chapter v  something about a lion   they are certainly up to something was snaps comment  yes and id give something to know just what it is added the doctors son  having rested mr jally took the boys to the bank of the river and there showed them how to make a good picture with a strong reflection in the water  this was rather difficult because of the distribution of light over the plate  be careful when you point your camera toward the sun said the photographer  otherwise you may get a sunspot or ghost right in the center of your picture  i know about that said whopper  once i tried to take a picture of my cousin standing by a well  the glare of the sun got on the plate just where her head ought to have been so she was headless  that sure was a ghost cried shep and then all laughed  the boys were to take the seven oclock train back to fairview so at five oclock they bid farewell to mr jally and walked toward mrs carsons house to get supper  just as they turned the corner of a street close to the house they heard a man yelling wildly  he was running rapidly at the same time  whats that fellow saying asked whopper  maybe its a fire  no he didnt say fire returned snap  it sounded to me like lion  lion questioned whopper  look out for the lion bawled the man  look out for the lion and down the street he went on the doublequick  he did say lion exclaimed giant  one of the circus lions must have gotten free burst out the doctors son  or else those circus men let him loose returned snap  dont you remember they said something about a lion  so they did  others were now taking up the cry and in a very few minutes men women and children were hurrying in all directions to get out of the way of the beast  some said it was one lion and some said five or six and everybody was thoroughly scared  well be eat up alive shrieked one lady  come bess  and she took her little girl by the hand and ran for home slamming and locking the door after her  soon everybody was running for shelter and in a twinkling the doors of stores and houses were tightly closed and windows followed the majority of the people went to the upper floors of their dwellings and peered forth anxiously to catch sight of whatever might be roaming the streets waiting to devour them  if a lion is really at large it will certainly make things interesting observed snap  but maybe its only a scare  i hope it is answered giant  excuse me from brushing up against a real bloodthirsty lion  and he moved toward the carson home the others following  what is it boys asked sheps aunt coming out on the piazza  what is all the noise about  they say a lion got loose from the circus answered her nephew  mercy on us ejaculated the lady and turned pale  come in the house this minute before you are all eat up  we dont know if it is true or not said snap  better not take any chances answered mrs carson  i once heard of a lion getting loose from central park in new york city and eating up five school children  yes father tells that story too answered shep  but it was all a newspaper hoaxit never happened aunty  well come in and well close the doors and windows  as much to please the lady as anything the boys went in and assisted in closing up the lower part of the house  they had just reached an upper window when a man went hurrying through the street holding a shotgun in his hands  did a lion really get loose called out snap  he certainly did was the answer  where is he now  somewhere back of the freight depot or in one of the empty freight cars  going to try to shoot him asked whopper  yes  four or five of us are going to try to do that or capture him  the man hurried on and presently another appeared armed with a rifle  wish i had a gun id go on the hunt too said snap  think of laying a real lion low  it would beat deer hunting wouldnt it answered whopper  but supposing the lion turned and hunted you  youd want to run about leven hundred miles  if you had the chance came from giant  ive heard that a lion can get over the ground as quick as a cat  i dont want any of you boys to leave this house until that lion is caught said mrs carson firmly  i feel it my duty to keep you here  maybe they wont catch him at all suggested her nephew  oh theyll be sure to catch or shoot him by morning answered the lady of the house  supper in the diningroom below was rather a haphazard affair it was eaten behind closed blinds and in semidarkness the lady of the house being afraid to make a light for fear of allowing the roaming lion to see the eating and her guests  just as the hired girl was bringing in the dessert a distant shot rang out and uttering a scream the girl whose nerves were on edge let the dessert saucers fall to the floor with a crash  somebody must have shot the lion cried giant  or shot at him corrected whopper  just look what you have done mary cried mrs carson in dismay  i couldnt help it mum answered the servant girl  that lion gettin loose has scared me stiff  well i am scared myself  clear up the muss and be careful next time  boys youll have to do without the preserves  but you can have cake  cake is good enough for me answered snap and the others said about the same  not long after that came another shot this time from the corner at the end of the block  they are coming this way exclaimed the doctors son  let us go upstairs again and see what is doing  be careful screamed his aunt  that lion may jump right up to the second story window  the boys went to an upper window and then growing bolder stepped out on the top of the front piazza  they saw several men running along a cross street  then another shot rang out  the lion must be in this vicinity said snap  i saw something thenover yonder cried giant and pointed to the back of a yard down by the corner of the street  a dogand he is legging it for dear life returned whopper  he looks as if he wouldnt stop this side of the north pole  perhaps the lion scared him said shep  i thinklook  the doctors son broke off short and pointed with his hand  gazing in the direction indicated the lads saw something dark slinking on the opposite side of a high picket fence  its the lion said snap in a whisper  see his tail swaying from side to side  oh for a rifle murmured whopper  aunty have you a gun called shep  we see the lion  no i havent any gun answered the lady of the house quickly and you had better get inside as quickly as you can  the lion may leap up at you  i dont think he can jump so high  there are some of the men with their guns went on giant  see they are running around to the front of that house  i wonder if they see the lion asked snap  let us yell to them suggested whopper  one after another the boys set up a shout  but the hunters were now out of sight and paid no attention to them  a moment later the lads saw the lion leave the vicinity of the fence cross the yard and disappear behind the side of a barn then came a sudden smashing of boards and a wildeyed horse burst into view and ran down the street at top speed  the lion scared that horse said whopper  well hes enough to scare anything  boys boys why dont you come in pleaded mrs carson  if he sees you hell surely try to get up on the piazza  if he turns this way well come in and shut the blinds answered her nephew  it may be too late then  oh i think not aunty  another shot rang out and then the boys saw the men running around the barn  perhaps they have managed to shut the lion in the barn said snap  if they are circus men they would rather capture the lion than kill him returned the doctors son  lions must be worth a good deal of money  it was now about seven oclock and not as light as it had been a few minutes passed and the men did not seem to be doing anything  do you know what i think declared whopper  i think that lion is hiding on them  just what i was going to say came from giant  maybe he has crawled to some dark corner of the barn and nobody has the courage to stir him up  do you want to stir him up asked snap dryly  not on your necktie answered the small youth  let him sleep in peace added whopper  he wont sleep said the doctors son  something doing now cried whopper a few minutes later  he had seen one of the men run across the yard  why i declare there is the lion in the yard next door  how did he get there asked snap  i dont know  that man is going to take another shot cried shep as he saw a gun raised  and there goes the lion cried snap as the form of the animal arose swiftly in the air  with grace and precision the lord of the animal world cleared the back fence of the yard and crouched down in the street close to a tree  hes heading this way burst out the doctors son  maybe we had better get indoors  oh he cant leap up here insisted giant who was brave even though small  well take no chances was sheps answer  come  he turned to the window and so did snap and whopper  at that minute one of the men came around the corner of the street  the lion leaped from behind the tree into the roadway  pulling up his gun the man banged away wildly for he was nervous and frightened  oh came in a groan from giant and his chums saw him stagger  what is it asked snap quickly  but instead of answering the small youth staggered around the piazza top  giant is shot gasped whopper  catch him  he is falling off the roof  snap made a quick leap forward and caught giant around the waist both were now on the slanting portion of the piazza roof  snap did what he could to stay their progress but it was in vain and the next instant both boys slipped down over the edge  snap clutched at a honeysuckle vine growing there but it gave way and a moment later the two boys rolled to the ground     chapter vi  something about a chimpanzee   it was well that that honeysuckle vine was growing there and that it gave way slowly after snap grasped it for otherwise the two boys might have suffered some broken bones  as it was snap bumped his shoulder severely and scraped his ear on the sand of the path that ran around the side of the house  poor giant was unconscious and even in that perilous moment snap realized that his little chum had been hit by some of the shot from the gun  whether the lad was dangerously wounded or not remained to be seen  the two boys had fallen inside the dooryard which was separated from the street by a low fence  hardly did they land when snap scrambled up dragging giant with him  the front door  the front door yelled shep from above  well let you in  and then he leaped through the window and tore down the stairs four steps at a time with whopper at his heels  as snap turned and looked out into the street he saw a sight calculated to daunt the stoutest heart  the lion was there standing erect with bristling mane glaring fiercely at him  get away the boy yelled not knowing what else to do  get away and then he picked up a whitewashed stone one of a number bordering the garden path  with all his might he threw it at the lion and caught the beast in the head  the animal turned slunk along the fence and disappeared behind a tree in front of the next house  the moment the animal turned away snap moved toward the piazza  he had giant in one of his arms and in his excitement did not notice the weight of his burden  as he ascended the steps the door was flung open and shep appeared  then whopper showed himself armed with an umbrella he had snatched from the hall rack  wheres the lion asked the doctors son  behind the tree gasped snap and then he literally fell into the hallway with giant still in his arm  at once the door was closed and locked again  was giant shot queried whopper as he threw down the umbrella  yes answered snap  make a light he added for the hallway was in total darkness  mrs carson was still upstairs while the hired girl in her fright had fled to the garret so the boys had to stumble around until shep found a match and lit the lamp  whopper and snap carried giant into the sittingroom and placed him on a sofa  as they did this the small youth opened his eyes and stared around wildly  the lion  dont let him eat me he muttered  youre safe giant answered the doctors son  ii got shot  we know it  let us see if you are badly hurt  on several occasions in cases of accident shep had aided his father in caring for patients and the knowledge thus gained now stood him in good stead he made a close examination and found that several buckshot had grazed the small youths temple while one had gone through the tip of the ear  giants face was covered with blood and this was washed off and then his wounds were bathed with witch hazel and bound up  you had a narrow escape was the comment of the doctors son  a little closer and you might have been killed or might have lost your eyesight  that fellow with the gun was mighty careless said whopper  he was excited added snap  he didnt want to hit giant  snap said nothing about his hurt shoulder although the bump he had received made him stiff and sore  he was thankful that the honeysuckle vine had broken the fall from the piazza roof and that he and giant had escaped from the clutches of the lion  the hunters of the animal had gone past the house and now those inside heard firing in the distance  the shots gradually grew fainter and fainter at last dying out altogether  i guess his lionship has left town said shep  or else he is dead added snap  mrs carson was much worried over the wounds giant had received and insisted upon putting on them some salve  the boy declared he felt all right again and that the wounds would soon heal  im used to little things like that he said  when we went hunting we had all sorts of things happen to us  mercy on us  then you ought never to go hunting again declared the lady of the house  it was a narrow escape said snap gravely you can be thankful that man didnt blow your head off  i am thankful snap and i am also thankful for what you did for me murmured giant and looked at his chum in a manner that spoke volumes  it was now too late to think of going to fairview for the last train had already departed  and as it was mrs carson insisted upon it that the boys remain all night  if you leave the house ill be worried to death thinking the lion caught you she said  so the boys stayed over another night  late in the evening they stopped two men who were passing the house and from them learned that the lion had been chased to the edge of a big woods north of railings  he had been wounded of that the men were certain and a regular hunting party was going out in the morning to either kill or capture the beast  the circus owner has offered a hundred dollars reward for his capture said one of the men so theyll get him alive if they can  did any other lions escape asked the doctors son  no but one of the big monkeys is missingthe educated one  do you mean abe the educated chimpanzee queried snap  thats the fellowthe one who eats drinks smokes and does all sorts of stunts  hes missing and the circus men are more worried over him than over the lion  one man said the chimwhatdoyoucallhim was worth a thousand dollars  i believe thatbeing educated to do so many things said whopper he sat up to a table to eat just like a man  did you hear how the lion and the chimpanzee happened to get away asked giant  why there was a report it was the fault of four rascals who used to work for the circusthree men who were discharged for getting drunk and a boy who did stunts on the trapeze and ran away  that boy cried snap  oh i dont think he had anything to do with it  well thats what the circus men say  if they catch the men and the boy theyll have the whole crowd locked up  i am sure the boy is innocent said the doctors son  i got shot by somebody hunting that lion said giant  do you know who fired his shotgun out yonder  oh that was hank donaldson  hes always blowing about what he can do with a gun and he was so worked up and nervous he killed macks dog and smashed the plateglass window in the new fiveandtencent store  he got scared to death when somebody told him a boy over here fell from the roof and got hit  is it bad  no but it might have been  you ought to pitch into hank  he ought to know better than to fire so promiscuouslike in the city streets  he meant well but if he had killed you what then  and the man passed on shaking his head earnestly  in the morning giant felt quite like himself and insisted upon leaving off the bandage that had been placed over his forehead  i dont want to become an object of curiosity he explained  even as it is i suppose lots of folks will want to know all about it  while the boys were eating the door bell rang and the hired girl announced a man to see the lad who had been shot  the visitor proved to be hank donaldson a big burly fellow now nervous to the degree of collapsing  ii hope yer dont think i did it apurpose said donaldson cos i didnti only wanted to shoot that ere lion fore he ate sombuddy up  i understand answered giant  but you were very careless after this you had better give up lion hunting  i sure will  i am very sorryyes i am  hope youll forgive it  i willif you didnt mean it answered giant  ive got a heap o troubles i have went on hank donaldson got to pay bout a hundred dollars fer a plateglass winder i smashed an got to pay fer a dorg too  ye dont catch me huntin lions no more  and he heaved a mountainous sigh  a few minutes later he departed saying he hoped giant would soon get over his hurts  i guess he will be punished enough when he pays for the glass and the dog said the small youth and smiled in spite of his wounds  getting a ladder the boys fixed up the brokendown honeysuckle vine and then bid goodby to mrs carson  she was still a bit timid about letting them go  you keep your eyes open for that lion she said  and if you see him run into the first house or store thats handy  dont think you can shoo him off again with a stone because it isnt likely youll be able to  well be on our guard aunty answered shep  the circus had left town as it was billed to perform in another city forty miles away  but several employees had been left behind and these men aided by a number of others went on a long hunt for the lion and the chimpanzee  the lion had been seen making for the woods but what had become of the chimpanzee nobody knew  the loss of that chimpanzee is a big one for the circus said snap while on the way home  just see how they feature him on the bills  they have other lions but abe was their only manmonkey  what the youth said about the chimpanzee was true  abe as he had been named was a wonderful drawingcard  at first a reward of fifty dollars was offered for his return and later this sum was increased  it may be as well to state here that the owner of the circus suspected that the men who had been discharged by him had the chimpanzee and would have it returned to him when the reward was large enough  what had become of the men nobody knew and the boy acrobat had likewise disappeared  that boy interested me said snap  id like to meet him again and have a talk with him  maybe we will meet him again some time answered the doctors son  oh its not likely  there wont be anything to keep him in these parts  if he is a regular acrobat more than likely hell join some other circus or some vaudeville show  he didnt look as if he liked the life said whopper  thats the way it struck me came from giant  when the boys got home they had quite a story to tell  mrs caslette was much alarmed over the injuries her son had received and insisted upon it that giant let dr reed attend him which the physician did willingly  not much damaged said the doctor  but he had what folks call a close shave  the boys told the doctor about what they had learned from mr jally and in turn he gave them instructions concerning the photographs he desired them to obtain during their outing in the windy mountains as there might be a little delay in getting the new cameras and in getting some other supplies the start of the trip was postponed until tuesday  and how do you propose to go asked snap of the doctors son  father thinks it would be wise for us to row to firefly lake then we can hide our boat and tote our supplies over to the mountains  that suits me shep  did ham spink and his crowd go that way asked whopper  i think they did but i am not sure  well i dont want to meet them if they did came from giant they can keep their distance and well keep ours     chapter vii  up the river   coming from sundayschool on sunday afternoon the boys fell in with jed sanborn the old hunter who had gone out with them on more than one trip  they were rather surprised to see the man carrying his shotgun for jed usually believed in respecting the sabbath day  been out hunting queried snap as all came to a halt  well yes kind of answered the old hunter  but not any reglar game  i didnt think youd be out on sunday said whopper  i took it into my head yesterday to look fer that lion as got away at railings was jed sanborns answer  somebuddy said as how he was keepin shady over to merricks woods so i tramped over  stayed in the woods all night an this mornin  did you see the lion asked snap eagerly  nary a hair o him lad an i dont think hes in the woods nuther  but he must be somewhere insisted giant  thet might be but he aint in merricks woods  ill bet a glass o cider ont  jed sanborn looked at the boys and grinned  goin out huntin agin so i hear  yes  whereabouts this timeup whar ye see the ghost  and the old man chuckled thinking of what the ghost had proved to be  no  we are going over to windy mountains this trip answered the doctors son  that far eh  its quite a trip  hope ye find it wuth so long a journey  i dont know as the game thar is any better nor around the lakes close to hum  we are going for the fun of camping partly said shep  he did not care to say anything about the picturetaking for his father do you expect to come out that way  i might  if you do you must hunt us up put in snap  ill do thet sure pop answered jed sanborn  he started off then turned back  oh i say he called  what is it asked whopper  its about thet pesky ham spink went on the old hunter  did i tell ye about my spring  no  what of it asked giant  ye know ive got a nice spring o cold water up by my cabin  well some days ago ham spink an thet dudder boy came up there an on the sly caved the spring in on me  i caught em coming away  i had my shotgun with me an i was mad good an proper  i said they must fix the spring or somebuddyd git shot  they got scart i kin tell ye an they got on their hands an knees in the sand an rocks an mud and worked like beavers till they had the spring fixed  it jest about ruined their clothes an when they went off they was as mad as hops  spink said he would square up but hes a blower an i aint afraid o him  it was just like hams meanness and carl dudders meanness too said snap  the new cameras and supplies had come in on saturday night and on monday morning the boys received a new tent from dr reed and a tarpaulin from mr dodge  mr dawson gave the boys some blankets and mrs caslette promised to supply them with a hamper of table delicacies  with so many good things well have a better time than ever before said snap  nothing like winding up the summer in good shape answered the doctors son  the chums went over their boat with care to make certain that it did not leak and then looked over their guns and the rest of their outfit  on monday evening everything was taken down to the boathouse for readiness early tuesday morning  i am glad of one thing remarked whopper  ham spink and his crowd are not on hand to molest our things as they tried to do before  well we gave em a warm reception when they did come to the boathouse answered snap with a grin referring to an event related in detail in the young hunters of the lake  for this particular outing the supplies were extra numerous and the boys knew it was going to be no light task to transport them by boat and pack  well have to make the best of it said the doctors son  when we are in the boat well have to row with care and if we cant tote the stuff over to the mountains in one trip well make two  it was somewhat gloomy monday evening and the boys were fearful that it might rain by morning  but the clouds cleared away during the night and the sun came up in the morning as brightly as ever each got an early breakfast and by eight oclock all were assembled at the boathouse  everything all right asked whopper who was the last to arrive  all ok answered snap  soon the supplies were stowed away with care and then the chums entered the craft  it was agreed that two should row at a time and snap and giant took up the oars  several men and boys had gathered to see them start  dont forget to bring back another bear sang out one man  if you should happen to see that lion better run for it cautioned another  we dont expect to see the lion and we arent looking for more bears answered snap  we are going to take it easy this trip  well i wish you luck said the man  then the boys set up a cheer from the shore and the chums answered it  say snap what makes you think this is going to be a real quiet picnic asked whopper on the way  now i expect to bag about fifty rabbits a hundred partridges some wild turkeys a bear or two and that lion in the bargain  wow gasped giant  whopper is to the front once more  why not make it two lions while you are at it  because there is only one and i dont want to beerpiggish  why not say lionish questioned shep  arent you going to hunt at all demanded the boy who loved to exaggerate  of course drawled giant  i am going to hunt ants and june bugs and horseflies and worms and  oh come off growled whopper  you know what i mean  to be sure well hunt said the doctors son  but the cameras are going ahead of the guns this trip  speaking of cameras and worms puts me in mind of something i heard yesterday said snap  its about trick photography  an amateur photographer showed a picture he had of what looked like a fierce snake on a rail fence  by and by he gave the trick away  the snake was nothing but a garden worm wound around some little sticks and toothpicks and the picture had been snapped at close range  thats like a trick picture i heard about taken on two plates said giant  it was one of a man wheeling himself in a wheelbarrow  i know of three fellows who took a queerlooking picture said whopper  now this is true he continued noticing the others look of doubt  they got an oilcloth sign a square one and then one fellow got up on another fellows shoulders  the two fellows held the sign in front of them while the third chap took the picture  when the photo was printed it looked as if the boy carrying the sign was about nine feet high  i heard of that in a different way said snap  a fellow out in the country took two horses back of a henhouse  he had the head of one horse sticking beyond one end of the henhouse and the hind legs of the second horse sticking out at the other end and the picture looked as if that horse was fifteen or twenty feet long  on they went along the river past pop lundys orchard where they had once had quite an adventure  it was rather warm but a light breeze cooled those at the oars  snap and giant rowed for about a mile and were then relieved by their chums and thus they changed about until it was time for lunch when they ran ashore at an inviting spot  rowing makes a fellow hungry observed whopper  i think i can eat at least fifteen sandwiches not to mention some cake and a few pieces of pie  perhaps you want the whole lunch yourself said snap  well you dont get it  anybody want coffee asked shep  if so well have to start up a fire  dont bother today  water is good enough said giant and so they rested in the shade of the trees and ate their sandwiches and a pie mrs caslette had baked for them washing the food down with water from a handy spring  i am going to take my first picture said snap and made the others get in a group each with a piece of pie in his hand  he took a snapshots and then marked the picture in a book he had brought along for that purpose  what do you call it asked whopper  pieous time answered snap and then dodged a tin cup the other flung at him  we must try to reach lake cameron before night said shep when they were once more on the way  i shouldnt care to camp out along the river  oh you might find a worse spot answered snap  however well get to the lake if we can  as my old readers know lake cameron was connected with the river by a narrow creek the banks of which were overhung with bushes since the boys had come home from their last outing the rains had been heavy consequently the creek was well filled with water  this makes getting through easy and i am glad of it said whopper i was afraid wed have to carry some of the stuff around so as to lighten the boat  are you going up the lake shore very far tonight questioned giant it was already growing dark  no i think we had best camp near the mouth of the creek answered the doctors son and the others agreed with him  as soon as the lake was reached giant who was the best fisherman of the crowd baited up and threw out his line  for some time he did not get a bite but then came a sharp tug so dear to the heart of the angler  what have you got asked whopper  might be an elephant but ii guess not cried the small youth  the others stopped rowing and giant began to play his catch with care soon he brought to light a fine pickerel and dropped the fish in the bottom of the boat  good for giant cried snap  a couple of more like that and well have a dandy fish supper  again the line was baited and thrown in and the boys took up their rowing  presently came another tug and again giant was successful bringing in a fish several inches larger than the first  this is pickerel day cried whopper reckon ill try my luck and he did and presently brought in a pickerel almost as large as the others  but that was the end of the luck for the time being  never mind said shep  three are enough  now to land and get our camp into shape for the nightand then for supper  and a few minutes later a landing was made     chapter viii  the first night out   the boys knew the shores of lake cameron well having camped there before and they selected a spot that just suited their wants the rowboat was drawn up in a tiny cove and made fast and then all hands set to work getting the tent and some of the outfit ashore  the things left in the boat were covered carefully with the tarpaulin to keep off the night dampness and a possible rain  shep had been selected as the leader during this outing on account of what his father had done for the club and he now directed giant and whopper to build the fire and get supper ready while he and snap erected the tent and cut some pine boughs for bedding  it will be almost warm enough tonight to sleep out of doors said the doctors son  but it seems more natural to sleep under some kind of a cover  he and snap took the ax and soon cut down three slender saplings and trimmed them  two were planted in the ground where the tent was to be erected and the third was laid across the top in little limbcrotches left for that purpose  then the canvas was thrown over and pegged down tightly sides and back  the front of the tent had a double flap which could be tied shut with strings if desired  long before the tent was up and furnished with bedding of pine boughs giant and whopper had the camp fire started and soon an appetizing odor of coffee and frying fish filled the air  it was now quite dark and the glare of the fire made the scene a pleasant one  camping wouldnt be camping without a fire observed snap as having finished his share of the work he sat down on a grassy hillock to rest and watch giant and whopper getting ready to serve the evening meal  right you are snap answered shep  even in the hottest of weather i love to see the glare and the flickering shadows  i always think of good stories and plenty to eat when i see a camp fire came from giant  well i reckon we are going to have the eating even if we dont have the stories said the doctors son  whats the matter with whopper spinning one of his outrageous yarns suggested snap  he must be fairly aching to tell something marvelous  i tell only truthful tales came from the storyteller modestly  now if you want to hear  truthful tales burst out giant  say whopper thats the very biggest whopper you ever told  all right then i wont tell any stories returned the other lad reproachfully  oh yes you will you cant help it said snap  supper was soon served  it consisted of bread and butter and coffee and pickerel done to a turn topped off with some crullers from a bagful donated by mrs caslette  the boys took their time eating and when they had finished the bones of the fish were picked clean then giant said something about a train falling off a bridge and that started whopper to telling a most marvelous story of an engineer who seeing that a bridge was down put on all speed and rushed his train over a gap thirty feet wide in safety the others listened with sober faces until whopper had finished and then burst out laughing  what did i tell you cried snap  i said whopper couldnt help telling a yarn  and such a one too added giant  and of course we all believe it came from the doctors son  well i had to do somethingto help pass the time said whopper a bit sheepishly  sure you did said snap heartily  its all right whopperonly dont ask us to believe such a story  is anybody going to stand guard tonight asked giant to change the subject  whats the use questioned snap  i dont think anybody or anything will come to disturb us  well you can never tell said shep slowly  but if you fellows dont care to stand guard well let it go at that  oh its for you to say shepyou are leader this trip  well i guess we can all turn in  and turn in they did about nine oclock with the understanding that they were to have breakfast at six in the morning and continue their journey as soon after that as possible  whether he felt the responsibility of leadership or not it would be hard to say but certain it is that the doctors son did not sleep near as soundly as did the others  he was very restless and when he dozed off it was to dream of the lion that had escaped from the circus  he imagined that the animal had followed them to their camp and was bending over him and licking his face he uttered a groan of terror and sat up and opened his eyes as he did this a dark form leaped over him and out of the open tent  the fire had burned low so what the form was shep could not tell  help screamed the doctors son  he was not yet fully awake  whawhats the matter spluttered snap throwing aside his blanket  whats wrong came from whopper and giant simultaneously  somethinga wild animalin herejumped over me gasped shep  it just went outside  oh you are dreaming shep said snap  no im not  i saw itfelt it  let me get my gun  the doctors son threw off his blanket leaped up and grasped his shotgun that hung on one of the tent poles  he stepped to the opening of the tent and peered out anxiously  see anything demanded whopper  he and the others were now up and each was arming himself  nno  i told you you were dreaming came from snap  too many crullers for supper was giants comment  sometimes they lay like lead in a fellows stomach and give him all sorts of dreams  it wasnt the crullers persisted the doctors son  im going outside and investigate  and he stepped out in the direction of the camp fire  be careful warned snap  if any wild beasts are around you want to be on your guard  the doctors son looked around with care but could see no trace of the night visitor  he stirred up the camp fire and soon had a bright blaze going  the others had followed him outside and they stood shivering in the damp air  false alarm i guess said giant yawning  what time is it  one oclock answered whopper after consulting his watch  say this is a dandy way of breaking up ones rest he added sarcastically  if you dont believe i saw somethingand felt somethingyou neednt returned shep tartly  must have been a sand flea or a water bug  come whopper dont get mad came from snap  if shep  there it is behind the bushes burst out the doctors son  i just saw its eyes shining  as he spoke he raised his shotgun  but the eyes had disappeared  i saw something came from giant  see its movingback of the huckleberry bush  something was moving that was evident but what it was none of the young hunters could make out  shep raised his gun again  shall i take a chance and fire he asked of the others  might as well answered whopper  it couldnt be anything but a wild animal  wait cried snap  he raised his voice  who is there he called out  answer or well shoot  for reply there came a sound that thoroughly astonished the boys it was the bark of a dog low and uncertain  then there stepped into view a collie wagging his tail doubtfully  a dog cried giant  come here  come here he called and gave an inviting whistle  slowly the dog came forward still wagging his tail doubtfully when he was quite close he sat up on his haunches and began to move his fore paws up and down  hes begging cried snap  he must be hungry  i suppose he smelled our food and came for some said giant good little dog he cried  come here  and as he snapped his fingers the collie came up to him and allowed the small youth to pat him on the head  thats your wild beast shep said whopper  well i knew it was something answered the doctors son  that dog must have been in the tent  more than likely answered snap  see how friendly he is he added for the collie was now leaping from one to another of the boys and barking joyfully  giant gave him a cruller and he ate the dainty greedily  hes half starved said snap  must have wandered off into the woods and got lost  is there a name on his collar asked whopper  no only a license number answered giant after an examination looks to me as if he might be a valuable animal  i think ive seen that collie before said shep  so you didin the tent said whopper quickly and set up a laugh  oh you know what i mean  he has a regular star on his breast yes i am sure ive seen him somewhere but where i cant remember  he ought to be returned to his owner said snap  but how we are going to do it i dont know  i dont care to go back just for the dog  nor i added giant  let us take him along and bring him back with us when we come  if hell stay with us came from whopper  he mayif we feed him well answered the doctors son  they let the dog have another cruller and the heads of the fish and the animal made a meal of them  the boys felt cold and tired and crawled back into the tent to finish their nights rest  soon the collie came nosing at the opening  come here said giant in a low voice and instantly the dog nestled down at his side and there he remained until daylight  we can take him in some of our pictures said the small youth hell add to the picturesqueness  what are you going to call him asked whopper  sphinx  and why sphinx asked snap  because he wont tell us who he is where he came from or anything about himself  oh thats not a pretty name cried the doctors son  i vote we call him wags because he wags his tail so much  all right wags it is said giant  what do you say wags he added turning to the dog  the collie barked and wagged his tail vigorously  evidently he was perfectly satisfied  as the lads had no more game or fish to eat they made a hasty meal of bacon bread crullers and coffee  as soon as the repast was over they took down the tent and placed that and the other things on board the rowboat  the collie had been fed and was more frisky than ever  wonder if hell go into the boat with us said snap  some dogs dont like the water  most collies do answered giant  ill try him  he called wags and the dog leaped into the craft and took his place at the bow  hell do for a lookout said whopper  come on its time to start  they looked around the temporary camp to make certain that nothing had been left behind then entered the rowboat and shoved off snap and whopper took the oars and soon they were on the journey up lake cameron to firefly lake  dont forget one thing said snap shortly after starting  if possible we want to bring down some sort of game for dinner  it wont do to use up our canned things and that stuff  everybody watch out said giant  and if we cant shoot something why toward dinner time ill try my hand at fishing again     chapter ix  into the rapids   it was another ideal day and the young hunters felt in the best of spirits  whopper felt so good that presently he burst out singing an old school song and the others joined in  thats all right and very good but if we want any game weve got to keep quiet said the doctors son after the song was ended  right you are answered whopper promptly  and as id rather eat later than sing now ill shut up  they followed the shore line of lake cameron heading for the rocky watercourse that connected that body of water with firefly lake  the eyes of all were on the alert for game and toward the middle of the forenoon giant called a halt  i saw something in the trees yonder he said pointing ashore looked to me as if they might be partridge  partridge would suit me first rate answered snap  let us land and try our luck  making as little noise as possible they beached the rowboat and giant silenced the dog not knowing what he might do while on a hunt  perhaps hes a good bird dog and perhaps he isnt he said  well take no chances  each of the young hunters had his shotgun and one after another they followed shep to the spot where the game had been seen among the trees  high among the branches of a silver maple tree they saw some ruffed grouse commonly known to many sportsmen as partridge  theres our chance said the doctors son  who is to fire  let us all take a chance pleaded giant  just to open the outing you know  shep was willing and said he would give the word  with great caution they crept as close as possible to the grouse  the birds were on three branches of the maple one over the other  silently the four boy hunters raised their firearms  shep looked at them and then along the barrel of his piece  fire said he and one shot rang out after another quickly  there was a mad whirring and fluttering from the ruffed grouse  two dropped like lead while two others flew around in a circle  badly wounded  then the boys discharged their guns again and wounded two more birds  as the game came down they rushed in and wrung the necks of those not already dead  six all told said giant proudly  thats one and a half apiece  not so bad answered snap  its dandy shouted whopper throwing up his cap in his delight now we can have roast partridge for dinner and supper too if we want to  right you are came from shep  i believe we all made a hit he added  a hit repeated whopper  we all made home runs  and at this reference to baseball all of the boys laughed  taking the game to the rowboat they resumed their journey and by noon reached the watercourse connecting the two lakes  here they stopped at a spot well known to them and built a camp fire and here they roasted all of the game fearing it might not keep in such hot weather  im going to try baking em in mud said giant who had learned the trick from jed sanborn  leaving the feathers on the grouse the lad plastered each bird thickly with some clayey mud and then placed them in the fire to roast or bake as he called it  he watched them with care and tried one frequently to see if it was done  now i guess this will do he said at last and cracked the baked mud from the grouse  with the mud came the feathers of the bird leaving the meat clean  the grouse was tender and juicy and done to a turn  giant youll have to get a job as a chef in a big hotel said the doctors son smacking his lips over the feast  this game certainly couldnt be better  why not leave some of the partridge right in the baked mud suggested snap  it ought to keep well that way  we can try it said whopper  the collie was given his share of the dinner and appeared to enjoy it as much as the boys  he acted as if he felt perfectly at home with the young hunters and made no offer to leave them  if he wasnt such a fine dog id put him down as an outcast said shep  but nobody would abandon such a fine animalhes worth too much money  once again the boy hunters proceeded on their way  as they entered the watercourse connecting the two lakes they noticed that the current was flowing swiftly  the heavy rains are responsible for this said snap  we want to be careful or the boat will be smashed on some of the rocks  we might get out and walkthat is some of usif the shore wasnt so rough and rocky said whopper  it looks wilder than ever now doesnt it boys  it certainly did look wilderor was it only the rushing of the water that made it appear so  they rowed on with caution two at the oars and two doing the steering with poles  wags sat in the bow as before watching proceedings in silence  about half the distance to firefly lake had been covered when they came to a sharp turn in the watercourse  here the water boiled and foamed around several sharp rocks  beware of the rocks sang out the doctors son  to the right  to the right yelled whopper  its too shallow on the other side  they tried to turn the craft to the right but the current seemed too strong for them  the boat swung around and hit one of the rocks a sharp blow  there was a little splash as the collie went overboard  then came a big souse that covered those who remained in the boat with spray  giant is overboard cried whopper  and so is the dog  let the dog take care of himself cried snap  grab giant  whopper turned to catch the lad who had gone overboard but the current was too quick for him and the small youth was sent whirling out of his reach  for the moment it looked as if the rowboat would either go over or be stove in on the rocks and those left on board had to turn their attention to the craft  they saw giant floundering in the boiling water but could do nothing to aid him  swing her around and pull for shore its our only chance cried snap  quick nowor well all go to the bottom  fighting desperately the three lads swung the craft around slowly it scraped on more of the rocks and one of the oars was caught and snapped off like a pipestem  but then the boat struck water that was a little more calm and soon they reached a cove and felt themselves safe for the time being  where is giant was sheps question as soon as they knew the outfit was secure  there he is on one of the rocks answered whopper  and here comes the dog he added as the collie came battling bravely toward them  soon wags was on shore and shaking himself vigorously acting as if such a bath was a daily occurrence  hello you fellows came in giants voice  he was sprawled out on a rock in midstream sixty feet away  are you hurt questioned shep anxiously  no the water was pretty soft answered the small youth  but i say how am i going to get ashore  cant you wade it asked whopper  no dont try thatthe current is too swift cried snap  well we cant take the boat to him said whopper  i know that  we might throw him a line suggested the doctors son  yes thats an idea  a light but strong line was brought forth and shep curled it up as a cowboy does a lasso  then he made a cast but the line fell short  let me try it said snap  one after another the boys on shore tried to reach giant with the line but failed  after whopper had made his cast wags who had been sitting on a rock watching proceedings with interest gave a bark and caught the end of the line in his teeth  theres an idea cried snap  let the dog carry the line  will he do it questioned whopper  we can try him and see  the end of the line was made fast to the collies collar and giant was told to call him  come wags  thats a good dog  come called the small youth and whistled and snapped his fingers  at first wags appeared to be doubtful but finally he ventured into the water  then he began to swim steadily toward the rock dragging the line behind him  what a shame if the current carries him away murmured whopper  well not allow that answered the doctors son  if he loses ground we can haul him in  slowly but surely the dog drew closer to the rock  at last he got within giants reach and the youth caught him and pulled him up  tie the rope about your waist and well haul you to shore sang out shep  bring the dog on your shoulder if you can  ill try it answered giant  it was no easy matter for him on the wet and slippery rock to adjust the rope and get the collie on his shoulder  but presently he announced that he was ready and the boys on shore commenced to haul in  down in the madly rushing water went giant and it was all he could do to keep his feet  but luck was with him and in a very few minutes he and the dog were safe  that was quite an adventure he said when he had recovered his breath  you went overboard in a great hurry remarked whopper  and so did wags  the shock to the boat did it  it made me lose my balance before i was aware  let us be thankful giant is safe and wags said the doctors son and thankful too that the boat didnt go over  if it had our outing would have been spoiled  weve got to be mighty careful how we travel through the rest of this river remarked snap  the heavy rains have made a fierce torrent of it  it must be confessed that the boys did not know exactly what to do should they venture on the river again or carry the outfit to the beginning of firefly lake  ive got an idea said shep at last  you can follow it or not as you think best  my idea is to have two of the crowd take the boat down and the two others walk to firefly lake carrying the most precious of the outfit  that suits me said snap  who will walk and who take the boat questioned whopper  i might as well go in the boatim wet already said giant smiling grimly  the three of us can draw lots as to who shall go with giant said the doctors son  the drawing was at once made and it fell to snap to go with the small youth  the cameras and guns were taken from the rowboat and also a few other things  then the doctors son and whopper aided the others in getting the boat into the rushing river once more  take care of yourselves cried shep  if all goes right youll get to the lake long before we do  in a moment the boat was caught by the current and whirled onward giant and snap had all they could do to steer it  but fortunately they found no more such bad places as those already encountered and in less than an hour found themselves floating on firefly lake safe and sound  the others might have come with us after all declared giant wonder how long it will take them to reach here  i dont know it depends on how rough they find the way  maybe a couple of hours answered snap  we may as well go ashore start up a camp and wait for them     chapter x  the cabin in the woods   the doctors son and whopper had no easy time of it making their way through the bushes and around the rocks which lined the watercourse between the two lakes  there was no trail on that side of the stream and they had to go it blind to use sheps words  say this is worse than climbing a mountain gasped whopper after slipping and sliding over a number of rocks and coming down rather suddenly in a hollow  rather knocks the breath out of a fellow returned shep  take care that you dont sprain an ankle whopper  thats what im watching out for  i dont want my whole outing spoiled  after a large amount of hard walking and climbing they managed to cover about half the distance to firefly lake  but by that time both were so exhausted the doctors son called a halt  no use of killing ourselves he said  we cant go any farther than the lake today anyway  hope snap and giant wait for us at the mouth of the river said whopper  i dont want to tramp along the lake shore afoot  oh theyll wait and mostly likely start a camp  say if i remember rightly the river makes a bend to the right here went on whopper after a pause  and if that is so whats the matter with our striking inland a short distance and cutting off some of the walk  im willinganything to reach firefly lake before it gets too dark to see  having rested themselves the boys commenced to draw away from the river shore taking to the woods where the walking was easier  it was now close to six oclock and the sun was going down over the trees to the westward  hope they have supper ready by the time we get there said whopper after a period of silence  this transit is making me as hungry as a bear  same here  well well have the partridge to fall back on even if they dont cook anything else  the two young hunters tramped on  as they walked they kept their eyes open for a possible sight of game  so far all they had seen were some birds not worth shooting  another quarter of a mile was covered when they came to a patch of spruces  as they advanced they saw several rabbits leap from beside one of the trees  a chance for a shot cried the doctors son and speedily swung his shotgun into position an example followed by his chum  both young hunters blazed away without delay and each was successful in laying a rabbit low  before they could fire again the rest of the game was out of sight  not very large was sheps comment as they picked up the game  but the rabbits are young and theyll make fine eating  it is a good thing that new game law isnt in effect yet said whopper  if it was wed not be allowed to shoot rabbits until next october  you are right whopperhunting will be a good deal more restricted after the new laws go into effect  placing the rabbits in a gamebag the two chums walked on past the clump of spruces and then across a little clearing  here much to their surprise they came in sight of a dilapidated cabin  it was a small affair of rough logs with a rude stone chimney and one window and one door  one end of the cabin sagged greatly as if on the point of falling down  i hadnt any idea this was here was the comment of the doctors son  wonder who it can belong to  perhaps some hunters put it up in days gone by returned whopper it doesnt look as if it was inhabited  lets go in and take a look around suggested shep  it was his delight to poke around in new and odd places  we dont want to lose time was his chums reply  it will be dark before you know it  oh it wont take long to look answered shep  the old cabin was surrounded by weeds and bushes and they had to fairly work their way to the doorway  somebody has been here thats certain cried the doctors son here are eggshells and newly picked chicken feathers  hello in there cried whopper poking his head into the small doorway  he could not see for the cabin inside was dark  scarcely had the word been uttered when a most surprising thing happened  something whizzed through the air directly between the heads of the two boy hunters  it was a goodsized chunk of wood and it struck a rock outside with a thud  whywhystop that stammered whopper and fell back and shep did the same  evidently somebody doesnt want visitors was the comment of the doctors son  i say he called out what do you mean by heaving that wo  crash  from the interior of the cabin came another chunk of wood a gnarled root just grazing sheps shoulder  then a stone followed striking whopper a glancing blow on the hip  both lads retreated in confusion  well of all things gasped the doctors son when he could get his breath  thats a cordial welcome i must say  have you any idea who it was  not the slightest  it was too dark to see anybody  couldnt be any of the ham spink crowd  no  i dont think theyd treat us in just that way  maybe its some crazy chap  thats more like itsome hermit like old peter peterson returned shep referring to an old man who lived near the lakes and who rarely showed himself in any of the settlements  peter peterson wasnt crazy he didnt heave things at folks  let us see if we can get him to come out  id like to see what sort of a chap he is  keeping at what they thought was a safe distance the two boy hunters called loudly half a dozen times  no answer was returned  perhaps hes deaf suggested whopper  more likely he doesnt want to show himself  maybe its a she shep  possibly  if its a woman she must be a regular witch  let us call again  they did so  at first they heard nothing in return  then came a strange sound from the cabin and for one brief instant a dark impish face showed itself at the broken window  then the face disappeared and a stone came whizzing toward the lads heads  they ducked just in time or one or the other might have been seriously hurt  lets get outno use of staying here to be a target cried whopper who was growing nervous  no telling what that fellowor womanmay do next  might come for us with a carving knife and he hurried away with the doctors son beside him  they did not slacken their pace until the dilapidated cabin had disappeared from view  did you see himor her asked shep  just about and no more  what a driedup hateful face  just what i thought  ill wager that that person whoever he or she is is as mad as aa crazy person can be  i believe you and i dont know as i want to go near that cabin again  we ought to tell the authorities about it though  that person might kill somebody some day  well we can tell the police when we go back  could it be some tramp who is living on farmers chickens and the like  it might be  but i think its somebody whos crazy  a tramp wouldnt find it any fun to live away out here  why it must be two miles at least to the nearest farm  more like three  tramps like to stay near the farms and near railroads  no thats some kind of a crazy hermit  discussing the happening from every point of view the two lads trudged on  it was now growing dark rapidly and they were anxious to reach firefly lake  hope we havent missed the way said the doctors son presently seems to me we ought to be getting to the river or the lake soon  heres a rise of ground  im going up there and take a look answered his chum  from the small hill they made out the glint of water in the distance and they also saw the glare of the camp fire snap and giant had started  might as well steer straight for the camp fire said shep  it will save us some walking  when within a few hundred feet of the camp they set up a loud whistle to which the others immediately responded  then snap and giant came to meet them and relieved them of some of the things a little later all were seated around the camp fire  so you got through all ok eh said the doctors son after snap and giant had told their story  well so did webut we had some queer things happen  and then he and whopper told of the tumbles and of what had occurred at the old cabin in the woods  say wish i had been along cried snap  id like to investigate that cabin and see who is there  you wouldnt want to investigate a block of wood or a stone thrown at your head would you demanded whopper sarcastically  maybe we could go there when the hermitor whatever he or she isis asleep went on snap  he always believed in getting at the bottom of a mystery  if you go there youll go without me declared whopper firmly i wouldnt tempt thatercrazy fellow again for a billion dollars  why he might come out and carve a chap all up with a butcher knife or blow your head off with a gun  supper was ready and while they were talking the young hunters managed to stow away a hearty meal after which all felt better but the experiences of the day had worn them out and each was glad enough to retire early  we want to be stirring early tomorrow said the doctors son we want to go up the lake and then begin to tote the outfit over the hills to the mountains  how about itgoing to set a guard asked giant  wonder if we cant put wags on guard asked snap  i think hed bark if anything came to disturb us came from whopper  well tie him to the front tent pole said the doctors son  then he wont be able to run off and more than likely hell bark if anything goes wrong  they fixed the camp fire and then tied the collie fast by a cord slipped under his collar  evidently wags was used to this treatment for he did not seem to mind it in the least  the young hunters entered the tent and in less than a quarter of an hour all were sound asleep  thus an hour passed  then of a sudden all the lads found themselves wide awake  wags was barking furiously and the hair of his body seemed to be fairly standing on end     chapter xi  a strange meeting   something is wrong cried snap leaping up and feeling for his gun what is it wags  the dog kept on barking and commenced to tug on the cord that held him  shall i let him loose asked whopper  all the boys were now on their feet and he and giant were rubbing their eyes  the wind had shifted and was blowing the smoke of the smoldering camp fire toward the tent  dont do ityet answered the doctors son  he might bite somebody  let us go outside first  maybe its that crazy hermit suggested whopper and gave a little shiver  he could still see that impish face glaring at him  be careful  one after another the young hunters stepped into the open each with his gun ready for use  shep stirred up the camp fire and threw on some lightwood causing a renewed blaze  i dont see anything wrong said shep after a long look around  see any wild beasts asked giant  wags would bark at a wild beast i am sure  nothing in sight now  all walked completely around the tent and the camp fire but failed to see anything out of the ordinary  the collie had now ceased barking and was wagging his tail apparently as happy and free from anxiety as ever  the dog must have dreamed he heard something grumbled whopper hang the luck  i was so sleepy  and he yawned broadly setting his chums to doing likewise  well dogs do dream sometimes admitted the doctors son  but what made him bark so loudly and look so mad  nobody could answer that question and nobody tried  they took another look around the tent fixed the fire again and at last one by one retired to rest once more wags at the foot of the tent pole as before  it was broad daylight when they awoke again and for a while nobody felt like stirring  at length snap looked at his watch  great mackerel he ejaculated  eight oclock  time we were getting breakfast and moving  thats so answered shep  still there is no great hurry  our time is our own  thats the charm of such an outing as this  i think we might stay here today came from giant  it will give us a chance to rest up and to fish  remember we wont have much fishing after we get to the mountains  we can get brook trout answered whopper  but just the same im willing to stay here today and fish  maybe we can get some big maskalonge same as we did before  and if we cant get those we can get some pickerel and bass and perch added giant  snap had promised to get breakfast ready and he set in with a will as soon as he was dressed  while he was working giant and whopper walked down to a cove where the boat had been left to look over their rods and lines  the doctors son busied himself with a camera determined to take a few pictures before leaving the lake shore  suddenly there came from the cove a hurried shouting that instantly attracted the attention of snap and shep  what are they saying demanded the doctors son  i dont knowsomething about the boat answered snap and dropping the coffeepot he held he ran toward the lake  shep set the camera on a box and followed  when they arrived at the cove they found giant and whopper gazing up and down and across the water in perplexity  the rowboat with the larger portion of their outfit was nowhere to be seen  wheres the boat demanded snap  thats what we want to know answered giant  didnt you leave it tied up  certainly i didto this elderberry bush  well where is it now  dont ask me  did giant tie the boat asked the doctors son  he had not seen the craft since the parting at the rapids  yes i didand i tied it good and fast too answered the small youth  snap saw me do it  yes i saw him tie it up but i thought maybe he shifted the boat afterward  no i left it just as it was tied up  the boy hunters looked blankly at one another  all gazed up and down the shore and across the lake  maybe ham spink began snap  if he took our boat illill kick him full of holes cried giant   he had not forgotten how spink and his cronies had annoyed them in the past  i dont see any footprints around here remarked the doctors son looking over the ground carefully  heres a tree branch broken said whopper  they might have come in a boat and towed our craft away suggested snap  boys i know why wags barked during the night cried giant  he heard somebody at the boat  yes and we didnt know enough to come down here added snap bitterly  if we had come we could have caught the boatstealers redhanded  a lively discussion followed but it did nothing toward enlightening the boy hunters  the one fact remained that the boat and a large portion of the outfit were gone and unless the craft could be recovered their outing would come to a premature finish  all i can think of to do is to take our guns and walk up and down the lake front said the doctors son  two can go one way and two the other  if you see anything shout or fire a gun  shall we have breakfast first asked snap its started  might as well since we dont know how long this search will last  much disappointed the chums walked back to the camp fire and there made a hasty meal of cold partridge crackers cheese and coffee they left wags tied to the tent pole  maybe hell scare off intrudersif any come said shep  it was decided that snap and shep should go up the shore and giant and whopper down in the direction of the river leading to lake cameron  all started off briskly anxious to catch sight of their craft as speedily as possible or learn what had become of it  it was comparatively easy to walk along the shore of firefly lake and snap and the doctors son made good progress  they passed the camp receiving a joyous bark from wags and then skirted a small bay leading to a fine sandy beach  fine spot for a swim remarked snap  we ought to have one before we go to the mountains  yes but let us find the boat first  of course  half an hours walking brought the two churns to another bay  they were walking behind a fringe of bushes and now the doctors son stepped forward parted the branches and peered eagerly out on the bosom of the lake  hello he cried with something of joy in his voice  is it the boat  yes  and now snap came forward  there it is just rounding yonder bend of the shore  hurry up well catch the rascal who is running off with it  they had seen the craft piled high with their outfit  a single person was at the oarsa boy by his size  he was pulling leisurely  maybe he wont come ashore and we cant follow him out on the lake said snap  we wont have to follow him  but if he wont come in  well make him and the doctors son raised his shotgun significantly  thats so i forgot about our guns  of course hell come in if we threaten to shoot him  the boys quickened their footsteps and soon reached a point opposite to where the rowboat was moving along  hi you stop yelled shep loudly  stop i say  at the command the boy in the boat ceased rowing and looked around curiously  who called he asked in a low but distinct voice  i did went on the doctors son  turn in here with that boat and be quick about it  what do you mean by running off with our property  why i declare gasped snap as he caught a good look at the face of the lad in the rowboat  shep do you recognize him  hes the lad from the circusthe young acrobat who ran away     chapter xii  the circus boys story   snap was right it was indeed the youthful circus performer  he looked as thin as ever but his face bore a far more healthy color than when the young hunters had seen him before  i say what do you mean by running off with our boat repeated the doctors son wrathfully  is this your boat asked the circus boy calmly  it is  i didnt run off with it  i found it drifting along the shore and i took off my shoes and socks and waded in after it  you didnt run off with it asked snap  i give you my word of honor replied the boy quickly  he ran the boat to shore and stepped out  if its your property im glad to hand it over to you  isay didnt i see you somewhere before he demanded excitedly  i rather guess you didat the circus replied shep  oh  you were the fellows whowho talked to jones the ringmaster  exactly  and youre the chap who ran away  thats true i did run away  can you blame me  they half starved me and beat me and wanted me to go up on the trapeze after i had had a spell of sickness  we saw you on a freight train leaving rallings  oh did you  yes i left town on a freight  it was the easiest way to goand the cheapest  and the boy smiled quietly  now give us the truth about our boat said shep sternly  you ran off with it last night didnt you  no sir and the boy looked the doctors son squarely in the eyes i never took any property that didnt belong to me in my life  and where did you find the boat  about half a mile from here along the shore  i made up my mind it had broken loose somehow and i thought if i found the owner he mighterthat is  give you a reward suggested snap  something about the lads manner pleased him  well he might give me something to eat  hungry  the boy nodded  well well give you something to eatall you wantif you are quite sure you didnt take the boat answered the doctors son  i told you the truth  then get into the boat again and well row to our camp  the three got in the strange boy sitting in the stern  shep and snap took up the oars and soon the craft was heading for the cove where it had been tied up the night before  a shot was fired to notify giant and whopper that the boat had been found  whats your name asked snap on the way  tommy cabot but up to the show they called me buzz  are your folks with the circus  my folks are deadthat is my father and mother are  ive got a sister somewhere older than myself but i dont know just where she is  how did you happen to go with the circus asked shep  they picked me up at centerport  they saw that i was limber and could do a turn or two and they made me join  they promised me good wages and a fine time but as soon as we got on the road they treated me worse than my dog  your dog  yes  i had a dog and i said i wouldnt join unless they took the dog too  jones wanted me to give him the doghe was a fine colliebut i wouldnt do it and when i left i took my dog with me  where is he now  i dont know  he ran away several days ago and i havent seen him since  and he was a collie asked snap  yes tommy cabots eyes brightened expectantly  you havent seen him have you  he must be somewhere around these lakes  we found a doga collie  hes got a tag on his collarnumber 444  my dog cried the circus boy  oh ill be glad to see him  hes my best friend even if he did run away  anyway i guess he went to get something to eat  i hadnt much for him  what do you call your dog asked the doctors son  wagsbecause he moves his tail so much  well i never  thats what we dubbed him  tell me broke in snap  do you know what happened at the circus after you left  i heard that some of the animals got away  i didnt hear the particulars  i went down among the farms and laid low waiting for the circus to go east  a lion got away and also abe the educated chimpanzee  the circus folks think those men who were discharged and you were responsible  me  i didnt do it and i never had anything to do with those men who were discharged  they were a hard crowd  a little later the camp was gained  as soon as the dog saw tommy cabot he became frantic with joy and leaped up and licked the hand of his youthful master  tommy fairly hugged wags to his breast  of course whopper and giant were surprised to see the circus boy and glad to know the boat had been found  how the craft had gotten loose was a mystery nobody was able to solve  a substantial breakfast was prepared for the circus boy and while he was eating he told his story in detailhow his parents had died years before and how his sister grace had been taken by some friends in the middle west  i sold papers and blacked boots for a living and i learned to do handsprings and the like said tommy  then the circus came along and i went with it taking wags  some of the circus men were kind to me but most of them were rough and jones and casso were cruel when i ran away i made up my mind id never go back but would try to get work in some city and also try to find my sister grace  but i ran short of money and then i came out here thinking i could get work on some farm or go with some sportsmen to carry their traps for em  but i didnt find any farms out here and the only sportsmen i met were some welldressed young fellows who jeered me and called me a scarecrowi suppose on account of my shabby clothes  the circus boy still wore the big suit of rags the young hunters had noticed before  must have been ham spink and his crowd murmured whopper  it would be just like them to do that  in spite of the color in his cheeks the young hunters could see that the circus lad was far from strong  he was nervous and evidently needed plenty of food and a rest  having heard the runaways tale snap and the others told something about themselves  tommy listened with keen interest and presently his eyes showed considerable enthusiasm  i wish i was going with you he said  such an outing would suit me down to the ground  i can cook some and i could wash the dishes and cut wood and keep the camp in order and all that but i dont suppose youd want me along in these old duds and he looked sadly at his torn and faded suit so much too big for him  oh we might fit you out with a sweater and a cap said snap  the more he saw of the circus boy the better he liked the young fellow but i dont know he added hastily looking at his chums  we didnt expect to take anybody said the doctors son slowly but you might stay with us for a day or two anywayand we can talk it over  we ought to be better acquainted before we make a bargain  he could help us take our outfit to the mountains said giant  we could pay him for the work  i dont want any pay  just give me my meals and it will be all right  we can settle the whole thing later said shep  but you can stay for the present  wasnt it queer cried whopper  we found your dog and you found our boat  it was queerbut im glad of it for it kind of squares up answered the circus boy  i dont know how much you think of your boat but i think a whole lot of wags  if we hadnt got the boat back our outing would have been spoiled said the doctors son  but come if we are going fishing let us start at once  we can do the rest of our talking after our lines are in     chapter xiii  some fine fishing   the four boy hunters were soon down at the lake shore preparing their hooks and lines  tommy cabot went along and while they fished he sat and watched them  this beats being with a circus all hollow said the young acrobat  i always thought circus life was fine declared giant  it ison the outside  but on the inside  no more of it for me  did they pay you much questioned whopper  i was supposed to get ten dollars a week but i didnt  every time payday came around theyd deduct something for extras i had had and things they said i had broken or torn or lost so i usually got two or three dollars and that i had to spend on clothing shoesand eating for the meals werent heavy at the show then one night some scamp stole my suit and i had to buy these from one of the workmen  i got em cheap but they arent much good and tommy smiled grimly as he surveyed the dilapidated garments  at fishing the boys were highly successful  snap caught the first fisha goodsized perchand the doctors son followed with a fine pickerel  then came whopper with another pickerel  for a while giant caught nothing  whats the matter giant queried snap  you are usually our best angler  oh wait i havent begun yet returned the small youth  scarcely had he spoken when he felt a tug and commenced to play a fish with vigor  that it was a large specimen of the finny tribe was evident by the way the rod bent and the line snapped and hummed  look out or youll lose him cried whopper excitedly  let giant alonehe knows how to play any fish said snap  thats what added the doctors son  the others forgot their lines in watching giant  up came the line for fifty feet and then out it would rush  but at last he commenced to reel in steadily and then with a swing he lifted his catch bodily and allowed it to drop on the grass where it flounced and flopped vigorously for a moment  a maskalonge cried the other boys simultaneously  and a big one added whopper  tell you what  it takes giant to haul in the big fish was snaps comment  no little chaps for him  the catching of the maskalonge enthused all and they went to fishing with renewed vigor  by dinnertime they had eighteen fish to their credit a few little ones and some weighing two and three pounds  say you fellows will have plenty of fish to eat remarked the boy from the circus  well you shall have your share added snap quickly  which puts me in mind that it must be near feeding time  shall i get some wood and start up the fire asked tommy  if you will  at once the circus boy started off and when the others got back to camp they found a fine blaze going with plenty of wood near by to keep it up  tommy was washing the leftover dishes and had set a kettle of water to boil  he certainly isnt lazy whispered snap to shep  if we take him along hell earn his food  yes and if he does the camp work that will give us more time to rest and take pictures returned the doctors son  boys i move we take a swim this afternoon cried giant while they were sitting around waiting for some fish to cook  it will be our last chance before going to the mountains and the water is just right  second the motion returned snap  so say we all of us sang out whopper  ive been dying for a swim for the last ten years  dying again  poor boy sighed shep  now if youll only live  he got no further for coming up behind him whopper pulled him over on the grass  as he went rolling he caught his tormentor by the ankles and down came whopper  then over and over rolled both lads up against giant who joined in the tussle goodnaturedly  look out for the fire yelled snap and as they rolled close to the flames he tried to force them back  then down he went himself and the mixup became more strenuous than ever  it was good healthy fun and tommy cabot stood by with a broad grin on his face enjoying it thoroughly  as they rolled toward the woods he picked up an armful of leaves and scattered it over the crowd  the tussle lasted for full five minutes and then the various boys sat up almost exhausted  guess youve got an appetite for dinner now observed the boy from the circus  appetite cried whopper  i could eat a house and lot  with the fence and barn thrown in added giant  they washed up a bit and soon had dinner consisting of baked maskalonge pancakes and chocolate  for dessert they had apples  now well rest for an hour and then go swimming said shep and so it was decided  all took a nap tommy lying down on the grass with the faithful wags beside him  while fishing the boys had selected a spot for swimming where the bottom was sloping and sandy  they went in together the circus boy with the others  you can swim asked snap  oh yes  and if i couldnt wags would take care of me answered tommy  just see him tow me  and getting a stick he called the collie  wags took hold of the end and commenced to swim along dragging his young master after him  hurrah for wags shouted whopper  when i get tired ill have him haul me along for a while  evidently the collie enjoyed the bath as much as did the boys  they remained in the water for the best part of an hour racing diving and doing various stunts  when they came out snap declared it was the best swim he had ever had  its a pity we wont be able to swim in the mountains said giant  well we cant expect to have everything returned the doctors son  having dried off and dressed the boys returned to camp and spent the rest of the afternoon in getting ready to move early in the morning  it was decided to hide the boat in the bushes and leave a portion of their outfit in the craft tied down under the tarpaulin they would carry with them all the things needed for several days so that a second trip would not be necessary until they felt like taking it  ill carry a share said tommy  im feeling stronger than i was  well give you a small load answered the doctors son  they retired early and were up at sunrise  tommy renewed the camp fire and they had a meal of fish and wheatcakes with coffee  then the tent was taken down and packed along with the other things  now put out the fire and well be off said shep and he saw to it personally that every spark of the blaze was extinguished  as my old readers know the boy hunters knew only too well what a forest fire meant and they had no desire to start such a conflagration  their route now lay over some hills that were more or less strange to them  but they had received many instructions from jed sanborn and thought they would have little trouble in gaining a trail back of the hills that led into the windy mountains  are the mountains really windy asked snap as they began the climb up the hills back of the lake each with a goodsized load strapped to his back  they are only windy at certain times of the year answered the doctors son  but when it blows why it blows so jed sanborn said  then well have to put our tent up good and strong came from whopper  we dont want to wake up some night and find ourselves blown into the middle of next year  and dying to know how we are going to get back added giant dryly  giant if you say dying again began whopper  save your wind boys interrupted shep  weve got a long and hard climb before us  what the doctors son said about the climb was truethe way was a steady pull upward and they had frequently to stop to get their breath  it was nearly eleven oclock when they reached the top of the hill  they had been on the upgrade for three hours  let us rest until after dinner said snap  no use killing ourselves  weve still got some miles to go answered shep  i know itbut it will be mostly down gradeat least until we reach the foot of the mountains  it was decided to rest and all of the young hunters willingly slipped their loads and sat down  below them was firefly lake with lake cameron in the distance on one side and lake narsac in the distance on the other  back of them lay the windy mountains with a hollow of trees and bushes between  the boys viewed the mountains with interest thinking of the outing they hoped to have there     chapter xiv  after deer with gun and camera   i hope we strike a good camping spot by night said snap for unless i miss my guess it will rain before morning  oh dont say rain cried giant  we can do without rain  it may not be a lasting storm but some rain will come mark my words  i think i see the trail up the mountains said whopper who was looking through a pair of fieldglasses  anyway its path of some kind  the others gave a look and all decided that whopper was right  resuming their loads after the noonday repast they started down the hill in the direction of windy mountains  they had some big bare rocks to cover and slipped and slid over these as best they could and then plunged straight into a thick woods  ought to be hunting here if anywhere observed shep  looks as if it was new ground for sportsmen  beware of sink holes cried whopper as he reached a rather soft spot  we dont want to go down as we did the other time we were out  look exclaimed the doctors son as they came to a small opening in the woods  deer or ill eat my cap  he pointed to some bushes and tender saplings growing near  the bushes had been nibbled and so had the bark on the saplings showing  that some animal had been there  i believe you are right and if so we may get a shot answered giant  yes a shotbut not until after we have used our cameras answered the doctors son  dont forget the first object of this outingto get some good pictures  right you are shep i forgot  but we must shoot the deerafter we have our photos  better sight the game first came from snap  with the thoughts of bringing down one or more deer filling their minds the boy hunters did not care so much about making a camp for the night  if necessary they knew they could erect their tent anywhere and take it down again in the morning  even the prospect of rain did not daunt them  let us hurry said shep  if we reach the deer we want to do it while it is light enough to take some pictures  with their cameras and guns ready for use they went on tommy cautioning the dog to be silent  wags seemed to understand and even acted as if he might lead them to the game  but he was not trained so they took no chances on this  deep in a hollow they came upon the unmistakable hoofmarks of three deer  they followed these through the woods and to a small clearing at a clump of bushes the doctors son called a halt  i think they may be near he whispered  if so we want to go slow or theyll get away from us  perhaps youd better go ahead and take a look said snap sure that that was what his chum desired  the loads were slipped to the ground and they went on shep well in advance  suddenly the doctors son put up one hand  it was a signal that the game was in sight  snap whispered to tommy to stop and hold the collie  there they are by yonder rocks said the doctors son pointing with his finger  we can all get good pictures i think  let us spread out a little  they did as he advised  the three deer were close together grazing the boys came up almost breathlessly and each snapped his camera for two films or plates  at the first clicking one of the deer evidently the leader raised his head  scenting the air he made a beautiful sight  for just an instant he stood still then gave a snort and started to run  shoot em cried shep and swinging his camera out of the way he caught up his firearm  but snap was ahead of him and bang went his piece  bang bang bang went the others in rapid succession then wags began to bark furiously and tommy let him go  after the game he leaped at his topmost speed  the first volley from the shotguns laid one of the deer low while a second was slightly wounded and began to limp away  the other deer kept on running and soon disappeared into the dense forest  come onlet us get that wounded deer cried whopper  there goes wags after him shouted tommy  that dog will get killed if he doesnt look out answered snap who knew only too well how a cornered deer can fight  but wags was too wise to get within reach of the deers hoofs and head  he raced around and around the game simply worrying it  coming closer the boy hunters watched their chances and snap took another shot followed by giant  these were fatal and limping a few feet farther the deer staggered and fell and soon breathed its last  call off the dog ordered the doctors son  but this was unnecessary for after a single sniff wags retired and did not attempt to molest the game  talk about luck cried whopper swinging his cap in the air  i call this prime  two deer first crack out of the box  yes and see the fine pictures we got added snap  that is i trust they are all right he added hastily  did you change your films and plates asked the doctors son  all had and they guarded jealously those containing the precious exposures  now we must take some more photos said shep  well get tommy to snap us holding up the deer on poles  we can label the two pictures before shooting and after  thats the stuff cried giant slangily  two poles were soon cut and a deer slung on each and while shep and snap raised up one whopper and giant raised the other  tommy had been instructed as to what to do and he took a snapshot or a time picture with each camera so that they would have plenty of films and plates in case one or more proved failures  its a bit extravagant said the doctors son  but well not have such game pictures every day  when we simply take scenery one plate or one film will do  when we make camp we can hang the deer in front of the tent and get another view said snap  yes and get a view of our big string of fish before we eat em all up added giant  well one thing is certain said whopper after they had surveyed their prizes thoroughly we cant get to the windy mountains by tonight with such a load  in that case we might as well make two bites of the trip and camp here for tonight said shep  i reckon this spot is as good as any theres a brook with good water for the deer have been using it  theres another reason for going into camp came from snap  just look at the sky over to the west  all gazed in the direction mentioned and saw heavy black clouds just showing over the treetops  the clouds advanced rapidly soon covering the sun  then came the rumble of distant thunder  a thunderstorm exclaimed tommy  i dont like them at all what shall we do  put up the tent as quickly as we can ordered the doctors son that storm may last all night and we want to keep dry if we can  in great haste they selected some saplings and cut them down for tent poles and pegs  then they got out the canvas and put it up driving in the pegs that held it as deeply as possible  the tent was erected on some sloping ground and behind it they cut a v in the soil so that the water might run off on either side instead of across the flooring of the shelter  then they cut some brushwood for couches and hauled it inside  here comes the storm cried snap presently and scarcely had he spoken when there came a rush of wind followed by some big drops of rain  then came more wind swaying the tent violently and causing the sides to bulge out like a balloon  a torrent of water followed and all of the boys were glad enough to crawl under the tent and tie the opening in front tight shut behind them     chapter xv  in the mountains at last   the boys and even the dog put in a thoroughly uncomfortable night it thundered and lightened for two hours and for the larger portion of the time the downpour was so heavy that it was impossible for the vshaped trench behind the tent to carry it off  consequently some of the water rushed directly across the flooring of the shelter wetting the brushwood cut for sleeping purposes  to keep their shoes and socks dry the young hunters went barefooted  once the wind cut loose a corner of the tent and despite the rain shep and snap had to go out and cut longer pegs with which to fasten the ropes  they had on rubber coats but still got a good deal of water in their faces and down their necks  it was impossible to light a camp fire and so they had to eat a cold supper of such things as chanced to be handy  they could not lie down and had to sit on little stacks of the damp brushwood with their bare feet in the water and mud  say this is dead loads of fun was whoppers sarcastic comment just as funny as doing an example in algebra or writing a composition on the decay of the roman empire  are you dying to began giant when a vigorous pinch on the arm from whopper stopped him  wow  let up  then you let up  i will  by midnight the worst of the storm was over but it still rained steadily and this kept up until almost daybreak  but then the wind shifted and the clouds scattered rapidly  utterly worn out the boys leaned against the tent poles and caught such cat naps as they could  when the young hunters finally emerged from the tent a surprise awaited them  tommy was ahead of them and the circus boy had cut such dry wood as he could find and started a big blaze  more than this he had put on a kettle of water to boil  good for you tommy cried the doctors son  well soon have a hot cup of coffee to cheer us and we can dry out the tent and our clothing while we get breakfast  thats about the worst night i can remember said whopper  my how it did pour at first  i thought sure wed be washed down into some hillside torrent and into the lake  they placed all the damp things close to the fire to dry and put on their socks and shoes  then giant and whopper assisted by tommy prepared a rather elaborate breakfast of fish and venison steaks  we deserve a square meal said giant  it will put new vigor into us  and his words proved true  by the time they had finished the repast they were ready to joke over the discomforts through which they had passed  but one storm is enough said snap  i trust it stays clear after this  the woods were so wet it was decided not to travel through them until after dinner  the sun came out strongly and in the clear sky thus presented the boys managed to get several pleasing photographs one was of tommy and his dog sitting on a rock and this was so good that when shown later it was very much admired  they also took a photograph of giant and whopper with the strings of fish  late that afternoon found them at the foot of the windy mountains here they discovered a welldefined trail and also a signboard telling them the game preserve in which dr reed was interested was just beyond  now we havent much farther to go said the doctors son  my father said wed find a good camping spot less than a mile from here  im glad of it answered giant  this load on my back isnt as light as it might be  pushing on they soon came to where another signboard had been located but the board had been knocked off with a stone or a hammer and was missing  some hunters meanness was snaps comment  a fellow who would destroy a signboard ought to be locked up was whoppers comment  its about on a par with starting a forest fire  they trudged on and presently came to where somebody had had a camp fire  here were some empty tins and some wellpicked bones giant kicked over one of the empty tins  hello i know who was here he cried  ham spink and his crowd  how do you know demanded the doctors son  because i know they had some of this brand of canned goods with emsaw it among their supplies  its different from the kind we have or what you can get in the regular stores  the spinks have their goods sent by freight from the city  giant must be right said snap  and look here will you  as he spoke snap pulled from the dead embers of the fire a halfburned bit of wood  it was part of a signboard  humph the signboard that was missing below here muttered shep ham and his crowd were too lazy to cut firewood so they used the board  if that isnt the height of laziness and meanness  its against the law to destroy signboards said whopper  that crowd ought to be brought to book for this  if you said anything theyd say we did it responded snap  ham would do anything to keep out of trouble and get us into a muss  that camp fire was built after the storm said the doctors son that proves the spink crowd cant be far from here  if they are near us we want to be on our guard observed giant theyd like no better fun than to steal our things  they havent forgotten what happened on the lakes this summer and last winter  the boy hunters were bound for a spot mentioned to them by dr reed and jed sanborn  it was a small dent in the mountain side where were located a fine spring of cool water with a rocky brook beyond  some distance farther was a cut in the mountain with a tiny lake surrounded by cedars and called cedar lake  it was nightfall when they reached the dent and the spring  all were thirsty and the sparkling water was very refreshing  father says that some day hell organize a company to bottle this water said shep  he is sure it will command a large sale in the big citiesit is so clear and pure  it couldnt be better answered snap  he looked around him  and what an ideal spot for our camp  it assuredly was ideal in every respect  they could see for miles to the east south and west over hill after hill covered with green trees and brushwood with ribbons of water between and here and there a lake  using the fieldglasses they could make out the church steeple of fairview and some other buildings  between the hills they could see various farms with the cattle grazing in the pastures or standing in groups in the barnyards  all was as silent and as calm as one could wish  what a place for a castle like those of old murmured snap as his eyes roamed over the scene  just think of this in the light of the full moon  snap is getting romantic came from whopper  come on down to the earth sonny and help pitch the tent or youll have to sleep out in that moonlight tonight and run the risk of getting moonstruck and this remark brought forth a laugh in which even snap joined  as tired as they were the five boys cut the necessary poles and hoisted the tent  as this was to be a permanent camp for some weeks they erected the shelter with care and around it dug a deep trench with another trench to carry rain down the mountain side so that none might run over the flooring as it had during the thunderstorm  then they spent considerable time in cutting down some heavy cedar boughs for bedding  snap whopper and tommy did this latter work and while it was going on shep and giant got together some flat stones and built something of a fireplace and a stove not far from the tents entrance  then they cut firewood and soon had a generous blaze started and put the kettle on to boil  and are we going to stay here for a while and just hunt and fish andand rest asked the boy from the circus  yes answered shep  dont you like it  like it  i think its thethe best ever  couldnt be better was the hearty reply  i think it will make you fat and strong tommy and thats what you need  and another thing answered the boy  those circus people cant find me out here  its not likely  everybody was glad that a permanent camp had been reached at last and that night all slept like rocks to use giants way of expressing it  they left wags on guard but this was unnecessary for nothing came to disturb them  the next day was spent in perfecting the camp and in taking care of what remained of the fish and of the venison  the skins were nailed up in the sun to dry  the boys were sorry they could not keep all of the meat but this was impossible as they had no ice and no means of smoking or pickling it  here comes somebody cried whopper while they sat around waiting for supper which snap and tommy were preparing  two boys were approaching and as they came closer the young hunters recognized ham spink and his close crony carl dudder     chapter xvi  a visit from the enemy   wonder what they want whispered shep as the newcomers drew closer  perhaps they have only come out of idle curiosity returned snap  well in that case they had better stay away grumbled giant  ham spink and carl dudder came up slowly  to tell the truth they were a bit afraid thinking the others might jump on them and begin a fight because of what had happened at the fairview dock  hello said ham presently  he did not know how else to start a conversation  hello yourself responded the doctors son shortly  going to camp out here eh went on the dudish youth  oh no weve opened an oyster house returned whopper who was bound to have his fun  humph  frank dawson you neednt get funny  was i funny  i didnt see you laugh  you know what i mean  expect to do some big hunting i suppose said carl dudder with a bit of a sneer in his tones  we generally do pretty well when we are out responded snap  following us up eh  not at all  yes you are  you knew we were coming here  and you know who this tract of land belongs to now said the doctors son  it isnt fenced in answered carl and his face took on a leer anybody can hunt here who wants to  that is truebut it will be fenced in next season  and by the way what right had you to tear down one of the signboards and use it for firewood  who said we did that demanded ham  we saw the halfburned board at your camp fire  you cant blame that on us cried carl  we can and do responded snap  you ought to be locked up for it  oh give us a rest growled ham  what brought you here demanded snap sharply  oh we knew we were being followedsaw you from a distanceand made up our mind to see who it was  i dont see why you cant leave us alone  we are not following you said giant and if youll leave us alone well not bother you  but you have got to keep your distance added whopper  no more underhanded work like we had before  understand  ham paid no attention to the last words  he and his crony were looking at tommy  now they whispered together  say arent you the kid that ran away from the circus demanded ham turning to the small youth  at the question tommy looked surprised and then scared  whawhat do you know about me he stammered  answer me ordered ham  you ran away from cassos railroad shows didnt you  dont tell him a thing tommy cried snap quickly  it is none of his business  ha i knew i was right cried ham triumphantly  youre the boy they called buzz the human fly  i saw you perform at chester and i heard later about your running away  and you helped to let a lion and a chimpanzee escape too  i did not cried tommy  the men who were discharged let those animals get away  i had nothing whatever to do with it  oh yes thats your story but the circus people tell it differently  put in carl dudder  i was talking to one of them only the other day  theyd give a good deal to catch you and those men  as he spoke he advanced toward tommy as if to catch hold of the lad the boy from the circus shrank back and looked very much alarmed  here carl dudder you leave that boy alone cried the doctors son  dont you dare to touch him  ill do as i please  the boy doesnt belong to you blustered carl  i know thatbut you are not going to lay the weight of your finger on him  dont do it whispered ham to his crony in alarm  remember they are five to two  i think there is a reward for this boy answered carl in an equally low tone of voice  well if there is keep mum and we may be able to get it  there was an awkward pause  tommy looked appealingly at the doctors son and his other friends  dont you worry they shant touch you said shep kindly  they are big bullies thats all  we know them thoroughly  are you going to stay here asked ham  that is our business answered snap  where have you located  that is our business  so it is but i want you to understand once for all ham spink that this time you must keep your distance  if you try to molest us in any way youll get the worst of it  how long are you going to stay  that is our business too  come on ham said carl in a low voice  what is the use of talking to them at all  let us get back to our own camp and let them take care of themselves  all right if you say so answered ham spink and turning on his heel he walked back the way he had come with his crony beside him  now what brought those chaps here demanded snap as soon as their enemies were out of hearing  no good ill wager that  oh i guess they just wanted to come and say something said giant  let us have supper  im too hungry to wait any longer  supper was had and the boy hunters and tommy sat around the camp fire for two hours discussing the situation and planning what they would do for the days to come  it was decided to pay a visit to the lake for the remainder of the supplies two days laterafter they had hunted and taken pictures and rested up a little  the two days passed quickly  the boy hunters saw and heard nothing of the spink crowd and almost forgot about them  they went out for game and managed to bring down some rabbits squirrels and some fine quail and also a pinemarten  they took over a dozen pictures of the game and also of the scenery and shep managed to get a fine photograph of an old owl as he sat on a tree limb  the boys made no effort to shoot the owl for he really seemed friendly and did not offer to fly away  it was decided that tommy and whopper should remain at the camp while the other three made the trip to firefly lake  take good care of things while we are gone cautioned the doctors son  dont let the spink crowd get the best of you  well watch out answered whopper  if  they try any funny business well shoot them into the middle of next year  oh dont shoot anybody cried snap  well you know what i mean answered the youth who loved to exaggerate  shep and the others had expected to start off directly after breakfast but snap had to fix one of his shoes and this delayed them  but by ten oclock they were on the way the others waving them a fond farewell  well look for you by tomorrow night said tommy  it was an easy matter to climb down the mountain side but the walk up the hill that separated them from the lake was another story yet as they had only their guns to carry they made good progress and by the middle of the afternoon they were in plain sight of the body of water where they had left the boat  somebody ahead of us cried snap presently and pointed out three persons walking toward the lake  i wonder if they can be members of the spink crowd was sheps comment  let us get closer and see     chapter xvii  what happened under the cliff   it was presently made evident to our friends that the persons ahead were ham spink carl dudder and a lad named dick bush who had in former years been a close personal friend to ham  wonder where they are going asked snap  down to the lake answered the doctors son  most likely to where they left their boat  let us keep behind them and out of sight suggested giant  if they see us they may follow us up and damage our boat after we are gone  so although they kept the spink crowd well in sight they took good care not to show themselves  reaching the lake shore ham spink and his friends came to a halt behind a clump of willows overhanging the water  close by the others saw a rowboat tied up  that must be their boat whispered snap  most likely they came for the same purpose that we didto get supplies  listen whispered the doctors son  i just heard somebody mention my name  their boat must be somewhere along here they heard ham spink exclaim  and if it iswell fix it all right finished carl dudder  well thats all right expostulated dick bush  but we dont want to do anything unlawful  they might have us arrested  they wont know who did it answered ham  what do you think of doing if you locate their boat asked dick  well take out the supplies and hide em and then fill the boat with rocks and sink her answered ham  that will be doing em up brown chuckled carl  well i dont know about this answered dick bush doubtfully he was not quite so lawless in his ideas as were the others  oh it will be all right we wont hurt the boat any answered ham  come on the quicker we locate the boat the better  as soon as weve fixed their boat we can come back here and get our things and hurry back to camp  and then the three boys moved along down the lake shore  well wouldnt that jar you cried snap when the other crowd was gone  hide our supplies and sink our boat  well i guess not  they havent turned in the right direction to find our boat returned the doctors son  we can get it out of the way before they come back  we ought to pay them for this murmured giant  let us take their boat and row it up the lake  it will give em something to do to find it  thats the talk cried snap  as the old saying goes what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander jump in and well take the boat to where we left our own  they soon had the spink rowboat untied and leaping aboard they shoved the craft out into the lake  then snap and shep took the oars and they were soon moving up firefly lake  they kept close to the overhanging trees and bushes so that the other crowd might not discover what was taking place  the distance to where they had left their own craft was not quite half a mile and they reached the spot in less than a quarter of an hour  they pulled inshore to find their boat just as it had been left  now the quicker we work the better said the doctors son  ive got an idea he went on as he caught sight of a tiny island about a hundred feet from shore  why not tie their boat fast over there  then if they want it they can swim for it  good cried snap and grinned  taking their own boat along they rowed to the island and there the spink craft was made fast on the side next to the main shore and in plain view of anybody who might be passing  on the shore of the island snap stuck up one of the oars and on the top placed a rubber boot he found in the rowboatone of a pair ham had brought along in case of prolonged wet weather  ham will recognize that rubber boot said snap  and then hell know the boat is his  the sight of the rubber boot on the top of the oar was a comical one and the boys had to laugh as they looked at it  having fastened the boat so that it could not possibly drift away the boys boarded their own craft and rowed still farther up firefly lake until they came to a cove and a creek the latter thickly overhung with bushes  they pulled the craft out of sight so that to find it without knowing where it was located would be practically impossible  now then to take our things and go into camp for the night said the doctors son  well have to find some shelter under the rocks not having a tent  the boys knew the locality fairly well from their previous visits and walked to where there was a split in the hills  here was located a rocky cliff hollowed out somewhat at the bottom  we can camp here said shep  with a camp fire in front the hollow will be quite comfortable  while in the cove they had managed to catch a few perch and a pickerel and starting a blaze they cooked these  they had some crackers and cheese along so made a comfortable if not an elaborate meal washing it down with a drink from a spring  we ought to get to bed early said snap  then we can start back for camp at sunrise and so get ahead of the spink crowd  oh they wont go back until they find their boat said giant  i dont know about that said the doctors son  they may get mad and lay it to us and start back tonight  you can never tell what ham spink and carl dudder will do  dick bush isnt quite so bad  as it was warm they allowed the fire to die down and by nine oclock all were sleeping soundly  they did not think it necessary to stand guard for the hollow was well screened from outside observation and they had all their traps behind them next to the cliff  how long he had been asleep the doctors son did not know but he awoke with a start feeling something pressing on his breast he gave a yell of fright and alarm and added another yell as he felt his leg pulled  then a dark body fled from the hollow and went crashing through the bushes beyond  whawhats the matter came in a stammering voice from giant  who was that demanded snap as in the darkness he felt for his gun  the fire was practically out and the hollow was intensely gloomy  i dont know ham spink maybe answered the doctors son much bewildered  he stood on me and pulled my foot he added  the boy hunters leaped up and after some trouble armed themselves it was dark around the cliff so they could see nothing  they listened intently and at a distance heard a peculiar noise and the rustling of some brushwood  shall i give em a shot suggested snap  no you might kill somebody answered shep  he raised his voice hi ham spink  come back here  we know you  to this call no answer was vouchsafed  again the boys listened but now the only sound that broke the stillness was the low wind in the tree branches overhead  he has gone whoever he was said snap  shep are you sure it was ham  not at all  i only thought it might be  for all i know it might have been a wild animal  what to pull your leg queried giant  well maybe he didnt really pull the leg  you see i was pretty sound asleep  but he or it jumped over me and back again  lets make a light and see if the outfit is ok suggested snap they had a small pocket lantern along and this was lit and an examination was made  see the sugar bag is bursted open cried the doctors son  the beans are scattered everywhere came from giant  and the cracker box is open and some of the crackers are missing added snap  that must have been the work of some enemy  he wanted to destroy our stores  but ii really dont think it was ham said shep slowly  it waswell it didnt seem like anybody of that crowd  i didnt get much of a look but it wasnt like ham or carl or dick  a wild animal might do this rooting around said snap  could it have been a bear  a bear ejaculated giant  dont say a bear rooted around here while we were asleep  why its enough to give a fellow heart failure thinking about it  wonder what time it is said the doctors son and felt for his watch  why i declare my watch is gone he exclaimed in consternation  just then snap saw something on the ground and picked it up  it was a shred of a red bandanna handkerchief  boys do you know what i think he said excitedly  i think our visitor was that wild hermit who lived in the lonely cabin in the woods  you mean the one whopper and i met asked shep  yes     chapter xviii  a fight with two wildcats   the doctors son and giant listened with interest to what their chum had to say  what makes you think it was the hermit asked shep  because of this bit of red handkerchief  whopper said he saw such a bandanna around the wild mans neck or head  gracious  so we did cried the doctors son  i had forgotten about it  but do you think that wild creature took my watch he added anxiously  yes unless you lost it on the way here  i didnt lose it before i went to sleep for i wound it up same as i do every night before retiring  let us take a look around for it suggested giant  a keen search was made but nothing that looked like a watch could be located anywhere  then as they were a bit cold the boys renewed the fire thus adding to the light  if that wild man or whatever he is took my watch i want it back declared the doctors son  do you think hed take it to that cabin in the woods with him questioned giant  more than likely  that must be a good way from here  it is  but you would want the watch if it was yours  of course  the boys talked the matter over for a quarter of an hour and then laid down to sleep once more leaving the camp fire burning brightly but the doctors son could not slumber soundly for his thoughts were on his missing timepiece which had been a present and a valuable one  they were up at sunrise and then another consultation was had  id like to look for the watch said snap  but if we dont get back to camp whopper and tommy will worry about usand there is no telling what the spink crowd will do in our absence  i suppose if that hermit has it the watch will be safe for a day or two answered the doctors son thoughtfully  we might go back to the camp first and then make a trip to the cabin in the woods  so it was decided and after a hasty breakfast they set off in the direction of the windy mountains  they took the same trail as before and on the walk kept their eyes open for game  they managed to bring down two grouse and a squirrel but that was all  they reached camp an hour after sundown much to the satisfaction of whopper and tommy who came to meet them  gosh but i am tired said snap as he threw his burden on the ground  i feel as if i wanted to rest for a week  a good nights sleep will make you change your mind answered the doctors son  supper was ready for them and they sat down gladly and partook of the things provided  during the day to pass the time whopper and tommy had baked a big pan of beans and another of biscuits and both were good  they had also tried their hand at baking some cake but this was a little burned  yet the boys ate it and declared it was all right  at home it might have been different but when one is out in the woods and doing ones own cookingwell there is no use in finding fault thats all  whopper and tommy listened with interest to what the others had to tell about the spink crowd and about the midnight visitor  they laughed heartily over what had been done to the rowboat and were serious over the loss of sheps watch  id be afraid to meet that wild man said tommy  why there is no telling what he would do if he was cornered  that is true answered shep  of course we can take our guns but id hate to shoot anybody even if it seemed necessary  maybe hell give in if we point our guns at him suggested whopper but i hardly think so  he may be as crazy as they make em and afraid of nothing  well ill think it over answered the doctors son thoughtfully he did not wish to expose his chums to danger nor did he wish to get into trouble himself  yet he felt the loss of the timepiece keenly  the young hunters looked for a visit from the spink crowd the next day but it did not come  instead it rained and they had to keep in the tent most of the time  but it cleared during the night and the days to follow were ideal  sunday passed and on monday shep snap and whopper went out on a hunt leaving giant and tommy in charge of the camp  giant declared he was going to take and develop some photographs using a daylight tank instead of a dark room for the latter process it had been decided that some of the party should visit the lonely cabin in the woods later in the week  the boys had seen some traces of wild beasts up the mountain side and thither they directed their steps keeping their eyes and ears on the alert as they proceeded  they had scarcely covered a quarter of a mile when they came upon the mutilated remains of a mink  hello what do you make of this cried snap as he pointed it out  a mink and some other wild beast killed it said whopper  do you suppose it was a bear asked snap  no most likely a wildcat or a big fox or wolf  lets go after em  they are no good for gameand that is what we are after  we might get some good photographs  thats soi never thought of that  filled with the idea of taking some pictures that might prove of value the boys hurried on through the woods and up the side of the mountain  shep cautioned the others to move as silently as possible so hardly a word was said  it was almost noon when they came to a flat spot where there was something of a clearing  here there was a spring and a pool and a fallen tree lay across both  wait whispered the doctors son  i think i see something  the others halted and shep advanced with increased caution bringing his camera to the front as he did so  the next instant he saw a sight that filled him with interest and pleasure  on the fallen tree spanning the pool rested two wildcats mates facing each other  both had their eyes closed and were evidently asleep  he motioned for the others to come up and in a few seconds all were ready to take pictures  the background was perfect and they felt this would be one of the finest subjects yet obtained  hardly daring to breathe one after another of the boys clicked the shutter of his camera and the negatives were taken  then they swung their cameras back and brought forward their shotguns  as they did this one of the wildcats suddenly opened its eyes and looked around  on the instant it let out a cry of rage and its back commenced to bristle  then the other wildcat leaped from the tree to the ground and crouched as if for a spring  fire came the command from the doctors son but this was not necessary for both snap and whopper blazed away as quickly as they could  the wildcat on the tree was hit and fell over into the pool with a loud splash  the other wildcat made a leap for snap and hit him in the shoulder  shoot him shoot him yelled snap in terror and did what he could to keep the beast from reaching his breast and throat  cant shootmight hit you answered the doctors son but then he came up on the side and blazed away at close quarters hitting the wildcat in the left hind leg  this caused the animal to drop to the ground where it twisted and turned so quickly that the eyes of the young hunters could scarcely follow it  the other wildcat had by this time climbed out of the pool  it gave itself a vigorous shake and turned as if to limp away  but then it espied its mate and stopped as if calculating on what to do next  shoot em sang out whopper and discharged his gun a second time  he hit the second wildcat in the back but the wounds were not serious and the beast still thrashed around snapping and snarling in a fashion that would have frightened any hunter  the shot from the gun awakened the fury of the first wildcat and crouching low it came toward whopper step by step its two eyes glowing like tiny electric lights  whopper tried to run but he was fascinated by the sight and too much overcome to move a step  look out whopper screamed snap and then he raised his own gun to take another shot  but the hammer merely clicked  he tried it again in increased haste and as a consequence shot wild the charge going over the wildcats head  then the wildcat made a leap striking whopper and hurling him over backward  as he went down the second wildcat lurched itself forward and in a twinkling both were on the young hunter snapping and snarling as though about to eat him up     chapter xix  some unlookedfor game   it was a moment of dire peril and no one realized it more than did the young hunter who had been attacked by the two wild beasts of the forest  like a flash he rolled over and doubled up to prevent the wildcats from reaching his head and neck  this quick movement sent the animals to the ground and as they landed snap jumped forward and struck one of the wildcats with the stock of his gun  it was a telling blow for by luck more than judgment it crushed the beasts skull  the attack on its mate caused the other wildcat to pause  then filled with a sudden fear and failing to get at whoppers throat it commenced to retreat  its running away shouted snap  kill it shep  the doctors son had been dancing around trying to get in a shot without injuring whopper  now he leveled his shotgun and banged away  it was a closerange hit and the head of the wildcat was almost blown from the body  it was several seconds before the three boy hunters realized that the battle was at an end  slowly whopper turned over and looked at the two dead animals  he rose to his feet panting heavily  are they boboth dead he asked  as dead as nails answered snap  i thought i waswas going to bebe chewed up  it was a narrow escape  say after this do you know what i think  i think we had better kill the beasts first and take the pictures afterward  then well not have such good photos returned the doctors son  yes but what good are photos to a fellow if he gets killed questioned whopper ruefully  well have to be more careful thats all said snap  what shall we do with the wildcats  leave them here for all i care answered the doctors son the skins are not much good at this time of year and after such handling  the three boys rested for a while and then took a picture of the dead wildcats with themselves in the background  so that all might get in the pictures they set their cameras on rocks and worked them by means of threads of black linen  i am afraid our shots have scared away all the game in this vicinity remarked the doctors son as they trudged forward once more  and so it seemed for nothing came into view for the next hour  then snap sighted some rabbits but before he could get a shot the game was out of sight  at noon they rested in a glade that commanded a fine view of the surrounding country and each of the boys took several time pictures with small lens openings so as to get sharp outlines  it was well on toward the middle of the afternoon when they came upon the trail of a deer  it looked to be quite fresh and this filled them with the hope of catching up to the game  we want to be mighty quiet cautioned snap who was in the lead the wind is uncertain and may carry the slightest sound to the deer  it will carry our scent too answered whopper  that we cant help and will have to chance  they followed the trail for fully half a mile through something of a hollow between the mountains  here they came on quite a pond much to their surprise  the pond was filled with lilies and other flowers and on one side was a series of rocks leading to quite a cliff  what a beautiful spot for a cabin cried shep forgetting all about the deer for a moment  why not take some pictures suggested snap  we may not come this way again  the doctors son was willing and they took several views one of whopper with his hand full of water lilies  the trail of the deer led around the rocky elevation and the three young hunters were moving through some low brushwood when of a sudden they heard a noise ahead of them  whats that asked whopper  bless me if i know whispered the doctors son  get your guns ready  here comes a deer shouted snap and an instant later a magnificent buck burst into view rushing around the other end of the cliff it appeared and disappeared so quickly that to get a shot was all but impossible  well of all the chumps cried snap in disgust  why didnt somebody let drive  why didnt you asked shep  i couldntthe rocks were in the way  well the rocks were in my way too  how can a fellow shoot at a streak of greased lightning asked whopper  that buck was making a hundred miles a minute  well thats the end of that game muttered snap much crestfallen boys it looks as if we were going to be skunked today  oh weve got a couple of hours yet said the doctors son  but i guess we had better turn back toward camp  we dont want to miss our way in the dark  let us go on a little said whopper  i imagine that buck got scared at something and id like to know what it was  maybe a bear said snap  and if it is you can be sure mr bruin will walk right away from us while we are thinking about a shot he added bitterly  he was disgusted to think they had allowed both the rabbits and the deer to get away from them  all of the boys were curious to know if anything had really frightened the buck and they went forward but this time more cautiously than ever  passing the cliff they came to a hillside overgrown with cedars and brushwood with many loose stones between  here they had to progress even more slowly for walking was treacherous and none of them had a desire to twist an ankle or break a leg  i dont see a thing said the doctors son presently  its a mighty lonely place isnt it  i fancied i saw something move just beyond yonder clump of cedars said whopper pointing with his hand  whopper is seeing things said snap laughing  i guess the wildcats and the deer got on his nerves  well dont believe me if you dont want to answered whopper rather testily  well see if there is anything in it anyway answered the doctors son  but i am not going any farther than those cedars  i am getting tiredand it is high time we turned back unless we want to remain away from camp all night  no i want to get back too answered snap  sleeping out of doors is all well enough once in a while but i prefer to be under some kind of a roof even if its only canvas  the three boys moved forward once again each with his gun ready for use should anything worth shooting appear  they came up to the cedars and were then able to look beyond where the mountain side was full of rocks with numerous holes between  oh yelled snap at the top of his lungs  look  all gazed in the direction indicated and for once they were fairly rooted to the spot  before them on a flat rock stood a large and magnificent lion gazing boldly at them     chapter xx  on the mountain side   for fully ten seconds the lion did not move and during that time the young hunters stood spellbound  then the foreign monarch of the forest turned and like a flash disappeared into a hole on the mountain side  diddidwas it really a lion gasped whopper when he could speak  it certainly wasand a big one too answered the doctors son  but here began snap  we dont have lions in america  it must be the one that got away from the circus cried shep  to be sure  why didnt i think of that came from whopper  sure as youre a foot high that is the circus lion  but how did he get away out here  thats easy to explain answered the doctors son  he left town and took to the woods and his quest for food brought him here  and it was the lion that scared the buck said snap  more than likely  and he scared us too  why didnt you shoot at him  why didnt you  i guess we were all about paralyzed i know i was declared whopper i didnt come out to hunt lions  ugh  maybe we had better get away from here  you cant kill a lion with a shotgunyou need a rifle and a heavy one at that  three heavy charges of buckshot would discourage any lion i think answered shep  at the same time we dont want to run the risk of being torn to pieces by such a beast  boys ive got an idea cried snap suddenly  maybe it wont work out but we might try it  to kill the lion  no to capture him alive and turn him over to the circus folks for that reward  what is the idea  let us dig a big pit here among the rocks and bait it with the two dead wildcats  we can drag the wildcats on the ground around here and to the pit and maybe the lion will follow the trail up and fall into the pit  hell be very obliging if he does that said whopper with a laugh i guess lions are as cautious as any wild beasts  hell follow the trail if he gets hungry enough said the doctors son  i think the idea is a good one and i vote we follow it out at once  but to dig a pit will be lots of work said whopper  cant we find some readymade hole that will do  retreating still farther and keeping their eyes and ears wide open for the possible reappearance of the monarch of the forest the three young hunters at length found a hole that suited them  the bottom was filled with loose stones and decayed leaves but these they soon cleaned out  then while whopper went off for the dead wildcats snap and shep made the hole still deeper  they removed the stones until they came to something of a small cave and had to take care for fear of tumbling in  i think that will hold the lion if he deigns to come this way said the doctors son  over the top of the opening they placed some light brushwood that would easily sink with the weight of any big beast and in the center placed one of the dead wildcats  the other they dragged in a circle around the hole and then let it fall to the bottom  that will give the beast something to eat in case he is captured said the doctors son  we dont want him to starve on our hands  ive got another idea said snap  why not fix one of the cameras so it will go off and take a picture in case the lion touches a certain string  mr jally told me how it could be done  a good idea cried shep  well do it right away  only we dont want any flashlight for that would scare the lion away  no well have to run the risk of having the camera worked in the daylight  it was dark by the time their task was accomplished  they knew that they could not get back to camp yet none of them had any desire to remain in the vicinity of the lion  he might take it into his head to eat us up instead of the wildcats said whopper earnestly  right you are responded shep  well get as far away as we can  they tramped for at least two miles and during that time passed a mountain brook that was strange to them  they tried to get some fish but were unsuccessful  we are skunked and no mistake said snap dolefully  not even one fish or a rabbit for supper  i am going to beat around the trees for something said the doctors son  shoot at anything that flies  he walked ahead and the others kept their guns in readiness  but all he stirred up were a few small birds not worth laying low  lucky we saved a little of the grub said whopper  if we hadnt wed go to bed supperless  i am going to roost in a tree tonight to keep out of the reach of that lion said snap  all agreed that this would be a good thing to do and after dividing what remained of the food brought along and getting a drink at a spring they selected a tree that suited their purpose and mounted to the thickest of the limbs  not a very comfortable bed was sheps comment  but better than falling into that lions clutches  shall we go back to the pit in the morning asked whopper  no let us go to camp first and see how giant and tommy are making out said the doctors son  most likely theyll be worrying about us  to keep from falling the three young hunters tied themselves fast in the tree  they tried to sleep but this was almost impossible and the most each got were fitful naps with many dreams of the lion all thoughts of other game were for the time being banished from their minds  at daybreak they descended to the ground and started for camp without waiting to shoot something for breakfast  they calculated they could get back before noon and then they would eat a big dinner at their leisure  all thought they had the lay of the land well fixed in their minds and so they did not advance with the caution they might otherwise have taken  as a consequence they presently made a false turn and this brought them to a part of the mountains that was exceedingly rocky and rough  say we cant get through here declared whopper at last  why its worse than the rocky road to dublin  i believe we are off the right trail returned snap  it seems to me our camp must be in that direction and he pointed to their left  perhaps you are right said the doctors son  anyway we cant get through here  well ruin our shoes and run the risk of breaking our necks  let us walk to the left said snap and they turned back a short distance  as they did this they started up a number of rabbits and eager for some game each blazed away and as a consequence two of the creatures were brought low  not much but something said the doctors son  they pressed on soon coming to some rocks that were quite smooth  be careful here cautioned snap  a tumble would be a nasty thing there is a cliff just below us  he and the doctors son went ahead and whopper followed  the rocks were even more slippery than they had anticipated  the doctors son was about to advise going back and walking around the cliff when whopper called out  a deer  i see a deer  where asked the others in a breath  over yonder  i am going to give him a shot  in great excitement whopper stood upright on the smooth rocks raised his shotgun and pulled the trigger  but the deer was not hit and a moment later disappeared from view  the report of the shotgun was followed by a yell from whopper  the weapon had kicked back and sent him sprawling  now he was rolling over and over on the smooth rocks directly toward the dangerous cliff below him     chapter xxi  adrift in the woods   stop whopper or hell go over the cliff  it was the doctors son who uttered the words  he was high up on the rocks and could do nothing to save his chum  snap heard and understood for he saw whopper rolling rapidly toward the cliff  if the youth went over a sheer drop of twenty or thirty feet awaited himwith more rocks below  in this moment of peril for snap to think was to whopper was very dear to him and he resolved to do all he could to save his chum even at the risk of his own life  he let his gun drop and ran over the rocks to where whopper was rolling over and over  then he caught him by the foot and threw himself flat clutching tenaciously at a single stone that arose sharply above those around it  snaps grip was good and for the moment whoppers progress was stayed  dont move called out snap as soon as he could catch his breath press down on the rocks for all you are worth  whopper understood and pressed down and thus both boys lay quiet for several seconds  whopper was but three feet from the edge of the cliff and snap was just above him  the doctors son was to the right in a spot that was a comparatively safe one  thethe gun kicked gasped whopper when he could speak  yes i know answered snap  but be careful or youll go over the cliff yet  whopper screwed his head around and gazed in the direction of the yawning gulf below him and his face changed color  gosh  well have to get out of this he murmured  crawl toward shep but take it slowly and be careful directed snap  shall i help you  no i can do it alone was the answer  both boys crawled like snails over the smooth rocks until they gained the spot where the doctors son rested  whopper drew a long breath of relief  im glad i didnt take that tumble he whispered hoarsely  he could hardly speak and his limbs trembled slightly  it was a good thing snap stopped you said shep  thats whatand i am mighty thankful snap replied whopper gratefully  well well have to go back that is all there is to it remarked the doctors son after a pause during which they looked across the rocks in perplexity  i thought sure we could go this way but it seems as if we cant  to climb down the rocks was as great a task as it had been to climb up and by the time they reached the bottom all were thoroughly hungry  it now lacked but an hour and a half of noon  well never get to camp by dinnertime declared snap  and im not going to do without breakfast and dinner too  i move we light a fire and cook those rabbits  ive got a little coffee left enough for three weak cups i guess  the others agreed and reaching a comfortable spot they cut a little wood and made a fire  then they sat down to rest while the skinned and cleaned rabbits were broiling  snap made the coffee and though rather weak and without milk and sugar they drank it eagerly  they had a little salt for the rabbits but that was all but hunger and fresh air are great appetizers  the scant meal at an end they resumed their journey the doctors son taking the lead  they moved in a semicircle around the base of one small mountain and then reached a rather broad mountain torrent  hello heres a surprise cried snap  i had no idea such a big brook flowed through these parts  nor i added shep  looks as if there might be good fishing here  the boys noted the location of the brook so that they might visit it another day and then pushed on as before  they reached a slight rise and all concluded that their camp was directly to the west  in that case all well have to do is to follow the sun declared whopper  right you are responded the doctors son  how far do you calculate it is  not more than two miles  it may be a little more said snap  but not much  they plunged into the woods once more and had hardly proceeded a hundred yards when they heard some partridges drumming  it was a chance for another shot and they hurried forward with guns ready for use  i see them cried snap and blazed away and the others followed suit  they were unusually lucky for five of the birds fell either dead or fatally wounded  soon they had the game in their bags  there that is something like cried snap  theyll make fine eating  and he smacked his lips  he loved partridge meat very much  they seemed to be getting deeper and deeper into the woods  the trees around them were so dense that it was almost impossible to see the direction of the sun  several times they came to a halt to look around  what do you make of it asked snap  i dont like it answered the doctors son emphatically  first thing we know well be lost  just what i was thinking  we were to follow the sun came from whopper  can you see it  once in a while and not very clearly at that  tell you what we might do suggested shep  climb a big tree and take a look around  this was considered a wise suggestion and they started to carry it out  a tree was selected and the others gave snap a boost to the lower branches  then up went the youth to the top slowly but surely  well what do you see demanded the doctors son after having given his chum a chance to look around  nothing  nothing echoed whopper blankly  nothing but woods and mountains and a brook or two  i dont see a thing that looks like a camp anywhere  oh it must be ahead of us insisted the doctors son  all rightyou come up and locate it grumbled snap  shep came up and so did whopper and all three of the lads gazed longingly first in one direction and then in another  nothing but what snap had mentioned greeted their eyes  boys we are lost cried whopper  oh no were not lostwe are here answered snap  the camp is lost  its the same thingso far as we are concerned  i think that is firefly lake said shep pointing to a hazy spot in the distance  and if it is then our camp may lay around on the upper side of this mountain  that may be true  shall we try to walk it  might as well shep  we dont want to stay here all night  and we dont want to walk two or three miles out of our way put in whopper  im getting mighty tirednot having had a good rest last night  we are having one adventure on top of the other said the doctors son with a grim smile  well is it go forward or stay here  nobody wanted to stand still and so they descended to the ground and moved off in the new direction settled upon  all were fagged out so progress was slow  they encountered some squirrels and snap brought down two and stowed them away with his partridge  theres a cat cried shep suddenly and ran forward  then of a sudden he stopped and smiled while whopper and snap roared  better give that cat a wide berth suggested snap unless you want to put a whole perfumery shop to shame  and they did give the animal a wide berth for it was a skunk and one ready for business as snap afterward expressed it  by nightfall they were still deep in the woods  all were now exhausted and coming to a fallen tree snap dropped to rest and so did his chums  boys we have missed it said the doctors son seriously  i must confess i havent the least idea where our camp is  and that means well have to stay out in these woods all night returned whopper  more than likely     chapter xxii  the spink crowd again   the prospect was not a pleasant one for the three boy hunters  it was not that they were afraid over the fact that they were lost in the woods on the mountain side  but they knew that giant and tommy would be greatly worried over their absence and it was possible yes probable that the two lads might have trouble with ham spink and his cronies  ham will be as mad as a hornet if he had much trouble finding his boat said snap in talking the situation over  and the first thing hell think of will be to get square  well if we cant get back we cant get back and that is all there is to it answered the doctors son philosophically  weve got to make the best of it  and then that lion added whopper  but to this the others merely shrugged their shoulders  they found a spot that seemed as good as any and collecting some dry sticks built a camp fire and made themselves a supper  they were footsore and weary and glad to rest  inside of an hour after eating all of the lads fell asleep and each slept soundly until morning  snap was the first to awaken and letting the others rest he replenished the camp fire and got breakfast ready  there was a sameness about their food that was not very appetizing but this could not be helped  when i get back im going to live a whole day on pancakes and beans and bacon said whopper  no more rabbits for me or partridge either  thats the one drawback to camping out returned the doctors son one does get awfully tired of eating game  it was again a question of how to proceed and once more they mounted a tree to take observations  they now saw two columns of smoke arising on the air not a great distance off  our camp fire and that of the spink crowd exclaimed snap  ill wager a button on it  i believe you are right answered shep  well make for the nearest of em anyway  they set off at a brisk pace taking as direct a route as the nature of the ground permitted  on the way they came to a large patch of huckleberry bushes and found the berries ripe and luscious  lets pick some said whopper  then we can make huckleberry dumplings or something like that  what about huckleberry pie suggested snap  great  they stopped long enough to pick several quarts of the berries stowing the fruit away in one of the cleanedout game bags  then on they went as before  soon they broke through the woods into a clearing and on the opposite side of this saw a camp with several boys lolling around a camp fire  they were members of the spink crowd and included dick bush and carl dudder  say where did you come from demanded carl dudder as he espied them and leaped to his feet  from the woods answered shep calmly  what do you want  nothing dudder excepting to pass  huh  you neednt look so innocentlike shep reed  we know what you did to our boat put in dick bush  what did we do to it asked whopper  you know well enough  think youre smart dont you growled carl  we know what you were going to do to our boat put in snap  what  you heard what i said  we only got ahead of you thats all  well fix you for it dont you worry said carl with a cunning leer  take care that you dont get into trouble was sheps answer then he walked around the camp fire and his chums followed  where are you going asked one of the other members of the spink crowd  that is our business  at this answer the other lads merely scowled  there was an awkward pause and then shep and his chums moved on and plunged into the woods beyond the camp fire  they are a real sociable bunch was whoppers sarcastic comment how i would love to stay with them  ill wager they fight like cats and dogs put in the doctors son  i dont believe they have one real pleasant day  and he was right the spink crowd were usually wrangling from morn to night and already one of the number had left and started for home in disgust  the boy hunters had the best part of half a mile farther to go but this they soon covered and then came to an opening that looked familiar to them  close at hand was their own camp  as they approached they heard loud talking  you clear out ham spink and leave us alone came in the voice of giant  we dont want you around here  and we dont want you either ike akley  well leave when we please was the answer from ham spink  we arent going to hurt you said the boy named ike akley another of the spink contingent  we dont want you around  got anything good to eat demanded ham coolly  not for you  well not go until you give us something good  thats the talk cried akley  lets take a look around and see if we can find any cookies said ham  you leave our things alone said giant firmly  bah you fellows didnt leave our boat alone so why should we leave your things alone growled ham  i wont have you looking through our things cried giant  he stepped up in front of ham who was much taller and heavier at the same time tommy ran to a distance and picked up two goodsized stones  you touch him or the things and ill throw these cried the boy from the circus  and ill set my dog on you too  you little rat you roared ham  dont you dare to interfere with me  ill take care of the kid cried ike akley and strode toward tommy  but in a twinkling the boy from the circus had leaped into a tree and was safe among the branches  the stones he had put in his pockets but now he brought them forth again  just remember what i said he exclaimed  im a good shot too  well get the best of em and take what we please cried ham spink  will you called out shep advancing into the opening with his gun in his hands  i rather guess not  ham looked around and so did ike akley  when both saw the doctors son snap and whopper and all with their guns in their hands they fell back and grew a trifle pale  thought you were going to rob us eh said shep sternly  nno stammered ham  weerwe were only going to take aercookie or two if you had em  well youll not take a thing so clear out  youyou took our boat said ham  and you were going to take ours only you didnt find it said snap with a grin  you hadnt any right to touch our boat  see here ham dont talk like a child  after all you did to harm us in the past weve got a right to do almost anything to you and you know it said the doctors son  now you clear out and leave us alone  youve been following us put in ike akley  not at all  then why did you come away out here to camp  because we chose to come  now clear outand stay away  a wordy war lasting several minutes followed  it was plainly to be seen that the shifting of the boat had filled ham spink with rage and he was unusually anxious to square up with the four boy hunters  but he could do nothing and at last he and his crony withdrew  i am glad you arrived said giant  if you hadnt i am afraid those fellows would have gotten the best of us  i would have shied rocks at them said tommy who had come down from the tree  they may be bigger than i am but i guess i could outrun em and at this remark the others had to smile  more than likely theyll come back some time said snap  and theyll bring the others with them  well have to remain on guard but tommy ive got great news  what is that  weve spotted a lionthe one that got away from the circus  a lion ejaculated giant  yes and we are hoping to trap the beast and get the reward offered for its return said whopper     chapter xxiii  a bear and a lion   giant and tommy listened with interest to what the others had to tell about the wildcats the deer and the lion and also about the stop at the spink camp  the story about the lion interested tommy deeply  casso will be glad to get that lion back he said  and if you capture him alive he ought to be willing to pay well for it  giant and tommy had had a rather quiet time in camp  they had hunted and fished a little and giant had taken some photos and developed some films and plates and printed a few pictures  the photographs had turned out well and the young hunters were correspondingly proud of them  i think my father will be much pleased said the doctors son  i am sure they are right in line with what he wanted  but we must get a good many more  how about your watch shep asked whopper  i declare i forgot about itthinking of that lion answered the doctors son  well have to go to that lonely cabin and see if i cant get it back from that crazy hermitif he is around  a days rest seemed to make snap and shep feel as lively as ever but whopper declared that he was still tired out and besides he had scraped an ankle on the rocks and this was quite sore  he said that he was willing to take it quiet for at least a day or two more  well have to see about that lion and about that hermit declared shep  supposing we leave you and tommy in camp this time and take giant along  all right said whopper  do you think you can manageif the spink tribe come to bother you asked snap  i think sounless they come at night  youll have to risk that  wags will watch out at night said tommy  hes better as a watch dog at night than he is in the daytime  it was decided that the boys should try first to find out if the lion had been trapped  then they were to journey to the lonely cabin in the woods not knowing how long they would be away  they took with them a fair stock of provisions and also a good supply of matches  they also took new films and plates for their cameras fortunately in spite of the rather rough experiences of the boys none of the picturetaking machines had been damaged beyond having the leather covers scratched and this did not matter  they dont look so well said shep  but theyll do the work and thats what we want  the doctors son with snap and giant started early on the following morning  giant was glad to get away from the camp once more and whistled a merry tune as they hurried along  they cut around the spink camp not wishing to meet their enemies  no use of letting them know we are gone said snap  if they did theyd be sure to go and bother whopper and tommy at onceand two couldnt do much against that whole crowd  snap and shep had fixed the direction well in their mind and studied the position of the sun so that they might not go astray  having left the spink camp behind them the three boys struck out in a bee line for the spot where they had left the pit with the dead wildcats as bait  they made good progress and stopped less than half an hour for lunch at midday  we ought to reach there before nightfall said the doctors son that is unless we get turned around again  i think we are going straight answered snap  but it may be farther than you think  while tramping along they scared up several rabbits and giant brought down one of these  but game appeared to be scarce and nothing else came to view  it was just five oclock when they reached a clearing that looked familiar to snap and shep  that pit is just beyond here said the doctors son  wed better go slowin case that lion hasnt been caught and is at large  the others took the advice and advanced with caution  a fringe of brushwood hid the pit from view  on the other side of the clearing was a dense forest of pines and hemlocks  well i never  it was the doctors son who uttered the exclamation  he was slightly in advance and had peered over the bushes  what is it asked snap in a low tone  look but dont make any noise  snap and whopper pressed forward and looked  what they saw thrilled them greatly  on the edge of the pit was a fairsized black bear  he was sniffing at the carcass of the wildcat that rested on the tree branches laid over the mouth of the opening  a chance for a fine shot whispered giant a bit nervously  waitwell get a picture first said the doctors son  but keep quiet  the others understood and hardly daring to breathe the three lads swung their cameras into position got them ready for use and spread out among the bushes to take some snapshots  the bear was a cautious animal and slowly he circled the pit sniffing longingly at the carcass so close at hand  evidently he desired a meat diet for a change and wanted to get the wildcat very much but did not quite trust the tree branches and what might be underneath  each of the lads got what he thought was a good picture and then snap and giant looked at shep and touched their guns  but the doctors son did not see them for he was looking wildly at something between the trees on the other side of the clearing  what do you see whispered snap  hush answered the doctors son  look for yourself  snap and giant gazed in the direction pointed out and it must be confessed that the hair of the smaller youth literally rose on end there between two trees crouched the lion that had escaped from the circus  the eyes of the monarch of the forest were fastened on the bear and his tail was swaying from side to side showing that he was getting ready for a leap  shall wewe shoot asked snap  he was so agitated he could hardly speak  why not take a picture asked shep who had his camera still in his hand  all rightbut we dont want that lion toto come this way  not much put in giant and it must be confessed that his voice trembled a good deal  to face a deer or even a bear was one thing to face a powerful lion was quite another  slowly the lion came out from between the two trees  the bear now had his head turned the other way so he was not aware of the approach of the enemy  it made a magnificent picture and for the moment the boys forgot their own peril and each took two snapshots one with the lion almost on top of the bear  scarcely had they clicked the shutters of the cameras the second time when a bloodcurdling roar rent the air and the lion made one grand leap for the bear  but as this happened bruin chanced to turn slightly and with a movement wonderful in such a bulky animal the bear sprang to one side  the lion missed his wouldbe prey and slid forward directly into the mass of tree limbs covering the pit  hes going into the hole cried snap  look  all gazed on the scene and saw that snap was right  unable to stop himself the lion had crashed down between the tree limbs and was now struggling vainly to reach firm ground once more the bear backed away and then turning sped off among the trees not over a dozen yards from where the young hunters were in hiding  the bearhes coming this way yelled snap  shoot him screamed giant  and he brought around his gun  all tried to get a shot but the trees were too thick and in a few seconds the bear was out of sight crashing down the brushwood as he went  he was badly frightened and with good cause for a lion was a new enemy for him  as the bear disappeared the boy hunters turned their attention again to the lion  the monarch of the forest was doing his best to climb over the tree limbs which turned and bent between him  shall we shoot him queried snap  if he gets loose  there he goes shouted shep  as the doctors son spoke they heard a tree limb snap in twain  for one instant the lion clung to the broken end then with a roar the beast sank out of sight into the pit     chapter xxiv  a notable capture   weve got him  weve got him shouted snap and his heart gave a wild bound of pleasure  dont be too sure cautioned the doctors son  waitkeep your gun ready for use  thats ithe may get out of the pit came from giant  dont take any risks  he could kill a fellow in a minute if he got the chance  they waited each with his gun ready  down in the pit they heard the lion growling and slashing around  evidently he was doing his best to get out of the hole  ill bet hes mad said snap  one of the dead wildcats is with him said snap  that will give him something to eat  hell not think of eating just now answered the doctors son he knows he is in a bad fix  they waited a minute longer and then the lion became quiet  at last the three boy hunters ventured into the clearing and shep with his gun raised walked slowly to the edge of the pit  suddenly a fearful roar rent the air echoing far and wide across the mountains  the lion had discovered the doctors son  his mane bristled and he showed his cruel teeth to the full  can hedo you think he can get out asked snap  hardly or hed be out already answered shep  let us pull those branches away  they might give him some sort of a foothold  all three of the boys came up and gazed down on the captured beast they hauled the tree branches away and threw the second dead wildcat into the pit  snap did this and it seemed to cause the lion some surprise  he shut his mouth his eyes began to blink and presently he bent down and commenced to feed on one of the carcasses  he knows he is a prisoner cried snap  see hes acting just as if he was in the circus for the monarch of the forest had laid down with the meat between his heavy fore paws  ive got an idea said shep looking around  there are a great number of flat stones on the mountain side  let us shove them down here and pile up a sort of wall around the top of the pit that will surely keep the lion in  this was considered a good suggestion and all the lads set to work without delay  some of the stones were so large it took two to lift them  they made an excellent wall and inside of an hour the boys had a barrier around the top of the pit three feet high  i dont think hell get out in a hurry said shep  but to make sure we can cut some poles and lay them over the stones and pile more stones on top  humph  why didnt you mention the poles first said snap  i didnt think of it snap  the saplings were cut and placed in a row over the top of the pit and then some stones were put on top of these  evidently the lion did not like to have his light and air cut off and he commenced to roar again  but this the boys did not mind for they now knew they had him fast  it goes without saying that all the boys were delighted over their catch  well have to get word to the circus folks as quickly as possible said snap  but where the show is now i dont know  probably tommy knows the route the circus was to take answered the doctors son  he does for he spoke to me about it put giant  but i have forgotten the towns and dates  do you know what id like to do before going on to that lonely cabin went on snap  what  go after that bear  oh he is probably miles away by this time said the doctors son  he was too scared to stay around here  well let us go after him anyway  he went in the direction of the cabinthat is partly  well well see in the morning said shep  the three boy hunters went into camp not very far away from the pit holding the lion  once or twice they went up to view their precious prize and noted that after eating one of the wildcats the lion stretched out and went to sleep  guess he thinks hes back in the menagerie said giant  well let him if only hell keep quiet until the circus people take him away  it was such a warm night they did not bother with a camp fire but eating some of the food brought along soon retired and went sound asleep  once giant awoke with a start and imagined that the lion was after him but he soon went to sleep again  im the morning they found the captured lion still resting quietly on the bottom of the pit  he had not touched the second wildcat  hell have plenty of food said snap  but how about water  i was thinking of that answered the doctors son  well have to bring some from a spring and lower it to him  they took the kettle they had brought along and filled it at a spring they had found and lowered this into the pit by means of a piece of fishingline grant carried  at first the lion roared in rage but when he saw the water he drank eagerly  they had to fill the kettle three times before he was satisfied  then they took more water and poured it in a hollow on one side of the pit bottom  now he wont go thirsty for a long time said shep  they cooked themselves a good breakfast and a little later set off across the hills in the direction of the end of firefly lake  it was their purpose to get to the lake by noon if possible and then strike out along the rocky watercourse leading to lake cameron  well have to be careful how we tackle that hermit said the doctors son  he may be the craziest kind of a lunatic  ive got an idea said snap  wouldnt it be a good idea to wait until night and then crawl up to the cabin while he is asleep  it may beif he didnt take us for robbers and act worse than ever  why not try him in the daytime first and then if you cant get the watch go back at night said giant  he may prowl around at night suggested shep  and remember he may not have the watch at allits all guesswork  it was an exceedingly warm day and when it was near noon all three of the young hunters were glad enough to lie down in the shade and rest  game appeared to be as scarce as the day before and all they shot were some rabbits and one squirrel  weve got to do better than this before we go home said shep  if we only knew what had become of that bear sighed snap  yes if we only did murmured giant  it was so pleasant in the shade that none of the boys could get up ambition enough to go on until they had taken a nap  then they went up a hill slowly carrying their coats over their shoulders  if its hot here what must it be in town said the doctors son  about ninety in the shade cried snap  at the top of the hill they took another rest  here there was a little breeze for which they were thankful  there is the lake cried giant pointing to a sheet of water below them  one good thing it will be easier going downhill than it was coming up  i vote we go in for a good swim when we reach the lake said snap what do you say shep  id rather get to that cabin before it is too late  but ill take a tenminutes dip if you wish  so it was agreed and the boys hurried through the woods to the lake shore in a pleasant frame of mind  listen cried snap presently  whats thata dog  all listened and heard a loud barking coming from the neighborhood of the water  i think its a fox cried giant  youll remember they bark just like that  lets try to get a photo and a shot answered the doctors son nothing like getting pictures of everything he added  they increased their speed and soon found themselves within a hundred yards of the shore of firefly lake  the barking had now ceased and they stood still not knowing in which direction to turn  something moving over yonder whispered giant presently and nodded with his head down the lake shore  making no noise they went forward again  they had to pass some bushes and rocks and then came to a point where a spur of land jutted far out into firefly lake  it was a rocky and sandy spur with scarcely any brushwood on it  there you are said snap and pointed to the extreme end of the spur  there on the rocks were two large foxes their noses well in the air gazing down the lake attentively  weve got them murmured the doctors son  come on well take pictures first and then shoot them  he brought around his camera and the others did likewise  they had just snapped the shutters when the foxes turned saw them and set up a loud and angry barking and showed their teeth  they are coming for us yelled giant and he was right  without hesitation the foxes made several big leaps and came directly for the young hunters     chapter xxv  the two foxes   ordinarily the foxes would have turned and run away but with the lake behind them this was impossible consequently they showed fight  they came on snapping and snarling viciously and with their teeth gleaming in a manner that made the boys shudder  fortunately for the young hunters the distance from the spur of rocks to where the lads stood was over fifty yards so as the foxes came rushing on they had just time enough to shove aside their cameras and bring their shotguns to the front  snap was the first of the three to bring his weapon into play and he pulled the trigger when the fox was less than a dozen feet away  the shot was a fairly good one for it took the beast just under the breast  the fox gave a yelp of intense pain and dropped back  the other fox came rushing at the doctors son  the strap of sheps gun had become entangled with that of his camera and consequently it was next to impossible for him to bring the weapon into proper play  he fired but the charge went too high and the beast continued to come on until it crouched at his feet snapping viciously and getting ready to leap at his throat  it was now that giant showed his mettle  he too had had a little trouble in getting at his gun but now the weapon was pointed at the fox at sheps feet  giant ran closer and pulled the trigger bang went the gun and the fox received the full charge directly in the left ear  it keeled over and giant sent the second charge of his doublebarreled weapon into the second fox and that too went down and lay quivering in its death agonies  it took the young hunters some time to recover from the excitement of the occurrence  the attack of the foxes had come so quickly that it had startled them greatly  this ought to be a warning to usthis and that fight with the wildcats said snap  we ought to be on our guard every minute weve been lucky so farmaybe some other time well not do so well  dont borrow trouble snap answered the doctors son  yet i agree with you we must be more careful in the future  is your camera all right  i think so  then let us take pictures of ourselves with the dead foxes went on shep and this was done and later the photographs turned out very well  having finished with the picturetaking the boys threw off their clothing and went for a swim in the clear cool waters of firefly lake  say this is fine cried snap enthusiastically as he splashed the water around  makes a fellow feel a year younger after such a hot tramp as we have had  thats what answered the doctors son  look at this he added as he made a long dive from a rock beside which he knew the water to be deep  they dove and swam and splashed around to their hearts content for a good quarter of an hour and even had a little race to a snag sticking up from the bottom fifty yards from the rocks  then shep said they had better dress and proceed on their way  they ran out of the lake shook themselves and made for the spot whee they had left their clothing behind some bushes  each stared in amazement  the clothing had been left in three heaps now the garments were strewn around in helterskelter fashion  somebody has been here cried snap  is anything gone demanded giant  at this all took a hasty inventory of their possessions  my shirt is missing came from the doctors son  one of my socks is gone added giant  my belt is gone came from snap and so is my camera  and my gun added shep looking around to where the weapons had rested against a tree  boys we have been robbed  what enemy has done this  can this be the work of the spink crowd  for a minute the talk was lively and then the boys calmed down a little  even in their excitement they were glad that nothing more had been taken  i dont think the spink crowd did this said snap  ham spink wouldnt stop short of taking everything  exactly my idea of it answered giant  whoever it was had a queer idea of what to take said the doctors son slowly  a shirt a belt one sock a camera and a gun  why in the name of goodness did he take one sock and not the other  he certainly threw things around pretty well said giant  maybe it was a wild animal he continued suddenly  no wild animal would walk off with a camera and a gun giant returned snap  ha  i have it he cried  that crazy hermit  maybe youre right said shep  it would be just like such a fellow to do a thing like this  and if he did this he must certainly have taken the watch went on snap  it would seem so  the boys lost no time in dressing  as it was warm shep did not miss his shirt very much nor did giant miss his sock  having no belt snap used a piece of stout cord instead  the loss of the gun is bad said the doctors son as they were finishing their toilet  for if that crazy fellow has it it will be so much harder to tackle him  thats true answered snap  maybe hell shoot himself with itif hes so very crazy  oh well not hope that murmured giant  they took the dead foxes and hung them high up in a tree intending if possible to come for them later and turn the meat over to the captured lion  then they pushed forward in the direction of the rocky waterway that connected the two lakes  youll have to lead said snap to the doctors son  youve been here before  ill lead as well as i can was the answer  but there is no regular trailthat is on the other side of the river  the walking now became very rough and the three young hunters had to proceed slowly  at times they were in sight of the water but often their course led them inland for a hundred yards or more  these rocks are something fierce exclaimed giant at length after slipping and sliding several times  you beware that you dont twist an ankle cautioned snap  presently they reached a spot where further progress seemed impossible giant and snap halted and looked at shep  before them was a little hollow filled with small stones and beyond were some shelving rocks with large cracks between  over the shelving rocks grew heavy masses of vines  dont drag urged the doctors son  it is getting late  the sun will be down in another hour  i cant go any faster panted giant  all three advanced and tried to climb the shelving rocks by holding on to the vines some of these gave way and the three boys fell back  then from under the rocks came a strange hissing sound followed by a curious rattle  whats that cried snap  snakes roared the doctors son  back for your lives fellows we have struck a den of rattlesnakes     chapter xxvi  more of a mystery   there was a wild scrambling on the part of all the young hunters to get out of the zone of danger  they leaped for the rocks behind them and shep and snap succeeded in mounting to spots of comparative safety  but giant was not so successful and slipping and sliding he rolled over and over coming to a stop when flat on his back  get up  get up screamed the doctors son  hurry up giant  shep and snap had caught sight of three rattlesnakes that had glided from between the shelving rocks ahead  they were all of good size  one had been caught in the tornaway vines and was hissing viciously and the other two were sounding their rattles preparatory to striking at the smaller youth  giant did not remain upon his back long  the instant he landed he started to turn over  he saw one of the snakes draw near and make a strike at his sockless ankle  giant let out a yell like an indian on the warpath and on all fours made a leap like a frog a distance of several feet  then he stood upright and made another leap for the rocks  as he came close snap caught him by the arm and pulled him still higher  the doctors son was the only person capable just then of using a gun and having no weapon of his own he grabbed snaps and blazed away  whether he hit a snake or not he could not tell  there was a hissing and rustling among the torn away vines and when the smoke of the discharge cleared away the snakes were no longer to be seen  ugh whataa thing tto happen said giant with a shiver his emotion was so deep he could scarcely speak  where are the snakes now asked snap and drew himself up on the highest rock he could find  i dont knowhiding i suppose answered the doctors son as he peered around sharply for a sight of the reptiles  the three boys waited for fully two minutes not daring to make a move  the vines lay where they had been cast and between them lay giants gun which he had dropped when trying to leap to safety  i guess we had better get out of this locality said snap at length  i have no desire to be bitten by a rattlesnake  indeed not answered giant  but my guni dont want to leave that behind  do you want to go down for it  not for a thousand dollars answered the small youth vehemently why a rattlesnake bite is deadly poisonous  i know that as well as you do giant  you might make a cast with your fishingline suggested the doctors son  i will  giant always carried several lines and selecting one of these he made a loop and to it fastened a small sinker for a weight  then he made a cast for the gun and secured it  slowly and cautiously and keeping on the highest rocks they could find the three young hunters commenced to retreat  they moved back at least fifty yards and then made a wide detour along the hill skirting the watercourse  all this took time and when they thought themselves safe it was growing dark  this doesnt look as if we were going to get to the cabin very fast remarked snap  how much farther have we to go  a good half mile answered shep  then we might as well go on even if it is night put in giant perhaps we can catch that crazy fellow asleep and make him a prisoner  he ought to be arrested for stealing our things  presently the doctors son came to a spot that looked familiar and a minute later he pointed to a notch cut in a tree  that is my blaze he said  i made it so as to remember where the cabin was located  well be there in a few minutes more better keep quiet  the others understood and after that they advanced without speaking unless it seemed necessary and then only in a whisper  the sun had gone down and it was as quiet as it was lonely  the doctors son was in the lead and presently he halted and pointed ahead  there was the dilapidated cabin just as it had been when visited by shep and whopper  see anybody asked giant in a low voice  not a soul  supposing we walk around the place first suggested snap  the others agreed to this and they circled the lonely structure at a distance of twenty yards  nobody appeared nor did they hear any sound from within  i may be mistaken but it looks deserted to me said snap  well we thought it was deserted too until that fellow shied things at us answered the doctors son  at last growing a bit bolder the three lads walked slowly up to the cabin snap and giant with their guns ready for use and the doctors son with a stout stick he had cut  thus they reached the doorway which was wide open  shep looked in shielding his head with one arm for he did not know but what he might become the target for anything the strange creature living there should have in hand  the place was pitch dark inside and for the moment the doctors son could see nothing  but as his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom he saw a broken table and an old bench and several discarded articles of culinary ware  do yoyou sesee him whispered giant  he was so agitated he could scarcely frame the words  shep shook his head and growing still bolder stepped into the lonely cabin  with added caution his two chums followed  they tiptoed their way through the two rooms and back again  he must have gone out said snap at last  shall i make a light  and as the others assented he struck a match and lit the pocket lantern he had brought along  the rays of the small light revealed a curious scene to them  in a corner where it had been hurled lay sheps gun  it had been discharged and the buckshot had gone through one sleeve of the shirt that had been stolen and which likewise lay in the corner there was some blood on the shirt and bloodstains led across the floor to the doorway and outside  must have shot himself was snaps comment  yes and ran away after he did it returned giant  see anything of my watch asked shep  no and i dont see my belt or my camera either answered snap  or my sock put in giant  the inner room of the cabin was littered up with a variety of things the wings of birds feathers of chickens shells of eggs bones bits of tree branches an old iron chain a tiny square lookingglass badly cracked some stale bread and cake cores of apples and pears and a great mass of other trash  hes a regular pig was snaps comment  wonder if hell come back tonight was giants question  perhaps unless he was fatally wounded answered shep  they made a thorough search for the missing watch camera and other things but without success  shep would not touch the shirt and left it where it was  but he took the gun and after examining it proceeded to load up the empty barrel  well go into camp near here said the doctors son  and keep watch for the missing person whoever he is  they got supper and went into camp close to the rear of the cabin they took turns at watching throughout the entire night but nothing came to disturb them  early in the morning they visited the cabin again but found nothing new to interest them  coming out giant started up two rabbits and quickly shot the game  say that will bring him back if hes in this vicinity cried snap  perhaps it would have been better  he stopped speaking for as he spoke they heard another gunshot from the woods between them and the river  then came a call that sounded somewhat familiar     chapter xxvii  an old friend appears   that cant be the wild man can it queried giant  no answered the doctors son  i think i know that voice  i think its jed sanborn came from snap  they waited for a few minutes and then saw a familiar figure emerge from the woods  it was their old hunting friend and in his hand he carried six partridges  hello there he cried on coming closer  thought you fellers was agoin up to the windy mountains  weve been uphave our camp there answered the doctors son we came down here for a purpose  everything all right at home asked giant  yes  we had a scare day before yesterday though  hicks barn got afire an folks thought the town might burn down account o the wind but the bucket brigade an the engine got the fire out before anything else caught  are our folks all well asked snap  yes an hopin you are the same as they write in letters and the old hunter grinned  had much luck shootin and pictertakin  we are well satisfied answered shep  got quite some partridge and rabbits and some deer and a lion  oh sure  a lion  suppose ye got an ellerphant and hoppowhatyoucallem too  we did get a lion said giant  weve got him in a pit  see here son lions dont roam these woods an never did  you are mistook in the beast  its the circus lion jed the one that got away at railings explained snap  oh  do ye really mean it  and now jed sanborn was tremendously interested  yes  we saw him on the mountain side and found a big pit and made a trap of it with some wildcat meat and we caught him  is he alive an well  yes  glory to washington  do you know them circus folks has offered a reward o three hundred dollars fer that lion if caught alive  then the money is ours cried shep  hurrah boys that suits me down to the ground  are you sure about the reward asked snap  o coursei read the poster in the postoffice  theyll give three hundred dollars fer the lion an five hundred fer the eddicated chimwhatyoucallhim  you know  the educated chimpanzee said shep  thats it  it looks as if that chimpanzee was wuth a lot to them he was a whole show in hisself  well weve got the lion right enough said snap  we dont know anything about the monkey  they told the old hunter about many of their doings and related the story of the missing watch camera and other things  why i didnt know anybody lived in this cabin said jed sanborn its been empty ever since old sturgis diedabout twelve years ago  he had some awful diseaselike smallpoxand folks got scared to come here  gracious  you dont suppose well get any disease cried giant in alarm  not from him sonits too long ago  why say i was at this cabin less than a month agostopped here overnight account o a rainstorm  wasnt nobuddy here then  it cant be peter peterson can it  no it didnt look like peterson answered the doctors son besides peterson isnt so plumb crazy as this chap  ill take a look around answered jed sanborn  he made the same investigation as had the boys  then he got down on his hands and knees and examined the soft ground in and around the cabin  say did ye see anything o a dog around here he asked  yes answered giant  that is the circus boy we told you about has his dog with hima collie  heres a trail looks something like a dogs but not much  plenty o other footmarksbut i reckon you made those  what to do next the boys did not know  there was no telling what had become of the strange occupant of the lonely cabin or when he would return  wed like to let those circus folks know about the lion said the doctors son  i suppose one of us will have to go back to town to send them word  i am going back to town tomorrow answered the old hunter  i can take word if ye want me to  that will do firstrate answered shep  we can send word where some of the men can meet usand in the meantime we can watch the lion so that he doesnt get away and doesnt die of hunger and thirst  wild beasts can live a long time without food and drink said jed sanborn  but the gittin away is another story  better watch him putty closely  after a good deal of talking the boys decided to return to their camp  it was arranged that the old hunter should depart for town at once find out where the circus was and inform the proprietor that the lion was found  then when a circus representative appeared sanborn was to meet him arrange to cage the lion and meet the boys at their camp the location of which they described in such a manner that it could not be missed  sanborn said the circus manager had found out that the three discharged employees were guilty of letting the animals escape and the men were now in jail  tell our folks that we are well and having a grand time said snap and sanborn promised to do so  after a hearty dinner at which the old hunter ate his fill of the things cooked by giant the boys and the old hunter separated and shep and his chums struck out for the camp  it was still warm so the doctors son did not mind the loss of his shirt  he had more at the camp so the loss did not matter much  i am glad we saw jed said shep as they trudged along  that will save us the trip to town  i hope he gets the circus folks here soon  tommy wont want to see them said giant  he told me he never wanted to see the inside of a circus tent again  and i dont blame him returned snap  well he can easily keep out of the way and we neednt say anything about him  wonder what hell do after we go home  ive got an idea came from the doctors son  let us take him with us and do what we can to find his sister  if we cant find her let us see if we cant find a home for him and put him to school  he ought to get an education  im willing to do what i can said snap readily  his eyes brightened we might spend some of that reward for the lion on tommy  id be willing to put in my share  so would i answered shep  in the middle of the afternoon they reached a beauwul spot in the mountains where a rocky stream formed a series of waterfalls  this locality had been mentioned by dr reed and they spent some time getting different pictures of it snap assisting the others since he had no camera of his own  i hope i get that camera back he said  we all hope that returned giant  the wild man can keep my socki shouldnt want to touch it after he had it  the water at the foot of the falls looked good for fishing and giant pleaded for permission to fish for a quarter of an hour or so  this was granted and he promptly baited up and threw in as a consequence he soon caught a beautiful brook trout and several more followed  wait ill take a snapshot of hauling in the next fish said the doctors son and he succeeded in getting a view that later on turned out exceedingly well  not having anything else to do snap wandered down the brook for a distance of a hundred yards  he was on the point of turning back when he saw something at a distance moving among the brushwood he looked sharply for a moment and then discovered that it was a large black bear     chapter xxviii  after a black bear   shep giant quick  whats the matter snap  a bear  down the stream  come on with the guns went on snap excitedly  he had returned hotfooted to where he had left his chums and the firearms  are you sure queried the doctors son as he dropped his camera and grabbed up his shotgun  dead certainbut i dont know how long he will stay there  oh if i had only had my gun with me groaned snap  i could have brought him down as easy as pie  arent you going to take your camera asked giant as he drew in his line and took both his photo outfit and his firearm  yes i forgot said the doctors son and picked up his camera again  dont shoot till we get a snapshot he said to snap who gun in hand was already off  all right but we dont want to lose the bear answered the other young hunter  of course not  with snap in the lead the three boys sneaked swiftly but silently down the mountain brook until they came to the spot from which snap had discovered the bear  here they halted and the others looked enquiringly at their leader  i saw him right over yonder whispered snap  go slow now or youll scare him  with bated breath the three young hunters advanced down the tiny stream  they gained the shelter of some dense brushwood and gazed around eagerly  not a sign of a bear was to be seen anywhere  maybe you were dreaming snap murmured giant  no i wasnti saw him just as plain as day  then he must have seen you running back to the pool and he must have took out too  perhaps but i was very careful to keep out of sight  they advanced a little farther and now saw ahead of them a slight hollow where there was another waterfall sheltered on either side by sharp rocks  there he is whispered the doctors son excitedly and pointed down to the pool at the foot of the falls  the black bear was there getting a drink  we cant take a picture from here said giant disappointedly  what shall we dofire  oh we ought to have a picture of him pleaded shep  it would be just the thing for our collection  let me suggest something said snap  i havent any camera so ill stay here  you two can make a half circle and come up below and kind of head the bear off  if he starts to run before you get ready ill fire at him  so it was agreed and shep and giant hurried off without delay making a wide detour through the woods and over the rocks  they could not help making a little noise but this was as they rightfully reasoned drowned out by the falling of the waters  in the meantime snap kept careful watch of the bear  the animal took his time drinking raising his head several times to look around him but he did not turn his gaze upward and consequently did not discover the young hunter who stood with weapon aimed ready to fire at a moments warning  fully five minutes passed and then the bear stretched himself and commenced to sniff the air  then of a sudden he arose on his hind legs to get a better look at his surroundings  this is the time they ought to get their pictures thought snap  an instant later he saw something fluttering in the bushes below the pool  shep and giant were there and had their cameras in action  the bear continued to stand upright but presently he dropped on all fours and began to lumber away from the brook at a good rate of speed  to have waited longer would have been foolish and taking careful aim snap fired his shotgun twice  scarcely had the two reports rung out than giant also fired followed a few seconds later by the doctors son  the aims of all three of the young hunters were true and the bear received such a peppering of buckshot that he was seriously if not mortally wounded  he dropped down dragged himself up again and roared with rage and pain  give him another yelled snap as he started to reload  giant was the first to run into the opening and as the bear saw the youth he snarled viciously and showed his teeth  he tried to rush at the boy but giant discharged the second barrel of his shotgun and the charge took the bear in the head  then the doctors son fired again and hit the animal in the side  this was too much for bruin and with a rocking motion he staggered forward a few steps and then pitched on his head dead  weve got him  weve got him yelled the small youth dancing around wildly and flinging his cap into the air  isnt this the dandy luck  did you get the pictures questioned snap leaping down the rocks to where the game lay  we sure did answered the doctors son  and ive got one of you aiming your gun right at the bear  i tilted the camera up a little to get it  what a fine bear cried giant  we never got a better answered snap  oh this is certainly prime luck  well have to take some more picturesof our game said shep and without delay they took several plates and filmsthe two cameras being of each kind  all the boys were in the pictures and of these photographs they were justly proud  now the question is what are we going to do with the bear said snap  we cant drag such a load to our camp  well have to skin the animal and take what meat we want answered the doctors son  its too bad to leave so much behind but it cant be helped  it wont keep in this weather anyway  if only jed sanborn was herehe might take some of it home  ill tell you what we can do said giant  try to drag the carcassor a big part of itup to the lions pit  it will help to feed that beast until the circus folks come  thats an idea said shep  and if we keep the lion well fed he wont try so hard to get away  menagerie animals are always lazy when well fedone of the keepers told me that  they only get restless when they are hungry  it took the boys some time to skin the dead bear and cut away such meat as they thought they could tote along  the rest of the meat they hung in a tree thinking they might possibly come back for it later  then they started once more for camp  i hope the spink crowd hasnt been bothering whopper and tommy since we have been away said snap  if they have  dont borrow trouble interrupted the doctors son  wait till it comes  with their heavy loads they made slow progress through the woods and they were glad when they reached the lion pit and could dispose of some of the bear meat  the lion greeted them with a roar but that was all  he had not yet eaten the second wildcat nevertheless they threw to him a chunk of the bear meat the fresh blood of which was very much to his satisfaction  it was late when they reached camp thoroughly tired out  whopper and tommy were glad to see them and immediately bustled about to get them a good supper  those left behind listened with interest to the tale the others had to tell  when shep told about the tracks around the lonely cabin tracks that had caused jed sanborn to ask if they had seen a dog tommy looked greatly interested  say he cried  do you suppose and then he stopped short  do we suppose what queried shep  oh i suppose it couldnt be but i was just thinking  maybe that isnt a crazy man at all  well what do you think it can be asked giant  maybe its abe the runaway chimpanzee     chapter xxix  the bottom of a mystery   all the others listened to tommys words with interest  then whopper spoke of the face he had seen as looking particularly impish  it was pretty dark so we couldnt see very well said he  it might have been the chimpanzee  would that chimpanzee steal a watch and a camera and a gun demanded the doctors son  hell take whatever happens to interest him answered the boy from the circus  they are constantly trying to teach him new tricks if youll remember one of his tricks is to fire a gun into the air and another is to look at a watch and pretend to tell the time  thats so cried snap  i saw him do both at the show  would he untie our boat asked giant  he might  if it is the chimpanzee well have a hard job of it catching him said shep slowly  he wont stay at the cabin but roam from place to placeand there is no telling what hell do with our things  dont forget the reward that has been offered said giant  if we can find the chimpanzee we can get that as well as the reward for the lion  whopper and tommy had not been bothered by the spink crowd and were of the opinion that the latter had shifted their camp to a new locality closer to the lake  well let them keep their distance thats all i ask said the doctors son  the next day snap shep and giant rested while whopper and tommy went on a short hunt bringing in some partridges and several squirrels  the boys took a few pictures snap using an extra camera that had been brought along  they now had a fine collection of which they were exceedingly proud  sunday passed and still they heard nothing from jed sanborn  the boys went hunting several times and brought in a variety of small game  they made a trip to the mountaintop and got several more photographs of value  films and plates were carefully stored away in waterandlighttight cases  i am sure my father will be greatly pleased when he sees what we have accomplished said shep  i dont believe he thought we could do so well  on tuesday morning just after breakfast the young hunters heard somebody coming through the woods toward them  wags set up a violent barking  maybe its sanborn with the circus folks said whopper  oh what shall i do asked tommy in alarm  i dont want them to see me  its the spink crowd cried giant  say something must be wrong look how excited they are  we ought to shoot emthats what we ought to do they heard carl dudder say loudly  well make em pay for the things thats what well make em do answered ham spink  call off your dog you rascals sang out dick bush for wags had walked toward him barking angrily  come here wags cried tommy and the collie obeyed instantly  but he evidently knew that the newcomers were enemies for he continued to eye them suspiciously  think youre smart dont you roared ham spink striding into the camp and facing shep and snap  well i want you to know that you have gone too far  youve got to pay damages or well have you all locked up  youve got to pay for my new suit of clothes said ike akley it is utterly ruined  and my sweater said dick bush  and i want to know where my shoes are put in carl dudder  and my briarroot pipe and tobacco  yes and my silver matchcase and a whole lot of other things said ham spink  yes and what right had you to make a roughhouse of our camp demanded another boy  all of our stores are ruined put in still another  it was mean to scatter that coffee in the mud  and the sugar and beans  yes and put the salt in the flour  so the talk ran on the newcomers getting more and more excited every moment  they had their guns with them and looked as if they meant to do serious harm to our friends  see here what are you talking about asked the doctors son at last  i cant make head or tail of it  he realized that something unusual had occurred  this brought forth another volley of accusations from the spink crowd  their camp had been roughhoused to the last degree and many things had been utterly ruined while other articles were missing  they were sure that shep and his chums were guilty of the crime  you are all wrong cried snap  we havent been near your camp  thats the truth added shep  i dont believe it cried carl dudder  but it is trueevery word of it came from giant and whopper and tommy said the same  youve been thereand you have our things said ike akley doggedly  if you want to do so you can search this camp said shep but dont you harm any of our goods  do you mean to say you didnt come to our camp last night demanded ham  i certainly do say it answered the doctors son  all we did was to hide that boat and we did that because we knew you wanted to hide ours  huh  how did you know that  because we heard you talking about it on the way to the lake  well if you didnt come to our camp last night who did asked dick bush  he was commencing to realize that a mistake had been made  dont ask me answered snap  but honor bright we werent near your camp dick  maybe it was the chimpanzee cried tommy  eh queried ham  in a few brief words the spink crowd were told of what had happened at the cabin at the cliff and at the lake shore  no mention was made of the capture of the lion  we think it was the chimpanzee said snap  but we may be mistakenit may be a crazy man  more talk followed and in the end snap and his chums agreed to visit the wrecked camp and take a look around  they left tommy in charge of their own camp and warned him to keep strict guard  it was a walk of half a mile and the boys covered it in less than half an hour  snap was in advance with ham by his side  ham still thought our friends guilty of what had occurred  heres our campor whats left of it said ham as they came to the clearing  now if you  he stopped short and gazed ahead with eyes bulging from his head snap gave a yell  boys here he is  the chimpanzee and hes having a high old time  all of the others rushed forward and saw a sight that filled some with rage and others with laughter  sure enough abe the educated chimpanzee was there and was evidently having the time of his life  he had on a highlycolored dress shirt a cap and one shoe and was amusing himself by tearing a hunting suit belonging to ham into shreds  the chimpanzee sure enough  look what he is doing  shoot him  shoot the rascal  so the cries rang out  the chimpanzee looked up in alarm  then as several guns were raised he leaped out of sight behind some bushes and went off chattering wildly as he disappeared     chapter xxx  goodby to the boy hunters   ill kill that monkey roared ham as he ran into the camp and picked up his ruined clothing  look at this  and this added carl dudder snatching up the remains of his sleeping blanket  it was the chimpanzee sure enough said dick bush  come on after him exclaimed shep  remember the reward he whispered to his chums  all presently made off after the chimpanzee  they kept in a bunch at first but gradually separated the spink crowd going one way and snap and his chums in another  im glad we caught sight of him as we did said whopper  now those fellows know we were not guilty of the roughhousing  it certainly was rough was giants comment  threequarters of their things are ruined  perhaps they can hold the circus proprietor responsible said the doctors son  they moved forward for nearly a quarter of a mile and were on the point of giving up the search and returning to camp when giant caught sight of a small cavelike opening on the mountain side  lets look in there he said  see there is a vest on the ground in front of it  be carefulthe chimpanzee may be dangerous warned snap  they hurried forward with eyes and ears on the alert  giant looked into the opening  no monkey here he announced  but he has been here  look  and much to snaps delight he held up the missing camera  then he ran into the cave and came forth with sheps watch and a number of trinkets taken from the spink camp  he must have come here after he left the old cabin said snap see there is some food  he must have gotten that last night when he raided spinks place  they took with them all the things to be found and then made another search for the chimpanzee  but they could not locate the marauding creature and so turned their steps toward their camp  well weve got a few of those others fellows things for them said whopper  we can return them after dinner  the camera is ok said snap after an examination  and so is the watch came from the doctors son  and to think it was only a chimpanzee after all cried giant  only is good exclaimed shep  hes had enough for anybody im thinking  as they came closer to their camp they heard tommy talking in a loud voice to somebody  wags was barking gaily  now you sit still and behave yourself the circus boy was saying then youll get a fine lump of sugar  talking to the dog i suppose said whopper  he thinks wagsno he isnt either  well i never  if this doesnt beat anything i ever saw  all came into the clearing and gazed in amazement at the sight presented  chained to a tree was abe the chimpanzee smiling and chattering and in front of him were tommy and the dog the former with some sugar in his hand  hullo cried snap  did you catch him  i certainly did answered the circus boy  but i had the time of my life doing it  he ran up a tree and he wouldnt come down until i offered him a handful of those nuts i found yesterday  they were too much of a temptation and while i fed him nuts with one hand i took the kettle chain and tied him up as you see  good for you said whopper  he must have known you or i guess he would have run away  yes he started to run away but i whistled like his keeper used to whistle and that made him sit still  you want to make sure of that chain said the doctors son  i see he has snaps belt on he added with a grin  ill tie him with a rope answered tommy and later the chimpanzee was firmly secured so that escape was out of the question  as the young hunters fed him well he seemed quite content  tommy this is an important capture for you said shep  its money in your pocket  the circus proprietor has offered five hundred dollars reward for the capture of this chimpanzee  five hundred dollars gasped the little fellow  but they wont pay it to me he added as his face fell  well make them payif they want the animal answered snap  but i dont want them to see me insisted tommy  see here tommy you leave this matter to us said the doctors son  i dont think they can compel you to go with the circus well take you to fairview and you can remain with us until we hear from your sister  all right but if they take me ill run away again answered the boy  a little later the spink crowd came into camp and were astonished to learn of the capture of the chimpanzee  they were glad to get back the things that had been found but declared that so many other articles had been ruined they would have to give up their outing  lets be generous to them whispered shep to his chums  i dont think we want to stay after the circus people come for the lion and the chimpanzee  and after some talking the young hunters offered the spink crowd part of their food supplies and a few other things  this surprised ham carl and the rest  they accepted the offer on the spot and a better feeling prevailed between the boys than had for many months  its very nice of you to do this said dick bush  i shant forget it  im sorry i accused you of ruining the camp came from ham  so am i added carl  butwell you know how it was  well let bygones be bygones said the doctors son  its better to be friends than enemies  ii suppose so said ham humbly and then he and his cronies took their departure  the young hunters watched out for the reappearance of jed sanborn snap and shep going to firefly lake for that purpose  two days later they saw the old hunter coming to the shore with a big flatbottomed boat containing four men  the men were from the circus and said they had come for the captured lion  we want to make sure of that reward said the doctors son  all right young man turn the lion over to us and the money is yours said one of the men  but well want a receipt from all the boys who captured the beast  youll get that said snap  you offered a reward for the chimpanzee too didnt you  certainly five hundred dollars  well weve got him too  you have  how did you do it asked the man and very briefly snap related the tale but did not give tommys name  that boy is in luck for the half thousand is his said the circus man  glad you got abe he added  he is a great drawingcard and worth a dozen lions to us  a visit was made to the lion pit and after a good deal of trouble the lion was brought to the surface of the ground and chained and muzzled  one of the men knew the beast well and had little trouble in walking the lion to the lake shore where he was chained to a tree and left in charge of one of the party  the circus men were vastly surprised when they learned that it was tommy who had captured the chimpanzee  at first they did not think they ought to pay the lad the reward but shep told them they could not have abe unless they did so  a bargain is a bargain said the doctors son  youll not touch the chimpanzee unless you pay up  the matter was argued hotly but in the end the circus men gave in and two checks were made out both payable to dr reed and the boys signed the receipts  then the circus men took the chimpanzee and walked down to the lake shore  guess you dont want tommy any more cried shep after them  no weve got another kid to take his place answered one of the men  theyll have their hands full getting that lion and the chimpanzee to town said snap and he was right  but the work was accomplished by the next day and the pair were shipped on to the circus by train  the young hunters remained in camp fortyeight hours longer and then packed up and moved down to firefly lake  just previous to going they let the spink crowd have some more of their things for which the other lads were extremely grateful  guess we better be friends after this said ham spink  it doesnt pay to be on the outs  it doesnt answered shep readily  on the return to fairview the boy hunters camped out three nights and shot a variety of small game and also a deer  they took the latter home and also the skin of the bear which was afterward cured and is now on the floor of the dodge parlor  you have done exceedingly well said dr reed when he had heard their story and gone over their films and plates and pictures these will make a grand collection and are just what we wanted for advertising purposes  the money obtained for the capture of the lion was divided among the four boy hunters and the amount received for the chimpanzee was placed to tommys credit by the doctor and the former circus boy went to live with the reed family for the time being  several letters were sent to tommys missing sister and at last word came back from her  she had married a storekeeper who was rich and she asked that tommy come to live with her  my but thats grand cried tommy  now ill have a good home  im mighty glad of it said shep and the other lads said the same  later they received letters from tommy stating that his sister and his brotherinlaw treated him well and were going to give him a fine education  well it was a great outing said snap one day when the boy hunters were talking it over  well have to go out again some day said whopper  school for ours cried the doctors son  right you are came from giant  but say we had a dandy time didnt we  so we did cried all the others and here we will leave the four boy hunters and say goodby  the end
