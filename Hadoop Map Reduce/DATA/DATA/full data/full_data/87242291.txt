87242291	the diary of a man of fifty by henry james   florence april 5th 1874they told me i should find italy greatly changed and in sevenandtwenty years there is room for changes  but to me everything is so perfectly the same that i seem to be living my youth over again all the forgotten impressions of that enchanting time come back to me  at the moment they were powerful enough but they afterwards faded away  what in the world became of them  whatever becomes of such things in the long intervals of consciousness  where do they hide themselves away in what unvisited cupboards and crannies of our being do they preserve themselves  they are like the lines of a letter written in sympathetic ink hold the letter to the fire for a while and the grateful warmth brings out the invisible words  it is the warmth of this yellow sun of florence that has been restoring the text of my own young romance the thing has been lying before me today as a clear fresh page  there have been moments during the last ten years when i have fell so portentously old so fagged and finished that i should have taken as a very bad joke any intimation that this present sense of juvenility was still in store for me  it wont last at any rate so i had better make the best of it  but i confess it surprises me  i have led too serious a life but that perhaps after all preserves ones youth  at all events i have travelled too far i have worked too hard i have lived in brutal climates and associated with tiresome people  when a man has reached his fiftysecond year without being materially the worse for wearwhen he has fair health a fair fortune a tidy conscience and a complete exemption from embarrassing relativesi suppose he is bound in delicacy to write himself happy  but i confess i shirk this obligation i have not been miserable i wont go so far as to say thator at least as to write it  but happinesspositive happinesswould have been something different  i dont know that it would have been better by all measurementsthat it would have left me better off at the present time but it certainly would have made this differencethat i should not have been reduced in pursuit of pleasant images to disinter a buried episode of more than a quarter of a century ago  i should have found entertainment morewhat shall i call itmore contemporaneous  i should have had a wife and children and i should not be in the way of making as the french say infidelities to the present  of course its a great gain to have had an escape not to have committed an act of thumping folly and i suppose that whatever serious step one might have taken at twentyfive after a struggle and with a violent effort and however ones conduct might appear to be justified by events there would always remain a certain element of regret a certain sense of loss lurking in the sense of gain a tendency to wonder rather wishfully what might have been  what might have been in this case would without doubt have been very sad and what has been has been very cheerful and comfortable but there are nevertheless two or three questions i might ask myself  why for instance have i never marriedwhy have i never been able to care for any woman as i cared for that one  ah why are the mountains blue and why is the sunshine warm happiness mitigated by impertinent conjecturesthats about my ticket  6thi knew it wouldnt last its already passing away  but i have spent a delightful day i have been strolling all over the place everything reminds me of something else and yet of itself at the same time my imagination makes a great circuit and comes back to the starting point  there is that wellremembered odour of spring in the air and the flowers as they used to be are gathered into great sheaves and stacks all along the rugged base of the strozzi palace  i wandered for an hour in the boboli gardens we went there several times together  i remember all those days individually they seem to me as yesterday  i found the corner where she always chose to sitthe bench of sunwarmed marble in front of the screen of ilex with that exuberant statue of pomona just beside it  the place is exactly the same except that poor pomona has lost one of her tapering fingers  i sat there for half an hour and it was strange how near to me she seemed  the place was perfectly emptythat is it was filled with her  i closed my eyes and listened i could almost hear the rustle of her dress on the gravel  why do we make such an ado about death  what is it after all but a sort of refinement of life  she died ten years ago and yet as i sat there in the sunny stillness she was a palpable audible presence  i went afterwards into the gallery of the palace and wandered for an hour from room to room  the same great pictures hung in the same places and the same dark frescoes arched above them  twice of old i went there with her she had a great understanding of art  she understood all sorts of things  before the madonna of the chair i stood a long time  the face is not a particle like hers and yet it reminded me of her  but everything does that  we stood and looked at it together once for half an hour i remember perfectly what she said  8thyesterday i felt blueblue and bored and when i got up this morning i had half a mind to leave florence  but i went out into the street beside the arno and looked up and downlooked at the yellow river and the violet hills and then decided to remainor rather i decided nothing  i simply stood gazing at the beauty of florence and before i had gazed my fill i was in goodhumour again and it was too late to start for rome  i strolled along the quay where something presently happened that rewarded me for staying  i stopped in front of a little jewellers shop where a great many objects in mosaic were exposed in the window i stood there for some minutesi dont know why for i have no taste for mosaic  in a moment a little girl came and stood beside mea little girl with a frowsy italian head carrying a basket  i turned away but as i turned my eyes happened to fall on her basket  it was covered with a napkin and on the napkin was pinned a piece of paper inscribed with an address  this address caught my glancethere was a name on it i knew  it was very legibly writtenevidently by a scribe who had made up in zeal what was lacking in skill  contessa salviscarabelli via ghibellinaso ran the superscription i looked at it for some moments it caused me a sudden emotion  presently the little girl becoming aware of my attention glanced up at me wondering with a pair of timid brown eyes  are you carrying your basket to the countess salvi i asked  the child stared at me  to the countess scarabelli  do you know the countess  know her murmured the child with an air of small dismay  i mean have you seen her  yes i have seen her  and then in a moment with a sudden soft smilee bella said the little girl  she was beautiful herself as she said it  precisely and is she fair or dark  the child kept gazing at me  biondabionda she answered looking about into the golden sunshine for a comparison  and is she young  she is not younglike me  but she is not old likelike  like me eh  and is she married  the little girl began to look wise  i have never seen the signor conte  and she lives in via ghibellina  sicuro  in a beautiful palace  i had one more question to ask and i pointed it with certain copper coins  tell me a littleis she good  the child inspected a moment the contents of her little brown fist  its you who are good she answered  ah but the countess i repeated  my informant lowered her big brown eyes with an air of conscientious meditation that was inexpressibly quaint  to me she appears so she said at last looking up  ah then she must be so i said because for your age you are very intelligent  and having delivered myself of this compliment i walked away and left the little girl counting her soldi  i walked back to the hotel wondering how i could learn something about the contessa salviscarabelli  in the doorway i found the innkeeper and near him stood a young man whom i immediately perceived to be a compatriot and with whom apparently he had been in conversation  i wonder whether you can give me a piece of information i said to the landlord  do you know anything about the count salviscarabelli  the landlord looked down at his boots then slowly raised his shoulders with a melancholy smile  i have many regrets dear sir  you dont know the name  i know the name assuredly  but i dont know the gentleman  i saw that my question had attracted the attention of the young englishman who looked at me with a good deal of earnestness  he was apparently satisfied with what he saw for he presently decided to speak  the count scarabelli is dead he said very gravely  i looked at him a moment he was a pleasing young fellow  and his widow lives i observed in via ghibellina  i daresay that is the name of the street  he was a handsome young englishman but he was also an awkward one he wondered who i was and what i wanted and he did me the honour to perceive that as regards these points my appearance was reassuring  but he hesitated very properly to talk with a perfect stranger about a lady whom he knew and he had not the art to conceal his hesitation  i instantly felt it to be singular that though he regarded me as a perfect stranger i had not the same feeling about him  whether it was that i had seen him before or simply that i was struck with his agreeable young faceat any rate i felt myself as they say here in sympathy with him  if i have seen him before i dont remember the occasion and neither apparently does he i suppose its only a part of the feeling i have had the last three days about everything  it was this feeling that made me suddenly act as if i had known him a long time  do you know the countess salvi i asked  he looked at me a little and then without resenting the freedom of my questionthe countess scarabelli you mean he said  yes i answered shes the daughter  the daughter is a little girl  she must be grown up now  she must belet me seeclose upon thirty  my young englishman began to smile  of whom are you speaking  i was speaking of the daughter i said understanding his smile  but i was thinking of the mother  of the mother  of a person i knew twentyseven years agothe most charming woman i have ever known  she was the countess salvishe lived in a wonderful old house in via ghibellina  a wonderful old house my young englishman repeated  she had a little girl i went on and the little girl was very fair like her mother and the mother and daughter had the same namebianca i stopped and looked at my companion and he blushed a little  and bianca salvi i continued was the most charming woman in the world he blushed a little more and i laid my hand on his shoulder  do you know why i tell you this  because you remind me of what i was when i knew herwhen i loved her  my poor young englishman gazed at me with a sort of embarrassed and fascinated stare and still i went on  i say thats the reason i told you thisbut youll think it a strange reason you remind me of my younger self  you neednt resent thati was a charming young fellow  the countess salvi thought so  her daughter thinks the same of you  instantly instinctively he raised his hand to my arm  truly  ah you are wonderfully like me i said laughing  that was just my state of mind  i wanted tremendously to please her  he dropped his hand and looked away smiling but with an air of ingenuous confusion which quickened my interest in him  you dont know what to make of me i pursued  you dont know why a stranger should suddenly address you in this way and pretend to read your thoughts  doubtless you think me a little cracked  perhaps i am eccentric but its not so bad as that  i have lived about the world a great deal following my profession which is that of a soldier  i have been in india in africa in canada and i have lived a good deal alone  that inclines people i think to sudden bursts of confidence  a week ago i came into italy where i spent six months when i was your age  i came straight to florencei was eager to see it again on account of associations  they have been crowding upon me ever so thickly  i have taken the liberty of giving you a hint of them  the young man inclined himself a little in silence as if he had been struck with a sudden respect  he stood and looked away for a moment at the river and the mountains  its very beautiful i said  oh its enchanting he murmured  thats the way i used to talk  but thats nothing to you  he glanced at me again  on the contrary i like to hear  well then let us take a walk  if you too are staying at this inn we are fellowtravellers  we will walk down the arno to the cascine  there are several things i should like to ask of you  my young englishman assented with an air of almost filial confidence and we strolled for an hour beside the river and through the shady alleys of that lovely wilderness  we had a great deal of talk its not only myself its my whole situation over again  are you very fond of italy i asked  he hesitated a moment  one cant express that  just so i couldnt express it  i used to tryi used to write verses on the subject of italy i was very ridiculous  so am i ridiculous said my companion  no my dear boy i answered we are not ridiculous we are two very reasonable superior people  the first time one comesas i have doneits a revelation  oh i remember well one never forgets it  its an introduction to beauty  and it must be a great pleasure said my young friend to come back  yes fortunately the beauty is always here  what form of it i asked do you prefer  my companion looked a little mystified and at last he said i am very fond of the pictures  so was i  and among the pictures which do you like best  oh a great many  so did i but i had certain favourites  again the young man hesitated a little and then he confessed that the group of painters he preferred on the whole to all others was that of the early florentines  i was so struck with this that i stopped short  that was exactly my taste  and then i passed my hand into his arm and we went our way again  we sat down on an old stone bench in the cascine and a solemn blankeyed hermes with wrinkles accentuated by the dust of ages stood above us and listened to our talk  the countess salvi died ten years ago i said  my companion admitted that he had heard her daughter say so  after i knew her she married again i added  the count salvi died before i knew hera couple of years after their marriage  yes i have heard that  and what else have you heard  my companion stared at me he had evidently heard nothing  she was a very interesting womanthere are a great many things to be said about her  later perhaps i will tell you  has the daughter the same charm  you forget said my young man smiling that i have never seen the mother  very true  i keep confounding  but the daughterhow long have you known her  only since i have been here  a very short time  a week  for a moment he said nothing  a month  thats just the answer i should have made  a week a monthit was all the same to me  i think it is more than a month said the young man  its probably six  how did you make her acquaintance  by a letteran introduction given me by a friend in england  the analogy is complete i said  but the friend who gave me my letter to madame de salvi died many years ago  he too admired her greatly  i dont know why it never came into my mind that her daughter might be living in florence  somehow i took for granted it was all over  i never thought of the little girl i never heard what had become of her  i walked past the palace yesterday and saw that it was occupied but i took for granted it had changed hands  the countess scarabelli said my friend brought it to her husband as her marriageportion  i hope he appreciated it  there is a fountain in the court and there is a charming old garden beyond it  the countesss sittingroom looks into that garden  the staircase is of white marble and there is a medallion by luca della robbia set into the wall at the place where it makes a bend  before you come into the drawingroom you stand a moment in a great vaulted place hung round with faded tapestry paved with bare tiles and furnished only with three chairs  in the drawingroom above the fireplace is a superb andrea del sarto  the furniture is covered with pale seagreen  my companion listened to all this  the andrea del sarto is there its magnificent  but the furniture is in pale red  ah they have changed it thenin twentyseven years  and theres a portrait of madame de salvi continued my friend  i was silent a moment  i should like to see that  he too was silent  then he asked why dont you go and see it  if you knew the mother so well why dont you call upon the daughter  from what you tell me i am afraid  what have i told you to make you afraid  i looked a little at his ingenuous countenance  the mother was a very dangerous woman  the young englishman began to blush again  the daughter is not he said  are you very sure  he didnt say he was sure but he presently inquired in what way the countess salvi had been dangerous  you must not ask me that i answered for after all i desire to remember only what was good in her  and as we walked back i begged him to render me the service of mentioning my name to his friend and of saying that i had known her mother well and that i asked permission to come and see her  9thi have seen that poor boy half a dozen times again and a most amiable young fellow he is  he continues to represent to me in the most extraordinary manner my own young identity the correspondence is perfect at all points save that he is a better boy than i  he is evidently acutely interested in his countess and leads quite the same life with her that i led with madame de salvi  he goes to see her every evening and stays half the night these florentines keep the most extraordinary hours  i remember towards 3 am madame de salvi used to turn me outcome come she would say its time to go  if you were to stay later people might talk  i dont know at what time he comes home but i suppose his evening seems as short as mine did  today he brought me a message from his contessaa very gracious little speech she remembered often to have heard her mother speak of meshe called me her english friend  all her mothers friends were dear to her and she begged i would do her the honour to come and see her  she is always at home of an evening  poor young stanmer he is of the devonshire stanmersa great property reported this speech verbatim and of course it cant in the least signify to him that a poor grizzled battered soldier old enough to be his father should come to call upon his inammorata  but i remember how it used to matter to me when other men came thats a point of difference  however its only because im so old  at twentyfive i shouldnt have been afraid of myself at fiftytwo camerino was thirtyfourand then the others  she was always at home in the evening and they all used to come  they were old florentine names but she used to let me stay after them all she thought an old english name as good  what a transcendent coquette    but basta cosi as she used to say  i meant to go tonight to casa salvi but i couldnt bring myself to the point  i dont know what im afraid of i used to be in a hurry enough to go there once  i suppose i am afraid of the very look of the placeof the old rooms the old walls  i shall go tomorrow night  i am afraid of the very echoes  10thshe has the most extraordinary resemblance to her mother  when i went in i was tremendously startled i stood starting at her  i have just come home it is past midnight i have been all the evening at casa salvi  it is very warmmy window is openi can look out on the river gliding past in the starlight  so of old when i came home i used to stand and look out  there are the same cypresses on the opposite hills  poor young stanmer was there and three or four other admirers they all got up when i came in  i think i had been talked about and there was some curiosity  but why should i have been talked about  they were all youngish mennone of them of my time  she is a wonderful likeness of her mother i couldnt get over it  beautiful like her mother and yet with the same faults in her face but with her mothers perfect head and brow and sympathetic almost pitying eyes  her face has just that peculiarity of her mothers which of all human countenances that i have ever known was the one that passed most quickly and completely from the expression of gaiety to that of repose  repose in her face always suggested sadness and while you were watching it with a kind of awe and wondering of what tragic secret it was the token it kindled on the instant into a radiant italian smile  the countess scarabellis smiles tonight however were almost uninterrupted  she greeted medivinely as her mother used to do and young stanmer sat in the corner of the sofaas i used to doand watched her while she talked  she is thin and very fair and was dressed in light vaporous black that completes the resemblance  the house the rooms are almost absolutely the same there may be changes of detail but they dont modify the general effect  there are the same precious pictures on the walls of the salonthe same great dusky fresco in the concave ceiling  the daughter is not rich i suppose any more than the mother  the furniture is worn and faded and i was admitted by a solitary servant who carried a twinkling taper before me up the great dark marble staircase  i have often heard of you said the countess as i sat down near her my mother often spoke of you  often i answered  i am surprised at that  why are you surprised  were you not good friends  yes for a certain timevery good friends  but i was sure she had forgotten me  she never forgot said the countess looking at me intently and smiling  she was not like that  she was not like most other women in any way i declared  ah she was charming cried the countess rattling open her fan  i have always been very curious to see you  i have received an impression of you  a good one i hope  she looked at me laughing and not answering this it was just her mothers trick  my englishman she used to call youil mio inglese  i hope she spoke of me kindly i insisted  the countess still laughing gave a little shrug balancing her hand to and fro  soso i always supposed you had had a quarrel  you dont mind my being frank like thiseh  i delight in it it reminds me of your mother  every one tells me that  but i am not clever like her  you will see for yourself  that speech i said completes the resemblance  she was always pretending she was not clever and in reality  in reality she was an angel eh  to escape from dangerous comparisons i will admit then that i am clever  that will make a difference  but let us talk of you  you are veryhow shall i say itvery eccentric  is that what your mother told you  to tell the truth she spoke of you as a great original  but arent all englishmen eccentric  all except that one and the countess pointed to poor stanmer in his corner of the sofa  oh i know just what he is i said  hes as quiet as a lambhes like all the world cried the countess  like all the worldyes  he is in love with you  she looked at me with sudden gravity  i dont object to your saying that for all the worldbut i do for him  well i went on he is peculiar in this he is rather afraid of you  instantly she began to smile she turned her face toward stanmer  he had seen that we were talking about him he coloured and got upthen came toward us  i like men who are afraid of nothing said our hostess  i know what you want i said to stanmer  you want to know what the signora contessa says about you  stanmer looked straight into her face very gravely  i dont care a straw what she says  you are almost a match for the signora contessa i answered  she declares she doesnt care a pins head what you think  i recognise the countesss style stanmer exclaimed turning away  one would think said the countess that you were trying to make a quarrel between us  i watched him move away to another part of the great saloon he stood in front of the andrea del sarto looking up at it  but he was not seeing it he was listening to what we might say  i often stood there in just that way  he cant quarrel with you any more than i could have quarrelled with your mother  ah but you did  something painful passed between you  yes it was painful but it was not a quarrel  i went away one day and never saw her again  that was all  the countess looked at me gravely  what do you call it when a man does that  it depends upon the case  sometimes said the countess in french its a lachete  yes and sometimes its an act of wisdom  and sometimes rejoined the countess its a mistake  i shook my head  for me it was no mistake  she began to laugh again  caro signore youre a great original  what had my poor mother done to you  i looked at our young englishman who still had his back turned to us and was staring up at the picture  i will tell you some other time i said  i shall certainly remind you i am very curious to know  then she opened and shut her fan two or three times still looking at me  what eyes they have  tell me a little she went on if i may ask without indiscretion  are you married  no signora contessa  isnt that at least a mistake  do i look very unhappy  she dropped her head a little to one side  for an englishmanno  ah said i laughing you are quite as clever as your mother  and they tell me that you are a great soldier she continued you have lived in india  it was very kind of you so far away to have remembered our poor dear italy  one always remembers italy the distance makes no difference  i remembered it well the day i heard of your mothers death  ah that was a sorrow said the countess  theres not a day that i dont weep for her  but che vuole  shes a saint its paradise  sicuro i answered and i looked some time at the ground  but tell me about yourself dear lady i asked at last raising my eyes  you have also had the sorrow of losing your husband  i am a poor widow as you see  che vuole  my husband died after three years of marriage  i waited for her to remark that the late count scarabelli was also a saint in paradise but i waited in vain  that was like your distinguished father i said  yes he too died young  i cant be said to have known him i was but of the age of my own little girl  but i weep for him all the more  again i was silent for a moment  it was in india too i said presently that i heard of your mothers second marriage  the countess raised her eyebrows  in india then one hears of everything  did that news please you  well since you ask meno  i understand that said the countess looking at her open fan  i shall not marry again like that  thats what your mother said to me i ventured to observe  she was not offended but she rose from her seat and stood looking at me a moment  thenyou should not have gone away she exclaimed  i stayed for another hour it is a very pleasant house  two or three of the men who were sitting there seemed very civil and intelligent one of them was a major of engineers who offered me a profusion of information upon the new organisation of the italian army while he talked however i was observing our hostess who was talking with the others very little i noticed with her young inglese  she is altogether charmingfull of frankness and freedom of that inimitable disinvoltura which in an englishwoman would be vulgar and which in her is simply the perfection of apparent spontaneity  but for all her spontaneity shes as subtle as a needlepoint and knows tremendously well what she is about  if she is not a consummate coquette    what had she in her head when she said that i should not have gone awaypoor little stanmer didnt go away  i left him there at midnight  12thi found him today sitting in the church of santa croce into which i wandered to escape from the heat of the sun  in the nave it was cool and dim he was staring at the blaze of candles on the great altar and thinking i am sure of his incomparable countess  i sat down beside him and after a while as if to avoid the appearance of eagerness he asked me how i had enjoyed my visit to casa salvi and what i thought of the padrona  i think half a dozen things i said but i can only tell you one now shes an enchantress  you shall hear the rest when we have left the church  an enchantress repeated stanmer looking at me askance  he is a very simple youth but who am i to blame him  a charmer i said a fascinatress  he turned away staring at the altar candles  an artistan actress i went on rather brutally  he gave me another glance  i think you are telling me all he said  no no there is more  and we sat a long time in silence  at last he proposed that we should go out and we passed in the street where the shadows had begun to stretch themselves  i dont know what you mean by her being an actress he said as we turned homeward  i suppose not  neither should i have known if any one had said that to me  you are thinking about the mother said stanmer  why are you always bringing her in  my dear boy the analogy is so great it forces itself upon me  he stopped and stood looking at me with his modest perplexed young face i thought he was going to exclaimthe analogy be hangedbut he said after a moment  well what does it prove  i cant say it proves anything but it suggests a great many things  be so good as to mention a few he said as we walked on  you are not sure of her yourself i began  never mind thatgo on with your analogy  thats a part of it  you are very much in love with her  thats a part of it too i suppose  yes as i have told you before  you are in love with her and yet you cant make her out thats just where i was with regard to madame de salvi  and she too was an enchantress an actress an artist and all the rest of it  she was the most perfect coquette i ever knew and the most dangerous because the most finished  what you mean then is that her daughter is a finished coquette  i rather think so  stanmer walked along for some moments in silence  seeing that you suppose me to be aa great admirer of the countess he said at last i am rather surprised at the freedom with which you speak of her  i confessed that i was surprised at it myself  but its on account of the interest i take in you  i am immensely obliged to you said the poor boy  ah of course you dont like it  that is you like my interesti dont see how you can help liking that but you dont like my freedom  thats natural enough but my dear young friend i want only to help you  if a man had said to meso many years agowhat i am saying to you i should certainly also at first have thought him a great brute  but after a little i should have been gratefuli should have felt that he was helping me  you seem to have been very well able to help yourself said stanmer you tell me you made your escape  yes but it was at the cost of infinite perplexityof what i may call keen suffering  i should like to save you all that  i can only repeatit is really very kind of you  dont repeat it too often or i shall begin to think you dont mean it  well said stanmer i think this at any ratethat you take an extraordinary responsibility in trying to put a man out of conceit of a woman who as he believes may make him very happy  i grasped his arm and we stopped going on with our talk like a couple of florentines  do you wish to marry her  he looked away without meeting my eyes  its a great responsibility he repeated  before heaven i said i would have married the mother  you are exactly in my situation  dont you think you rather overdo the analogy asked poor stanmer  a little more a little lessit doesnt matter  i believe you are in my shoes  but of course if you prefer it i will beg a thousand pardons and leave them to carry you where they will  he had been looking away but now he slowly turned his face and met my eyes  you have gone too far to retreat what is it you know about her  about this onenothing  but about the other  i care nothing about the other  my dear fellow i said they are mother and daughterthey are as like as two of andreas madonnas  if they resemble each other then you were simply mistaken in the mother  i took his arm and we walked on again there seemed no adequate reply to such a charge  your state of mind brings back my own so completely i said presently  you admire heryou adore her and yet secretly you mistrust her  you are enchanted with her personal charm her grace her wit her everything and yet in your private heart you are afraid of her  afraid of her  your mistrust keeps rising to the surface you cant rid yourself of the suspicion that at the bottom of all things she is hard and cruel and you would be immensely relieved if some one should persuade you that your suspicion is right  stanmer made no direct reply to this but before we reached the hotel he saidwhat did you ever know about the mother  its a terrible story i answered  he looked at me askance  what did she do  come to my rooms this evening and i will tell you  he declared he would but he never came  exactly the way i should have acted  14thi went again last evening to casa salvi where i found the same little circle with the addition of a couple of ladies  stanmer was there trying hard to talk to one of them but making i am sure a very poor business of it  the countesswell the countess was admirable  she greeted me like a friend of ten years toward whom familiarity should not have engendered a want of ceremony she made me sit near her and she asked me a dozen questions about my health and my occupations  i live in the past i said  i go into the galleries into the old palaces and the churches  today i spent an hour in michael angelos chapel at san loreozo  ah yes thats the past said the countess  those things are very old  twentyseven years old i answered  twentyseven  altro  i mean my own past i said  i went to a great many of those places with your mother  ah the pictures are beautiful murmured the countess glancing at stanmer  have you lately looked at any of them i asked  have you gone to the galleries with him  she hesitated a moment smiling  it seems to me that your question is a little impertinent  but i think you are like that  a little impertinent  never  as i say your mother did me the honour more than once to accompany me to the uffizzi  my mother must have been very kind to you  so it seemed to me at the time  at the time only  well if you prefer so it seems to me now  eh said the countess she made sacrifices  to what cara signora  she was perfectly free  your lamented father was deadand she had not yet contracted her second marriage  if she was intending to marry again it was all the more reason she should have been careful  i looked at her a moment she met my eyes gravely over the top of her fan  are you very careful i said  she dropped her fan with a certain violence  ah yes you are impertinent  ah no i said  remember that i am old enough to be your father that i knew you when you were three years old  i may surely ask such questions  but you are right one must do your mother justice  she was certainly thinking of her second marriage  you have not forgiven her that said the countess very gravely  have you i asked more lightly  i dont judge my mother  that is a mortal sin  my stepfather was very kind to me  i remember him i said i saw him a great many timesyour mother already received him  my hostess sat with lowered eyes saying nothing but she presently looked up  she was very unhappy with my father  that i can easily believe  and your stepfatheris he still living  he diedbefore my mother  did he fight any more duels  he was killed in a duel said the countess discreetly  it seems almost monstrous especially as i can give no reason for itbut this announcement instead of shocking me caused me to feel a strange exhilaration  most assuredly after all these years i bear the poor man no resentment  of course i controlled my manner and simply remarked to the countess that as his fault had been so was his punishment  i think however that the feeling of which i speak was at the bottom of my saying to her that i hoped that unlike her mothers her own brief married life had been happy  if it was not she said i have forgotten it nowi wonder if the late count scarabelli was also killed in a duel and if his adversary    is it on the books that his adversary as well shall perish by the pistol  which of those gentlemen is he i wonder  is it reserved for poor little stanmer to put a bullet into him  no poor little stanmer i trust will do as i did  and yet unfortunately for him that woman is consummately plausible  she was wonderfully nice last evening she was really irresistible  such frankness and freedom and yet something so soft and womanly such graceful gaiety so much of the brightness without any of the stiffness of good breeding and over it all something so picturesquely simple and southern  she is a perfect italian  but she comes honestly by it  after the talk i have just jotted down she changed her place and the conversation for half an hour was general  stanmer indeed said very little partly i suppose because he is shy of talking a foreign tongue  was i like thatwas i so constantly silent  i suspect i was when i was perplexed and heaven knows that very often my perplexity was extreme  before i went away i had a few more words tete atete with the countess  i hope you are not leaving florence yet she said you will stay a while longer  i answered that i came only for a week and that my week was over  i stay on from day to day i am so much interested  eh its the beautiful moment  im glad our city pleases you  florence pleases meand i take a paternal interest to our young friend i added glancing at stanmer  i have become very fond of him  bel tipo inglese said my hostess  and he is very intelligent he has a beautiful mind  she stood there resting her smile and her clear expressive eyes upon me  i dont like to praise him too much i rejoined lest i should appear to praise myself he reminds me so much of what i was at his age  if your beautiful mother were to come to life for an hour she would see the resemblance  she gave me a little amused stare  and yet you dont look at all like him  ah you didnt know me when i was twentyfive  i was very handsome and moreover it isnt that its the mental resemblance  i was ingenuous candid trusting like him  trusting  i remember my mother once telling me that you were the most suspicious and jealous of men  i fell into a suspicious mood but i was fundamentally not in the least addicted to thinking evil  i couldnt easily imagine any harm of any one  and so you mean that mr stanmer is in a suspicions mood  well i mean that his situation is the same as mine  the countess gave me one of her serious looks  come she said what was itthis famous situation of yours  i have heard you mention it before  your mother might have told you since she occasionally did me the honour to speak of me  all my mother ever told me was that you werea sad puzzle to her  at this of course i laughed outi laugh still as i write it  well then that was my situationi was a sad puzzle to a very clever woman  and you mean therefore that i am a puzzle to poor mr stanmer  he is racking his brains to make you out  remember it was you who said he was intelligent  she looked round at him and as fortune would have it his appearance at that moment quite confirmed my assertion  he was lounging back in his chair with an air of indolence rather too marked for a drawingroom and staring at the ceiling with the expression of a man who has just been asked a conundrum  madame scarabelli seemed struck with his attitude  dont you see i said he cant read the riddle  you yourself she answered said he was incapable of thinking evil  i should be sorry to have him think any evil of me  and she looked straight at meseriously appealinglywith her beautiful candid brow  i inclined myself smiling in a manner which might have meanthow could that be possible  i have a great esteem for him she went on i want him to think well of me  if i am a puzzle to him do me a little service  explain me to him  explain you dear lady  you are older and wiser than he  make him understand me  she looked deep into my eyes for a moment and then she turned away  26thi have written nothing for a good many days but meanwhile i have been half a dozen times to casa salvi  i have seen a good deal also of my young friendhad a good many walks and talks with him  i have proposed to him to come with me to venice for a fortnight but he wont listen to the idea of leaving florence  he is very happy in spite of his doubts and i confess that in the perception of his happiness i have lived over again my own  this is so much the case that when the other day he at last made up his mind to ask me to tell him the wrong that madame de salvi had done me i rather checked his curiosity  i told him that if he was bent upon knowing i would satisfy him but that it seemed a pity just now to indulge in painful imagery  but i thought you wanted so much to put me out of conceit of our friend  i admit i am inconsistent but there are various reasons for it  in the first placeits obviousi am open to the charge of playing a double game  i profess an admiration for the countess scarabelli for i accept her hospitality and at the same time i attempt to poison your mind isnt that the proper expression  i cant exactly make up my mind to that though my admiration for the countess and my desire to prevent you from taking a foolish step are equally sincere  and then in the second place you seem to me on the whole so happy  one hesitates to destroy an illusion no matter how pernicious that is so delightful while it lasts  these are the rare moments of life  to be young and ardent in the midst of an italian spring and to believe in the moral perfection of a beautiful womanwhat an admirable situation  float with the current ill stand on the brink and watch you  your real reason is that you feel you have no case against the poor lady said stanmer  you admire her as much as i do  i just admitted that i admired her  i never said she was a vulgar flirt her mother was an absolutely scientific one  heaven knows i admired that  its a nice point however how much one is hound in honour not to warn a young friend against a dangerous woman because one also has relations of civility with the lady  in such a case said stanmer i would break off my relations  i looked at him and i think i laughed  are you jealous of me by chance  he shook his head emphatically  not in the least i like to see you there because your conduct contradicts your words  i have always said that the countess is fascinating  otherwise said stanmer in the case you speak of i would give the lady notice  give her notice  mention to her that you regard her with suspicion and that you propose to do your best to rescue a simpleminded youth from her wiles  that would be more loyal  and he began to laugh again  it is not the first time he has laughed at me but i have never minded it because i have always understood it  is that what you recommend me to say to the countess i asked  recommend you he exclaimed laughing again i recommend nothing  i may be the victim to be rescued but i am at least not a partner to the conspiracy  besides he added in a moment the countess knows your state of mind  has she told you so  stanmer hesitated  she has begged me to listen to everything you may say against her  she declares that she has a good conscience  ah said i shes an accomplished woman  and it is indeed very clever of her to take that tone  stanmer afterwards assured me explicitly that he has never given her a hint of the liberties i have taken in conversation withwhat shall i call itwith her moral nature she has guessed them for herself  she must hate me intensely and yet her manner has always been so charming to me she is truly an accomplished woman  may 4thi have stayed away from casa salvi for a week but i have lingered on in florence under a mixture of impulses  i have had it on my conscience not to go near the countess againand yet from the moment she is aware of the way i feel about her it is open war  there need be no scruples on either side  she is as free to use every possible art to entangle poor stanmer more closely as i am to clip her finespun meshes under the circumstances however we naturally shouldnt meet very cordially  but as regards her meshes why after all should i clip them  it would really be very interesting to see stanmer swallowed up  i should like to see how he would agree with her after she had devoured himto what vulgar imagery by the way does curiosity reduce a man let him finish the story in his own way as i finished it in mine  it is the same story but why a quarter of a century later should it have the same denoument  let him make his own denoument  5thhang it however i dont want the poor boy to be miserable  6thah but did my denoument then prove such a happy one  7thhe came to my room late last night he was much excited  what was it she did to you he asked  i answered him first with another question  have you quarrelled with the countess  but he only repeated his own  what was it she did to you  sit down and ill tell you  and he sat there beside the candle staring at me  there was a man always therecount camerino  the man she married  the man she married  i was very much in love with her and yet i didnt trust her  i was sure that she lied i believed that she could be cruel nevertheless at moments she had a charm which made it pure pedantry to be conscious of her faults and while these moments lasted i would have done anything for her  unfortunately they didnt last long  but you know what i mean am i not describing the scarabelli  the countess scarabelli never lied cried stanmer  thats just what i would have said to any one who should have made the insinutation  but i suppose you are not asking me the question you put to me just now from dispassionate curiosity  a man may want to know said the innocent fellow  i couldnt help laughing out  this at any rate is my story  camerino was always there he was a sort of fixture in the house  if i had moments of dislike for the divine bianca i had no moments of liking for him  and yet he was a very agreeable fellow very civil very intelligent not in the least disposed to make a quarrel with me  the trouble of course was simply that i was jealous of him  i dont know however on what ground i could have quarrelled with him for i had no definite rights  i cant say what i expectedi cant say what as the matter stood i was prepared to do  with my name and my prospects i might perfectly have offered her my hand  i am not sure that she would have accepted iti am by no means clear that she wanted that  but she wanted wanted keenly to attach me to her she wanted to have me about i should have been capable of giving up everythingengland my career my familysimply to devote myself to her to live near her and see her every day  why didnt you do it then asked stanmer  why dont you  to be a proper rejoinder to my question he said rather neatly yours should be asked twentyfive years hence  it remains perfectly true that at a given moment i was capable of doing as i say  that was what she wanteda rich susceptible credulous convenient young englishman established near her en permanence  and yet i added i must do her complete justice  i honestly believe she was fond of me  at this stanmer got up and walked to the window he stood looking out a moment and then he turned round  you know she was older than i i went on  madame scarabelli is older than you  one day in the garden her mother asked me in an angry tone why i disliked camerino for i had been at no pains to conceal my feeling about him and something had just happened to bring it out  i dislike him i said because you like him so much  i assure you i dont like him she answered  he has all the appearance of being your lover i retorted it was a brutal speech certainly but any other man in my place would have made it  she took it very strangely she turned pale but she was not indignant  how can he be my lover after what he has done she asked  what has he done  she hesitated a good while then she said he killed my husband  good heavens i cried and you receive him do you know what she said  she said che voule  is that all asked stanmer  no she went on to say that camerino had killed count salvi in a duel and she admitted that her husbands jealousy had been the occasion of it the count it appeared was a monster of jealousyhe had led her a dreadful life  he himself meanwhile had been anything but irreproachable he had done a mortal injury to a man of whom he pretended to be a friend and this affair had become notorious  the gentleman in question had demanded satisfaction for his outraged honour but for some reason or other the countess to do her justice did not tell me that her husband was a coward he had not as yet obtained it  the duel with camerino had come on first in an access of jealous fury the count had struck camerino in the face and this outrage i know not how justly was deemed expiable before the other  by an extraordinary arrangement the italians have certainly no sense of fair play the other man was allowed to be camerinos second  the duel was fought with swords and the count received a wound of which though at first it was not expected to be fatal he died on the following day  the matter was hushed up as much as possible for the sake of the countesss good name and so successfully that it was presently observed that among the public the other gentleman had the credit of having put his blade through m de salvi this gentleman took a fancy not to contradict the impression and it was allowed to subsist  so long as he consented it was of course in camerinos interest not to contradict it as it left him much more free to keep up his intimacy with the countess  stanmer had listened to all this with extreme attention  why didnt she contradict it  i shrugged my shoulders  i am bound to believe it was for the same reason  i was horrified at any rate by the whole story  i was extremely shocked at the countesss want of dignity in continuing to see the man by whose hand her husband had fallen  the husband had been a great brute and it was not known said stanmer  its not being known made no difference  and as for salvi having been a brute that is but a way of saying that his wife and the man whom his wife subsequently married didnt like him  stanmer hooked extremely meditative his eyes were fixed on mine  yes that marriage is hard to get over  it was not becoming  ah said i what a long breath i drew when i heard of it  i remember the place and the hour  it was at a hillstation in india seven years after i had left florence  the post brought me some english papers and in one of them was a letter from italy with a lot of socalled fashionable intelligence  there among various scandals in high life and other delectable items i read that the countess bianca salvi famous for some years as the presiding genius of the most agreeable seen in florence was about to bestow her hand upon count camerino a distinguished bolognese  ah my dear boy it was a tremendous escape  i had been ready to marry the woman who was capable of that  but my instinct had warned me and i had trusted my instinct  instincts everything as falstaff says  and stanmer began to laugh did you tell madame de salvi that your instinct was against her  no i told her that she frightened me shocked me horrified me  thats about the same thing  and what did she say  she asked me what i would have  i called her friendship with camerino a scandal and she answered that her husband had been a brute  besides no one knew it therefore it was no scandal  just your argument  i retorted that this was odious reasoning and that she had no moral sense we had a passionate argument and i declared i would never see her again in the heat of my displeasure i left florence and i kept my vow  i never saw her again  you couldnt have been much in love with her said stanmer  i was notthree months after  if you had been you would have come backthree days after  so doubtless it seems to you  all i can say is that it was the great effort of my life  being a military man i have had on various occasions to face time enemy  but it was not then i needed my resolution it was when i left florence in a postchaise  stanmer turned about the room two or three times and then he said i dont understand  i dont understand why she should have told you that camerino had killed her husband  it could only damage her  she was afraid it would damage her more that i should think he was her lover  she wished to say the thing that would most effectually persuade me that he was not her loverthat he could never be  and then she wished to get the credit of being very frank  good heavens how you must have analysed her cried my companion staring  there is nothing so analytic as disillusionment  but there it is  she married camerino  yes i dont lime that said stanmer  he was silent a while and then he addedperhaps she wouldnt have done so if you had remained  he has a little innocent way  very likely she would have dispensed with the ceremony i answered drily  upon my word he said you have analysed her  you ought to be grateful to me  i have done for you what you seem unable to do for yourself  i dont see any camerino in my case he said  perhaps among those gentlemen i can find one for you  thank you he cried ill take care of that myself  and he went awaysatisfied i hope  10thhes an obstinate little wretch it irritates me to see him sticking to it  perhaps he is looking for his camerino  i shall leave him at any rate to his fate it is growing insupportably hot  11thi went this evening to bid farewell to the scarabelli  there was no one there she was alone in her great dusky drawingroom which was lighted only by a couple of candles with the immense windows open over the garden  she was dressed in white she was deucedly pretty  she asked me of course why i had been so long without coming  i think you say that only for form i answered  i imagine you know  che what have i done  nothing at all  you are too wise for that  she looked at me a while  i think you are a little crazy  ah no i am only too sane  i have too much reason rather than too little  you have at any rate what we call a fixed idea  there is no harm in that so long as its a good one  but yours is abominable she exclaimed with a laugh  of course you cant like me or my ideas  all things considered you have treated me with wonderful kindness and i thank you and kiss your hands  i leave florence tomorrow  i wont say im sorry she said laughing again  but i am very glad to have seen you  i always wondered about you  you are a curiosity  yes you must find me so  a man who can resist your charms  the fact is i cant  this evening you are enchanting and it is the first time i have been alone with you  she gave no heed to this she turned away  but in a moment she came back and stood looking at me and her beautiful solemn eyes seemed to shine in the dimness of the room  how could you treat my mother so she asked  treat her so  how could you desert the most charming woman in the world  it was not a case of desertion and if it had been it seems to me she was consoled  at this moment there was the sound of a step in the antechamber and i saw that the countess perceived it to be stanmers  that wouldnt have happened she murmured  my poor mother needed a protector  stanmer came in interrupting our talk and looking at me i thought with a little air of bravado  he must think me indeed a tiresome meddlesome bore and upon my word turning it all over i wonder at his docility  after all hes fiveandtwentyand yet i must add it does irritate methe way he sticks  he was followed in a moment by two or three of the regular italians and i made my visit short  goodbye countess i said and she gave me her hand in silence  do you need a protector i added softly  she looked at me from head to foot and then almost angrilyyes signore  but to deprecate her anger i kept her hand an instant and then bent my venerable head and kissed it  i think i appeased her  bologna 14thi left florence on the 11th and have been here these three days  delightful old italian townbut it lacks the charm of my florentine secret  i wrote that last entry five days ago late at night after coming back from casa salsi  i afterwards fell asleep in my chair the night was half over when i woke up  instead of going to bed i stood a long time at the window looking out at the river  it was a warm still night and the first faint streaks of sunrise were in the sky  presently i heard a slow footstep beneath my window and looking down made out by the aid of a street lamp that stanmer was but just coming home  i called to him to come to my rooms and after an interval he made his appearance  i want to bid you goodbye i said i shall depart in the morning dont go to the trouble of saying you are sorry  of course you are not i must have bullied you immensely  he made no attempt to say he was sorry but he said he was very glad to have made my acquaintance  your conversation he said with his little innocent air has been very suggestive  have you found camerino i asked smiling  i have given up the search  well i said some day when you find that you have made a great mistake remember i told you so  he looked for a minute as if he were trying to anticipate that day by the exercise of his reason  has it ever occurred to you that you may have made a great mistake  oh yes everything occurs to one sooner or later  thats what i said to him but i didnt say that the question pointed by his candid young countenance had for the moment a greater force than it had ever had before  and then he asked me whether as things had turned out i myself had been so especially happy  paris december 17tha note from young stanmer whom i saw in florencea remarkable little note dated rome and worth transcribing     my dear generali have it at heart to tell you that i was married a    week ago to the countess salviscarabelli  you talked me into a great    muddle but a month after that it was all very clear  things that    involve a risk are like the christian faith they must be seen from    the insideyours ever e s     p sa fig for analogies unless you can find an analogy for my    happiness  his happiness makes him very clever  i hope it will lasti mean his cleverness not his happiness  london april 19th 1877last night at lady hs i met edmund stanmer who married bianca salvis daughter  i heard the other day that they had come to england  a handsome young fellow with a fresh contented face  he reminded me of florence which i didnt pretend to forget but it was rather awkward for i remember i used to disparage that woman to him  i had a complete theory about her  but he didnt seem at all stiff on the contrary he appeared to enjoy our encounter  i asked him if his wife were there  i had to do that  oh yes shes in one of the other rooms  come and make her acquaintance i want you to know her  you forget that i do know her  oh no you dont you never did  and he gave a little significant laugh  i didnt feel like facing the cidevant scarabelli at that moment so i said that i was leaving the house but that i would do myself the honour of calling upon his wife  we talked for a minute of something else and then suddenly breaking off and looking at me he laid his hand on my arm  i must do him the justice to say that he looks felicitous  depend upon it you were wrong he said  my dear young friend i answered imagine the alacrity with which i concede it  something else again was spoken of but in an instant he repeated his movement  depend upon it you were wrong  i am sure the countess has forgiven me i said and in that case you ought to bear no grudge  as i have had the honour to say i will call upon her immediately  i was not alluding to my wife he answered  i was thinking of your own story  my own story  so many years ago  was it not rather a mistake  i looked at him a moment hes positively rosy  thats not a question to solve in a london crush  and i turned away  22di havent yet called on the cidevant i am afraid of finding her at home  and that boys words have been thrumming in my earsdepend upon it you were wrong  wasnt it rather a mistake  was i wrongwas it a mistake  was i too cautionstoo suspicioustoo logical  was it really a protector she neededa man who might have helped her  would it have been for his benefit to believe in her and was her fault only that i had forsaken her  was the poor woman very unhappy  god forgive me how the questions come crowding in  if i marred her happiness i certainly didnt make my own  and i might have made iteh  thats a charming discovery for a man of my age
