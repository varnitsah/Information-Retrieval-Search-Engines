press     new york city     illustration nathaniel hawthorne     introduction   hawthorne made three collections of his short stories and sketches twicetold tales mosses from an old manse and the snow image and other tales the prefaces to these volumes express with characteristic charm the authors dissatisfaction with his handiwork no critic has pointed out so clearly as hawthorne himself the ineffectiveness of some of the twicetold tales he thinks that the mosses from an old manse afford no solid basis for a literary reputation and his comment upon the earlier and later work gathered indiscriminately into his final volume is that the ripened autumnal fruit tastes but little better than the early windfalls  it must be remembered that the collections were made in desultory fashion they included some work that hawthorne had outgrown even when the first volume was published such as elaborate exercises in description and fanciful allegories excellently composed but without substance yet side by side with these proofs of his long weary apprenticeship are stories that reveal the consummate artist mature in mind and heart and with the sure hand of the master the qualities of imagination and style that place hawthorne easily first among american writers of fiction are as readily discernible in his best brief tales as in his romances  dr heideggers experiment with which the present volume opens is hawthornes earliest treatment of the elixir of immortality theme which haunted him throughout his life and was the subject of the unfinished romance which rested upon his coffin he handles it daintily poetically here with an irony at once exquisite and profound the birthmark represents another favorite theme the rivalry between scientific passion and human affection it is not wholly free from the morbid fancy which hawthorne occasionally betrays and which allies him on one side of his manygifted mind with edgar allan poe but the essential sanity of hawthornes moral and the perfection of the workmanship render the birthmark worthy of its high place among modern short stories ethan brand dates obviously from the sojourn at north adams massachusetts described in the american notebook fragmentary as it is it is one of hawthornes most powerful pieces of writing the unpardonable sin which it portraysthe development of the intellect at the expense of the heartbeing one which the lonely romancer himself had had cause to dread the motive of the humorous character sketch entitled wakefield is somewhat similar the danger of stepping aside even for a moment from ones allotted place drownes wooden image is a charming old boston version of the artistic miracles made possible by love in the ambitious guest the familiar story of the willey house in the notch of the white hills is told with singular delicacy and imaginativeness while the great stone face a parable after hawthornes own heart is suggested by a wellknown phenomenon of the same mountainous region hawthornes numerous tales based upon new england history are represented by one of the briefest the gray champion whose succinct opening and eloquent close are no less admirable than the stern passion of its dramatic climax  not every note of which hawthornes deeptoned instrument was capable is exhibited in these eight tales but they will serve perhaps to show the nature of his magic certain characteristics of his art are everywhere in evidence simplicity of theme and treatment absolute clearness verbal melody with now and again a dusky splendor of coloring the touch of a few other men may be as perfect the notes they evoke more brilliant certainly more gay but hawthornes graver harmonies linger in the ear and abide in the memory it is only after intimate acquaintance however that one perceives fully hawthornes real scope his power to convey an idea in its totality his art is the product of a rich personality strong selfcontained content to brood long over its treasures it is seldom in the history of literatureand quite without parallel in american lettersthat a nature so perfectly dowered should attain to such perfect selfexpression here lies his supreme fortune as an artist he was permitted to give adequate expression to a rare and beautiful genius and for thousands of his countrymen life has been touched to finer issues because hawthorne followed his boyish bent and became a writer of fiction  bliss perry     contents                                      page      editors introduction             v      dr heideggers experiment

meet him in his study there were three whitebearded gentlemen mr medbourne colonel killigrew and mr gascoigne and a withered gentlewoman whose name was the widow wycherly they were all melancholy old creatures who had been unfortunate in life and whose greatest misfortune it was that they were not long ago in their graves mr medbourne in the vigor of his age had been a prosperous merchant but had lost his all by a frantic speculation and was now little better than a mendicant colonel killigrew had wasted his best years and his health and substance in the pursuit of sinful pleasures which had given birth to a brood of pains such as the gout and divers other torments of soul and body mr gascoigne was a ruined politician a man of evil fame or at least had been so till time had buried him from the knowledge of the present generation and made him obscure instead of infamous as for the widow wycherly tradition tells us that she was a great beauty in her day but for a long while past she had lived in deep seclusion on account of certain scandalous stories which had prejudiced the gentry of the town against her it is a circumstance worth mentioning that each of these three old gentlemen mr medbourne colonel killigrew and mr gascoigne were early lovers of the widow wycherly and had once been on the point of cutting each others throats for her sake and before proceeding further i will merely hint that dr heidegger and all his four guests were sometimes thought to be a little beside themselves as is not unfrequently the case with old people when worried either by present troubles or woful recollections  my dear old friends said dr heidegger motioning them to be seated i am desirous of your assistance in one of those little experiments with which i amuse myself here in my study  if all stories were true dr heideggers study must have been a very curious place it was a dim oldfashioned chamber festooned with cobwebs and besprinkled with antique dust around the walls stood several oaken bookcases the lower shelves of which were filled with rows of gigantic folios and blackletter quartos and the upper with little parchmentcovered duodecimos over the central bookcase was a bronze bust of hippocrates with which according to some authorities dr heidegger was accustomed to hold consultations in all difficult cases of his practice in the obscurest corner of the room stood a tall and narrow oaken closet with its door ajar within which doubtfully appeared a skeleton between two of the bookcases hung a lookingglass presenting its high and dusty plate within a tarnished gilt frame among many wonderful stories related of this mirror it was fabled that the spirits of all the doctors deceased patients dwelt within its verge and would stare him in the face whenever he looked thitherward the opposite side of the chamber was ornamented with the fulllength portrait of a young lady arrayed in the faded magnificence of silk satin and brocade and with a visage as faded as her dress above half a century ago dr heidegger had been on the point of marriage with this young lady but being affected with some slight disorder she had swallowed one of her lovers prescriptions and died on the bridal evening the greatest curiosity of the study remains to be mentioned it was a ponderous folio volume bound in black leather with massive silver clasps there were no letters on the back and nobody could tell the title of the book but it was well known to be a book of magic and once when a chambermaid had lifted it merely to brush away the dust the skeleton had rattled in its closet the picture of the young lady had stepped one foot upon the floor and several ghastly faces had peeped forth from the mirror while the brazen head of hippocrates frowned and said forbear  such was dr heideggers study on the summer afternoon of our tale a small round table as black as ebony stood in the centre of the room sustaining a cutglass vase of beautiful form and elaborate workmanship the sunshine came through the window between the heavy festoons of two faded damask curtains and fell directly across this vase so that a mild splendor was reflected from it on the ashen visages of the five old people who sat around four champagneglasses were also on the table  my dear old friends repeated dr heidegger may i reckon on your aid in performing an exceedingly curious experiment  now dr heidegger was a very strange old gentleman whose eccentricity had become the nucleus for a thousand fantastic stories some of these fables to my shame be it spoken might possibly be traced back to mine own veracious self and if any passages of the present tale should startle the readers faith i must be content to bear the stigma of a fictionmonger  when the doctors four guests heard him talk of his proposed experiment they anticipated nothing more wonderful than the murder of a mouse in an airpump or the examination of a cobweb by the microscope or some similar nonsense with which he was constantly in the habit of pestering his intimates but without waiting for a reply dr heidegger hobbled across the chamber and returned with the same ponderous folio bound in black leather which common report affirmed to be a book of magic undoing the silver clasps he opened the volume and took from among its blackletter pages a rose or what was once a rose though now the green leaves and crimson petals had assumed one brownish hue and the ancient flower seemed ready to crumble to dust in the doctors hands  this rose said dr heidegger with a sigh this same withered and crumbling flower blossomed fiveandfifty years ago it was given me by sylvia ward whose portrait hangs yonder and i meant to wear it in my bosom at our wedding fiveandfifty years it has been treasured between the leaves of this old volume now would you deem it possible that this rose of half a century could ever bloom again  nonsense said the widow wycherly with a peevish toss of her head you might as well ask whether an old womans wrinkled face could ever bloom again  see answered dr heidegger  he uncovered the vase and threw the faded rose into the water which it contained at first it lay lightly on the surface of the fluid appearing to imbibe none of its moisture soon however a singular change began to be visible the crushed and dried petals stirred and assumed a deepening tinge of crimson as if the flower were reviving from a deathlike slumber the slender stalk and twigs of foliage became green and there was the rose of half a century looking as fresh as when sylvia ward had first given it to her lover it was scarcely full blown for some of its delicate red leaves curled modestly around its moist bosom within which two or three dewdrops were sparkling  that is certainly a very pretty deception said the doctors friends carelessly however for they had witnessed greater miracles at a conjurers show pray how was it effected  did you never hear of the fountain of youth asked dr heidegger which ponce de leon the spanish adventurer went in search of two or three centuries ago  but did ponce de leon ever find it said the widow wycherly  no answered dr heidegger for he never sought it in the right place the famous fountain of youth if i am rightly informed is situated in the southern part of the floridian peninsula not far from lake macaco its source is overshadowed by several gigantic magnolias which though numberless centuries old have been kept as fresh as violets by the virtues of this wonderful water an acquaintance of mine knowing my curiosity in such matters has sent me what you see in the vase  ahem said colonel killigrew who believed not a word of the doctors story and what may be the effect of this fluid on the human frame  you shall judge for yourself my dear colonel replied dr heidegger and all of you my respected friends are welcome to so much of this admirable fluid as may restore to you the bloom of youth for my own part having had much trouble in growing old i am in no hurry to grow young again with your permission therefore i will merely watch the progress of the experiment  while he spoke dr heidegger had been filling the four champagneglasses with the water of the fountain of youth it was apparently impregnated with an effervescent gas for little bubbles were continually ascending from the depths of the glasses and bursting in silvery spray at the surface as the liquor diffused a pleasant perfume the old people doubted not that it possessed cordial and comfortable properties and though utter sceptics as to its rejuvenescent power they were inclined to swallow it at once but dr heidegger besought them to stay a moment  before you drink my respectable old friends said he it would be well that with the experience of a lifetime to direct you you should draw up a few general rules for your guidance in passing a second time through the perils of youth think what a sin and shame it would be if with your peculiar advantages you should not become patterns of virtue and wisdom to all the young people of the age  the doctors four venerable friends made him no answer except by a feeble and tremulous laugh so very ridiculous was the idea that knowing how closely repentance treads behind the steps of error they should ever go astray again  drink then said the doctor bowing i rejoice that i have so well selected the subjects of my experiment  with palsied hands they raised the glasses to their lips the liquor if it really possessed such virtues as dr heidegger imputed to it could not have been bestowed on four human beings who needed it more wofully they looked as if they had never known what youth or pleasure was but had been the offspring of natures dotage and always the gray decrepit sapless miserable creatures who now sat stooping round the doctors table without life enough in their souls or bodies to be animated even by the prospect of growing young again they drank off the water and replaced their glasses on the table  assuredly there was an almost immediate improvement in the aspect of the party not unlike what might have been produced by a glass of generous wine together with a sudden glow of cheerful sunshine brightening over all their visages at once there was a healthful suffusion on their cheeks instead of the ashen hue that had made them look so corpselike they gazed at one another and fancied that some magic power had really begun to smooth away the deep and sad inscriptions which father time had been so long engraving on their brows the widow wycherly adjusted her cap for she felt almost like a woman again  give us more of this wondrous water cried they eagerly we are youngerbut we are still too old quickgive us more  patience patience quoth dr heidegger who sat watching the experiment with philosophic coolness you have been a long time growing old surely you might be content to grow young in half an hour but the water is at your service  again he filled their glasses with the liquor of youth enough of which still remained in the vase to turn half the old people in the city to the age of their own grandchildren while the bubbles were yet sparkling on the brim the doctors four guests snatched their glasses from the table and swallowed the contents at a single gulp was it delusion even while the draught was passing down their throats it seemed to have wrought a change on their whole systems their eyes grew clear and bright a dark shade deepened among their silvery locks they sat around the table three gentlemen of middle age and a woman hardly beyond her buxom prime  my dear widow you are charming cried colonel killigrew whose eyes had been fixed upon her face while the shadows of age were flitting from it like darkness from the crimson daybreak  the fair widow knew of old that colonel killigrews compliments were not always measured by sober truth so she started up and ran to the mirror still dreading that the ugly visage of an old woman would meet her gaze meanwhile the three gentlemen behaved in such a manner as proved that the water of the fountain of youth possessed some intoxicating qualities unless indeed their exhilaration of spirits were merely a lightsome dizziness caused by the sudden removal of the weight of years mr gascoignes mind seemed to run on political topics but whether relating to the past present or future could not easily be determined since the same ideas and phrases have been in vogue these fifty years now he rattled forth fullthroated sentences about patriotism national glory and the peoples right now he muttered some perilous stuff or other in a sly and doubtful whisper so cautiously that even his own conscience could scarcely catch the secret and now again he spoke in measured accents and a deeply deferential tone as if a royal ear were listening to his wellturned periods colonel killigrew all this time had been trolling forth a jolly bottlesong and ringing his glass in symphony with the chorus while his eyes wandered toward the buxom figure of the widow wycherly on the other side of the table mr medbourne was involved in a calculation of dollars and cents with which was strangely intermingled a project for supplying the east indies with ice by harnessing a team of whales to the polar icebergs  as for the widow wycherly she stood before the mirror courtesying and simpering to her own image and greeting it as the friend whom she loved better than all the world beside she thrust her face close to the glass to see whether some longremembered wrinkle or crowsfoot had indeed vanished she examined whether the snow had so entirely melted from her hair that the venerable cap could be safely thrown aside at last turning briskly away she came with a sort of dancing step to the table  my dear old doctor cried she pray favor me with another glass  certainly my dear madam certainly replied the complaisant doctor see i have already filled the glasses  there in fact stood the four glasses brimful of this wonderful water the delicate spray of which as it effervesced from the surface resembled the tremulous glitter of diamonds it was now so nearly sunset that the chamber had grown duskier than ever but a mild and moonlike splendor gleamed from within the vase and rested alike on the four guests and on the doctors venerable figure he sat in a highbacked elaborately carved oaken armchair with a gray dignity of aspect that might have well befitted that very father time whose power had never been disputed save by this fortunate company even while quaffing the third draught of the fountain of youth they were almost awed by the expression of his mysterious visage  but the next moment the exhilarating gush of young life shot through their veins they were now in the happy prime of youth age with its miserable train of cares and sorrows and diseases was remembered only as the trouble of a dream from which they had joyously awoke the fresh gloss of the soul so early lost and without which the worlds successive scenes had been but a gallery of faded pictures again threw its enchantment over all their prospects they felt like newcreated beings in a newcreated universe  we are young we are young they cried exultingly  youth like the extremity of age had effaced the strongly marked characteristics of middle life and mutually assimilated them all they were a group of merry youngsters almost maddened with the exuberant frolicsomeness of their years the most singular effect of their gayety was an impulse to mock the infirmity and decrepitude of which they had so lately been the victims they laughed loudly at their oldfashioned attire the wideskirted coats and flapped waistcoats of the young men and the ancient cap and gown of the blooming girl one limped across the floor like a gouty grandfather one set a pair of spectacles astride of his nose and pretended to pore over the blackletter pages of the book of magic a third seated himself in an armchair and strove to imitate the venerable dignity of dr heidegger then all shouted mirthfully and leaped about the room the widow wycherlyif so fresh a damsel could be called a widowtripped up to the doctors chair with a mischievous merriment in her rosy face  doctor you dear old soul cried she get up and dance with me and then the four young people laughed louder than ever to think what a queer figure the poor old doctor would cut  pray excuse me answered the doctor quietly i am old and rheumatic and my dancing days were over long ago but either of these gay young gentlemen will be glad of so pretty a partner  dance with me clara cried colonel killigrew  no no i will be her partner shouted mr gascoigne  she promised me her hand fifty years ago exclaimed mr medbourne  they all gathered round her one caught both her hands in his passionate graspanother threw his arm about her waistthe third buried his hand among the glossy curls that clustered beneath the widows cap blushing panting struggling chiding laughing her warm breath fanning each of their faces by turns she strove to disengage herself yet still remained in their triple embrace never was there a livelier picture of youthful rivalship with bewitching beauty for the prize yet by a strange deception owing to the duskiness of the chamber and the antique dresses which they still wore the tall mirror is said to have reflected the figures of the three old gray withered grandsires ridiculously contending for the skinny ugliness of a shrivelled grandam  but they were young their burning passions proved them so inflamed to madness by the coquetry of the girlwidow who neither granted nor quite withheld her favors the three rivals began to interchange threatening glances still keeping hold of the fair prize they grappled fiercely at one anothers throats as they struggled to and fro the table was overturned and the vase dashed into a thousand fragments the precious water of youth flowed in a bright stream across the floor moistening the wings of a butterfly which grown old in the decline of summer had alighted there to die the insect fluttered lightly through the chamber and settled on the snowy head of dr heidegger  come come gentlemencome madam wycherly exclaimed the doctor i really must protest against this riot  they stood still and shivered for it seemed as if gray time were calling them back from their sunny youth far down into the chill and darksome vale of years they looked at old dr heidegger who sat in his carved armchair holding the rose of half a century which he had rescued from among the fragments of the shattered vase at the motion of his hand the four rioters resumed their seats the more readily because their violent exertions had wearied them youthful though they were  my poor sylvias rose ejaculated dr heidegger holding it in the light of the sunset clouds it appears to be fading again  and so it was even while the party were looking at it the flower continued to shrivel up till it became as dry and fragile as when the doctor had first thrown it into the vase he shook off the few drops of moisture which clung to its petals  i love it as well thus as in its dewy freshness observed he pressing the withered rose to his withered lips while he spoke the butterfly fluttered down from the doctors snowy head and fell upon the floor  his guests shivered again a strange chillness whether of the body or spirit they could not tell was creeping gradually over them all they gazed at one another and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm and left a deepening furrow where none had been before was it an illusion had the changes of a lifetime been crowded into so brief a space and were they now four aged people sitting with their old friend dr heidegger  are we grown old again so soon cried they dolefully  in truth they had the water of youth possessed merely a virtue more transient than that of wine the delirium which it created had effervesced away yes they were old again with a shuddering impulse that showed her a woman still the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face and wished that the coffinlid were over it since it could be no longer beautiful  yes friends ye are old again said dr heidegger and lo the water of youth is all lavished on the ground well i bemoan it not for if the fountain gushed at my very doorstep i would not stoop to bathe my lips in it no though its delirium were for years instead of moments such is the lesson ye have taught me  but the doctors four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves they resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to florida and quaff at morning noon and night from the fountain of youth       notein an english review not long since i have been accused of      plagiarizing the idea of this story from a chapter in one of the      novels of alexandre dumas there has undoubtedly been a plagiarism      on one side or the other but as my story was written a good deal      more than twenty years ago and as the novel is of considerably      more recent date i take pleasure in thinking that m dumas has      done me the honor to appropriate one of the fanciful conceptions of      my earlier days he is heartily welcome to it nor is it the only      instance by many in which the great french romancer has exercised      the privilege of commanding genius by confiscating the intellectual      property of less famous people to his own use and behoof       september 1860     the birthmark   in the latter part of the last century there lived a man of science an eminent proficient in every branch of natural philosophy who not long before our story opens had made experience of a spiritual affinity more attractive than any chemical one he had left his laboratory to the care of an assistant cleared his fine countenance from the furnacesmoke washed the stain of acids from his fingers and persuaded a beautiful woman to become his wife in those days when the comparatively recent discovery of electricity and other kindred mysteries of nature seemed to open paths into the region of miracle it was not unusual for the love of science to rival the love of woman in its depth and absorbing energy the higher intellect the imagination the spirit and even the heart might all find their congenial aliment in pursuits which as some of their ardent votaries believed would ascend from one step of powerful intelligence to another until the philosopher should lay his hand on the secret of creative force and perhaps make new worlds for himself we know not whether aylmer possessed this degree of faith in mans ultimate control over nature he had devoted himself however too unreservedly to scientific studies ever to be weakened from them by any second passion his love for his young wife might prove the stronger of the two but it could only be by intertwining itself with his love of science and uniting the strength of the latter to his own  such a union accordingly took place and was attended with truly remarkable consequences and a deeply impressive moral one day very soon after their marriage aylmer sat gazing at his wife with a trouble in his countenance that grew stronger until he spoke  georgiana said he has it never occurred to you that the mark upon your cheek might be removed  no indeed said she smiling but perceiving the seriousness of his manner she blushed deeply to tell you the truth it has been so often called a charm that i was simple enough to imagine it might be so  ah upon another face perhaps it might replied her husband but never on yours no dearest georgiana you came so nearly perfect from the hand of nature that this slightest possible defect which we hesitate whether to term a defect or a beauty shocks me as being the visible mark of earthly imperfection  shocks you my husband cried georgiana deeply hurt at first reddening with momentary anger but then bursting into tears then why did you take me from my mothers side you cannot love what shocks you  to explain this conversation it must be mentioned that in the centre of georgianas left cheek there was a singular mark deeply interwoven as it were with the texture and substance of her face in the usual state of her complexiona healthy though delicate bloomthe mark wore a tint of deeper crimson which imperfectly defined its shape amid the surrounding rosiness when she blushed it gradually became more indistinct and finally vanished amid the triumphant rush of blood that bathed the whole cheek with its brilliant glow but if any shifting motion caused her to turn pale there was the mark again a crimson stain upon the snow in what aylmer sometimes deemed an almost fearful distinctness its shape bore not a little similarity to the human hand though of the smallest pygmy size georgianas lovers were wont to say that some fairy at her birthhour had laid her tiny hand upon the infants cheek and left this impress there in token of the magic endowments that were to give her such sway over all hearts many a desperate swain would have risked life for the privilege of pressing his lips to the mysterious hand it must not be concealed however that the impression wrought by this fairy signmanual varied exceedingly according to the difference of temperament in the beholders some fastidious personsbut they were exclusively of her own sexaffirmed that the bloody hand as they chose to call it quite destroyed the effect of georgianas beauty and rendered her countenance even hideous but it would be as reasonable to say that one of those small blue stains which sometimes occur in the purest statuary marble would convert the eve of powers to a monster masculine observers if the birthmark did not heighten their admiration contented themselves with wishing it away that the world might possess one living specimen of ideal loveliness without the semblance of a flaw after his marriagefor he thought little or nothing of the matter beforeaylmer discovered that this was the case with himself  had she been less beautifulif envys self could have found aught else to sneer athe might have felt his affection heightened by the prettiness of this mimic hand now vaguely portrayed now lost now stealing forth again and glimmering to and fro with every pulse of emotion that throbbed within her heart but seeing her otherwise so perfect he found this one defect grow more and more intolerable with every moment of their united lives it was the fatal flaw of humanity which nature in one shape or another stamps ineffaceably on all her productions either to imply that they are temporary and finite or that their perfection must be wrought by toil and pain the crimson hand expressed the ineludible gripe in which mortality clutches the highest and purest of earthly mould degrading them into kindred with the lowest and even with the very brutes like whom their visible frames return to dust in this manner selecting it as the symbol of his wifes liability to sin sorrow decay and death aylmers sombre imagination was not long in rendering the birthmark a frightful object causing him more trouble and horror than ever georgianas beauty whether of soul or sense had given him delight  at all the seasons which should have been their happiest he invariably and without intending it nay in spite of a purpose to the contrary reverted to this one disastrous topic trifling as it at first appeared it so connected itself with innumerable trains of thought and modes of feeling that it became the central point of all with the morning twilight aylmer opened his eyes upon his wifes face and recognized the symbol of imperfection and when they sat together at the evening hearth his eyes wandered stealthily to her cheek and beheld flickering with the blaze of the woodfire the spectral hand that wrote mortality where he would fain have worshipped georgiana soon learned to shudder at his gaze it needed but a glance with the peculiar expression that his face often wore to change the roses of her cheek into a deathlike paleness amid which the crimson hand was brought strongly out like a basrelief of ruby on the whitest marble  late one night when the lights were growing dim so as hardly to betray the stain on the poor wifes cheek she herself for the first time voluntarily took up the subject  do you remember my dear aylmer said she with a feeble attempt at a smile have you any recollection of a dream last night about this odious hand  none none whatever replied aylmer starting but then he added in a dry cold tone affected for the sake of concealing the real depth of his emotion i might well dream of it for before i fell asleep it had taken a pretty firm hold of my fancy  and you did dream of it continued georgiana hastily for she dreaded lest a gush of tears should interrupt what she had to say a terrible dream i wonder that you can forget it is it possible to forget this one expressionit is in her heart now we must have it out reflect my husband for by all means i would have you recall that dream  the mind is in a sad state when sleep the allinvolving cannot confine her spectres within the dim region of her sway but suffers them to break forth affrighting this actual life with secrets that perchance belong to a deeper one aylmer now remembered his dream he had fancied himself with his servant aminadab attempting an operation for the removal of the birthmark but the deeper went the knife the deeper sank the hand until at length its tiny grasp appeared to have caught hold of georgianas heart whence however her husband was inexorably resolved to cut or wrench it away  when the dream had shaped itself perfectly in his memory aylmer sat in his wifes presence with a guilty feeling truth often finds its way to the mind close muffled in robes of sleep and then speaks with uncompromising directness of matters in regard to which we practise an unconscious selfdeception during our waking moments until now he had not been aware of the tyrannizing influence acquired by one idea over his mind and of the lengths which he might find in his heart to go for the sake of giving himself peace  aylmer resumed georgiana solemnly i know not what may be the cost to both of us to rid me of this fatal birthmark perhaps its removal may cause cureless deformity or it may be the stain goes as deep as life itself again do we know that there is a possibility on any terms of unclasping the firm gripe of this little hand which was laid upon me before i came into the world  dearest georgiana i have spent much thought upon the subject hastily interrupted aylmer i am convinced of the perfect practicability of its removal  if there be the remotest possibility of it continued georgiana let the attempt be made at whatever risk danger is nothing to me for life while this hateful mark makes me the object of your horror and disgustlife is a burden which i would fling down with joy either remove this dreadful hand or take my wretched life you have deep science all the world bears witness of it you have achieved great wonders cannot you remove this little little mark which i cover with the tips of two small fingers is this beyond your power for the sake of your own peace and to save your poor wife from madness  noblest dearest tenderest wife cried aylmer rapturously doubt not my power i have already given this matter the deepest thoughtthought which might almost have enlightened me to create a being less perfect than yourself georgiana you have led me deeper than ever into the heart of science i feel myself fully competent to render this dear cheek as faultless as its fellow and then most beloved what will be my triumph when i shall have corrected what nature left imperfect in her fairest work even pygmalion when his sculptured woman assumed life felt not greater ecstasy than mine will be  it is resolved then said georgiana faintly smiling and aylmer spare me not though you should find the birthmark take refuge in my heart at last  her husband tenderly kissed her cheekher right cheeknot that which bore the impress of the crimson hand  the next day aylmer apprised his wife of a plan that he had formed whereby he might have opportunity for the intense thought and constant watchfulness which the proposed operation would require while georgiana likewise would enjoy the perfect repose essential to its success they were to seclude themselves in the extensive apartments occupied by aylmer as a laboratory and where during his toilsome youth he had made discoveries in the elemental powers of nature that had roused the admiration of all the learned societies in europe seated calmly in this laboratory the pale philosopher had investigated the secrets of the highest cloudregion and of the profoundest mines he had satisfied himself of the causes that kindled and kept alive the fires of the volcano and had explained the mystery of fountains and how it is that they gush forth some so bright and pure and others with such rich medicinal virtues from the dark bosom of the earth here too at an earlier period he had studied the wonders of the human frame and attempted to fathom the very process by which nature assimilates all her precious influences from earth and air and from the spiritual world to create and foster man her masterpiece the latter pursuit however aylmer had long laid aside in unwilling recognition of the truthagainst which all seekers sooner or later stumblethat our great creative mother while she amuses us with apparently working in the broadest sunshine is yet severely careful to keep her own secrets and in spite of her pretended openness shows us nothing but results she permits us indeed to mar but seldom to mend and like a jealous patentee on no account to make now however aylmer resumed these halfforgotten investigations not of course with such hopes or wishes as first suggested them but because they involved much physiological truth and lay in the path of his proposed scheme for the treatment of georgiana  as he led her over the threshold of the laboratory georgiana was cold and tremulous aylmer looked cheerfully into her face with intent to reassure her but was so startled with the intense glow of the birthmark upon the whiteness of her cheek that he could not restrain a strong convulsive shudder his wife fainted  aminadab aminadab shouted aylmer stamping violently on the floor  forthwith there issued from an inner apartment a man of low stature but bulky frame with shaggy hair hanging about his visage which was grimed with the vapors of the furnace this personage had been aylmers underworker during his whole scientific career and was admirably fitted for that office by his great mechanical readiness and the skill with which while incapable of comprehending a single principle he executed all the details of his masters experiments with his vast strength his shaggy hair his smoky aspect and the indescribable earthiness that incrusted him he seemed to represent mans physical nature while aylmers slender figure and pale intellectual face were no less apt a type of the spiritual element  throw open the door of the boudoir aminadab said aylmer and burn a pastil  yes master answered aminadab looking intently at the lifeless form of georgiana and then he muttered to himself if she were my wife id never part with that birthmark  when georgiana recovered consciousness she found herself breathing an atmosphere of penetrating fragrance the gentle potency of which had recalled her from her deathlike faintness the scene around her looked like enchantment aylmer had converted those smoky dingy sombre rooms where he had spent his brightest years in recondite pursuits into a series of beautiful apartments not unfit to be the secluded abode of a lovely woman the walls were hung with gorgeous curtains which imparted the combination of grandeur and grace that no other species of adornment can achieve and as they fell from the ceiling to the floor their rich and ponderous folds concealing all angles and straight lines appeared to shut in the scene from infinite space for aught georgiana knew it might be a pavilion among the clouds and aylmer excluding the sunshine which would have interfered with his chemical processes had supplied its place with perfumed lamps emitting flames of various hue but all uniting in a soft impurpled radiance he now knelt by his wifes side watching her earnestly but without alarm for he was confident in his science and felt that he could draw a magic circle round her within which no evil might intrude  where am i ah i remember said georgiana faintly and she placed her hand over her cheek to hide the terrible mark from her husbands eyes  fear not dearest exclaimed he do not shrink from me believe me georgiana i even rejoice in this single imperfection since it will be such a rapture to remove it  o spare me sadly replied his wife pray do not look at it again i never can forget that convulsive shudder  in order to soothe georgiana and as it were to release her mind from the burden of actual things aylmer now put in practice some of the light and playful secrets which science had taught him among its profounder lore airy figures absolutely bodiless ideas and forms of unsubstantial beauty came and danced before her imprinting their momentary footsteps on beams of light though she had some indistinct idea of the method of these optical phenomena still the illusion was almost perfect enough to warrant the belief that her husband possessed sway over the spiritual world then again when she felt a wish to look forth from her seclusion immediately as if her thoughts were answered the procession of external existence flitted across a screen the scenery and the figures of actual life were perfectly represented but with that bewitching yet indescribable difference which always makes a picture an image or a shadow so much more attractive than the original when wearied of this aylmer bade her cast her eyes upon a vessel containing a quantity of earth she did so with little interest at first but was soon startled to perceive the germ of a plant shooting upward from the soil then came the slender stalk the leaves gradually unfolded themselves and amid them was a perfect and lovely flower  it is magical cried georgiana i dare not touch it  nay pluck it answered aylmerpluck it and inhale its brief perfume while you may the flower will wither in a few moments and leave nothing save its brown seedvessels but thence may be perpetuated a race as ephemeral as itself  but georgiana had no sooner touched the flower than the whole plant suffered a blight its leaves turning coalblack as if by the agency of fire  there was too powerful a stimulus said aylmer thoughtfully  to make up for this abortive experiment he proposed to take her portrait by a scientific process of his own invention it was to be effected by rays of light striking upon a polished plate of metal georgiana assented but on looking at the result was affrighted to find the features of the portrait blurred and indefinable while the minute figure of a hand appeared where the cheek should have been aylmer snatched the metallic plate and threw it into a jar of corrosive acid  soon however he forgot these mortifying failures in the intervals of study and chemical experiment he came to her flushed and exhausted but seemed invigorated by her presence and spoke in glowing language of the resources of his art he gave a history of the long dynasty of the alchemists who spent so many ages in quest of the universal solvent by which the golden principle might be elicited from all things vile and base aylmer appeared to believe that by the plainest scientific logic it was altogether within the limits of possibility to discover this longsought medium but he added a philosopher who should go deep enough to acquire the power would attain too lofty a wisdom to stoop to the exercise of it not less singular were his opinions in regard to the elixir vitæ he more than intimated that it was at his option to concoct a liquid that should prolong life for years perhaps interminably but that it would produce a discord in nature which all the world and chiefly the quaffer of the immortal nostrum would find cause to curse  aylmer are you in earnest asked georgiana looking at him with amazement and fear it is terrible to possess such power or even to dream of possessing it  o do not tremble my love said her husband i would not wrong either you or myself by working such inharmonious effects upon our lives but i would have you consider how trifling in comparison is the skill requisite to remove this little hand  at the mention of the birthmark georgiana as usual shrank as if a redhot iron had touched her cheek  again aylmer applied himself to his labors she could hear his voice in the distant furnaceroom giving directions to aminadab whose harsh uncouth misshapen tones were audible in response more like the grunt or growl of a brute than human speech after hours of absence aylmer reappeared and proposed that she should now examine his cabinet of chemical products and natural treasures of the earth among the former he showed her a small vial in which he remarked was contained a gentle yet most powerful fragrance capable of impregnating all the breezes that blow across a kingdom they were of inestimable value the contents of that little vial and as he said so he threw some of the perfume into the air and filled the room with piercing and invigorating delight  and what is this asked georgiana pointing to a small crystal globe containing a goldcolored liquid it is so beautiful to the eye that i could imagine it the elixir of life  in one sense it is replied aylmer or rather the elixir of immortality it is the most precious poison that ever was concocted in this world by its aid i could apportion the lifetime of any mortal at whom you might point your finger the strength of the dose would determine whether he were to linger out years or drop dead in the midst of a breath no king on his guarded throne could keep his life if i in my private station should deem that the welfare of millions justified me in depriving him of it  why do you keep such a terrific drug inquired georgiana in horror  do not mistrust me dearest said her husband smiling its virtuous potency is yet greater than its harmful one but see here is a powerful cosmetic with a few drops of this in a vase of water freckles may be washed away as easily as the hands are cleansed a stronger infusion would take the blood out of the cheek and leave the rosiest beauty a pale ghost  is it with this lotion that you intend to bathe my cheek asked georgiana anxiously  o no hastily replied her husband this is merely superficial your case demands a remedy that shall go deeper  in his interviews with georgiana aylmer generally made minute inquiries as to her sensations and whether the confinement of the rooms and the temperature of the atmosphere agreed with her these questions had such a particular drift that georgiana began to conjecture that she was already subjected to certain physical influences either breathed in with the fragrant air or taken with her food she fancied likewise but it might be altogether fancy that there was a stirring up of her systema strange indefinite sensation creeping through her veins and tingling half painfully half pleasurably at her heart still whenever she dared to look into the mirror there she beheld herself pale as a white rose and with the crimson birthmark stamped upon her cheek not even aylmer now hated it so much as she  to dispel the tedium of the hours which her husband found it necessary to devote to the processes of combination and analysis georgiana turned over the volumes of his scientific library in many dark old tomes she met with chapters full of romance and poetry they were the works of the philosophers of the middle ages such as albertus magnus cornelius agrippa paracelsus and the famous friar who created the prophetic brazen head all these antique naturalists stood in advance of their centuries yet were imbued with some of their credulity and therefore were believed and perhaps imagined themselves to have acquired from the investigation of nature a power above nature and from physics a sway over the spiritual world hardly less curious and imaginative were the early volumes of the transactions of the royal society in which the members knowing little of the limits of natural possibility were continually recording wonders or proposing methods whereby wonders might be wrought  but to georgiana the most engrossing volume was a large folio from her husbands own hand in which he had recorded every experiment of his scientific career its original aim the methods adopted for its development and its final success or failure with the circumstances to which either event was attributable the book in truth was both the history and emblem of his ardent ambitious imaginative yet practical and laborious life he handled physical details as if there were nothing beyond them yet spiritualized them all and redeemed himself from materialism by his strong and eager aspiration towards the infinite in his grasp the veriest clod of earth assumed a soul georgiana as she read reverenced aylmer and loved him more profoundly than ever but with a less entire dependence on his judgment than heretofore much as he had accomplished she could not but observe that his most splendid successes were almost invariably failures if compared with the ideal at which he aimed his brightest diamonds were the merest pebbles and felt to be so by himself in comparison with the inestimable gems which lay hidden beyond his reach the volume rich with achievements that had won renown for its author was yet as melancholy a record as ever mortal hand had penned it was the sad confession and continual exemplification of the shortcomings of the composite man the spirit burdened with clay and working in matter and of the despair that assails the higher nature at finding itself so miserably thwarted by the earthly part perhaps every man of genius in whatever sphere might recognize the image of his own experience in aylmers journal  so deeply did these reflections affect georgiana that she laid her face upon the open volume and burst into tears in this situation she was found by her husband  it is dangerous to read in a sorcerers books said he with a smile though his countenance was uneasy and displeased georgiana there are pages in that volume which i can scarcely glance over and keep my senses take heed lest it prove as detrimental to you  it has made me worship you more than ever said she  ah wait for this one success rejoined he then worship me if you will i shall deem myself hardly unworthy of it but come i have sought you for the luxury of your voice sing to me dearest  so she poured out the liquid music of her voice to quench the thirst of his spirit he then took his leave with a boyish exuberance of gayety assuring her that her seclusion would endure but a little longer and that the result was already certain scarcely had he departed when georgiana felt irresistibly impelled to follow him she had forgotten to inform aylmer of a symptom which for two or three hours past had begun to excite her attention it was a sensation in the fatal birthmark not painful but which induced a restlessness throughout her system hastening after her husband she intruded for the first time into the laboratory  the first thing that struck her eye was the furnace that hot and feverish worker with the intense glow of its fire which by the quantities of soot clustered above it seemed to have been burning for ages there was a distillingapparatus in full operation around the room were retorts tubes cylinders crucibles and other apparatus of chemical research an electrical machine stood ready for immediate use the atmosphere felt oppressively close and was tainted with gaseous odors which had been tormented forth by the processes of science the severe and homely simplicity of the apartment with its naked walls and brick pavement looked strange accustomed as georgiana had become to the fantastic elegance of her boudoir but what chiefly indeed almost solely drew her attention was the aspect of aylmer himself  he was pale as death anxious and absorbed and hung over the furnace as if it depended upon his utmost watchfulness whether the liquid which it was distilling should be the draught of immortal happiness or misery how different from the sanguine and joyous mien that he had assumed for georgianas encouragement  carefully now aminadab carefully thou human machine carefully thou man of clay muttered aylmer more to himself than his assistant now if there be a thought too much or too little it is all over  ho ho mumbled aminadab look master look  aylmer raised his eyes hastily and at first reddened then grew paler than ever on beholding georgiana he rushed towards her and seized her arm with a gripe that left the print of his fingers upon it  why do you come hither have you no trust in your husband cried he impetuously would you throw the blight of that fatal birthmark over my labors it is not well done go prying woman go  nay aylmer said georgiana with the firmness of which she possessed no stinted endowment it is not you that have a right to complain you mistrust your wife you have concealed the anxiety with which you watch the development of this experiment think not so unworthily of me my husband tell me all the risk we run and fear not that i shall shrink for my share in it is far less than your own  no no georgiana said aylmer impatiently it must not be  i submit replied she calmly and aylmer i shall quaff whatever draught you bring me but it will be on the same principle that would induce me to take a dose of poison if offered by your hand  my noble wife said aylmer deeply moved i knew not the height and depth of your nature until now nothing shall be concealed know then that this crimson hand superficial as it seems has clutched its grasp into your being with a strength of which i had no previous conception i have already administered agents powerful enough to do aught except to change your entire physical system only one thing remains to be tried if that fail us we are ruined  why did you hesitate to tell me this asked she  because georgiana said aylmer in a low voice there is danger  danger there is but one dangerthat this horrible stigma shall be left upon my cheek cried georgiana remove it remove it whatever be the cost or we shall both go mad  heaven knows your words are too true said aylmer sadly and now dearest return to your boudoir in a little while all will be tested  he conducted her back and took leave of her with a solemn tenderness which spoke far more than his words how much was now at stake after his departure georgiana became rapt in musings she considered the character of aylmer and did it completer justice than at any previous moment her heart exulted while it trembled at his honorable loveso pure and lofty that it would accept nothing less than perfection nor miserably make itself contented with an earthlier nature than he had dreamed of she felt how much more precious was such a sentiment than that meaner kind which would have borne with the imperfection for her sake and have been guilty of treason to holy love by degrading its perfect idea to the level of the actual and with her whole spirit she prayed that for a single moment she might satisfy his highest and deepest conception longer than one moment she well knew it could not be for his spirit was ever on the march ever ascending and each instant required something that was beyond the scope of the instant before  the sound of her husbands footsteps aroused her he bore a crystal goblet containing a liquor colorless as water but bright enough to be the draught of immortality aylmer was pale but it seemed rather the consequence of a highly wrought state of mind and tension of spirit than of fear or doubt  the concoction of the draught has been perfect said he in answer to georgianas look unless all my science have deceived me it cannot fail  save on your account my dearest aylmer observed his wife i might wish to put off this birthmark of mortality by relinquishing mortality itself in preference to any other mode life is but a sad possession to those who have attained precisely the degree of moral advancement at which i stand were i weaker and blinder it might be happiness were i stronger it might be endured hopefully but being what i find myself methinks i am of all mortals the most fit to die  you are fit for heaven without tasting death replied her husband but why do we speak of dying the draught cannot fail behold its effect upon this plant  on the windowseat there stood a geranium diseased with yellow blotches which had overspread all its leaves aylmer poured a small quantity of the liquid upon the soil in which it grew in a little time when the roots of the plant had taken up the moisture the unsightly blotches began to be extinguished in a living verdure  there needed no proof said georgiana quietly give me the goblet i joyfully stake all upon your word  drink then thou lofty creature exclaimed aylmer with fervid admiration there is no taint of imperfection on thy spirit thy sensible frame too shall soon be all perfect  she quaffed the liquid and returned the goblet to his hand  it is grateful said she with a placid smile methinks it is like water from a heavenly fountain for it contains i know not what of unobtrusive fragrance and deliciousness it allays a feverish thirst that had parched me for many days now dearest let me sleep my earthly senses are closing over my spirit like the leaves around the heart of a rose at sunset  she spoke the last words with a gentle reluctance as if it required almost more energy than she could command to pronounce the faint and lingering syllables scarcely had they loitered through her lips ere she was lost in slumber aylmer sat by her side watching her aspect with the emotions proper to a man the whole value of whose existence was involved in the process now to be tested mingled with this mood however was the philosophic investigation characteristic of the man of science not the minutest symptom escaped him a heightened flush of the cheek a slight irregularity of breath a quiver of the eyelid a hardly perceptible tremor through the framesuch were the details which as the moments passed he wrote down in his folio volume intense thought had set its stamp upon every previous page of that volume but the thoughts of years were all concentrated upon the last  while thus employed he failed not to gaze often at the fatal hand and not without a shudder yet once by a strange and unaccountable impulse he pressed it with his lips his spirit recoiled however in the very act and georgiana out of the midst of her deep sleep moved uneasily and murmured as if in remonstrance again aylmer resumed his watch nor was it without avail the crimson hand which at first had been strongly visible upon the marble paleness of georgianas cheek now grew more faintly outlined she remained not less pale than ever but the birthmark with every breath that came and went lost somewhat of its former distinctness its presence had been awful its departure was more awful still watch the stain of the rainbow fading out of the sky and you will know how that mysterious symbol passed away  by heaven it is wellnigh gone said aylmer to himself in almost irrepressible ecstasy i can scarcely trace it now success success and now it is like the faintest rosecolor the lightest flush of blood across her cheek would overcome it but she is so pale  he drew aside the windowcurtain and suffered the light of natural day to fall into the room and rest upon her cheek at the same time he heard a gross hoarse chuckle which he had long known as his servant aminadabs expression of delight  ah clod ah earthly mass cried aylmer laughing in a sort of frenzy you have served me well matter and spiritearth and heavenhave both done their part in this laugh thing of the senses you have earned the right to laugh  these exclamations broke georgianas sleep she slowly unclosed her eyes and gazed into the mirror which her husband had arranged for that purpose a faint smile flitted over her lips when she recognized how barely perceptible was now that crimson hand which had once blazed forth with such disastrous brilliancy as to scare away all their happiness but then her eyes sought aylmers face with a trouble and anxiety that he could by no means account for  my poor aylmer murmured she  poor nay richest happiest most favored exclaimed he my peerless bride it is successful you are perfect  my poor aylmer she repeated with a more than human tenderness you have aimed loftily you have done nobly do not repent that with so high and pure a feeling you have rejected the best the earth could offer aylmer dearest aylmer i am dying  alas it was too true the fatal hand had grappled with the mystery of life and was the bond by which an angelic spirit kept itself in union with a mortal frame as the last crimson tint of the birthmarkthat sole token of human imperfectionfaded from her cheek the parting breath of the now perfect woman passed into the atmosphere and her soul lingering a moment near her husband took its heavenward flight then a hoarse chuckling laugh was heard again thus ever does the gross fatality of earth exult in its invariable triumph over the immortal essence which in this dim sphere of halfdevelopment demands the completeness of a higher state yet had aylmer reached a profounder wisdom he need not thus have flung away the happiness which would have woven his mortal life of the selfsame texture with the celestial the momentary circumstance was too strong for him he failed to look beyond the shadowy scope of time and living once for all in eternity to find the perfect future in the present     ethan brand  a chapter from an abortive romance   bartram the limeburner a rough heavylooking man begrimed with charcoal sat watching his kiln at nightfall while his little son played at building houses with the scattered fragments of marble when on the hillside below them they heard a roar of laughter not mirthful but slow and even solemn like a wind shaking the boughs of the forest  father what is that asked the little boy leaving his play and pressing betwixt his fathers knees  o some drunken man i suppose answered the limeburner some merry fellow from the barroom in the village who dared not laugh loud enough within doors lest he should blow the roof of the house off so here he is shaking his jolly sides at the foot of graylock  but father said the child more sensitive than the obtuse middleaged clown he does not laugh like a man that is glad so the noise frightens me  dont be a fool child cried his father gruffly you will never make a man i do believe there is too much of your mother in you i have known the rustling of a leaf startle you hark here comes the merry fellow now you shall see that there is no harm in him  bartram and his little son while they were talking thus sat watching the same limekiln that had been the scene of ethan brands solitary and meditative life before he began his search for the unpardonable sin many years as we have seen had now elapsed since that portentous night when the idea was first developed the kiln however on the mountainside stood unimpaired and was in nothing changed since he had thrown his dark thoughts into the intense glow of its furnace and melted them as it were into the one thought that took possession of his life it was a rude round towerlike structure about twenty feet high heavily built of rough stones and with a hillock of earth heaped about the larger part of its circumference so that the blocks and fragments of marble might be drawn by cartloads and thrown in at the top there was an opening at the bottom of the tower like an ovenmouth but large enough to admit a man in a stooping posture and provided with a massive iron door with the smoke and jets of flame issuing from the chinks and crevices of this door which seemed to give admittance into the hillside it resembled nothing so much as the private entrance to the infernal regions which the shepherds of the delectable mountains were accustomed to show to pilgrims  there are many such limekilns in that tract of country for the purpose of burning the white marble which composes a large part of the substance of the hills some of them built years ago and long deserted with weeds growing in the vacant round of the interior which is open to the sky and grass and wildflowers rooting themselves into the chinks of the stones look already like relics of antiquity and may yet be overspread with the lichens of centuries to come others where the limeburner still feeds his daily and nightlong fire afford points of interest to the wanderer among the hills who seats himself on a log of wood or a fragment of marble to hold a chat with the solitary man it is a lonesome and when the character is inclined to thought may be an intensely thoughtful occupation as it proved in the case of ethan brand who had mused to such strange purpose in days gone by while the fire in this very kiln was burning  the man who now watched the fire was of a different order and troubled himself with no thoughts save the very few that were requisite to his business at frequent intervals he flung back the clashing weight of the iron door and turning his face from the insufferable glare thrust in huge logs of oak or stirred the immense brands with a long pole within the furnace were seen the curling and riotous flames and the burning marble almost molten with the intensity of heat while without the reflection of the fire quivered on the dark intricacy of the surrounding forest and showed in the foreground a bright and ruddy little picture of the hut the spring beside its door the athletic and coalbegrimed figure of the limeburner and the halffrightened child shrinking into the protection of his fathers shadow and when again the iron door was closed then reappeared the tender light of the halffull moon which vainly strove to trace out the indistinct shapes of the neighboring mountains and in the upper sky there was a flitting congregation of clouds still faintly tinged with the rosy sunset though thus far down into the valley the sunshine had vanished long and long ago  the little boy now crept still closer to his father as footsteps were heard ascending the hillside and a human form thrust aside the bushes that clustered beneath the trees  halloo who is it cried the limeburner vexed at his sons timidity yet half infected by it come forward and show yourself like a man or ill fling this chunk of marble at your head  you offer me a rough welcome said a gloomy voice as the unknown man drew nigh yet i neither claim nor desire a kinder one even at my own fireside  to obtain a distincter view bartram threw open the iron door of the kiln whence immediately issued a gush of fierce light that smote full upon the strangers face and figure to a careless eye there appeared nothing very remarkable in his aspect which was that of a man in a coarse brown countrymade suit of clothes tall and thin with the staff and heavy shoes of a wayfarer as he advanced he fixed his eyeswhich were very brightintently upon the brightness of the furnace as if he beheld or expected to behold some object worthy of note within it  good evening stranger said the limeburner whence come you so late in the day  i come from my search answered the wayfarer for at last it is finished  drunkor crazy muttered bartram to himself i shall have trouble with the fellow the sooner i drive him away the better  the little boy all in a tremble whispered to his father and begged him to shut the door of the kiln so that there might not be so much light for that there was something in the mans face which he was afraid to look at yet could not look away from and indeed even the limeburners dull and torpid sense began to be impressed by an indescribable something in that thin rugged thoughtful visage with the grizzled hair hanging wildly about it and those deeply sunken eyes which gleamed like fires within the entrance of a mysterious cavern but as he closed the door the stranger turned towards him and spoke in a quiet familiar way that made bartram feel as if he were a sane and sensible man after all  your task draws to an end i see said he this marble has already been burning three days a few hours more will convert the stone to lime  why who are you exclaimed the limeburner you seem as well acquainted with my business as i am myself  and well i may be said the stranger for i followed the same craft many a long year and here too on this very spot but you are a newcomer in these parts did you never hear of ethan brand  the man that went in search of the unpardonable sin asked bartram with a laugh  the same answered the stranger he has found what he sought and therefore he comes back again  what then you are ethan brand himself cried the limeburner in amazement i am a newcomer here as you say and they call it eighteen years since you left the foot of graylock but i can tell you the good folks still talk about ethan brand in the village yonder and what a strange errand took him away from his limekiln well and so you have found the unpardonable sin  even so said the stranger calmly  if the question is a fair one proceeded bartram where might it be  ethan brand laid his finger on his own heart  here replied he  and then without mirth in his countenance but as if moved by an involuntary recognition of the infinite absurdity of seeking throughout the world for what was the closest of all things to himself and looking into every heart save his own for what was hidden in no other breast he broke into a laugh of scorn it was the same slow heavy laugh that had almost appalled the limeburner when it heralded the wayfarers approach  the solitary mountainside was made dismal by it laughter when out of place mistimed or bursting forth from a disordered state of feeling may be the most terrible modulation of the human voice the laughter of one asleep even if it be a little childthe madmans laughthe wild screaming laugh of a born idiotare sounds that we sometimes tremble to hear and would always willingly forget poets have imagined no utterance of fiends or hobgoblins so fearfully appropriate as a laugh and even the obtuse limeburner felt his nerves shaken as this strange man looked inward at his own heart and burst into laughter that rolled away into the night and was indistinctly reverberated among the hills  joe said he to his little son scamper down to the tavern in the village and tell the jolly fellows there that ethan brand has come back and that he has found the unpardonable sin  the boy darted away on his errand to which ethan brand made no objection nor seemed hardly to notice it he sat on a log of wood looking steadfastly at the iron door of the kiln when the child was out of sight and his swift and light footsteps ceased to be heard treading first on the fallen leaves and then on the rocky mountainpath the limeburner began to regret his departure he felt that the little fellows presence had been a barrier between his guest and himself and that he must now deal heart to heart with a man who on his own confession had committed the one only crime for which heaven could afford no mercy that crime in its indistinct blackness seemed to overshadow him the limeburners own sins rose up within him and made his memory riotous with a throng of evil shapes that asserted their kindred with the master sin whatever it might be which it was within the scope of mans corrupted nature to conceive and cherish they were all of one family they went to and fro between his breast and ethan brands and carried dark greetings from one to the other  then bartram remembered the stories which had grown traditionary in reference to this strange man who had come upon him like a shadow of the night and was making himself at home in his old place after so long absence that the dead people dead and buried for years would have had more right to be at home in any familiar spot than he ethan brand it was said had conversed with satan himself in the lurid blaze of this very kiln the legend had been matter of mirth heretofore but looked grisly now according to this tale before ethan brand departed on his search he had been accustomed to evoke a fiend from the hot furnace of the limekiln night after night in order to confer with him about the unpardonable sin the man and the fiend each laboring to frame the image of some mode of guilt which could neither be atoned for nor forgiven and with the first gleam of light upon the mountaintop the fiend crept in at the iron door there to abide the intensest element of fire until again summoned forth to share in the dreadful task of extending mans possible guilt beyond the scope of heavens else infinite mercy  while the limeburner was struggling with the horror of these thoughts ethan brand rose from the log and flung open the door of the kiln the action was in such accordance with the idea in bartrams mind that he almost expected to see the evil one issue forth redhot from the raging furnace  hold hold cried he with a tremulous attempt to laugh for he was ashamed of his fears although they overmastered him dont for mercys sake bring out your devil now  man sternly replied ethan brand what need have i of the devil i have left him behind me on my track it is with such halfway sinners as you that he busies himself fear not because i open the door i do but act by old custom and am going to trim your fire like a limeburner as i was once  he stirred the vast coals thrust in more wood and bent forward to gaze into the hollow prisonhouse of the fire regardless of the fierce glow that reddened upon his face the limeburner sat watching him and half suspected his strange guest of a purpose if not to evoke a fiend at least to plunge bodily into the flames and thus vanish from the sight of man ethan brand however drew quietly back and closed the door of the kiln  i have looked said he into many a human heart that was seven times hotter with sinful passions than yonder furnace is with fire but i found not there what i sought no not the unpardonable sin  what is the unpardonable sin asked the limeburner and then he shrank farther from his companion trembling lest his question should be answered  it is a sin that grew within my own breast replied ethan brand standing erect with a pride that distinguishes all enthusiasts of his stamp a sin that grew nowhere else the sin of an intellect that triumphed over the sense of brotherhood with man and reverence for god and sacrificed everything to its own mighty claims the only sin that deserves a recompense of immortal agony freely were it to do again would i incur the guilt unshrinkingly i accept the retribution  the mans head is turned muttered the limeburner to himself he may be a sinner like the rest of usnothing more likelybut ill be sworn he is a madman too  nevertheless he felt uncomfortable at his situation alone with ethan brand on the wild mountainside and was right glad to hear the rough murmur of tongues and the footsteps of what seemed a pretty numerous party stumbling over the stones and rustling through the underbrush soon appeared the whole lazy regiment that was wont to infest the village tavern comprehending three or four individuals who had drunk flip beside the barroom fire through all the winters and smoked their pipes beneath the stoop through all the summers since ethan brands departure laughing boisterously and mingling all their voices together in unceremonious talk they now burst into the moonshine and narrow streaks of firelight that illuminated the open space before the limekiln bartram set the door ajar again flooding the spot with light that the whole company might get a fair view of ethan brand and he of them  there among other old acquaintances was a once ubiquitous man now almost extinct but whom we were formerly sure to encounter at the hotel of every thriving village throughout the country it was the stageagent the present specimen of the genus was a wilted and smokedried man wrinkled and rednosed in a smartly cut brown bobtailed coat with brass buttons who for a length of time unknown had kept his desk and corner in the barroom and was still puffing what seemed to be the same cigar that he had lighted twenty years before he had great fame as a dry joker though perhaps less on account of any intrinsic humor than from a certain flavor of brandytoddy and tobaccosmoke which impregnated all his ideas and expressions as well as his person another wellremembered though strangely altered face was that of lawyer giles as people still called him in courtesy an elderly ragamuffin in his soiled shirtsleeves and towcloth trousers this poor fellow had been an attorney in what he called his better days a sharp practitioner and in great vogue among the village litigants but flip and sling and toddy and cocktails imbibed at all hours morning noon and night had caused him to slide from intellectual to various kinds and degrees of bodily labor till at last to adopt his own phrase he slid into a soapvat in other words giles was now a soapboiler in a small way he had come to be but the fragment of a human being a part of one foot having been chopped off by an axe and an entire hand torn away by the devilish grip of a steamengine yet though the corporeal hand was gone a spiritual member remained for stretching forth the stump giles steadfastly averred that he felt an invisible thumb and fingers with as vivid a sensation as before the real ones were amputated a maimed and miserable wretch he was but one nevertheless whom the world could not trample on and had no right to scorn either in this or any previous stage of his misfortunes since he had still kept up the courage and spirit of a man asked nothing in charity and with his one handand that the left onefought a stern battle against want and hostile circumstances  among the throng too came another personage who with certain points of similarity to lawyer giles had many more of difference it was the village doctor a man of some fifty years whom at an earlier period of his life we introduced as paying a professional visit to ethan brand during the latters supposed insanity he was now a purplevisaged rude and brutal yet halfgentlemanly figure with something wild ruined and desperate in his talk and in all the details of his gesture and manners brandy possessed this man like an evil spirit and made him as surly and savage as a wild beast and as miserable as a lost soul but there was supposed to be in him such wonderful skill such native gifts of healing beyond any which medical science could impart that society caught hold of him and would not let him sink out of its reach so swaying to and fro upon his horse and grumbling thick accents at the bedside he visited all the sickchambers for miles about among the mountain towns and sometimes raised a dying man as it were by miracle or quite as often no doubt sent his patient to a grave that was dug many a year too soon the doctor had an everlasting pipe in his mouth and as somebody said in allusion to his habit of swearing it was always alight with hellfire  these three worthies pressed forward and greeted ethan brand each after his own fashion earnestly inviting him to partake of the contents of a certain black bottle in which as they averred he would find something far better worth seeking for than the unpardonable sin no mind which has wrought itself by intense and solitary meditation into a high state of enthusiasm can endure the kind of contact with low and vulgar modes of thought and feeling to which ethan brand was now subjected it made him doubtand strange to say it was a painful doubtwhether he had indeed found the unpardonable sin and found it within himself the whole question on which he had exhausted life and more than life looked like a delusion  leave me he said bitterly ye brute beasts that have made yourselves so shrivelling up your souls with fiery liquors i have done with you years and years ago i groped into your hearts and found nothing there for my purpose get ye gone  why you uncivil scoundrel cried the fierce doctor is that the way you respond to the kindness of your best friends then let me tell you the truth you have no more found the unpardonable sin than yonder boy joe has you are but a crazy fellowi told you so twenty years agoneither better nor worse than a crazy fellow and the fit companion of old humphrey here  he pointed to an old man shabbily dressed with long white hair thin visage and unsteady eyes for some years past this aged person had been wandering about among the hills inquiring of all travellers whom he met for his daughter the girl it seemed had gone off with a company of circusperformers and occasionally tidings of her came to the village and fine stories were told of her glittering appearance as she rode on horseback in the ring or performed marvellous feats on the tightrope  the whitehaired father now approached ethan brand and gazed unsteadily into his face  they tell me you have been all over the earth said he wringing his hands with earnestness you must have seen my daughter for she makes a grand figure in the world and everybody goes to see her did she send any word to her old father or say when she was coming back  ethan brands eye quailed beneath the old mans that daughter from whom he so earnestly desired a word of greeting was the esther of our tale the very girl whom with such cold and remorseless purpose ethan brand had made the subject of a psychological experiment and wasted absorbed and perhaps annihilated her soul in the process  yes murmured he turning away from the hoary wanderer it is no delusion there is an unpardonable sin  while these things were passing a merry scene was going forward in the area of cheerful light beside the spring and before the door of the hut a number of the youth of the village young men and girls had hurried up the hillside impelled by curiosity to see ethan brand the hero of so many a legend familiar to their childhood finding nothing however very remarkable in his aspectnothing but a sunburnt wayfarer in plain garb and dusty shoes who sat looking into the fire as if he fancied pictures among the coalsthese young people speedily grew tired of observing him as it happened there was other amusement at hand an old german jew travelling with a diorama on his back was passing down the mountainroad towards the village just as the party turned aside from it and in hopes of eking out the profits of the day the showman had kept them company to the limekiln  come old dutchman cried one of the young men let us see your pictures if you can swear they are worth looking at  o yes captain answered the jewwhether was a matter of courtesy or craft he styled everybody captaini shall show you indeed some very superb pictures  so placing his box in a proper position he invited the young men and girls to look through the glass orifices of the machine and proceeded to exhibit a series of the most outrageous scratchings and daubings as specimens of the fine arts that ever an itinerant showman had the face to impose upon his circle of spectators the pictures were worn out moreover tattered full of cracks and wrinkles dingy with tobaccosmoke and otherwise in a most pitiable condition some purported to be cities public edifices and ruined castles in europe others represented napoleons battles and nelsons seafights and in the midst of these would be seen a gigantic brown hairy handwhich might have been mistaken for the hand of destiny though in truth it was only the showmanspointing its forefinger to various scenes of the conflict while its owner gave historical illustrations when with much merriment at its abominable deficiency of merit the exhibition was concluded the german bade little joe put his head into the box viewed through the magnifyingglasses the boys round rosy visage assumed the strangest imaginable aspect of an immense titanic child the mouth grinning broadly and the eyes and every other feature overflowing with fun at the joke suddenly however that merry face turned pale and its expression changed to horror for this easily impressed and excitable child had become sensible that the eye of ethan brand was fixed upon him through the glass  you make the little man to be afraid captain said the german jew turning up the dark and strong outline of his visage from his stooping posture but look again and by chance i shall cause you to see somewhat that is very fine upon my word  ethan brand gazed into the box for an instant and then starting back looked fixedly at the german what had he seen nothing apparently for a curious youth who had peeped in almost at the same moment beheld only a vacant space of canvas  i remember you now muttered ethan brand to the showman  ah captain whispered the jew of nuremburg with a dark smile i find it to be a heavy matter in my showboxthis unpardonable sin by my faith captain it has wearied my shoulders this long day to carry it over the mountain  peace answered ethan brand sternly or get thee into the furnace yonder  the jews exhibition had scarcely concluded when a great elderly dogwho seemed to be his own master as no person in the company laid claim to himsaw fit to render himself the object of public notice hitherto he had shown himself a very quiet welldisposed old dog going round from one to another and by way of being sociable offering his rough head to be patted by any kindly hand that would take so much trouble but now all of a sudden this grave and venerable quadruped of his own mere motion and without the slightest suggestion from anybody else began to run round after his tail which to heighten the absurdity of the proceeding was a great deal shorter than it should have been never was seen such headlong eagerness in pursuit of an object that could not possibly be attained never was heard such a tremendous outbreak of growling snarling barking and snappingas if one end of the ridiculous brutes body were at deadly and most unforgivable enmity with the other faster and faster round about went the cur and faster and still faster fled the unapproachable brevity of his tail and louder and fiercer grew his yells of rage and animosity until utterly exhausted and as far from the goal as ever the foolish old dog ceased his performance as suddenly as he had begun it the next moment he was as mild quiet sensible and respectable in his deportment as when he first scraped acquaintance with the company  as may be supposed the exhibition was greeted with universal laughter clapping of hands and shouts of encore to which the canine performer responded by wagging all that there was to wag of his tail but appeared totally unable to repeat his very successful effort to amuse the spectators  meanwhile ethan brand had resumed his seat upon the log and moved it might be by a perception of some remote analogy between his own case and that of this selfpursuing cur he broke into the awful laugh which more than any other token expressed the condition of his inward being from that moment the merriment of the party was at an end they stood aghast dreading lest the inauspicious sound should be reverberated around the horizon and that mountain would thunder it to mountain and so the horror be prolonged upon their ears then whispering one to another that it was latethat the moon was almost downthat the august night was growing chillthey hurried homewards leaving the limeburner and little joe to deal as they might with their unwelcome guest save for these three human beings the open space on the hillside was a solitude set in a vast gloom of forest beyond that darksome verge the firelight glimmered on the stately trunks and almost black foliage of pines intermixed with the lighter verdure of sapling oaks maples and poplars while here and there lay the gigantic corpses of dead trees decaying on the leafstrewn soil and it seemed to little joea timorous and imaginative childthat the silent forest was holding its breath until some fearful thing should happen  ethan brand thrust more wood into the fire and closed the door of the kiln then looking over his shoulder at the limeburner and his son he bade rather than advised them to retire to rest  for myself i cannot sleep said he i have matters that it concerns me to meditate upon i will watch the fire as i used to do in the old time  and call the devil out of the furnace to keep you company i suppose muttered bartram who had been making intimate acquaintance with the black bottle above mentioned but watch if you like and call as many devils as you like for my part i shall be all the better for a snooze come joe  as the boy followed his father into the hut he looked back at the wayfarer and the tears came into his eyes for his tender spirit had an intuition of the bleak and terrible loneliness in which this man had enveloped himself  when they had gone ethan brand sat listening to the crackling of the kindled wood and looking at the little spirts of fire that issued through the chinks of the door these trifles however once so familiar had but the slightest hold of his attention while deep within his mind he was reviewing the gradual but marvellous change that had been wrought upon him by the search to which he had devoted himself he remembered how the night dew had fallen upon himhow the dark forest had whispered to himhow the stars had gleamed upon hima simple and loving man watching his fire in the years gone by and ever musing as it burned he remembered with what tenderness with what love and sympathy for mankind and what pity for human guilt and woe he had first begun to contemplate those ideas which afterwards became the inspiration of his life with what reverence he had then looked into the heart of man viewing it as a temple originally divine and however desecrated still to be held sacred by a brother with what awful fear he had deprecated the success of his pursuit and prayed that the unpardonable sin might never be revealed to him then ensued that vast intellectual development which in its progress disturbed the counterpoise between his mind and heart the idea that possessed his life had operated as a means of education it had gone on cultivating his powers to the highest point of which they were susceptible it had raised him from the level of an unlettered laborer to stand on a starlit eminence whither the philosophers of the earth laden with the lore of universities might vainly strive to clamber after him so much for the intellect but where was the heart that indeed had witheredhad contractedhad hardenedhad perished it had ceased to partake of the universal throb he had lost his hold of the magnetic chain of humanity he was no longer a brotherman opening the chambers of the dungeons of our common nature by the key of holy sympathy which gave him a right to share in all its secrets he was now a cold observer looking on mankind as the subject of his experiment and at length converting man and woman to be his puppets and pulling the wires that moved them to such degrees of crime as were demanded for his study  thus ethan brand became a fiend he began to be so from the moment that his moral nature had ceased to keep the pace of improvement with his intellect and now as his highest effort and inevitable developmentas the bright and gorgeous flower and rich delicious fruit of his lifes laborhe had produced the unpardonable sin  what more have i to seek what more to achieve said ethan brand to himself my task is done and well done  starting from the log with a certain alacrity in his gait and ascending the hillock of earth that was raised against the stone circumference of the limekiln he thus reached the top of the structure it was a space of perhaps ten feet across from edge to edge presenting a view of the upper surface of the immense mass of broken marble with which the kiln was heaped all these innumerable blocks and fragments of marble were redhot and vividly on fire sending up great spouts of blue flame which quivered aloft and danced madly as within a magic circle and sank and rose again with continual and multitudinous activity as the lonely man bent forward over this terrible body of fire the blasting heat smote up against his person with a breath that it might be supposed would have scorched and shrivelled him up in a moment  ethan brand stood erect and raised his arms on high the blue flames played upon his face and imparted the wild and ghastly light which alone could have suited its expression it was that of a fiend on the verge of plunging into his gulf of intensest torment  o mother earth cried he who art no more my mother and into whose bosom this frame shall never be resolved o mankind whose brotherhood i have cast off and trampled thy great heart beneath my feet o stars of heaven that shone on me of old as if to light me onward and upwardfarewell all and forever come deadly element of firehenceforth my familiar frame embrace me as i do thee  that night the sound of a fearful peal of laughter rolled heavily through the sleep of the limeburner and his little son dim shapes of horror and anguish haunted their dreams and seemed still present in the rude hovel when they opened their eyes to the daylight  up boy up cried the limeburner staring about him thank heaven the night is gone at last and rather than pass such another i would watch my limekiln wide awake for a twelvemonth this ethan brand with his humbug of an unpardonable sin has done me no such mighty favor in taking my place  he issued from the hut followed by little joe who kept fast hold of his fathers hand the early sunshine was already pouring its gold upon the mountaintops and though the valleys were still in shadow they smiled cheerfully in the promise of the bright day that was hastening onward the village completely shut in by hills which swelled away gently about it looked as if it had rested peacefully in the hollow of the great hand of providence every dwelling was distinctly visible the little spires of the two churches pointed upwards and caught a foreglimmering of brightness from the sungilt skies upon their gilded weathercocks the tavern was astir and the figure of the old smokedried stageagent cigar in mouth was seen beneath the stoop old graylock was glorified with a golden cloud upon his head scattered likewise over the breasts of the surrounding mountains there were heaps of hoary mist in fantastic shapes some of them far down into the valley others high up towards the summits and still others of the same family of mist or cloud hovering in the gold radiance of the upper atmosphere stepping from one to another of the clouds that rested on the hills and thence to the loftier brotherhood that sailed in air it seemed almost as if a mortal man might thus ascend into the heavenly regions earth was so mingled with sky that it was a daydream to look at it  to supply that charm of the familiar and homely which nature so readily adopts into a scene like this the stagecoach was rattling down the mountainroad and the driver sounded his horn while echo caught up the notes and intertwined them into a rich and varied and elaborate harmony of which the original performer could lay claim to little share the great hills played a concert among themselves each contributing a strain of airy sweetness  little joes face brightened at once  dear father cried he skipping cheerily to and fro that strange man is gone and the sky and the mountains all seem glad of it  yes growled the limeburner with an oath but he has let the fire go down and no thanks to him if five hundred bushels of lime are not spoiled if i catch the fellow hereabouts again i shall feel like tossing him into the furnace  with his long pole in his hand he ascended to the top of the kiln after a moments pause he called to his son  come up here joe said he  so little joe ran up the hillock and stood by his fathers side the marble was all burnt into perfect snowwhite lime but on its surface in the midst of the circlesnowwhite too and thoroughly converted into limelay a human skeleton in the attitude of a person who after long toil lies down to long repose within the ribsstrange to saywas the shape of a human heart  was the fellows heart made of marble cried bartram in some perplexity at this phenomenon at any rate it is burnt into what looks like special good lime and taking all the bones together my kiln is half a bushel the richer for him  so saying the rude limeburner lifted his pole and letting it fall upon the skeleton the relics of ethan brand were crumbled into fragments     wakefield   in some old magazine or newspaper i recollect a story told as truth of a manlet us call him wakefieldwho absented himself for a long time from his wife the fact thus abstractedly stated is not very uncommon norwithout a proper distinction of circumstancesto be condemned either as naughty or nonsensical howbeit this though far from the most aggravated is perhaps the strangest instance on record of marital delinquency and moreover as remarkable a freak as may be found in the whole list of human oddities the wedded couple lived in london the man under pretence of going a journey took lodgings in the next street to his own house and there unheard of by his wife or friends and without the shadow of a reason for such selfbanishment dwelt upwards of twenty years during that period he beheld his home every day and frequently the forlorn mrs wakefield and after so great a gap in his matrimonial felicitywhen his death was reckoned certain his estate settled his name dismissed from memory and his wife long long ago resigned to her autumnal widowhoodhe entered the door one evening quietly as from a days absence and became a loving spouse till death  this outline is all that i remember but the incident though of the purest originality unexampled and probably never to be repeated is one i think which appeals to the generous sympathies of mankind we know each for himself that none of us would perpetrate such a folly yet feel as if some other might to my own contemplations at least it has often recurred always exciting wonder but with a sense that the story must be true and a conception of its heros character whenever any subject so forcibly affects the mind time is well spent in thinking of it if the reader choose let him do his own meditation or if he prefer to ramble with me through the twenty years of wakefields vagary i bid him welcome trusting that there will be a pervading spirit and a moral even should we fail to find them done up neatly and condensed into the final sentence thought has always its efficacy and every striking incident its moral  what sort of a man was wakefield we are free to shape out our own idea and call it by his name he was now in the meridian of life his matrimonial affections never violent were sobered into a calm habitual sentiment of all husbands he was likely to be the most constant because a certain sluggishness would keep his heart at rest wherever it might be placed he was intellectual but not actively so his mind occupied itself in long and lazy musings that tended to no purpose or had not vigor to attain it his thoughts were seldom so energetic as to seize hold of words imagination in the proper meaning of the term made no part of wakefields gifts with a cold but not depraved nor wandering heart and a mind never feverish with riotous thoughts nor perplexed with originality who could have anticipated that our friend would entitle himself to a foremost place among the doers of eccentric deeds had his acquaintances been asked who was the man in london the surest to perform nothing today which should be remembered on the morrow they would have thought of wakefield only the wife of his bosom might have hesitated she without having analyzed his character was partly aware of a quiet selfishness that had rusted into his inactive mindof a peculiar sort of vanity the most uneasy attribute about himof a disposition to craft which had seldom produced more positive effects than the keeping of petty secrets hardly worth revealingand lastly of what she called a little strangeness sometimes in the good man this latter quality is indefinable and perhaps nonexistent  let us now imagine wakefield bidding adieu to his wife it is the dusk of an october evening his equipment is a drab greatcoat a hat covered with an oilcloth topboots an umbrella in one hand and a small portmanteau in the other he has informed mrs wakefield that he is to take the night coach into the country she would fain inquire the length of his journey its object and the probable time of his return but indulgent to his harmless love of mystery interrogates him only by a look he tells her not to expect him positively by the return coach nor to be alarmed should he tarry three or four days but at all events to look for him at supper on friday evening wakefield himself be it considered has no suspicion of what is before him he holds out his hand she gives her own and meets his parting kiss in the matterofcourse way of a ten years matrimony and forth goes the middleaged mr wakefield almost resolved to perplex his good lady by a whole weeks absence after the door has closed behind him she perceives it thrust partly open and a vision of her husbands face through the aperture smiling on her and gone in a moment for the time this little incident is dismissed without a thought but long afterwards when she has been more years a widow than a wife that smile recurs and flickers across all her reminiscences of wakefields visage in her many musings she surrounds the original smile with a multitude of fantasies which make it strange and awful as for instance if she imagines him in a coffin that parting look is frozen on his pale features or if she dreams of him in heaven still his blessed spirit wears a quiet and crafty smile yet for its sake when all others have given him up for dead she sometimes doubts whether she is a widow  but our business is with the husband we must hurry after him along the street ere he lose his individuality and melt into the great mass of london life it would be vain searching for him there let us follow close at his heels therefore until after several superfluous turns and doublings we find him comfortably established by the fireside of a small apartment previously bespoken he is in the next street to his own and at his journeys end he can scarcely trust his good fortune in having got thither unperceivedrecollecting that at one time he was delayed by the throng in the very focus of a lighted lantern and again there were footsteps that seemed to tread behind his own distinct from the multitudinous tramp around him and anon he heard a voice shouting afar and fancied that it called his name doubtless a dozen busybodies had been watching him and told his wife the whole affair poor wakefield little knowest thou thine own insignificance in this great world no mortal eye but mine has traced thee go quietly to thy bed foolish man and on the morrow if thou wilt be wise get thee home to good mrs wakefield and tell her the truth remove not thyself even for a little week from thy place in her chaste bosom were she for a single moment to deem thee dead or lost or lastingly divided from her thou wouldst be wofully conscious of a change in thy true wife forever after it is perilous to make a chasm in human affections not that they gape so long and wide but so quickly close again  almost repenting of his frolic or whatever it may be termed wakefield lies down betimes and starting from his first nap spreads forth his arms into the wide and solitary waste of the unaccustomed bed nothinks he gathering the bedclothes about himi will not sleep alone another night  in the morning he rises earlier than usual and sets himself to consider what he really means to do such are his loose and rambling modes of thought that he has taken this very singular step with the consciousness of a purpose indeed but without being able to define it sufficiently for his own contemplation the vagueness of the project and the convulsive effort with which he plunges into the execution of it are equally characteristic of a feebleminded man wakefield sifts his ideas however as minutely as he may and finds himself curious to know the progress of matters at homehow his exemplary wife will endure her widowhood of a week and briefly how the little sphere of creatures and circumstances in which he was a central object will be affected by his removal a morbid vanity therefore lies nearest the bottom of the affair but how is he to attain his ends not certainly by keeping close in this comfortable lodging where though he slept and awoke in the next street to his home he is as effectually abroad as if the stagecoach had been whirling him away all night yet should he reappear the whole project is knocked in the head his poor brains being hopelessly puzzled with this dilemma he at length ventures out partly resolving to cross the head of the street and send one hasty glance towards his forsaken domicile habitfor he is a man of habitstakes him by the hand and guides him wholly unaware to his own door where just at the critical moment he is aroused by the scraping of his foot upon the step wakefield whither are you going  at that instant his fate was turning on the pivot little dreaming of the doom to which his first backward step devotes him he hurries away breathless with agitation hitherto unfelt and hardly dares turn his head at the distant corner can it be that nobody caught sight of him will not the whole householdthe decent mrs wakefield the smart maidservant and the dirty little footboyraise a hue and cry through london streets in pursuit of their fugitive lord and master wonderful escape he gathers courage to pause and look homeward but is perplexed with a sense of change about the familiar edifice such as affects us all when after a separation of months or years we again see some hill or lake or work of art with which we were friends of old in ordinary cases this indescribable impression is caused by the comparison and contrast between our imperfect reminiscences and the reality in wakefield the magic of a single night has wrought a similar transformation because in that brief period a great moral change has been effected but this is a secret from himself before leaving the spot he catches a far and momentary glimpse of his wife passing athwart the front window with her face turned towards the head of the street the crafty nincompoop takes to his heels scared with the idea that among a thousand such atoms of mortality her eye must have detected him right glad is his heart though his brain be somewhat dizzy when he finds himself by the coalfire of his lodgings  so much for the commencement of this long whimwham after the initial conception and the stirring up of the mans sluggish temperament to put it in practice the whole matter evolves itself in a natural train we may suppose him as the result of deep deliberation buying a new wig of reddish hair and selecting sundry garments in a fashion unlike his customary suit of brown from a jews oldclothes bag it is accomplished wakefield is another man the new system being now established a retrograde movement to the old would be almost as difficult as the step that placed him in his unparalleled position furthermore he is rendered obstinate by a sulkiness occasionally incident to his temper and brought on at present by the inadequate sensation which he conceives to have been produced in the bosom of mrs wakefield he will not go back until she be frightened half to death well twice or thrice has she passed before his sight each time with a heavier step a paler cheek and more anxious brow and in the third week of his nonappearance he detects a portent of evil entering the house in the guise of an apothecary next day the knocker is muffled towards nightfall comes the chariot of a physician and deposits its bigwigged and solemn burden at wakefields door whence after a quarter of an hours visit he emerges perchance the herald of a funeral dear woman will she die by this time wakefield is excited to something like energy of feeling but still lingers away from his wifes bedside pleading with his conscience that she must not be disturbed at such a juncture if aught else restrains him he does not know it in the course of a few weeks she gradually recovers the crisis is over her heart is sad perhaps but quiet and let him return soon or late it will never be feverish for him again such ideas glimmer through the mist of wakefields mind and render him indistinctly conscious that an almost impassable gulf divides his hired apartment from his former home it is but in the next street he sometimes says fool it is in another world hitherto he has put off his return from one particular day to another henceforward he leaves the precise time undetermined not tomorrowprobably next weekpretty soon poor man the dead have nearly as much chance of revisiting their earthly homes as the selfbanished wakefield  would that i had a folio to write instead of an article of a dozen pages then might i exemplify how an influence beyond our control lays its strong hand on every deed which we do and weaves its consequences into an iron tissue of necessity wakefield is spellbound we must leave him for ten years or so to haunt around his house without once crossing the threshold and to be faithful to his wife with all the affection of which his heart is capable while he is slowly fading out of hers long since it must be remarked he has lost the perception of singularity in his conduct  now for a scene amid the throng of a london street we distinguish a man now waxing elderly with few characteristics to attract careless observers yet bearing in his whole aspect the handwriting of no common fate for such as have the skill to read it he is meagre his low and narrow forehead is deeply wrinkled his eyes small and lustreless sometimes wander apprehensively about him but oftener seem to look inward he bends his head and moves with an indescribable obliquity of gait as if unwilling to display his full front to the world watch him long enough to see what we have described and you will allow that circumstanceswhich often produce remarkable men from natures ordinary handiworkhave produced one such here next leaving him to sidle along the footwalk cast your eyes in the opposite direction where a portly female considerably in the wane of life with a prayerbook in her hand is proceeding to yonder church she has the placid mien of settled widowhood her regrets have either died away or have become so essential to her heart that they would be poorly exchanged for joy just as the lean man and wellconditioned woman are passing a slight obstruction occurs and brings these two figures directly in contact their hands touch the pressure of the crowd forces her bosom against his shoulder they stand face to face staring into each others eyes after a ten years separation thus wakefield meets his wife  the throng eddies away and carries them asunder the sober widow resuming her former pace proceeds to church but pauses in the portal and throws a perplexed glance along the street she passes in however opening her prayerbook as she goes and the man with so wild a face that busy and selfish london stands to gaze after him he hurries to his lodgings bolts the door and throws himself upon the bed the latent feelings of years break out his feeble mind acquires a brief energy from their strength all the miserable strangeness of his life is revealed to him at a glance and he cries out passionately wakefield wakefield you are mad  perhaps he was so the singularity of his situation must have so moulded him to himself that considered in regard to his fellowcreatures and the business of life he could not be said to possess his right mind he had contrived or rather he had happened to dissever himself from the worldto vanishto give up his place and privileges with living men without being admitted among the dead the life of a hermit is nowise parallel to his he was in the bustle of the city as of old but the crowd swept by and saw him not he was we may figuratively say always beside his wife and at his hearth yet must never feel the warmth of the one nor the affection of the other it was wakefields unprecedented fate to retain his original share of human sympathies and to be still involved in human interests while he had lost his reciprocal influence on them it would be a most curious speculation to trace out the effect of such circumstances on his heart and intellect separately and in unison yet changed as he was he would seldom be conscious of it but deem himself the same man as ever glimpses of the truth indeed would come but only for the moment and still he would keep saying i shall soon go back nor reflect that he had been saying so for twenty years  i conceive also that these twenty years would appear in the retrospect scarcely longer than the week to which wakefield had at first limited his absence he would look on the affair as no more than an interlude in the main business of his life when after a little while more he should deem it time to reenter his parlor his wife would clap her hands for joy on beholding the middleaged mr wakefield alas what a mistake would time but await the close of our favorite follies we should be young men all of us and till doomsday  one evening in the twentieth year since he vanished wakefield is taking his customary walk towards the dwelling which he still calls his own it is a gusty night of autumn with frequent showers that patter down upon the pavement and are gone before a man can put up his umbrella pausing near the house wakefield discerns through the parlor windows of the second floor the red glow and the glimmer and fitful flash of a comfortable fire on the ceiling appears a grotesque shadow of good mrs wakefield the cap the nose and chin and the broad waist form an admirable caricature which dances moreover with the upflickering and downsinking blaze almost too merrily for the shade of an elderly widow at this instant a shower chances to fall and is driven by the unmannerly gust full into wakefields face and bosom he is quite penetrated with its autumnal chill shall he stand wet and shivering here when his own hearth has a good fire to warm him and his own wife will run to fetch the gray coat and smallclothes which doubtless she has kept carefully in the closet of their bedchamber no wakefield is no such fool he ascends the stepsheavilyfor twenty years have stiffened his legs since he came downbut he knows it not stay wakefield would you go to the sole home that is left you then step into your grave the door opens as he passes in we have a parting glimpse of his visage and recognize the crafty smile which was the precursor of the little joke that he has ever since been playing off at his wifes expense how unmercifully has he quizzed the poor woman well a good nights rest to wakefield  this happy eventsupposing it to be suchcould only have occurred at an unpremeditated moment we will not follow our friend across the threshold he has left us much food for thought a portion of which shall lend its wisdom to a moral and be shaped into a figure amid the seeming confusion of our mysterious world individuals are so nicely adjusted to a system and systems to one another and to a whole that by stepping aside for a moment a man exposes himself to a fearful risk of losing his place forever like wakefield he may become as it were the outcast of the universe     drownes wooden image   one sunshiny morning in the good old times of the town of boston a young carver in wood well known by the name of drowne stood contemplating a large oaken log which it was his purpose to convert into the figurehead of a vessel and while he discussed within his own mind what sort of shape or similitude it were well to bestow upon this excellent piece of timber there came into drownes workshop a certain captain hunnewell owner and commander of the good brig called the cynosure which had just returned from her first voyage to fayal  ah that will do drowne that will do cried the jolly captain tapping the log with his ratan i bespeak this very piece of oak for the figurehead of the cynosure she has shown herself the sweetest craft that ever floated and i mean to decorate her prow with the handsomest image that the skill of man can cut out of timber and drowne you are the fellow to execute it  you give me more credit than i deserve captain hunnewell said the carver modestly yet as one conscious of eminence in his art but for the sake of the good brig i stand ready to do my best and which of these designs do you prefer herepointing to a staring halflength figure in a white wig and scarlet coathere is an excellent model the likeness of our gracious king here is the valiant admiral vernon or if you prefer a female figure what say you to britannia with the trident  all very fine drowne all very fine answered the mariner but as nothing like the brig ever swam the ocean so i am determined she shall have such a figurehead as old neptune never saw in his life and what is more as there is a secret in the matter you must pledge your credit not to betray it  certainly said drowne marvelling however what possible mystery there could be in reference to an affair so open of necessity to the inspection of all the world as the figurehead of a vessel you may depend captain on my being as secret as the nature of the case will permit  captain hunnewell then took drowne by the button and communicated his wishes in so low a tone that it would be unmannerly to repeat what was evidently intended for the carvers private ear we shall therefore take the opportunity to give the reader a few desirable particulars about drowne himself  he was the first american who is known to have attemptedin a very humble line it is truethat art in which we can now reckon so many names already distinguished or rising to distinction from his earliest boyhood he had exhibited a knackfor it would be too proud a word to call it geniusa knack therefore for the imitation of the human figure in whatever material came most readily to hand the snows of a new england winter had often supplied him with a species of marble as dazzlingly white at least as the parian or the carrara and if less durable yet sufficiently so to correspond with any claims to permanent existence possessed by the boys frozen statues yet they won admiration from maturer judges than his schoolfellows and were indeed remarkably clever though destitute of the native warmth that might have made the snow melt beneath his hand as he advanced in life the young man adopted pine and oak as eligible materials for the display of his skill which now began to bring him a return of solid silver as well as the empty praise that had been an apt reward enough for his productions of evanescent snow he became noted for carving ornamental pumpheads and wooden urns for gateposts and decorations more grotesque than fanciful for mantelpieces no apothecary would have deemed himself in the way of obtaining custom without setting up a gilded mortar if not a head of galen or hippocrates from the skilful hand of drowne  but the great scope of his business lay in the manufacture of figureheads for vessels whether it were the monarch himself or some famous british admiral or general or the governor of the province or perchance the favorite daughter of the shipowner there the image stood above the prow decked out in gorgeous colors magnificently gilded and staring the whole world out of countenance as if from an innate consciousness of its own superiority these specimens of native sculpture had crossed the sea in all directions and been not ignobly noticed among the crowded shipping of the thames and wherever else the hardy mariners of new england had pushed their adventures it must be confessed that a family likeness pervaded these respectable progeny of drownes skill that the benign countenance of the king resembled those of his subjects and that miss peggy hobart the merchants daughter bore a remarkable similitude to britannia victory and other ladies of the allegoric sisterhood and finally that they all had a kind of wooden aspect which proved an intimate relationship with the unshaped blocks of timber in the carvers workshop but at least there was no inconsiderable skill of hand nor a deficiency of any attribute to render them really works of art except that deep quality be it of soul or intellect which bestows life upon the lifeless and warmth upon the cold and which had it been present would have made drownes wooden image instinct with spirit  the captain of the cynosure had now finished his instructions  and drowne said he impressively you must lay aside all other business and set about this forthwith and as to the price only do the job in firstrate style and you shall settle that point yourself  very well captain answered the carver who looked grave and somewhat perplexed yet had a sort of smile upon his visage depend upon it ill do my utmost to satisfy you  from that moment the men of taste about long wharf and the town dock who were wont to show their love for the arts by frequent visits to drownes workshop and admiration of his wooden images began to be sensible of a mystery in the carvers conduct often he was absent in the daytime sometimes as might be judged by gleams of light from the shopwindows he was at work until a late hour of the evening although neither knock nor voice on such occasions could gain admittance for a visitor or elicit any word of response nothing remarkable however was observed in the shop at those hours when it was thrown open a fine piece of timber indeed which drowne was known to have reserved for some work of especial dignity was seen to be gradually assuming shape what shape it was destined ultimately to take was a problem to his friends and a point on which the carver himself preserved a rigid silence but day after day though drowne was seldom noticed in the act of working upon it this rude form began to be developed until it became evident to all observers that a female figure was growing into mimic life at each new visit they beheld a larger pile of wooden chips and a nearer approximation to something beautiful it seemed as if the hamadryad of the oak had sheltered herself from the unimaginative world within the heart of her native tree and that it was only necessary to remove the strange shapelessness that had incrusted her and reveal the grace and loveliness of a divinity imperfect as the design the attitude the costume and especially the face of the image still remained there was already an effect that drew the eye from the wooden cleverness of drownes earlier productions and fixed it upon the tantalizing mystery of this new project  copley the celebrated painter then a young man and a resident of boston came one day to visit drowne for he had recognized so much of moderate ability in the carver as to induce him in the dearth of professional sympathy to cultivate his acquaintance on entering the shop the artist glanced at the inflexible image of the king commander dame and allegory that stood around on the best of which might have been bestowed the questionable praise that it looked as if a living man had here been changed to wood and that not only the physical but the intellectual and spiritual part partook of the stolid transformation but in not a single instance did it seem as if the wood were imbibing the ethereal essence of humanity what a wide distinction is here and how far would the slightest portion of the latter merit have outvalued the utmost degree of the former  my friend drowne said copley smiling to himself but alluding to the mechanical and wooden cleverness that so invariably distinguished the images you are really a remarkable person i have seldom met with a man in your line of business that could do so much for one other touch might make this figure of general wolfe for instance a breathing and intelligent human creature  you would have me think that you are praising me highly mr copley answered drowne turning his back upon wolfes image in apparent disgust but there has come a light into my mind i know what you know as well that the one touch which you speak of as deficient is the only one that would be truly valuable and that without it these works of mine are no better than worthless abortions there is the same difference between them and the works of an inspired artist as between a signpost daub and one of your best pictures  this is strange cried copley looking him in the face which now as the painter fancied had a singular depth of intelligence though hitherto it had not given him greatly the advantage over his own family of wooden images what has come over you how is it that possessing the idea which you have now uttered you should produce only such works as these  the carver smiled but made no reply copley turned again to the images conceiving that the sense of deficiency which drowne had just expressed and which is so rare in a merely mechanical character must surely imply a genius the tokens of which had heretofore been overlooked but no there was not a trace of it he was about to withdraw when his eyes chanced to fall upon a halfdeveloped figure which lay in a corner of the workshop surrounded by scattered chips of oak it arrested him at once  what is here who has done this he broke out after contemplating it in speechless astonishment for an instant here is the divine the lifegiving touch what inspired hand is beckoning this wood to arise and live whose work is this  no mans work replied drowne the figure lies within that block of oak and it is my business to find it  drowne said the true artist grasping the carver fervently by the hand you are a man of genius  as copley departed happening to glance backward from the threshold he beheld drowne bending over the halfcreated shape and stretching forth his arms as if he would have embraced and drawn it to his heart while had such a miracle been possible his countenance expressed passion enough to communicate warmth and sensibility to the lifeless oak  strange enough said the artist to himself who would have looked for a modern pygmalion in the person of a yankee mechanic  as yet the image was but vague in its outward presentment so that as in the cloudshapes around the western sun the observer rather felt or was led to imagine than really saw what was intended by it day by day however the work assumed greater precision and settled its irregular and misty outline into distincter grace and beauty the general design was now obvious to the common eye it was a female figure in what appeared to be a foreign dress the gown being laced over the bosom and opening in front so as to disclose a skirt or petticoat the folds and inequalities of which were admirably represented in the oaken substance she wore a hat of singular gracefulness and abundantly laden with flowers such as never grew in the rude soil of new england but which with all their fanciful luxuriance had a natural truth that it seemed impossible for the most fertile imagination to have attained without copying from real prototypes there were several little appendages to this dress such as a fan a pair of earrings a chain about the neck a watch in the bosom and a ring upon the finger all of which would have been deemed beneath the dignity of sculpture they were put on however with as much taste as a lovely woman might have shown in her attire and could therefore have shocked none but a judgment spoiled by artistic rules  the face was still imperfect but gradually by a magic touch intelligence and sensibility brightened through the features with all the effect of light gleaming forth from within the solid oak the face became alive it was a beautiful though not precisely regular and somewhat haughty aspect but with a certain piquancy about the eyes and mouth which of all expressions would have seemed the most impossible to throw over a wooden countenance and now so far as carving went this wonderful production was complete  drowne said copley who had hardly missed a single day in his visits to the carvers workshop if this work were in marble it would make you famous at once nay i would almost affirm that it would make an era in the art it is as ideal as an antique statue and yet as real as any lovely woman whom one meets at a fireside or in the street but i trust you do not mean to desecrate this exquisite creature with paint like those staring kings and admirals yonder  not paint her exclaimed captain hunnewell who stood by not paint the figurehead of the cynosure and what sort of a figure should i cut in a foreign port with such an unpainted oaken stick as this over my prow she must and she shall be painted to the life from the topmost flower in her hat down to the silver spangles on her slippers  mr copley said drowne quietly i know nothing of marble statuary and nothing of the sculptors rules of art but of this wooden image this work of my hands this creature of my heartand here his voice faltered and choked in a very singular mannerof thisof heri may say that i know something a wellspring of inward wisdom gushed within me as i wrought upon the oak with my whole strength and soul and faith let others do what they may with marble and adopt what rules they choose if i can produce my desired effect by painted wood those rules are not for me and i have a right to disregard them  the very spirit of genius muttered copley to himself how otherwise should this carver feel himself entitled to transcend all rules and make me ashamed of quoting them  he looked earnestly at drowne and again saw that expression of human love which in a spiritual sense as the artist could not help imagining was the secret of the life that had been breathed into this block of wood  the carver still in the same secrecy that marked all his operations upon this mysterious image proceeded to paint the habiliments in their proper colors and the countenance with natures red and white when all was finished he threw open his workshop and admitted the townspeople to behold what he had done most persons at their first entrance felt impelled to remove their hats and pay such reverence as was due to the richly dressed and beautiful young lady who seemed to stand in a corner of the room with oaken chips and shavings scattered at her feet then came a sensation of fear as if not being actually human yet so like humanity she must therefore be something preternatural there was in truth an indefinable air and expression that might reasonably induce the query who and from what sphere this daughter of the oak should be the strange rich flowers of eden on her head the complexion so much deeper and more brilliant than those of our native beauties the foreign as it seemed and fantastic garb yet not too fantastic to be worn decorously in the street the delicately wrought embroidery of the skirt the broad gold chain about her neck the curious ring upon her finger the fan so exquisitely sculptured in openwork and painted to resemble pearl and ebonywhere could drowne in his sober walk of life have beheld the vision here so matchlessly embodied and then her face in the dark eyes and around the voluptuous mouth there played a look made up of pride coquetry and a gleam of mirthfulness which impressed copley with the idea that the image was secretly enjoying the perplexing admiration of himself and other beholders  and will you said he to the carver permit this masterpiece to become the figurehead of a vessel give the honest captain yonder figure of britanniait will answer his purpose far betterand send this fairy queen to england where for aught i know it may bring you a thousand pounds  i have not wrought it for money said drowne  what sort of a fellow is this thought copley a yankee and throw away the chance of making his fortune he has gone mad and thence has come this gleam of genius  there was still further proof of drownes lunacy if credit were due to the rumor that he had been seen kneeling at the feet of the oaken lady and gazing with a lovers passionate ardor into the face that his own hands had created the bigots of the day hinted that it would be no matter of surprise if an evil spirit were allowed to enter this beautiful form and seduce the carver to destruction  the fame of the image spread far and wide the inhabitants visited it so universally that after a few days of exhibition there was hardly an old man or a child who had not become minutely familiar with its aspect even had the story of drownes wooden image ended here its celebrity might have been prolonged for many years by the reminiscences of those who looked upon it in their childhood and saw nothing else so beautiful in after life but the town was now astounded by an event the narrative of which has formed itself into one of the most singular legends that are yet to be met with in the traditionary chimneycorners of the new england metropolis where old men and women sit dreaming of the past and wag their heads at the dreamers of the present and the future  one fine morning just before the departure of the cynosure on her second voyage to fayal the commander of that gallant vessel was seen to issue from his residence in hanover street he was stylishly dressed in a blue broadcloth coat with goldlace at the seams and buttonholes an embroidered scarlet waistcoat a triangular hat with a loop and broad binding of gold and wore a silverhilted hanger at his side but the good captain might have been arrayed in the robes of a prince or the rags of a beggar without in either case attracting notice while obscured by such a companion as now leaned on his arm the people in the street started rubbed their eyes and either leaped aside from their path or stood as if transfixed to wood or marble in astonishment  do you see itdo you see it cried one with tremulous eagerness it is the very same  the same answered another who had arrived in town only the night before who do you mean i see only a seacaptain in his shoregoing clothes and a young lady in a foreign habit with a bunch of beautiful flowers in her hat on my word she is as fair and bright a damsel as my eyes have looked on this many a day  yes the samethe very same repeated the other drownes wooden image has come to life  here was a miracle indeed yet illuminated by the sunshine or darkened by the alternate shade of the houses and with its garments fluttering lightly in the morning breeze there passed the image along the street it was exactly and minutely the shape the garb and the face which the townspeople had so recently thronged to see and admire not a rich flower upon her head not a single leaf but had its prototype in drownes wooden workmanship although now their fragile grace had become flexible and was shaken by every footstep that the wearer made the broad gold chain upon the neck was identical with the one represented on the image and glistened with the motion imparted by the rise and fall of the bosom which it decorated a real diamond sparkled on her finger in her right hand she bore a pearl and ebony fan which she flourished with a fantastic and bewitching coquetry that was likewise expressed in all her movements as well as in the style of her beauty and the attire that so well harmonized with it the face with its brilliant depth of complexion had the same piquancy of mirthful mischief that was fixed upon the countenance of the image but which was here varied and continually shifting yet always essentially the same like the sunny gleam upon a bubbling fountain on the whole there was something so airy and yet so real in the figure and withal so perfectly did it represent drownes image that people knew not whether to suppose the magic wood etherealized into a spirit or warmed and softened into an actual woman  one thing is certain muttered a puritan of the old stamp drowne has sold himself to the devil and doubtless this gay captain hunnewell is a party to the bargain  and i said a young man who overheard him would almost consent to be the third victim for the liberty of saluting those lovely lips  and so would i said copley the painter for the privilege of taking her picture  the image or the apparition whichever it might be still escorted by the bold captain proceeded from hanover street through some of the cross lanes that make this portion of the town so intricate to ann street thence into dock square and so downward to drownes shop which stood just on the waters edge the crowd still followed gathering volume as it rolled along never had a modern miracle occurred in such broad daylight nor in the presence of such a multitude of witnesses the airy image as if conscious that she was the object of the murmurs and disturbance that swelled behind her appeared slightly vexed and flustered yet still in a manner consistent with the light vivacity and sportive mischief that were written in her countenance she was observed to flutter her fan with such vehement rapidity that the elaborate delicacy of its workmanship gave way and it remained broken in her hand  arriving at drownes door while the captain threw it open the marvellous apparition paused an instant on the threshold assuming the very attitude of the image and casting over the crowd that glance of sunny coquetry which all remembered on the face of the oaken lady she and her cavalier then disappeared  ah murmured the crowd drawing a deep breath as with one vast pair of lungs  the world looks darker now that she has vanished said some of the young men  but the aged whose recollections dated as far back as witch times shook their heads and hinted that our forefathers would have thought it a pious deed to burn the daughter of the oak with fire  if she be other than a bubble of the elements exclaimed copley i must look upon her face again  he accordingly entered the shop and there in her usual corner stood the image gazing at him as it might seem with the very same expression of mirthful mischief that had been the farewell look of the apparition when but a moment before she turned her face towards the crowd the carver stood beside his creation mending the beautiful fan which by some accident was broken in her hand but there was no longer any motion in the lifelike image nor any real woman in the workshop nor even the witchcraft of a sunny shadow that might have deluded peoples eyes as it flitted along the street captain hunnewell too had vanished his hoarse seabreezy tones however were audible on the other side of a door that opened upon the water  sit down in the stern sheets my lady said the gallant captain come bear a hand you lubbers and set us on board in the turning of a minuteglass  and then was heard the stroke of oars  drowne said copley with a smile of intelligence you have been a truly fortunate man what painter or statuary ever had such a subject no wonder that she inspired a genius into you and first created the artist who afterwards created her image  drowne looked at him with a visage that bore the traces of tears but from which the light of imagination and sensibility so recently illuminating it had departed he was again the mechanical carver that he had been known to be all his lifetime  i hardly understand what you mean mr copley said he putting his hand to his brow this image can it have been my work well i have wrought it in a kind of dream and now that i am broad awake i must set about finishing yonder figure of admiral vernon  and forthwith he employed himself on the stolid countenance of one of his wooden progeny and completed it in his own mechanical style from which he was never known afterwards to deviate he followed his business industriously for many years acquired a competence and in the latter part of his life attained to a dignified station in the church being remembered in records and traditions as deacon drowne the carver one of his productions an indian chief gilded all over stood during the better part of a century on the cupola of the province house bedazzling the eyes of those who looked upward like an angel of the sun another work of the good deacons handa reduced likeness of his friend captain hunnewell holding a telescope and quadrantmay be seen to this day at the corner of broad and state streets serving in the useful capacity of sign to the shop of a nauticalinstrument maker we know not how to account for the inferiority of this quaint old figure as compared with the recorded excellence of the oaken lady unless on the supposition that in every human spirit there is imagination sensibility creative power genius which according to circumstances may either be developed in this world or shrouded in a mask of dulness until another state of being to our friend drowne there came a brief season of excitement kindled by love it rendered him a genius for that one occasion but quenched in disappointment left him again the mechanical carver in wood without the power even of appreciating the work that his own hands had wrought yet who can doubt that the very highest state to which a human spirit can attain in its loftiest aspirations is its truest and most natural state and that drowne was more consistent with himself when he wrought the admirable figure of the mysterious lady than when he perpetrated a whole progeny of blockheads  there was a rumor in boston about this period that a young portuguese lady of rank on some occasion of political or domestic disquietude had fled from her home in fayal and put herself under the protection of captain hunnewell on board of whose vessel and at whose residence she was sheltered until a change of affairs this fair stranger must have been the original of drownes wooden image     the ambitious guest   one september night a family had gathered round their hearth and piled it high with the driftwood of mountain streams the dry cones of the pine and the splintered ruins of great trees that had come crashing down the precipice up the chimney roared the fire and brightened the room with its broad blaze the faces of the father and mother had a sober gladness the children laughed the eldest daughter was the image of happiness at seventeen and the aged grandmother who sat knitting in the warmest place was the image of happiness grown old they had found the herb heartsease in the bleakest spot of all new england this family were situated in the notch of the white hills where the wind was sharp throughout the year and pitilessly cold in the wintergiving their cottage all its fresh inclemency before it descended on the valley of the saco they dwelt in a cold spot and a dangerous one for a mountain towered above their heads so steep that the stones would often rumble down its sides and startle them at midnight  the daughter had just uttered some simple jest that filled them all with mirth when the wind came through the notch and seemed to pause before their cottagerattling the door with a sound of wailing and lamentation before it passed into the valley for a moment it saddened them though there was nothing unusual in the tones but the family were glad again when they perceived that the latch was lifted by some traveller whose footsteps had been unheard amid the dreary blast which heralded his approach and wailed as he was entering and went moaning away from the door  though they dwelt in such a solitude these people held daily converse with the world the romantic pass of the notch is a great artery through which the lifeblood of internal commerce is continually throbbing between maine on one side and the green mountains and the shores of the st lawrence on the other the stagecoach always drew up before the door of the cottage the wayfarer with no companion but his staff paused here to exchange a word that the sense of loneliness might not utterly overcome him ere he could pass through the cleft of the mountain or reach the first house in the valley and there the teamster on his way to portland market would put up for the night and if a bachelor might sit an hour beyond the usual bedtime and steal a kiss from the mountainmaid at parting it was one of those primitive taverns where the traveller pays only for food and lodging but meets with a homely kindness beyond all price when the footsteps were heard therefore between the outer door and the inner one the whole family rose up grandmother children and all as if about to welcome some one who belonged to them and whose fate was linked with theirs  the door was opened by a young man his face at first wore the melancholy expression almost despondency of one who travels a wild and bleak road at nightfall and alone but soon brightened up when he saw the kindly warmth of his reception he felt his heart spring forward to meet them all from the old woman who wiped a chair with her apron to the little child that held out its arms to him one glance and smile placed the stranger on a footing of innocent familiarity with the eldest daughter  ah this fire is the right thing cried he especially when there is such a pleasant circle round it i am quite benumbed for the notch is just like the pipe of a great pair of bellows it has blown a terrible blast in my face all the way from bartlett  then you are going towards vermont said the master of the house as he helped to take a light knapsack off the young mans shoulders  yes to burlington and far enough beyond replied he i meant to have been at ethan crawfords tonight but a pedestrian lingers along such a road as this it is no matter for when i saw this good fire and all your cheerful faces i felt as if you had kindled it on purpose for me and were waiting my arrival so i shall sit down among you and make myself at home  the frankhearted stranger had just drawn his chair to the fire when something like a heavy footstep was heard without rushing down the steep side of the mountain as with long and rapid strides and taking such a leap in passing the cottage as to strike the opposite precipice the family held their breath because they knew the sound and their guest held his by instinct  the old mountain has thrown a stone at us for fear we should forget him said the landlord recovering himself he sometimes nods his head and threatens to come down but we are old neighbors and agree together pretty well upon the whole besides we have a sure place of refuge hard by if he should be coming in good earnest  let us now suppose the stranger to have finished his supper of bears meat and by his natural felicity of manner to have placed himself on a footing of kindness with the whole family so that they talked as freely together as if he belonged to their mountain brood he was of a proud yet gentle spirithaughty and reserved among the rich and great but ever ready to stoop his head to the lowly cottage door and be like a brother or a son at the poor mans fireside in the household of the notch he found warmth and simplicity of feeling the pervading intelligence of new england and a poetry of native growth which they had gathered when they little thought of it from the mountain peaks and chasms and at the very threshold of their romantic and dangerous abode he had travelled far and alone his whole life indeed had been a solitary path for with the lofty caution of his nature he had kept himself apart from those who might otherwise have been his companions the family too though so kind and hospitable had that consciousness of unity among themselves and separation from the world at large which in every domestic circle should still keep a holy place where no stranger may intrude but this evening a prophetic sympathy impelled the refined and educated youth to pour out his heart before the simple mountaineers and constrained them to answer him with the same free confidence and thus it should have been is not the kindred of a common fate a closer tie than that of birth  the secret of the young mans character was a high and abstracted ambition he could have borne to live an undistinguished life but not to be forgotten in the grave yearning desire had been transformed to hope and hope long cherished had become like certainty that obscurely as he journeyed now a glory was to beam on all his pathwaythough not perhaps while he was treading it but when posterity should gaze back into the gloom of what was now the present they would trace the brightness of his footsteps brightening as meaner glories faded and confess that a gifted one had passed from his cradle to his tomb with none to recognize him  as yet cried the stranger his cheek glowing and his eye flashing with enthusiasmas yet i have done nothing were i to vanish from the earth tomorrow none would know so much of me as you that a nameless youth came up at nightfall from the valley of the saco and opened his heart to you in the evening and passed through the notch by sunrise and was seen no more not a soul would ask who was he whither did the wanderer go but i cannot die till i have achieved my destiny then let death come i shall have built my monument  there was a continual flow of natural emotion gushing forth amid abstracted revery which enabled the family to understand this young mans sentiments though so foreign from their own with quick sensibility of the ludicrous he blushed at the ardor into which he had been betrayed  you laugh at me said he taking the eldest daughters hand and laughing himself you think my ambition as nonsensical as if i were to freeze myself to death on the top of mount washington only that people might spy at me from the country round about and truly that would be a noble pedestal for a mans statue  it is better to sit here by this fire answered the girl blushing and be comfortable and contented though nobody thinks about us  i suppose said her father after a fit of musing there is something natural in what the young man says and if my mind had been turned that way i might have felt just the same it is strange wife how his talk has set my head running on things that are pretty certain never to come to pass  perhaps they may observed the wife is the man thinking what he will do when he is a widower  no no cried he repelling the idea with reproachful kindness when i think of your death esther i think of mine too but i was wishing we had a good farm in bartlett or bethlehem or littleton or some other township round the white mountains but not where they could tumble on our heads i should want to stand well with my neighbors and be called squire and sent to general court for a term or two for a plain honest man may do as much good there as a lawyer and when i should be grown quite an old man and you an old woman so as not to be long apart i might die happy enough in my bed and leave you all crying around me a slate gravestone would suit me as well as a marble onewith just my name and age and a verse of a hymn and something to let people know that i lived an honest man and died a christian  there now exclaimed the stranger it is our nature to desire a monument be it slate or marble or a pillar of granite or a glorious memory in the universal heart of man  were in a strange way tonight said the wife with tears in her eyes they say its a sign of something when folks minds go a wandering so hark to the children  they listened accordingly the younger children had been put to bed in another room but with an open door between so that they could be heard talking busily among themselves one and all seemed to have caught the infection from the fireside circle and were outvying each other in wild wishes and childish projects of what they would do when they came to be men and women at length a little boy instead of addressing his brothers and sisters called out to his mother  ill tell you what i wish mother cried he i want you and father and grandmam and all of us and the stranger too to start right away and go and take a drink out of the basin of the flume  nobody could help laughing at the childs notion of leaving a warm bed and dragging them from a cheerful fire to visit the basin of the flumea brook which tumbles over the precipice deep within the notch the boy had hardly spoken when a wagon rattled along the road and stopped a moment before the door it appeared to contain two or three men who were cheering their hearts with the rough chorus of a song which resounded in broken notes between the cliffs while the singers hesitated whether to continue their journey or put up here for the night  father said the girl they are calling you by name  but the good man doubted whether they had really called him and was unwilling to show himself too solicitous of gain by inviting people to patronize his house he therefore did not hurry to the door and the lash being soon applied the travellers plunged into the notch still singing and laughing though their music and mirth came back drearily from the heart of the mountain  there mother cried the boy again theyd have given us a ride to the flume  again they laughed at the childs pertinacious fancy for a night ramble but it happened that a light cloud passed over the daughters spirit she looked gravely into the fire and drew a breath that was almost a sigh it forced its way in spite of a little struggle to repress it then starting and blushing she looked quickly round the circle as if they had caught a glimpse into her bosom the stranger asked what she had been thinking of  nothing answered she with a downcast smile only i felt lonesome just then  o i have always had a gift of feeling what is in other peoples hearts said he half seriously shall i tell the secrets of yours for i know what to think when a young girl shivers by a warm hearth and complains of lonesomeness at her mothers side shall i put these feelings into words  they would not be a girls feelings any longer if they could be put into words replied the mountain nymph laughing but avoiding his eye  all this was said apart perhaps a germ of love was springing in their hearts so pure that it might blossom in paradise since it could not be matured on earth for women worship such gentle dignity as his and the proud contemplative yet kindly soul is oftenest captivated by simplicity like hers but while they spoke softly and he was watching the happy sadness the lightsome shadows the shy yearnings of a maidens nature the wind through the notch took a deeper and drearier sound it seemed as the fanciful stranger said like the choral strain of the spirits of the blast who in old indian times had their dwelling among these mountains and made their heights and recesses a sacred region there was a wail along the road as if a funeral were passing to chase away the gloom the family threw pine branches on their fire till the dry leaves crackled and the flame arose discovering once again a scene of peace and humble happiness the light hovered about them fondly and caressed them all there were the little faces of the children peeping from their bed apart and here the fathers frame of strength the mothers subdued and careful mien the highbrowed youth the budding girl and the good old grandam still knitting in the warmest place the aged woman looked up from her task and with fingers ever busy was the next to speak  old folks have their notions said she as well as young ones youve been wishing and planning and letting your heads run on one thing and another till youve set my mind awandering too now what should an old woman wish for when she can go but a step or two before she comes to her grave children it will haunt me night and day till i tell you  what is it mother cried the husband and wife at once  then the old woman with an air of mystery which drew the circle closer round the fire informed them that she had provided her graveclothes some years beforea nice linen shroud a cap with a muslin ruff and everything of a finer sort than she had worn since her weddingday but this evening an old superstition had strangely recurred to her it used to be said in her younger days that if anything were amiss with a corpse if only the ruff were not smooth or the cap did not set right the corpse in the coffin and beneath the clods would strive to put up its cold hands and arrange it the bare thought made her nervous  dont talk so grandmother said the girl shuddering  now continued the old woman with singular earnestness yet smiling strangely at her own folly i want one of you my childrenwhen your mother is dressed and in the coffini want one of you to hold a lookingglass over my face who knows but i may take a glimpse at myself and see whether alls right  old and young we dream of graves and monuments murmured the stranger youth i wonder how mariners feel when the ship is sinking and they unknown and undistinguished are to be buried together in the oceanthat wide and nameless sepulchre  for a moment the old womans ghastly conception so engrossed the minds of her hearers that a sound abroad in the night rising like the roar of a blast had grown broad deep and terrible before the fated group were conscious of it the house and all within it trembled the foundations of the earth seemed to be shaken as if this awful sound were the peal of the last trump young and old exchanged one wild glance and remained an instant pale affrighted without utterance or power to move then the same shriek burst simultaneously from all their lips  the slide the slide  the simplest words must intimate but not portray the unutterable horror of the catastrophe the victims rushed from their cottage and sought refuge in what they deemed a safer spotwhere in contemplation of such an emergency a sort of barrier had been reared alas they had quitted their security and fled right into the pathway of destruction down came the whole side of the mountain in a cataract of ruin just before it reached the house the stream broke into two branchesshivered not a window there but overwhelmed the whole vicinity blocked up the road and annihilated everything in its dreadful course long ere the thunder of that great slide had ceased to roar among the mountains the mortal agony had been endured and the victims were at peace their bodies were never found  the next morning the light smoke was seen stealing from the cottage chimney up the mountainside within the fire was yet smouldering on the hearth and the chairs in a circle round it as if the inhabitants had but gone forth to view the devastation of the slide and would shortly return to thank heaven for their miraculous escape all had left separate tokens by which those who had known the family were made to shed a tear for each who has not heard their name the story has been told far and wide and will forever be a legend of these mountains poets have sung their fate  there were circumstances which led some to suppose that a stranger had been received into the cottage on this awful night and had shared the catastrophe of all its inmates others denied that there were sufficient grounds for such a conjecture woe for the highsouled youth with his dream of earthly immortality his name and person utterly unknown his history his way of life his plans a mystery never to be solved his death and his existence equally a doubt whose was the agony of that death moment     the great stone face   one afternoon when the sun was going down a mother and her little boy sat at the door of their cottage talking about the great stone face they had but to lift their eyes and there it was plainly to be seen though miles away with the sunshine brightening all its features  and what was the great stone face  embosomed amongst a family of lofty mountains there was a valley so spacious that it contained many thousand inhabitants some of these good people dwelt in loghuts with the black forest all around them on the steep and difficult hillsides others had their homes in comfortable farmhouses and cultivated the rich soil on the gentle slopes or level surfaces of the valley others again were congregated into populous villages where some wild highland rivulet tumbling down from its birthplace in the upper mountain region had been caught and tamed by human cunning and compelled to turn the machinery of cottonfactories the inhabitants of this valley in short were numerous and of many modes of life but all of them grown people and children had a kind of familiarity with the great stone face although some possessed the gift of distinguishing this grand natural phenomenon more perfectly than many of their neighbors  the great stone face then was a work of nature in her mood of majestic playfulness formed on the perpendicular side of a mountain by some immense rocks which had been thrown together in such a position as when viewed at a proper distance precisely to resemble the features of the human countenance it seemed as if an enormous giant or a titan had sculptured his own likeness on the precipice there was the broad arch of the forehead a hundred feet in height the nose with its long bridge and the vast lips which if they could have spoken would have rolled their thunder accents from one end of the valley to the other true it is that if the spectator approached too near he lost the outline of the gigantic visage and could discern only a heap of ponderous and gigantic rocks piled in chaotic ruin one upon another retracing his steps however the wondrous features would again be seen and the farther he withdrew from them the more like a human face with all its original divinity intact did they appear until as it grew dim in the distance with the clouds and glorified vapor of the mountains clustering about it the great stone face seemed positively to be alive  it was a happy lot for children to grow up to manhood or womanhood with the great stone face before their eyes for all the features were noble and the expression was at once grand and sweet as if it were the glow of a vast warm heart that embraced all mankind in its affections and had room for more it was an education only to look at it according to the belief of many people the valley owed much of its fertility to this benign aspect that was continually beaming over it illuminating the clouds and infusing its tenderness into the sunshine  as we began with saying a mother and her little boy sat at their cottagedoor gazing at the great stone face and talking about it the childs name was ernest  mother said he while the titanic visage smiled on him i wish that it could speak for it looks so very kindly that its voice must needs be pleasant if i were to see a man with such a face i should love him dearly  if an old prophecy should come to pass answered his mother we may see a man some time or other with exactly such a face as that  what prophecy do you mean dear mother eagerly inquired ernest pray tell me all about it  so his mother told him a story that her own mother had told to her when she herself was younger than little ernest a story not of things that were past but of what was yet to come a story nevertheless so very old that even the indians who formerly inhabited this valley had heard it from their forefathers to whom as they affirmed it had been murmured by the mountain streams and whispered by the wind among the treetops the purport was that at some future day a child should be born hereabouts who was destined to become the greatest and noblest personage of his time and whose countenance in manhood should bear an exact resemblance to the great stone face not a few oldfashioned people and young ones likewise in the ardor of their hopes still cherished an enduring faith in this old prophecy but others who had seen more of the world had watched and waited till they were weary and had beheld no man with such a face nor any man that proved to be much greater or nobler than his neighbors concluded it to be nothing but an idle tale at all events the great man of the prophecy had not yet appeared  o mother dear mother cried ernest clapping his hands above his head i do hope that i shall live to see him  his mother was an affectionate and thoughtful woman and felt that it was wisest not to discourage the generous hopes of her little boy so she only said to him perhaps you may  and ernest never forgot the story that his mother told him it was always in his mind whenever he looked upon the great stone face he spent his childhood in the logcottage where he was born and was dutiful to his mother and helpful to her in many things assisting her much with his little hands and more with his loving heart in this manner from a happy yet often pensive child he grew up to be a mild quiet unobtrusive boy and sunbrowned with labor in the fields but with more intelligence brightening his aspect than is seen in many lads who have been taught at famous schools yet ernest had had no teacher save only that the great stone face became one to him when the toil of the day was over he would gaze at it for hours until he began to imagine that those vast features recognized him and gave him a smile of kindness and encouragement responsive to his own look of veneration we must not take upon us to affirm that this was a mistake although the face may have looked no more kindly at ernest than at all the world besides but the secret was that the boys tender and confiding simplicity discerned what other people could not see and thus the love which was meant for all became his peculiar portion  about this time there went a rumor throughout the valley that the great man foretold from ages long ago who was to bear a resemblance to the great stone face had appeared at last it seems that many years before a young man had migrated from the valley and settled at a distant seaport where after getting together a little money he had set up as a shopkeeper his namebut i could never learn whether it was his real one or a nickname that had grown out of his habits and success in lifewas gathergold being shrewd and active and endowed by providence with that inscrutable faculty which develops itself in what the world calls luck he became an exceedingly rich merchant and owner of a whole fleet of bulkybottomed ships all the countries of the globe appeared to join hands for the mere purpose of adding heap after heap to the mountainous accumulation of this one mans wealth the cold regions of the north almost within the gloom and shadow of the arctic circle sent him their tribute in the shape of furs hot africa sifted for him the golden sands of her rivers and gathered up the ivory tusks of her great elephants out of the forests the east came bringing him the rich shawls and spices and teas and the effulgence of diamonds and the gleaming purity of large pearls the ocean not to be behindhand with the earth yielded up her mighty whales that mr gathergold might sell their oil and make a profit on it be the original commodity what it might it was gold within his grasp it might be said of him as of midas in the fable that whatever he touched with his finger immediately glistened and grew yellow and was changed at once into sterling metal or which suited him still better into piles of coin and when mr gathergold had become so very rich that it would have taken him a hundred years only to count his wealth he bethought himself of his native valley and resolved to go back thither and end his days where he was born with this purpose in view he sent a skilful architect to build him such a palace as should be fit for a man of his vast wealth to live in  as i have said above it had already been rumored in the valley that mr gathergold had turned out to be the prophetic personage so long and vainly looked for and that his visage was the perfect and undeniable similitude of the great stone face people were the more ready to believe that this must needs be the fact when they beheld the splendid edifice that rose as if by enchantment on the site of his fathers old weatherbeaten farmhouse the exterior was of marble so dazzlingly white that it seemed as though the whole structure might melt away in the sunshine like those humbler ones which mr gathergold in his young playdays before his fingers were gifted with the touch of transmutation had been accustomed to build of snow it had a richly ornamented portico supported by tall pillars beneath which was a lofty door studded with silver knobs and made of a kind of variegated wood that had been brought from beyond the sea the windows from the floor to the ceiling of each stately apartment were composed respectively of but one enormous pane of glass so transparently pure that it was said to be a finer medium than even the vacant atmosphere hardly anybody had been permitted to see the interior of this palace but it was reported and with good semblance of truth to be far more gorgeous than the outside insomuch that whatever was iron or brass in other houses was silver or gold in this and mr gathergolds bedchamber especially made such a glittering appearance that no ordinary man would have been able to close his eyes there but on the other hand mr gathergold was now so inured to wealth that perhaps he could not have closed his eyes unless where the gleam of it was certain to find its way beneath his eyelids  in due time the mansion was finished next came the upholsterers with magnificent furniture then a whole troop of black and white servants the harbingers of mr gathergold who in his own majestic person was expected to arrive at sunset our friend ernest meanwhile had been deeply stirred by the idea that the great man the noble man the man of prophecy after so many ages of delay was at length to be made manifest to his native valley he knew boy as he was that there were a thousand ways in which mr gathergold with his vast wealth might transform himself into an angel of beneficence and assume a control over human affairs as wide and benignant as the smile of the great stone face full of faith and hope ernest doubted not that what the people said was true and that now he was to behold the living likeness of those wondrous features on the mountainside while the boy was still gazing up the valley and fancying as he always did that the great stone face returned his gaze and looked kindly at him the rumbling of wheels was heard approaching swiftly along the winding road  here he comes cried a group of people who were assembled to witness the arrival here comes the great mr gathergold  a carriage drawn by four horses dashed round the turn of the road within it thrust partly out of the window appeared the physiognomy of a little old man with a skin as yellow as if his own midashand had transmuted it he had a low forehead small sharp eyes puckered about with innumerable wrinkles and very thin lips which he made still thinner by pressing them forcibly together  the very image of the great stone face shouted the people sure enough the old prophecy is true and here we have the great man come at last  and what greatly perplexed ernest they seemed actually to believe that here was the likeness which they spoke of by the roadside there chanced to be an old beggarwoman and two little beggarchildren stragglers from some faroff region who as the carriage rolled onward held out their hands and lifted up their doleful voices most piteously beseeching charity a yellow clawthe very same that had clawed together so much wealthpoked itself out of the coachwindow and dropt some copper coins upon the ground so that though the great mans name seems to have been gathergold he might just as suitably have been nicknamed scattercopper still nevertheless with an earnest shout and evidently with as much good faith as ever the people bellowed  he is the very image of the great stone face  but ernest turned sadly from the wrinkled shrewdness of that sordid visage and gazed up the valley where amid a gathering mist gilded by the last sunbeams he could still distinguish those glorious features which had impressed themselves into his soul their aspect cheered him what did the benign lips seem to say  he will come fear not ernest the man will come  the years went on and ernest ceased to be a boy he had grown to be a young man now he attracted little notice from the other inhabitants of the valley for they saw nothing remarkable in his way of life save that when the labor of the day was over he still loved to go apart and gaze and meditate upon the great stone face according to their idea of the matter it was a folly indeed but pardonable inasmuch as ernest was industrious kind and neighborly and neglected no duty for the sake of indulging this idle habit they knew not that the great stone face had become a teacher to him and that the sentiment which was expressed in it would enlarge the young mans heart and fill it with wider and deeper sympathies than other hearts they knew not that thence would come a better wisdom than could be learned from books and a better life than could be moulded on the defaced example of other human lives neither did ernest know that the thoughts and affections which came to him so naturally in the fields and at the fireside and wherever he communed with himself were of a higher tone than those which all men shared with him a simple soulsimple as when his mother first taught him the old prophecyhe beheld the marvellous features beaming adown the valley and still wondered that their human counterpart was so long in making his appearance  by this time poor mr gathergold was dead and buried and the oddest part of the matter was that his wealth which was the body and spirit of his existence had disappeared before his death leaving nothing of him but a living skeleton covered over with a wrinkled yellow skin since the melting away of his gold it had been very generally conceded that there was no such striking resemblance after all betwixt the ignoble features of the ruined merchant and that majestic face upon the mountainside so the people ceased to honor him during his lifetime and quietly consigned him to forgetfulness after his decease once in a while it is true his memory was brought up in connection with the magnificent palace which he had built and which had long ago been turned into a hotel for the accommodation of strangers multitudes of whom came every summer to visit that famous natural curiosity the great stone face thus mr gathergold being discredited and thrown into the shade the man of prophecy was yet to come  it so happened that a nativeborn son of the valley many years before had enlisted as a soldier and after a great deal of hard fighting had now become an illustrious commander whatever he may be called in history he was known in camps and on the battlefield under the nickname of old bloodandthunder this warworn veteran being now infirm with age and wounds and weary of the turmoil of a military life and of the roll of the drum and the clangor of the trumpet that had so long been ringing in his ears had lately signified a purpose of returning to his native valley hoping to find repose where he remembered to have left it the inhabitants his old neighbors and their grownup children were resolved to welcome the renowned warrior with a salute of cannon and a public dinner and all the more enthusiastically it being affirmed that now at last the likeness of the great stone face had actually appeared an aiddecamp of old bloodandthunder travelling through the valley was said to have been struck with the resemblance moreover the schoolmates and early acquaintances of the general were ready to testify on oath that to the best of their recollection the aforesaid general had been exceedingly like the majestic image even when a boy only that the idea had never occurred to them at that period great therefore was the excitement throughout the valley and many people who had never once thought of glancing at the great stone face for years before now spent their time in gazing at it for the sake of knowing exactly how general bloodandthunder looked  on the day of the great festival ernest with all the other people of the valley left their work and proceeded to the spot where the sylvan banquet was prepared as he approached the loud voice of the rev dr battleblast was heard beseeching a blessing on the good things set before them and on the distinguished friend of peace in whose honor they were assembled the tables were arranged in a cleared space of the woods shut in by the surrounding trees except where a vista opened eastward and afforded a distant view of the great stone face over the generals chair which was a relic from the home of washington there was an arch of verdant boughs with the laurel profusely intermixed and surmounted by his countrys banner beneath which he had won his victories our friend ernest raised himself on his tiptoes in hopes to get a glimpse of the celebrated guest but there was a mighty crowd about the tables anxious to hear the toasts and speeches and to catch any word that might fall from the general in reply and a volunteer company doing duty as a guard pricked ruthlessly with their bayonets at any particularly quiet person among the throng so ernest being of an unobtrusive character was thrust quite into the background where he could see no more of old bloodandthunders physiognomy than if it had been still blazing on the battlefield to console himself he turned towards the great stone face which like a faithful and longremembered friend looked back and smiled upon him through the vista of the forest meantime however he could overhear the remarks of various individuals who were comparing the features of the hero with the face on the distant mountainside  tis the same face to a hair cried one man cutting a caper for joy  wonderfully like thats a fact responded another  like why i call it old bloodandthunder himself in a monstrous lookingglass cried a third and why not hes the greatest man of this or any other age beyond a doubt  and then all three of the speakers gave a great shout which communicated electricity to the crowd and called forth a roar from a thousand voices that went reverberating for miles among the mountains until you might have supposed that the great stone face had poured its thunderbreath into the cry all these comments and this vast enthusiasm served the more to interest our friend nor did he think of questioning that now at length the mountainvisage had found its human counterpart it is true ernest had imagined that this longlookedfor personage would appear in the character of a man of peace uttering wisdom and doing good and making people happy but taking an habitual breadth of view with all his simplicity he contended that providence should choose its own method of blessing mankind and could conceive that this great end might be effected even by a warrior and a bloody sword should inscrutable wisdom see fit to order matters so  the general the general was now the cry hush silence old bloodandthunders going to make a speech  even so for the cloth being removed the generals health had been drunk amid shouts of applause and he now stood upon his feet to thank the company ernest saw him there he was over the shoulders of the crowd from the two glittering epaulets and embroidered collar upward beneath the arch of green boughs with intertwined laurel and the banner drooping as if to shade his brow and there too visible in the same glance through the vista of the forest appeared the great stone face and was there indeed such a resemblance as the crowd had testified alas ernest could not recognize it he beheld a warworn and weatherbeaten countenance full of energy and expressive of an iron will but the gentle wisdom the deep broad tender sympathies were altogether wanting in old bloodandthunders visage and even if the great stone face had assumed his look of stern command the milder traits would still have tempered it  this is not the man of prophecy sighed ernest to himself as he made his way out of the throng and must the world wait longer yet  the mists had congregated about the distant mountainside and there were seen the grand and awful features of the great stone face awful but benignant as if a mighty angel were sitting among the hills and enrobing himself in a cloudvesture of gold and purple as he looked ernest could hardly believe but that a smile beamed over the whole visage with a radiance still brightening although without motion of the lips it was probably the effect of the western sunshine melting through the thinly diffused vapors that had swept between him and the object that he gazed at butas it always didthe aspect of his marvellous friend made ernest as hopeful as if he had never hoped in vain  fear not ernest said his heart even as if the great face were whispering himfear not ernest he will come  more years sped swiftly and tranquilly away ernest still dwelt in his native valley and was now a man of middle age by imperceptible degrees he had become known among the people now as heretofore he labored for his bread and was the same simplehearted man that he had always been but he had thought and felt so much he had given so many of the best hours of his life to unworldly hopes for some great good to mankind that it seemed as though he had been talking with the angels and had imbibed a portion of their wisdom unawares it was visible in the calm and wellconsidered beneficence of his daily life the quiet stream of which had made a wide green margin all along its course not a day passed by that the world was not the better because this man humble as he was had lived he never stepped aside from his own path yet would always reach a blessing to his neighbor almost involuntarily too he had become a preacher the pure and high simplicity of his thought which as one of its manifestations took shape in the good deeds that dropped silently from his hand flowed also forth in speech he uttered truths that wrought upon and moulded the lives of those who heard him his auditors it may be never suspected that ernest their own neighbor and familiar friend was more than an ordinary man least of all did ernest himself suspect it but inevitably as the murmur of a rivulet came thoughts out of his mouth that no other human lips had spoken  when the peoples minds had had a little time to cool they were ready enough to acknowledge their mistake in imagining a similarity between general bloodandthunders truculent physiognomy and the benign visage on the mountainside but now again there were reports and many paragraphs in the newspapers affirming that the likeness of the great stone face had appeared upon the broad shoulders of a certain eminent statesman he like mr gathergold and old bloodandthunder was a native of the valley but had left it in his early days and taken up the trades of law and politics instead of the rich mans wealth and the warriors sword he had but a tongue and it was mightier than both together so wonderfully eloquent was he that whatever he might choose to say his auditors had no choice but to believe him wrong looked like right and right like wrong for when it pleased him he could make a kind of illuminated fog with his mere breath and obscure the natural daylight with it his tongue indeed was a magic instrument sometimes it rumbled like the thunder sometimes it warbled like the sweetest music it was the blast of warthe song of peace and it seemed to have a heart in it when there was no such matter in good truth he was a wondrous man and when his tongue had acquired him all other imaginable successwhen it had been heard in halls of state and in the courts of princes and potentatesafter it had made him known all over the world even as a voice crying from shore to shoreit finally persuaded his countrymen to select him for the presidency before this timeindeed as soon as he began to grow celebratedhis admirers had found out the resemblance between him and the great stone face and so much were they struck by it that throughout the country this distinguished gentleman was known by the name of old stony phiz the phrase was considered as giving a highly favorable aspect to his political prospects for as is likewise the case with the popedom nobody ever becomes president without taking a name other than his own  while his friends were doing their best to make him president old stony phiz as he was called set out on a visit to the valley where he was born of course he had no other object than to shake hands with his fellowcitizens and neither thought nor cared about any effect which his progress through the country might have upon the election magnificent preparations were made to receive the illustrious statesman a cavalcade of horsemen set forth to meet him at the boundary line of the state and all the people left their business and gathered along the wayside to see him pass among these was ernest though more than once disappointed as we have seen he had such a hopeful and confiding nature that he was always ready to believe in whatever seemed beautiful and good he kept his heart continually open and thus was sure to catch the blessing from on high when it should come so now again as buoyantly as ever he went forth to behold the likeness of the great stone face  the cavalcade came prancing along the road with a great clattering of hoofs and a mighty cloud of dust which rose up so dense and high that the visage of the mountainside was completely hidden from ernests eyes all the great men of the neighborhood were there on horseback militia officers in uniform the member of congress the sheriff of the county the editors of newspapers and many a farmer too had mounted his patient steed with his sunday coat upon his back it really was a very brilliant spectacle especially as there were numerous banners flaunting over the cavalcade on some of which were gorgeous portraits of the illustrious statesman and the great stone face smiling familiarly at one another like two brothers if the pictures were to be trusted the mutual resemblance it must be confessed was marvellous we must not forget to mention that there was a band of music which made the echoes of the mountains ring and reverberate with the loud triumph of its strains so that airy and soulthrilling melodies broke out among all the heights and hollows as if every nook of his native valley had found a voice to welcome the distinguished guest but the grandest effect was when the faroff mountain precipice flung back the music for then the great stone face itself seemed to be swelling the triumphant chorus in acknowledgment that at length the man of prophecy was come  all this while the people were throwing up their hats and shouting with enthusiasm so contagious that the heart of ernest kindled up and he likewise threw up his hat and shouted as loudly as the loudest huzza for the great man huzza for old stony phiz but as yet he had not seen him  here he is now cried those who stood near ernest there there look at old stony phiz and then at the old man of the mountain and see if they are not as like as two twinbrothers  in the midst of all this gallant array came an open barouche drawn by four white horses and in the barouche with his massive head uncovered sat the illustrious statesman old stony phiz himself  confess it said one of ernests neighbors to him the great stone face has met its match at last  now it must be owned that at his first glimpse of the countenance which was bowing and smiling from the barouche ernest did fancy that there was a resemblance between it and the old familiar face upon the mountainside the brow with its massive depth and loftiness and all the other features indeed were boldly and strongly hewn as if in emulation of a more than heroic of a titanic model but the sublimity and stateliness the grand expression of a divine sympathy that illuminated the mountain visage and etherealized its ponderous granite substance into spirit might here be sought in vain something had been originally left out or had departed and therefore the marvellously gifted statesman had always a weary gloom in the deep caverns of his eyes as of a child that has outgrown its playthings or a man of mighty faculties and little aims whose life with all its high performances was vague and empty because no high purpose had endowed it with reality  still ernests neighbor was thrusting his elbow into his side and pressing him for an answer  confess confess is not he the very picture of your old man of the mountain  no said ernest bluntly i see little or no likeness  then so much the worse for the great stone face answered his neighbor and again he set up a shout for old stony phiz  but ernest turned away melancholy and almost despondent for this was the saddest of his disappointments to behold a man who might have fulfilled the prophecy and had not willed to do so meantime the cavalcade the banners the music and the barouches swept past him with the vociferous crowd in the rear leaving the dust to settle down and the great stone face to be revealed again with the grandeur that it had worn for untold centuries  lo here i am ernest the benign lips seemed to say i have waited longer than thou and am not yet weary fear not the man will come  the years hurried onward treading in their haste on one anothers heels and now they began to bring white hairs and scatter them over the head of ernest they made reverend wrinkles across his forehead and furrows in his cheeks he was an aged man but not in vain had he grown old more than the white hairs on his head were the sage thoughts in his mind his wrinkles and furrows were inscriptions that time had graved and in which he had written legends of wisdom that had been tested by the tenor of a life and ernest had ceased to be obscure unsought for undesired had come the fame which so many seek and made him known in the great world beyond the limits of the valley in which he had dwelt so quietly college professors and even the active men of cities came from far to see and converse with ernest for the report had gone abroad that this simple husbandman had ideas unlike those of other men not gained from books but of a higher tonea tranquil and familiar majesty as if he had been talking with the angels as his daily friends whether it were sage statesman or philanthropist ernest received these visitors with the gentle sincerity that had characterized him from boyhood and spoke freely with them of whatever came uppermost or lay deepest in his heart or their own while they talked together his face would kindle unawares and shine upon them as with a mild evening light pensive with the fulness of such discourse his guests took leave and went their way and passing up the valley paused to look at the great stone face imagining that they had seen its likeness in a human countenance but could not remember where  while ernest had been growing up and growing old a bountiful providence had granted a new poet to this earth he likewise was a native of the valley but had spent the greater part of his life at a distance from that romantic region pouring out his sweet music amid the bustle and din of cities often however did the mountains which had been familiar to him in his childhood lift their snowy peaks into the clear atmosphere of his poetry neither was the great stone face forgotten for the poet had celebrated it in an ode which was grand enough to have been uttered by its own majestic lips this man of genius we may say had come down from heaven with wonderful endowments if he sang of a mountain the eyes of all mankind beheld a mightier grandeur reposing on its breast or soaring to its summit than had before been seen there if his theme were a lovely lake a celestial smile had now been thrown over it to gleam forever on its surface if it were the vast old sea even the deep immensity of its dread bosom seemed to swell the higher as if moved by the emotions of the song thus the world assumed another and a better aspect from the hour that the poet blessed it with his happy eyes the creator had bestowed him as the last best touch to his own handiwork creation was not finished till the poet came to interpret and so complete it  the effect was no less high and beautiful when his human brethren were the subject of his verse the man or woman sordid with the common dust of life who crossed his daily path and the little child who played in it were glorified if he beheld them in his mood of poetic faith he showed the golden links of the great chain that intertwined them with an angelic kindred he brought out the hidden traits of a celestial birth that made them worthy of such kin some indeed there were who thought to show the soundness of their judgment by affirming that all the beauty and dignity of the natural world existed only in the poets fancy let such men speak for themselves who undoubtedly appear to have been spawned forth by nature with a contemptuous bitterness she having plastered them up out of her refuse stuff after all the swine were made as respects all things else the poets ideal was the truest truth  the songs of this poet found their way to ernest he read them after his customary toil seated on the bench before his cottagedoor where for such a length of time he had filled his repose with thought by gazing at the great stone face and now as he read stanzas that caused the soul to thrill within him he lifted his eyes to the vast countenance beaming on him so benignantly  o majestic friend he murmured addressing the great stone face is not this man worthy to resemble thee  the face seemed to smile but answered not a word  now it happened that the poet though he dwelt so far away had not only heard of ernest but had meditated much upon his character until he deemed nothing so desirable as to meet this man whose untaught wisdom walked hand in hand with the noble simplicity of his life one summer morning therefore he took passage by the railroad and in the decline of the afternoon alighted from the cars at no great distance from ernests cottage the great hotel which had formerly been the palace of mr gathergold was close at hand but the poet with his carpetbag on his arm inquired at once where ernest dwelt and was resolved to be accepted as his guest  approaching the door he there found the good old man holding a volume in his hand which alternately he read and then with a finger between the leaves looked lovingly at the great stone face  good evening said the poet can you give a traveller a nights lodging  willingly answered ernest and then he added smiling methinks i never saw the great stone face look so hospitably at a stranger  the poet sat down on the bench beside him and he and ernest talked together often had the poet held intercourse with the wittiest and the wisest but never before with a man like ernest whose thoughts and feelings gushed up with such a natural freedom and who made great truths so familiar by his simple utterance of them angels as had been so often said seemed to have wrought with him at his labor in the fields angels seemed to have sat with him by the fireside and dwelling with angels as friend with friends he had imbibed the sublimity of their ideas and imbued it with the sweet and lowly charm of household words so thought the poet and ernest on the other hand was moved and agitated by the living images which the poet flung out of his mind and which peopled all the air about the cottagedoor with shapes of beauty both gay and pensive the sympathies of these two men instructed them with a profounder sense than either could have attained alone their minds accorded into one strain and made delightful music which neither of them could have claimed as all his own nor distinguished his own share from the others they led one another as it were into a high pavilion of their thoughts so remote and hitherto so dim that they had never entered it before and so beautiful that they desired to be there always  as ernest listened to the poet he imagined that the great stone face was bending forward to listen too he gazed earnestly into the poets glowing eyes  who are you my strangely gifted guest he said  the poet laid his finger on the volume that ernest had been reading  you have read these poems said he you know me thenfor i wrote them  again and still more earnestly than before ernest examined the poets features then turned towards the great stone face then back with an uncertain aspect to his guest but his countenance fell he shook his head and sighed  wherefore are you sad inquired the poet  because replied ernest all through life i have awaited the fulfilment of a prophecy and when i read these poems i hoped that it might be fulfilled in you  you hoped answered the poet faintly smiling to find in me the likeness of the great stone face and you are disappointed as formerly with mr gathergold and old bloodandthunder and old stony phiz yes ernest it is my doom you must add my name to the illustrious three and record another failure of your hopes forin shame and sadness do i speak it ernesti am not worthy to be typified by yonder benign and majestic image  and why asked ernest he pointed to the volume are not those thoughts divine  they have a strain of the divinity replied the poet you can hear in them the faroff echo of a heavenly song but my life dear ernest has not corresponded with my thought i have had grand dreams but they have been only dreams because i have livedand that too by my own choiceamong poor and mean realities sometimes evenshall i dare to say iti lack faith in the grandeur the beauty and the goodness which my own works are said to have made more evident in nature and in human life why then pure seeker of the good and true shouldst thou hope to find me in yonder image of the divine  the poet spoke sadly and his eyes were dim with tears so likewise were those of ernest  at the hour of sunset as had long been his frequent custom ernest was to discourse to an assemblage of the neighboring inhabitants in the open air he and the poet arm in arm still talking together as they went along proceeded to the spot it was a small nook among the hills with a gray precipice behind the stern front of which was relieved by the pleasant foliage of many creeping plants that made a tapestry for the naked rock by hanging their festoons from all its rugged angles at a small elevation above the ground set in a rich framework of verdure there appeared a niche spacious enough to admit a human figure with freedom for such gestures as spontaneously accompany earnest thought and genuine emotion into this natural pulpit ernest ascended and threw a look of familiar kindness around upon his audience they stood or sat or reclined upon the grass as seemed good to each with the departing sunshine falling obliquely over them and mingling its subdued cheerfulness with the solemnity of a grove of ancient trees beneath and amid the boughs of which the golden rays were constrained to pass in another direction was seen the great stone face with the same cheer combined with the same solemnity in its benignant aspect  ernest began to speak giving to the people of what was in his heart and mind his words had power because they accorded with his thoughts and his thoughts had reality and depth because they harmonized with the life which he had always lived it was not mere breath that this preacher uttered they were the words of life because a life of good deeds and holy love was melted into them pearls pure and rich had been dissolved into this precious draught the poet as he listened felt that the being and character of ernest were a nobler strain of poetry than he had ever written his eyes glistened with tears he gazed reverentially at the venerable man and said within himself that never was there an aspect so worthy of a prophet and a sage as that mild sweet thoughtful countenance with the glory of white hair diffused about it at a distance but distinctly to be seen high up in the golden light of the setting sun appeared the great stone face with hoary mists around it like the white hairs around the brow of ernest its look of grand beneficence seemed to embrace the world  at that moment in sympathy with a thought which he was about to utter the face of ernest assumed a grandeur of expression so imbued with benevolence that the poet by an irresistible impulse threw his arms aloft and shouted  behold behold ernest is himself the likeness of the great stone face  then all the people looked and saw that what the deepsighted poet said was true the prophecy was fulfilled but ernest having finished what he had to say took the poets arm and walked slowly homeward still hoping that some wiser and better man than himself would by and by appear bearing a resemblance to the great stone face     the gray champion   there was once a time when new england groaned under the actual pressure of heavier wrongs than those threatened ones which brought on the revolution james ii the bigoted successor of charles the voluptuous had annulled the charters of all the colonies and sent a harsh and unprincipled soldier to take away our liberties and endanger our religion the administration of sir edmund andros lacked scarcely a single characteristic of tyranny a governor and council holding office from the king and wholly independent of the country laws made and taxes levied without concurrence of the people immediate or by their representatives the rights of private citizens violated and the titles of all landed property declared void the voice of complaint stifled by restrictions on the press and finally disaffection overawed by the first band of mercenary troops that ever marched on our free soil for two years our ancestors were kept in sullen submission by that filial love which had invariably secured their allegiance to the mother country whether its head chanced to be a parliament protector or popish monarch till these evil times however such allegiance had been merely nominal and the colonists had ruled themselves enjoying far more freedom than is even yet the privilege of the native subjects of great britain  at length a rumor reached our shores that the prince of orange had ventured on an enterprise the success of which would be the triumph of civil and religious rights and the salvation of new england it was but a doubtful whisper it might be false or the attempt might fail and in either case the man that stirred against king james would lose his head still the intelligence produced a marked effect the people smiled mysteriously in the streets and threw bold glances at their oppressors while far and wide there was a subdued and silent agitation as if the slightest signal would rouse the whole land from its sluggish despondency aware of their danger the rulers resolved to avert it by an imposing display of strength and perhaps to confirm their despotism by yet harsher measures one afternoon in april 1689 sir edmund andros and his favorite councillors being warm with wine assembled the redcoats of the governors guard and made their appearance in the streets of boston the sun was near setting when the march commenced  the roll of the drum at that unquiet crisis seemed to go through the streets less as the martial music of the soldiers than as a mustercall to the inhabitants themselves a multitude by various avenues assembled in king street which was destined to be the scene nearly a century afterwards of another encounter between the troops of britain and a people struggling against her tyranny though more than sixty years had elapsed since the pilgrims came this crowd of their descendants still showed the strong and sombre features of their character perhaps more strikingly in such a stern emergency than on happier occasions there were the sober garb the general severity of mien the gloomy but undismayed expression the scriptural forms of speech and the confidence in heavens blessing on a righteous cause which would have marked a band of the original puritans when threatened by some peril of the wilderness indeed it was not yet time for the old spirit to be extinct since there were men in the street that day who had worshipped there beneath the trees before a house was reared to the god for whom they had become exiles old soldiers of the parliament were here too smiling grimly at the thought that their aged arms might strike another blow against the house of stuart here also were the veterans of king philips war who had burned villages and slaughtered young and old with pious fierceness while the godly souls throughout the land were helping them with prayer several ministers were scattered among the crowd which unlike all other mobs regarded them with such reverence as if there were sanctity in their very garments these holy men exerted their influence to quiet the people but not to disperse them meantime the purpose of the governor in disturbing the peace of the town at a period when the slightest commotion might throw the country into a ferment was almost the universal subject of inquiry and variously explained  satan will strike his masterstroke presently cried some because he knoweth that his time is short all our godly pastors are to be dragged to prison we shall see them at a smithfield fire in king street  hereupon the people of each parish gathered closer round their minister who looked calmly upwards and assumed a more apostolic dignity as well befitted a candidate for the highest honor of his profession the crown of martyrdom it was actually fancied at that period that new england might have a john rogers of her own to take the place of that worthy in the primer  the pope of rome has given orders for a new st bartholomew cried others we are to be massacred man and male child  neither was this rumor wholly discredited although the wiser class believed the governors object somewhat less atrocious his predecessor under the old charter bradstreet a venerable companion of the first settlers was known to be in town there were grounds for conjecturing that sir edmund andros intended at once to strike terror by a parade of military force and to confound the opposite faction by possessing himself of their chief  stand firm for the old charter governor shouted the crowd seizing upon the idea the good old governor bradstreet  while this cry was at the loudest the people were surprised by the wellknown figure of governor bradstreet himself a patriarch of nearly ninety who appeared on the elevated steps of a door and with characteristic mildness besought them to submit to the constituted authorities  my children concluded this venerable person do nothing rashly cry not aloud but pray for the welfare of new england and expect patiently what the lord will do in this matter  the event was soon to be decided all this time the roll of the drum had been approaching through cornhill louder and deeper till with reverberations from house to house and the regular tramp of martial footsteps it burst into the street a double rank of soldiers made their appearance occupying the whole breadth of the passage with shouldered matchlocks and matches burning so as to present a row of fires in the dusk their steady march was like the progress of a machine that would roll irresistibly over everything in its way next moving slowly with a confused clatter of hoofs on the pavement rode a party of mounted gentlemen the central figure being sir edmund andros elderly but erect and soldierlike those around him were his favorite councillors and the bitterest foes of new england at his right hand rode edward randolph our archenemy that blasted wretch as cotton mather calls him who achieved the downfall of our ancient government and was followed with a sensible curse through life and to his grave on the other side was bullivant scattering jests and mockery as he rode along dudley came behind with a downcast look dreading as well he might to meet the indignant gaze of the people who beheld him their only countryman by birth among the oppressors of his native land the captain of a frigate in the harbor and two or three civil officers under the crown were also there but the figure which most attracted the public eye and stirred up the deepest feeling was the episcopal clergyman of kings chapel riding haughtily among the magistrates in his priestly vestments the fitting representative of prelacy and persecution the union of church and state and all those abominations which had driven the puritans to the wilderness another guard of soldiers in double rank brought up the rear  the whole scene was a picture of the condition of new england and its moral the deformity of any government that does not grow out of the nature of things and the character of the people on one side the religious multitude with their sad visages and dark attire and on the other the group of despotic rulers with the highchurchman in the midst and here and there a crucifix at their bosoms all magnificently clad flushed with wine proud of unjust authority and scoffing at the universal groan and the mercenary soldiers waiting but the word to deluge the street with blood showed the only means by which obedience could be secured  o lord of hosts cried a voice among the crowd provide a champion for thy people  this ejaculation was loudly uttered and served as a heralds cry to introduce a remarkable personage the crowd had rolled back and were now huddled together nearly at the extremity of the street while the soldiers had advanced no more than a third of its length the intervening space was emptya paved solitude between lofty edifices which threw almost a twilight shadow over it suddenly there was seen the figure of an ancient man who seemed to have emerged from among the people and was walking by himself along the centre of the street to confront the armed band he wore the old puritan dress a dark cloak and a steeplecrowned hat in the fashion of at least fifty years before with a heavy sword upon his thigh but a staff in his hand to assist the tremulous gait of age  when at some distance from the multitude the old man turned slowly round displaying a face of antique majesty rendered doubly venerable by the hoary beard that descended on his breast he made a gesture at once of encouragement and warning then turned again and resumed his way  who is this gray patriarch asked the young men of their sires  who is this venerable brother asked the old men among themselves  but none could make reply the fathers of the people those of fourscore years and upwards were disturbed deeming it strange that they should forget one of such evident authority whom they must have known in their early days the associate of winthrop and all the old councillors giving laws and making prayers and leading them against the savage the elderly men ought to have remembered him too with locks as gray in their youth as their own were now and the young how could he have passed so utterly from their memoriesthat hoary sire the relic of longdeparted times whose awful benediction had surely been bestowed on their uncovered heads in childhood  whence did he come what is his purpose who can this old man be whispered the wondering crowd  meanwhile the venerable stranger staff in hand was pursuing his solitary walk along the centre of the street as he drew near the advancing soldiers and as the roll of their drum came full upon his ear the old man raised himself to a loftier mien while the decrepitude of age seemed to fall from his shoulders leaving him in gray but unbroken dignity now he marched onward with a warriors step keeping time to the military music thus the aged form advanced on one side and the whole parade of soldiers and magistrates on the other till when scarcely twenty yards remained between the old man grasped his staff by the middle and held it before him like a leaders truncheon  stand cried he  the eye the face and attitude of command the solemn yet warlike peal of that voice fit either to rule a host in the battlefield or be raised to god in prayer were irresistible at the old mans word and outstretched arm the roll of the drum was hushed at once and the advancing line stood still a tremulous enthusiasm seized upon the multitude that stately form combining the leader and the saint so gray so dimly seen in such an ancient garb could only belong to some old champion of the righteous cause whom the oppressors drum had summoned from his grave they raised a shout of awe and exultation and looked for the deliverance of new england  the governor and the gentlemen of his party perceiving themselves brought to an unexpected stand rode hastily forward as if they would have pressed their snorting and affrighted horses right against the hoary apparition he however blenched not a step but glancing his severe eye round the group which half encompassed him at last bent it sternly on sir edmund andros one would have thought that the dark old man was chief ruler there and that the governor and council with soldiers at their back representing the whole power and authority of the crown had no alternative but obedience  what does this old fellow here cried edward randolph fiercely on sir edmund bid the soldiers forward and give the dotard the same choice that you give all his countrymento stand aside or be trampled on  nay nay let us show respect to the good grandsire said bullivant laughing see you not he is some old roundheaded dignitary who hath lain asleep these thirty years and knows nothing of the change of times doubtless he thinks to put us down with a proclamation in old nolls name  are you mad old man demanded sir edmund andros in loud and harsh tones how dare you stay the march of king jamess governor  i have stayed the march of a king himself ere now replied the gray figure with stern composure i am here sir governor because the cry of an oppressed people hath disturbed me in my secret place and beseeching this favor earnestly of the lord it was vouchsafed me to appear once again on earth in the good old cause of his saints and what speak ye of james there is no longer a popish tyrant on the throne of england and by tomorrow noon his name shall be a byword in this very street where ye would make it a word of terror back thou that wast a governor back with this night thy power is endedtomorrow the prisonback lest i foretell the scaffold  the people had been drawing nearer and nearer and drinking in the words of their champion who spoke in accents long disused like one unaccustomed to converse except with the dead of many years ago but his voice stirred their souls they confronted the soldiers not wholly without arms and ready to convert the very stones of the street into deadly weapons sir edmund andros looked at the old man then he cast his hard and cruel eye over the multitude and beheld them burning with that lurid wrath so difficult to kindle or to quench and again he fixed his gaze on the aged form which stood obscurely in an open space where neither friend nor foe had thrust himself what were his thoughts he uttered no word which might discover but whether the oppressor were overawed by the gray champions look or perceived his peril in the threatening attitude of the people it is certain that he gave back and ordered his soldiers to commence a slow and guarded retreat before another sunset the governor and all that rode so proudly with him were prisoners and long ere it was known that james had abdicated king william was proclaimed throughout new england  but where was the gray champion some reported that when the troops had gone from king street and the people were thronging tumultuously in their rear bradstreet the aged governor was seen to embrace a form more aged than his own others soberly affirmed that while they marvelled at the venerable grandeur of his aspect the old man had faded from their eyes melting slowly into the hues of twilight till where he stood there was an empty space but all agreed that the hoary shape was gone the men of that generation watched for his reappearance in sunshine and in twilight but never saw him more nor knew when his funeral passed nor where his gravestone was  and who was the gray champion perhaps his name might be found in the records of that stern court of justice which passed a sentence too mighty for the age but glorious in all after times for its humbling lesson to the monarch and its high example to the subject i have heard that whenever the descendants of the puritans are to show the spirit of their sires the old man appears again when eighty years had passed he walked once more in king street five years later in the twilight of an april morning he stood on the green beside the meetinghouse at lexington where now the obelisk of granite with a slab of slate inlaid commemorates the first fallen of the revolution and when our fathers were toiling at the breastwork on bunkers hill all through that night the old warrior walked his rounds long long may it be ere he comes again his hour is one of darkness and adversity and peril but should domestic tyranny oppress us or the invaders step pollute our soil still may the gray champion come for he is the type of new englands hereditary spirit and his shadowy march on the eve of danger must ever be the pledge that new englands sons will vindicate their ancestry
