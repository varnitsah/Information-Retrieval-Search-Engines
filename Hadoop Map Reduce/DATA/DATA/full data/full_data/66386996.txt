66386996	note on the resemblances and differences in the structure   and the development of the brain in man and apes   by  professor t h huxley frs   this essay is taken from the descent of man and selection in relation to sex by charles darwin where it appears at the end of chapter vii which is also the end of part i  footnotes are numbered as they appear in the descent of man    the controversy respecting the nature and the extent of the differences in the structure of the brain in man and the apes which arose some fifteen years ago has not yet come to an end though the subject matter of the dispute is at present totally different from what it was formerly  it was originally asserted and reasserted with singular pertinacity that the brain of all the apes even the highest differs from that of man in the absence of such conspicuous structures as the posterior lobes of the cerebral hemispheres with the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle and the hippocampus minor contained in those lobes which are so obvious in man  but the truth that the three structures in question are as well developed in apes as in human brains or even better and that it is characteristic of all the primates if we exclude the lemurs to have these parts well developed stands at present on as secure a basis as any proposition in comparative anatomy moreover it is admitted by every one of the long series of anatomists who of late years have paid special attention to the arrangement of the complicated sulci and gyri which appear upon the surface of the cerebral hemispheres in man and the higher apes that they are disposed after the very same pattern in him as in them  every principal gyrus and sulcus of a chimpanzees brain is clearly represented in that of a man so that the terminology which applies to the one answers for the other  on this point there is no difference of opinion  some years since professor bischoff published a memoir 70  die grosshirnwindungen des menschen abhandlungen der k bayerischen akademie b x 1868 on the cerebral convolutions of man and apes and as the purpose of my learned colleague was certainly not to diminish the value of the differences between apes and men in this respect i am glad to make a citation from him  that the apes and especially the orang chimpanzee and gorilla come very close to man in their organisation much nearer than to any other animal is a well known fact disputed by nobody looking at the matter from the point of view of organisation alone no one probably would ever have disputed the view of linnaeus that man should be placed merely as a peculiar species at the head of the mammalia and of those apes  both shew in all their organs so close an affinity that the most exact anatomical investigation is needed in order to demonstrate those differences which really exist  so it is with the brains the brains of man the orang the chimpanzee the gorilla in spite of all the important differences which they present come very close to one another loc cit p 101  there remains then no dispute as to the resemblance in fundamental characters between the apes brain and mans  nor any as to the wonderfully close similarity between the chimpanzee orang and man in even the details of the arrangement of the gyri and sulci of the cerebral hemispheres  nor turning to the differences between the brains of the highest apes and that of man is there any serious question as to the nature and extent of these differences  it is admitted that the mans cerebral hemispheres are absolutely and relatively larger than those of the orang and chimpanzee that his frontal lobes are less excavated by the upward protrusion of the roof of the orbits that his gyri and sulci are as a rule less symmetrically disposed and present a greater number of secondary plications  and it is admitted that as a rule in man the temporooccipital or external perpendicular fissure which is usually so strongly marked a feature of the apes brain is but faintly marked but it is also clear that none of these differences constitutes a sharp demarcation between the mans and the apes brain  in respect to the external perpendicular fissure of gratiolet in the human brain for instance professor turner remarks  71  convolutions of the human cerebrum topographically considered 1866 p 12  in some brains it appears simply as an indentation of the margin of the hemisphere but in others it extends for some distance more or less transversely outwards  i saw it in the right hemisphere of a female brain pass more than two inches outwards and on another specimen also the right hemisphere it proceeded for fourtenths of an inch outwards and then extended downwards as far as the lower margin of the outer surface of the hemisphere  the imperfect definition of this fissure in the majority of human brains as compared with its remarkable distinctness in the brain of most quadrumana is owing to the presence in the former of certain superficial well marked secondary convolutions which bridge it over and connect the parietal with the occipital lobe  the closer the first of these bridging gyri lies to the longitudinal fissure the shorter is the external parietooccipital fissure loc cit p 12  the obliteration of the external perpendicular fissure of gratiolet therefore is not a constant character of the human brain  on the other hand its full development is not a constant character of the higher apes brain  for in the chimpanzee the more or less extensive obliteration of the external perpendicular sulcus by bridging convolutions on one side or the other has been noted over and over again by prof rolleston mr marshall m broca and professor turner at the conclusion of a special paper on this subject the latter writes 72  notes more especially on the bridging convolutions in the brain of the chimpanzee proceedings of the royal society of edinburgh 18656  the three specimens of the brain of a chimpanzee just described prove that the generalisation which gratiolet has attempted to draw of the complete absence of the first connecting convolution and the concealment of the second as essentially characteristic features in the brain of this animal is by no means universally applicable  in only one specimen did the brain in these particulars follow the law which gratiolet has expressed  as regards the presence of the superior bridging convolution i am inclined to think that it has existed in one hemisphere at least in a majority of the brains of this animal which have up to this time been figured or described  the superficial position of the second bridging convolution is evidently less frequent and has as yet i believe only been seen in the brain a recorded in this communication  the asymmetrical arrangement in the convolutions of the two hemispheres which previous observers have referred to in their descriptions is also well illustrated in these specimens pp 8 9  even were the presence of the temporooccipital or external perpendicular sulcus a mark of distinction between the higher apes and man the value of such a distinctive character would be rendered very doubtful by the structure of the brain in the platyrrhine apes in fact while the temporooccipital is one of the most constant of sulci in the catarrhine or old world apes it is never very strongly developed in the new world apes it is absent in the smaller platyrrhini rudimentary in pithecia 73 flower on the anatomy of pithecia monachus proceedings of the zoological society 1862 and more or less obliterated by bridging convolutions in ateles  a character which is thus variable within the limits of a single group can have no great taxonomic value  it is further established that the degree of asymmetry of the convolution of the two sides in the human brain is subject to much individual variation and that in those individuals of the bushman race who have been examined the gyri and sulci of the two hemispheres are considerably less complicated and more symmetrical than in the european brain while in some individuals of the chimpanzee their complexity and asymmetry become notable  this is particularly the case in the brain of a young male chimpanzee figured by m broca  lordre des primates p 165 fig 11  again as respects the question of absolute size it is established that the difference between the largest and the smallest healthy human brain is greater than the difference between the smallest healthy human brain and the largest chimpanzees or orangs brain  moreover there is one circumstance in which the orangs and chimpanzees brains resemble mans but in which they differ from the lower apes and that is the presence of two corpora candicantiathe cynomorpha having but one  in view of these facts i do not hesitate in this year 1874 to repeat and insist upon the proposition which i enunciated in 1863  74 mans place in nature p 102  so far as cerebral structure goes therefore it is clear that man differs less from the chimpanzee or the orang than these do even from the monkeys and that the difference between the brain of the chimpanzee and of man is almost insignificant when compared with that between the chimpanzee brain and that of a lemur  in the paper to which i have referred professor bischoff does not deny the second part of this statement but he first makes the irrelevant remark that it is not wonderful if the brains of an orang and a lemur are very different and secondly goes on to assert that if we successively compare the brain of a man with that of an orang the brain of this with that of a chimpanzee of this with that of a gorilla and so on of a hylobates semnopithecus cynocephalus cercopithecus macacus cebus callithrix lemur stenops hapale we shall not meet with a greater or even as great a break in the degree of development of the convolutions as we find between the brain of a man and that of an orang or chimpanzee  to which i reply firstly that whether this assertion be true or false it has nothing whatever to do with the proposition enunciated in mans place in nature which refers not to the development of the convolutions alone but to the structure of the whole brain  if professor bischoff had taken the trouble to refer to p 96 of the work he criticises in fact he would have found the following passage and it is a remarkable circumstance that though so far as our present knowledge extends there is one true structural break in the series of forms of simian brains this hiatus does not lie between man and the manlike apes but between the lower and the lowest simians or in other words between the old and new world apes and monkeys and the lemurs every lemur which has yet been examined in fact has its cerebellum partially visible from above and its posterior lobe with the contained posterior cornu and hippocampus minor more or less rudimentary  every marmoset american monkey old world monkey baboon or manlike ape on the contrary has its cerebellum entirely hidden posteriorly by the cerebral lobes and possesses a large posterior cornu with a welldeveloped hippocampus minor  this statement was a strictly accurate account of what was known when it was made and it does not appear to me to be more than apparently weakened by the subsequent discovery of the relatively small development of the posterior lobes in the siamang and in the howling monkey  notwithstanding the exceptional brevity of the posterior lobes in these two species no one will pretend that their brains in the slightest degree approach those of the lemurs  and if instead of putting hapale out of its natural place as professor bischoff most unaccountably does we write the series of animals he has chosen to mention as follows  homo pithecus troglodytes hylobates semnopithecus cynocephalus cercopithecus macacus cebus callithrix hapale lemur stenops i venture to reaffirm that the great break in this series lies between hapale and lemur and that this break is considerably greater than that between any other two terms of that series  professor bischoff ignores the fact that long before he wrote gratiolet had suggested the separation of the lemurs from the other primates on the very ground of the difference in their cerebral characters and that professor flower had made the following observations in the course of his description of the brain of the javan loris  75  transactions of the zoological society vol v 1862  and it is especially remarkable that in the development of the posterior lobes there is no approximation to the lemurine short hemisphered brain in those monkeys which are commonly supposed to approach this family in other respects viz the lower members of the platyrrhine group  so far as the structure of the adult brain is concerned then the very considerable additions to our knowledge which have been made by the researches of so many investigators during the past ten years fully justify the statement which i made in 1863  but it has been said that admitting the similarity between the adult brains of man and apes they are nevertheless in reality widely different because they exhibit fundamental differences in the mode of their development  no one would be more ready than i to admit the force of this argument if such fundamental differences of development really exist  but i deny that they do exist  on the contrary there is a fundamental agreement in the development of the brain in men and apes  gratiolet originated the statement that there is a fundamental difference in the development of the brains of apes and that of manconsisting in this that in the apes the sulci which first make their appearance are situated on the posterior region of the cerebral hemispheres while in the human foetus the sulci first become visible on the frontal lobes  76 chez tous les singes les plis posterieurs se developpent les premiers les plis anterieurs se developpent plus tard aussi la vertebre occipitale et la parietale sontelles relativement tresgrandes chez le foetus  lhomme presente une exception remarquable quant a lepoque de lapparition des plis frontaux qui sont les premiers indiques mais le developpement general du lobe frontal envisage seulement par rapport a son volume suit les memes lois que dans les singes  gratiolet memoire sur les plis cerebres de lhomme et des primateaux p 39 tab iv fig 3  this general statement is based upon two observations the one of a gibbon almost ready to be born in which the posterior gyri were well developed while those of the frontal lobes were hardly indicated 77  gratiolets words are loc cit p 39 dans le foetus dont il sagit les plis cerebraux posterieurs sont bien developpes tandis que les plis du lobe frontal sont a peine indiques  the figure however pl iv fig 3 shews the fissure of rolando and one of the frontal sulci plainly enough nevertheless m alix in his notice sur les travaux anthropologiques de gratiolet mem de la societe danthropologie de paris 1868 page 32 writes thus gratiolet a eu entre les mains le cerveau dun foetus de gibbon singe eminemment superieur et tellement rapproche de lorang que des naturalistes trescompetents lont range parmi les anthropoides  m huxley par exemple nhesite pas sur ce point eh bien cest sur le cerveau dun foetus de gibbon que gratiolet a vu les circonvolutions du lobe temporosphenoidal deja developpees lorsquil nexistent pas encore de plis sur le lobe frontal  il etait donc bien autorise a dire que chez lhomme les circonvolutions apparaissent da en w tandis que chez les singes elles se developpent dw en a and the other of a human foetus at the 22nd or 23rd week of uterogestation in which gratiolet notes that the insula was uncovered but that nevertheless des incisures sement de lobe anterieur une scissure peu profonde indique la separation du lobe occipital tresreduit dailleurs des cette epoque  le reste de la surface cerebrale est encore absolument lisse  three views of this brain are given in plate ii figs 1 2 3 of the work cited shewing the upper lateral and inferior views of the hemispheres but not the inner view  it is worthy of note that the figure by no means bears out gratiolets description inasmuch as the fissure anterotemporal on the posterior half of the face of the hemisphere is more marked than any of those vaguely indicated in the anterior half  if the figure is correct it in no way justifies gratiolets conclusion  il y a donc entre ces cerveaux those of a callithrix and of a gibbon et celui du foetus humain une difference fondamental  chez celuici longtemps avant que les plis temporaux apparaissent les plis frontaux essayent dexister  since gratiolets time however the development of the gyri and sulci of the brain has been made the subject of renewed investigation by schmidt bischoff pansch 78  ueber die typische anordnung der furchen und windungen auf den grosshirnhemispharen des menschen und der affen archiv fur anthropologie iii 1868 and more particularly by ecker 79 zur entwicklungs geschichte der furchen und windungen der grosshirnhemispharen im foetus des menschen  archiv fur anthropologie iii 1868 whose work is not only the latest but by far the most complete memoir on the subject  the final results of their inquiries may be summed up as follows  1  in the human foetus the sylvian fissure is formed in the course of the third month of uterogestation  in this and in the fourth month the cerebral hemispheres are smooth and rounded with the exception of the sylvian depression and they project backwards far beyond the cerebellum  2  the sulci properly so called begin to appear in the interval between the end of the fourth and the beginning of the sixth month of foetal life but ecker is careful to point out that not only the time but the order of their appearance is subject to considerable individual variation  in no case however are either the frontal or the temporal sulci the earliest  the first which appears in fact lies on the inner face of the hemisphere whence doubtless gratiolet who does not seem to have examined that face in his foetus overlooked it and is either the internal perpendicular occipitoparietal or the calcarine sulcus these two being close together and eventually running into one another as a rule the occipitoparietal is the earlier of the two  3  at the latter part of this period another sulcus the posterioparietal or fissure of rolando is developed and it is followed in the course of the sixth month by the other principal sulci of the frontal parietal temporal and occipital lobes  there is however no clear evidence that one of these constantly appears before the other and it is remarkable that in the brain at the period described and figured by ecker loc cit pp 212213 taf ii figs 1 2 3 4 the anterotemporal sulcus scissure parallele so characteristic of the apes brain is as well if not better developed than the fissure of rolando and is much more marked than the proper frontal sulci  taking the facts as they now stand it appears to me that the order of the appearance of the sulci and gyri in the foetal human brain is in perfect harmony with the general doctrine of evolution and with the view that man has been evolved from some apelike form though there can be no doubt that form was in many respects different from any member of the primates now living  von baer taught us half a century ago that in the course of their development allied animals put on at first the characters of the greater groups to which they belong and by degrees assume those which restrict them within the limits of their family genus and species and he proved at the same time that no developmental stage of a higher animal is precisely similar to the adult condition of any lower animal  it is quite correct to say that a frog passes through the condition of a fish inasmuch as at one period of its life the tadpole has all the characters of a fish and if it went no further would have to be grouped among fishes  but it is equally true that a tadpole is very different from any known fish  in like manner the brain of a human foetus at the fifth month may correctly be said to be not only the brain of an ape but that of an arctopithecine or marmosetlike ape for its hemispheres with their great posterior lobster and with no sulci but the sylvian and the calcarine present the characteristics found only in the group of the arctopithecine primates  but it is equally true as gratiolet remarks that in its widely open sylvian fissure it differs from the brain of any actual marmoset  no doubt it would be much more similar to the brain of an advanced foetus of a marmoset  but we know nothing whatever of the development of the brain in the marmosets  in the platyrrhini proper the only observation with which i am acquainted is due to pansch who found in the brain of a foetal cebus apella in addition to the sylvian fissure and the deep calcarine fissure only a very shallow anterotemporal fissure scissure parallele of gratiolet  now this fact taken together with the circumstance that the anterotemporal sulcus is present in such platyrrhini as the saimiri which present mere traces of sulci on the anterior half of the exterior of the cerebral hemispheres or none at all undoubtedly so far as it goes affords fair evidence in favour of gratiolets hypothesis that the posterior sulci appear before the anterior in the brains of the platyrrhini  but it by no means follows that the rule which may hold good for the platyrrhini extends to the catarrhini  we have no information whatever respecting the development of the brain in the cynomorpha and as regards the anthropomorpha nothing but the account of the brain of the gibbon near birth already referred to  at the present moment there is not a shadow of evidence to shew that the sulci of a chimpanzees or orangs brain do not appear in the same order as a mans  gratiolet opens his preface with the aphorism  il est dangereux dans les sciences de conclure trop vite  i fear he must have forgotten this sound maxim by the time he had reached the discussion of the differences between men and apes in the body of his work  no doubt the excellent author of one of the most remarkable contributions to the just understanding of the mammalian brain which has ever been made would have been the first to admit the insufficiency of his data had he lived to profit by the advance of inquiry  the misfortune is that his conclusions have been employed by persons incompetent to appreciate their foundation as arguments in favour of obscurantism  80  for example m labbe lecomte in his terrible pamphlet le darwinisme et lorigine de lhomme 1873  but it is important to remark that whether gratiolet was right or wrong in his hypothesis respecting the relative order of appearance of the temporal and frontal sulci the fact remains that before either temporal or frontal sulci appear the foetal brain of man presents characters which are found only in the lowest group of the primates leaving out the lemurs and that this is exactly what we should expect to be the case if man has resulted from the gradual modification of the same form as that from which the other primates have sprung
