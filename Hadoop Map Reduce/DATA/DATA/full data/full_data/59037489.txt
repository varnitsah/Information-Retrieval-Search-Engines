59037489	twice told tales                        sights from a steeple                        by nathaniel hawthorne   o i have climbed high and my reward is small  here i stand with wearied knees earth indeed  at a dizzy depth below but heaven far far beyond me still  o that i could soar up into the very  zenith where man never breathed nor eagle ever flew  and where the ethereal azure melts away from the eye  and appears only a deepened shade of nothingness  and  yet i shiver at that cold and solitary thought  what clouds are gathering in the golden west with direful  intent against the brightness and the warmth of this  dimmer afternoon  they are ponderous airships black  as death and freighted with the tempest and at intervals  their thunder the signalguns of that unearthly squadron rolls distant along the deep of heaven  these nearer  heaps of fleecy vapormethinks i could roll and toss  upon them the whole day longseem scattered here  and there for the repose of tired pilgrims through the sky  perhapsfor who can tellbeautiful spirits are disporting themselves there and will bless my mortal  eye with the brief appearance of their curly locks of  golden light and laughing faces fair and faint as the  people of a rosy dream  or where the floating mass so imperfectly obstructs the color of the firmament a slender foot and fairy limb resting too heavily upon the frail support may be thrust through and suddenly withdrawn while longing fancy follows them in vain  yonder again is an airy archipelago where the sunbeams love to linger in their journeyings through space  every one of those little clouds has been dipped and steeped in radiance which the slightest pressure might disengage in silvery profusion like water wrung from a seamaids hair  bright they are as a young mans visions and like them would be realized in chillness obscurity and tears  i will look on them no more  in three parts of the visible circle whose centre is this spire i discern cultivated fields villages white countryseats the waving lines of rivulets little placid lakes and here and there a rising ground that would fain be termed a hill  on the fourth side is the sea stretching away towards a viewless boundary blue and calm except where the passing anger of a shadow flits across its surface and is gone hitherward a broad inlet penetrates far into the land on the verge of the harbor formed by its extremity is a town and over it am i a watchman allheeding and unheeded  o that the multitude of chimneys could speak like those of madrid and betray in smoky whispers the secrets of all who since their first foundation have assembled at the hearths within  o that the limping devil of le sage would perch beside me here extend his wand over this contiguity of roofs uncover every chamber and make me familiar with their inhabitants  the most desirable mode of existence might be that of a spiritualized paul pry hovering invisible round man and woman witnessing their deeds searching into their hearts borrowing brightness from their felicity and shade from their sorrow and retaining no emotion peculiar to himself  but none of these things are possible and if i would know interior of brick walls or the mystery of human bosoms i can but guess  yonder is a fair street extending north and south  the stately mansions are placed each on its carpet of verdant grass and a long flight of steps descends from every door to the pavement  ornamental treesthe broadleafed horsechestnut the elm so lofty and bending the graceful but infrequent willow and others whereof i know not the namesgrow thrivingly among brick and stone  the oblique rays of the sun are intercepted by these green citizens and by the houses so that one side of the street is a shaded and pleasant walk  on its whole extent there is now but a single passenger advancing from the upper end and be unless distance and the medium of a pocket spyglass do him more than justice is a fine young man of twenty  he saunters slowly forward slapping his left hand with his folded gloves bending his eyes upon the pavement and sometimes raising them to throw a glance before him certainly he has a pensive air  is he in doubt or in debt  is he if the question be allowable in love  does he strive to be melancholy and gentlemanlike  or is he merely overcome by the heat  but i bid him farewell for the present  the door of one of the housesan aristocratic edifice with curtains of purple and gold waving from the windowsis now opened and down the steps come two ladies swinging their parasols and lightly arrayed for a summer ramble  both are young both are pretty but methinks the lefthand lass is the fairer of the twain and though she be so serious at this moment i could swear that there is a treasure of gentle fun within her  they stand talking a little while upon the steps and finally proceed up the street meantime as their faces are now turned from me i may look elsewhere  upon that wharf and down the corresponding street is a busy contrast to the quiet scene which i have just noticed  business evidently has its centre there and many a man is wasting the summer afternoon in labor and anxiety in losing riches or in gaining them when he would be wiser to flee away to some pleasant country village or shaded lake in the forest or wild and cool seabeach  i see vessels unlading at the wharf and precious merchandise strewn upon the ground abundantly as at the bottom of the sea that market whence no goods return and where there is no captain nor supercargo to render an account of sales  here the clerks are diligent with their paper and pencils and sailors ply the block and tackle that hang over the hold accompanying their toil with cries long drawn and roughly melodious till the bales and puncheons ascend to upper air  at a little distance a group of gentlemen are assembled round the door of a warehouse  grave seniors be they and i would wagerif it were safe in these times to be responsible for any onethat the least eminent among them might vie with old vicentio that incomparable trafficker of pisa  i can even select the wealthiest of the company it is the elderly personage in somewhat rusty black with powdered hair the superfluous whiteness of which is visible upon the cape of his coat his twenty ships are wafted on some of their many courses by every breeze that blows and his namei will venture to say though i know it notis a familiar sound among the farseparated merchants of europe and the indies  but i bestow too much of my attention in this quarter  on looking again to the long and shady walk i perceive that the two fair girls have encountered the young man  after a sort of shyness in the recognition he turns back with them  moreover he has sanctioned my taste in regard to his companions by placing himself on the inner side of the pavement nearest the venus to whom ienacting on a steepletop the part of paris on the top of idaadjudged the golden apple  in two streets converging at right angles towards my watchtower i distinguish three different processions  one is a proud array of voluntary soldiers in bright uniform resembling from the height whence i look down the painted veterans that garrison the windows of a toyshop and yet it stirs my heart their regular advance their nodding plumes the sunflash on their bayonets and musketbarrels the roll of their drums ascending past me and the fife ever and anon piercing throughthese things have wakened a warlike fire peaceful though i be close to their rear marches a battalion of schoolboys ranged in crooked and irregular platoons shouldering sticks thumping a harsh and unripe clatter from an instrument of tin and ridiculously aping the intricate manoeuvres of the foremost band  nevertheless as slight differences are scarcely perceptible from a churchspire one might be tempted to ask which are the boys or rather which the men but leaving these let us turn to the third procession which though sadder in outward show may excite identical reflections in the thoughtful mind  it is a funeral  a hearse drawn by a black and bony steed and covered by a dusty pall two or three coaches rumbling over the stones their drivers half asleep a dozen couple of careless mourners in their everyday attire such was not the fashion of our fathers when they carried a friend to his grave  there is now no doleful clang of the bell to proclaim sorrow to the town  was the king of terrors more awful in those days than in our own that wisdom and philosophy have been able to produce this change  not so  here is a proof that he retains his proper majesty  the military men and the military boys are wheeling round the corner and meet the funeral full in the face  immediately the drum is silent all but the tap that regulates each simultaneous footfall  the soldiers yield the path to the dusty hearse and unpretending train and the children quit their ranks and cluster on the sidewalks with timorous and instinctive curiosity  the mourners enter the churchyard at the base of the steeple and pause by an open grave among the burialstones the lightning glimmers on them as they lower down the coffin and the thunder rattles heavily while they throw the earth upon its lid  verily the shower is near and i tremble for the young man and the girls who have now disappeared from the long and shady street  how various are the situations of the people covered by the roofs beneath me and how diversified are the events at this moment befalling them the newborn the aged the dying the strong in life and the recent dead are in the chambers of these many mansions  the full of hope the happy the miserable and the desperate dwell together within the circle of my glance  in some of the houses over which my eyes roam so coldly guilt is entering into hearts that are still tenanted by a debased and trodden virtueguilt is on the very edge of commission and the impending deed might be averted guilt is done and the criminal wonders if it be irrevocable  there are broad thoughts struggling in my mind and were i able to give them distinctness they would make their way in eloquence lo  the raindrops are descending  the clouds within a little time have gathered over all the sky hanging heavily as if about to drop in one unbroken mass upon the earth  at intervals the lightning flashes from their brooding hearts quivers disappears and then comes the thunder travelling slowly after its twinborn flame  a strong wind has sprung up howls through the darkened streets and raises the dust in dense bodies to rebel against the approaching storm  the disbanded soldiers fly the funeral has already vanished like its dead and all people hurry homewardall that have a home while a few lounge by the corners or trudge on desperately at their leisure  in a narrow lane which communicates with the shady street i discern the rich old merchant putting himself to the top of his speed lest the rain should convert his hairpowder to a paste unhappy gentleman  by the slow vehemence and painful moderation wherewith he journeys it is but too evident that podagra has left its thrilling tenderness in his great toe  but yonder at a far more rapid pace come three other of my acquaintance the two pretty girls and the young man unseasonably interrupted in their walk  their footsteps are supported by the risen dustthe wind lends them its velocitythey fly like three seabirds driven landward by the tempestuous breeze  the ladies would not thus rival atalanta if they but knew that any one were at leisure to observe them  ah as they hasten onward laughing in the angry face of nature a sudden catastrophe has chanced  at the corner where the narrow lane enters into the street they come plump against the old merchant whose tortoise motion has just brought him to that point he likes not the sweet encounter the darkness of the whole air gathers speedily upon his visage and there is a pause on both sides  finally he thrusts aside the youth with little courtesy seizes an arm of each of the two girls and plods onward like a magician with a prize of captive fairies  all this is easy to be understood  how disconsolate the poor lover stands regardless of the rain that threatens an exceeding damage to his wellfashioned habiliments till he catches a backward glance of mirth from a bright eye and turns away with whatever comfort it conveys  the old man and his daughters are safely housed and now the storm lets loose its fury  in every dwelling i perceive the faces of the chambermaids as they shut down the windows excluding the impetuous shower and shrinking away from the quick fiery glare  the large drops descend with force upon the slated roofs and rise again in smoke  there is a rush and roar as of a river through the air and muddy streams bubble majestically along the pavement whirl their dusky foam into the kennel and disappear beneath iron grates  thus did arethusa sink  i love not my station here aloft in the midst of the tumult which i am powerless to direct or quell with the blue lightning wrinkling on my brow and the thunder muttering its first awful syllables in my ear  i will descend  yet let me give another glance to the sea where the foam breaks out in long white lines upon a broad expanse of blackness or boils up in far distant points like snowy mountaintops in the eddies of a flood and let me look once more at the green plain and little hills of the country over which the giant of the storm is striding in robes of mist and at the town whose obscured and desolate streets might beseem a city of the dead and turning a single moment to the sky now gloomy as an authors prospects i prepare to resume my station on lower earth but stay  a little speck of azure has widened in the western heavens the sunbeams find a passage and go rejoicing through the tempest and on yonder darkest cloud born like hallowed hopes of the glory of another world and the trouble and tears of this brightens forth the rainbow
