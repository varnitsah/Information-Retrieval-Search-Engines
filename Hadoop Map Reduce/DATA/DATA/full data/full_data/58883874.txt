airmothers the tree of knowledge great cities and their influence for good and evil heroism the massacre of the innocents a mad world my masters     womans work in a country parish 1    i have been asked to speak a few words to you on a ladys work in a country parish  i shall confine myself rather to principles than to details and the first principle which i would impress on you is that we must all be just before we are generous  i must indeed speak plainly on this point  a womans first duties are to her own family her own servants  be not deceived  if anyone cannot rule her own household she cannot rule the church of god if anyone cannot sympathise with the servants with whom she is in contact all day long she will not really sympathise with the poor whom she sees once a week  i know the temptation not to believe this is very great  it seems so much easier to women to do something for the poor than for their own ladies maids and housemaids and cooks  and why  because they can treat the poor as things  but they must treat their servants as persons  a lady can go into a poor cottage lay down the law to the inhabitants reprove them for sins to which she has never been tempted tell them how to set things right which if she had the doing of them i fear she would do even more confusedly and slovenly than they she can give them a tract as she might a pill and then a shilling as something sweet after the medicine and she can go out again and see no more of them till her benevolent mood recurs but with the servants it is not so  she knows their characters and what is more they know hers they know her private history her little weaknesses  perhaps she is a little in their power and she is shy with them  she is afraid of beginning a good work with them because if she does she will be forced to carry it out and it cannot be cold dry perfunctory official  it must be hearty living loving personal  she must make them her friends and perhaps she is afraid of doing that for fear they should take liberties as it is calledwhich they very probably will do unless she keeps up a very high standard of self restraint and earnestness in her own lifeand that involves a great deal of trouble and so she is tempted when she wishes to do good to fall back on the poor people in the cottages outside who as she fancies know nothing about her and will never find out whether or not she acts up to the rules which she lays down for them  be not deceived i say in this case also  fancy not that they know nothing about you  there is nothing secret which shall not be made manifest and what you do in the closet is surely proclaimed and often with exaggeration enough and to spare on the housetop  these poor folks at your gate know well enough through servants and tradesmen what you are how you treat your servants how you pay your bills what sort of temper you have and they form a shrewd hard estimate of your character in the light of which they view all that you do and say to them and believe me that if you wish to do any real good to them you must begin by doing good to those who lie still nearer to you than them  and believe me too that if you shrink from a hearty patriarchal sympathy with your own servants because it would require too much personal human intercourse with them you are like a man who finding that he had not powder enough to fire off a pocketpistol should try to better matters by using the same quantity of ammunition in an eightyfour pound gun  for it is this human friendship trust affection which is the very thing you have to employ towards the poor and to call up in them clubs societies alms lending libraries are but dead machinery needful perhaps but like the iron tube without the powder unable to send the bullet forth one single inch dead and useless lumber without humanity without the smile of the lip the light of the eye the tenderness of the voice which makes the poor woman feel that a soul is speaking to her soul a heart yearning after her heart that she is not merely a thing to be improved but a sister to be made conscious of the divine bond of her sisterhood and taught what she means when she repeats in her creed i believe in the communion of saints  this is my text and my keynotewhatever else i may say today is but a carrying out into details of the one question how may you go to these poor creatures as woman to woman  your next duties are to your husbands or fathers servants and workmen  it is said that a clergymans wife ought to consider the parish as her flock as well as her husbands  it may be so  i believe the dogma to be much overstated just now  but of a landlords or employers wife i am inclined to say too of an officers wife such a doctrine is absolutely true and cannot be overstated  a large proportion therefore of your parish work will be to influence the men of your family to do their duty by their dependants  you wish to cure the evils under which they labour  the greater proportion of these are in the hands of your men relatives  it is a mockery for instance in you to visit the feverstricken cottage while your husband leaves it in a state which breeds that fever  your business is to go to him and say here is a wrong right it  this as many a beautiful middle age legend tells us has been womans function in all uncivilised times not merely to melt mans heart to pity but to awaken it to duty  but the man must see that the woman is in earnest  that if he will not repair the wrong by justice she will if possible as in those old legends by selfsacrifice  be sure this method will conquer  do but say  if you will not newroof that cottage if you will not make that drain i will  i will not buy a new dress till it is done i will sell the horse you gave me pawn the bracelet you gave me but the thing shall be done  let him see i say that you are in earnest and he will feel that your message is a divine one which he must obey for very shame and weariness if for nothing else  this is in my eyes the second part of a womans parish work  i entreat you to bear it in mind when you hear as i trust you will lectures in this place upon that sanitary reform without which all efforts for the bettering of the masses are in my eyes not only useless but hypocritical  i will suppose then that you are fulfilling home duties in self restraint and love and in the fear of god  i will suppose that you are using all your womans influence on the mind of your family in behalf of tenants and workmen and i tell you frankly that unless this be first done you are paying a tithe of mint and anise and neglecting common righteousness and mercy  but you wish to do more  you wish for personal contact with the poor round you for the pure enjoyment of doing good to them with your own hands  how are you to set about it  first there are clubs clothingclubs shoeclubs maternalclubs all very good in their way  but do not fancy that they are the greater part of your parish work  rather watch and fear lest they become substitutes for your real parish work lest the bustle and amusement of playing at shopkeeper or pennycollector once a week should blind you to your real poweryour real treasure by spending which you become all the richer  what you have to do is to ennoble and purify the womanhood of these poor women to make them better daughters sisters wives mothers  and all the clubs in the world will not do that they are but palliatives of a great evil which they do not touch cloaks for almsgiving clumsy means of eking out insufficient wages at best kindly contrivances for tricking into temporary thriftiness a degraded and reckless peasantry  miserable miserable state of things out of which the longer i live i see less hope of escape saving by an emigration which shall drain us of all the healthy strong and brave among the lower classes and leave us as a just punishment for our sins only the cripple the drunkard and the beggar  yet these clubs must be carried on  they make life a little more possible they lighten hearts if but for a moment they inculcate habits of order and selfrestraint which may be useful when the poor man finds himself in canada or australia  and it is a cruel utilitarianism to refuse to palliate the symptoms because you cannot cure the disease itself  you will give opiates to the suffering who must die nevertheless  let him slip into his grave at least as painlessly as you can  and so you must use these charitable societies remembering all along what a fearful and humbling sign the necessity for them is of the diseased state of this england as the sportula and universal almsgiving was of the decadence of rome  however the work has to be done and such as it is it is especially fitted for young unmarried ladies  it requires no deep knowledge of human nature  it makes them aware of the amount of suffering and struggling which lies around them without bringing them in that most undesirable contact with the coarser forms of evil which housevisitation must do and the mere business habits of accuracy and patience to which it compels them are a valuable practical schooling for them themselves in afterlife  it is tiresome and unsentimental drudgery no doubt but perhaps all the better training on that account  and after all the magic of sweetness grace and courtesy may shed a hallowing and humanising light over the meanest work and the smile of god may spread from lip to lip and the light of god from eye to eye even between the giver and receiver of a penny till the poor woman goes home saying in her heart i have not only found the life of my handi have found a sister for time and for eternity  but there is another field of parish usefulness which i cannot recommend too earnestly and that is the school  there you may work as hard as you will and how you willprovided you do it in a loving hearty cheerful human way playful and yet earnest two qualities which when they exist in their highest power are sure to go together  i say how you will  i am no pedant about schools i care less what is taught than how it is taught  the merest rudiments of christianity the merest rudiments of popular instruction are enough provided they be given by lips which speak as if they believed what they said and with a look which shows real love for the pupil  manner is everythingmatter a secondary consideration for in matter brain only speaks to brain in manner soul speaks to soul  if you want christs lost lambs really to believe that he died for them you will do it better by one little act of interest and affection than by making them learn by heart whole commentarieseven as miss nightingale has preached christ crucified to those poor soldiers by acts of plain outward drudgery more livingly and really and convincingly than she could have done by ten thousand sermons and made many a noble lad i doubt not say in his heart for the first time in his wild life i can believe now that christ died for me for here is one whom he has taught to die for me in like wise  and this blessed effect of schoolwork remember is not confined to the children  it goes home with them to the parents the child becomes an object of interest and respect in their eyes when they see it an object of interest and respect in yours  if they see that you look on it as an awful and glorious being the child of god the coheir of christ they learn gradually to look on it in the same light  they become afraid and ashamed and it is a noble fear and shame to do and say before it what they used to do and say afraid to illuse it  it becomes to them a mysterious visitor sad that it should be so but true as sad from a higher and purer sphere who must be treated with something of courtesy and respect who must even be asked to teach them something of its new knowledge and the school and the ladies interest in the school become to the degraded parents a living sign that those childrens angels do indeed behold the face of their father which is in heaven  now there is one thing in schoolwork which i wish to press on you and that is that you should not confine your work to the girls but bestow it as freely on those who need it more and who paradoxical as it may seem will respond to it more deeply and freelythe boys  i am not going to enter into the reasons why i only entreat you to believe me that by helping to educate the boys or even when old enough by taking a class as i have seen done with admirable effect of grownup lads you may influence for ever not only the happiness of your pupils but of the girls whom they will hereafter marry  it will be a boon to your own sex as well as to ours to teach them courtesy selfrestraint reverence for physical weakness admiration of tenderness and gentleness and it is one which only a lady can bestow  only by being accustomed in youth to converse with ladies will the boy learn to treat hereafter his sweetheart or his wife like a gentleman  there is a latent chivalry doubt it not in the heart of every untutored clod if it dies out in him as it too often does it were better for him i often think if he had never been born  but the only talisman which will keep it alive much more develop it into its fulness is friendly and revering intercourse with women of higher rank than himself between whom and him there is a great and yet a blessed gulf fixed  i have left to the last the most important subject of all and that is what is called visiting the poor  it is an endless subject if you go into details you might write volumes on it all i can do this afternoon is to keep to my own keynote and say visit whom when and where you will but let your visits be those of woman to woman  consider to whom you goto poor souls whose life compared with yours is one long malaise of body and soul and spiritand do as you would be done by instead of reproving and faultfinding encourage  in gods name encourage they scramble through lifes rocks bogs and thornbrakes clumsily enough and have many a fall poor things  but why in the name of a god of love and justice is the lady rolling along the smooth turnpikeroad in her comfortable carriage to be calling out all day long to the poor soul who drags on beside her over hedge and ditch moss and moor barefooted and weary hearted with halfadozen children at her back  you ought not to have fallen here and it was very cowardly to lie down there and it was your duty as a mother to have helped that child through the puddle while as for sleeping under that bush it is most imprudent and inadmissible  why not encourage her praise her cheer her on her weary way by loving words and keep your reproofs for yourselfeven your advice for she does get on her way after all where you could not travel a step forward and she knows what she is about perhaps better than you do and what she has to endure and what god thinks of her lifejourney  the heart knoweth its own bitterness and a stranger intermeddleth not with its joy  but do not be a stranger to her  be a sister to her  i do not ask you to take her up in your carriage  you cannot perhaps it is good for her that you cannot  it is good sometimes for lazarus that he is not fit to sit at divess feastgood for him that he should receive his evil things in this life and be comforted in the life to come  all i ask is do to the poor soul as you would have her do to you in her place  do not interrupt and vex her for she is busy enough already with remedies which she does not understand for troubles which you do not understand but speak comfortably to her and say  i cannot feel with you but i do feel for you  i should enjoy helping you but i do not know howtell me  tell me where the yoke galls tell me why that forehead is grown old before its time  i may be able to ease the burden to put fresh light into the eyes and if not still tell me simply because i am a woman and know the relief of pouring out my own soul into loving ears even though in the depths of despair  yes paradoxical as it may seem i am convinced that the only way to help these poor women humanly and really is to begin by confessing to them that you do not know how to help them to humble yourself to them and to ask their counsel for the good of themselves and of their neighbours instead of coming proudly to them with nostrums ready compounded as if a doctor should be so confident in his own knowledge of books and medicine as to give physic before asking the patients symptoms  therefore i entreat you to bear in mind for without this all visiting of the poor will be utterly void and useless that you must regulate your conduct to them and in their houses even to the most minute particulars by the very same rules which apply to persons of your own class  never let any woman say of you thought fatal to all confidence all influence  yes it is all very kind  but she does not behave to me as she would to one of her own quality  piety earnestness affectionateness eloquenceall may be nullified and stultified by simply keeping a poor woman standing in her own cottage while you sit or entering her house even at her own request while she is at meals  she may decline to sit she may beg you to come in all the more reason for refusing utterly to obey her because it shows that that very inward gulf between you and her still exists in her mind which it is the object of your visit to bridge over  if you know her to be in trouble touch on that trouble as you would with a lady  womans heart is alike in all ranks and the deepest sorrow is the one of which she speaks the last and least  we should not like anyoneno not an angel from heaven to come into our houses without knocking at the door and say  i hear you are very ill offi will lend you a hundred pounds  i think you are very careless of money i will take your accounts into my own hands and still less again  your son is a very bad profligate disgraceful fellow who is not fit to be mentioned i intend to take him out of your hands and reform him myself neither do the poor like such unceremonious mercy such untender tenderness benevolence at horseplay mistaking kicks for caresses  they do not like it they will not respond to it save in parishes which have been demoralised by officious and indiscriminate benevolence and where the last remaining virtues of the poor savage selfhelp and independence have been exchanged as i have too often seen them exchanged for organised begging and hypocrisy  i would that you would all read ladies and consider well the traits of an opposite character which have just come to light to me i am ashamed to say for the first time in the biography of sidney smith  the love and admiration which that truly brave and loving man won from everyone rich or poor with whom he came in contact seems to me to have arisen from the one fact that without perhaps having any such conscious intention he treated rich and poor his own servants and the noblemen his guests alike and alike courteously considerately cheerfully affectionatelyso leaving a blessing and reaping a blessing wheresoever he went  approach then these poor women as sisters and you will be able gradually to reverse the hard saying of which i made use just now do not apply remedies which they do not understand to diseases which you do not understand  learn lovingly and patiently aye and reverently for there is that in every human being which deserves reverence and must be reverenced if we wish to understand itlearn i say to understand their troubles and by that time they will have learnt to understand your remedies and they will appreciate them  for you have remedies  i do not undervalue your position  no man on earth is less inclined to undervalue the real power of wealth rank accomplishments mannerseven physical beauty  all are talents from god and i give god thanks when i see them possessed by any human being for i know that they too can be used in his service and brought to bear on the true emancipation of womanher emancipation not from man as some foolish persons fancy but from the devil the slanderer and divider who divides her from man and makes her live a lifelong tragedy which goes on in more cottages than in palacesa vie e part a vie incomprisea life made up half of illusage half of unnecessary selfwilled selfconceited martyrdom instead of being as god intended half of the human universe a helpmeet for man and the one bright spot which makes this world endurable  towards making her that and so realising the primeval mission by every cottage hearth each of you can do something for each of you have some talent power knowledge attraction between soul and soul which the cottagers wife has not and by which you may draw her to you with as the prophet says human bonds and the cords of love  but she must be drawn by them alone or your work is nothing and though you give the treasures of ind they are valueless equally to her and to christ for they are not given in his name which is that boundless tenderness consideration patience selfsacrifice by which even the cup of cold water is a precious offeringas god grant your labour may be    the science of health 2    whether the british race is improving or degenerating  what if it seem probably degenerating are the causes of so great an evil how they can be if not destroyed at least arrested  these are questions worthy attention not of statesmen only and medical men but of every father and mother in these isles  i shall say somewhat about them in this essay and say it in a form which ought to be intelligible to fathers and mothers of every class from the highest to the lowest in hopes of convincing some of them at least that the science of health now so utterly neglected in our curriculum of socalled education ought to be taughtthe rudiments of it at leastin every school college and university  we talk of our hardy forefathers and rightly  but they were hardy just as the savage is usually hardy because none but the hardy lived  they may have been able to say of themselvesas they do in a state paper of 1515 now well known through the pages of mr froude  what comyn folk of all the world may compare with the comyns of england in riches freedom liberty welfare and all prosperity  what comyn folk is so mighty and so strong in the felde as the comyns of england  they may have been fed on great shins of beef till they became as benvenuto cellini calls them the english wild beasts  but they increased in numbers slowly if at all for centuries  those terrible laws of natural selection which issue in the survival of the fittest cleared off the less fit in every generation principally by infantile disease often by wholesale famine and pestilence and left on the whole only those of the strongest constitutions to perpetuate a hardy valiant and enterprising race  at last came a sudden and unprecedented change  in the first years of this century steam and commerce produced an enormous increase in the population  millions of fresh human beings found employment married brought up children who found employment in their turn and learnt to live more or less civilised lives  an event doubtless for which god is to be thanked  a quite new phase of humanity bringing with it new vices and new dangers but bringing also not merely new comforts but new noblenesses new generosities new conceptions of duty and of how that duty should be done  it is childish to regret the old times when our sootgrimed manufacturing districts were green with lonely farms to murmur at the transformation would be i believe to murmur at the will of him without whom not a sparrow falls to the ground   the old order changeth yielding place to the new and god fulfils himself in many ways lest one good custom should corrupt the world   our duty is instead of longing for the good old custom to take care of the good new custom lest it should corrupt the world in like wise  and it may do so thus  the rapid increase of population during the first half of this century began at a moment when the british stock was specially exhausted namely about the end of the long french war  there may have been periods of exhaustion at least in england before that  there may have been one here as there seems to have been on the continent after the crusades and another after the wars of the roses  there was certainly a period of severe exhaustion at the end of elizabeths reign due both to the long spanish and irish wars and to the terrible endemics introduced from abroad an exhaustion which may have caused in part the national weakness which hung upon us during the reign of the stuarts  but after none of these did the survival of the less fit suddenly become more easy or the discovery of steam power and the acquisition of a colonial empire create at once a fresh demand for human beings and a fresh supply of food for them  britain at the beginning of the nineteenth century was in an altogether new social situation  at the beginning of the great french war and indeed ever since the beginning of the war with spain in 1739often snubbed as the war about jenkinss earbut which was as i hold one of the most just as it was one of the most popular of all our wars after too the once famous forty fine harvests of the eighteenth century the british people from the gentleman who led to the soldier or sailor who followed were one of the mightiest and most capable races which the world has ever seen comparable best to the old roman at his mightiest and most capable period that at least their works testify  they createdas far as man can be said to create anythingthe british empire  they won for us our colonies our commerce the mastery of the seas of all the world  but at what a cost   their bones are scattered far and wide by mount and stream and sea   year after year till the final triumph of waterloo not battle only but worse destroyers than shot and shellfatigue and diseasehad been carrying off our stoutest ablest healthiest young men each of whom represented alas a maiden left unmarried at home or married in default to a less able man  the strongest went to the war each who fell left a weaklier man to continue the race while of those who did not fall too many returned with tainted and weakened constitutions to injure it may be generations yet unborn  the middle classes being mostly engaged in peaceful pursuits suffered less of this decimation of their finest young men and to that fact i attribute much of their increasing preponderance social political and intellectual to this very day  one cannot walk the streets of any of our great commercial cities without seeing plenty of men young and middle aged whose whole bearing and stature shows that the manly vigour of our middle class is anything but exhausted  in liverpool especially i have been much struck not only with the vigorous countenance but with the bodily size of the mercantile men on change  but it must be remembered always first that these men are the very elite of their class the cleverest men the men capable of doing most work and next that they are almost all of them from the great merchant who has his villa out of town and perhaps his moor in the highlands down to the sturdy young volunteer who serves in the haberdashers shop countrybred men and that the question is not what they are like now but what their children and grandchildren especially the fine young volunteers will be like  a very serious question i hold that to be and for this reason  war is without doubt the most hideous physical curse which fallen man inflicts upon himself and for this simple reason that it reverses the very laws of nature and is more cruel even than pestilence  for instead of issuing in the survival of the fittest it issues in the survival of the less fit  and therefore if protracted must deteriorate generations yet unborn and yet a peace such as we now enjoy prosperous civilised humane is fraught though to a less degree with the very same ill effect  in the first place tens of thousandswho knows it notlead sedentary and unwholesome lives stooping asphyxiated employing as small a fraction of their bodies as of their minds  and all this in dwellings workshops what notthe influences the very atmosphere of which tend not to health but to unhealth and to drunkenness as a solace under the feeling of unhealth and depression  and that such a life must tell upon their offspring and if their offspring grow up under similar circumstances upon their offsprings offspring till a whole population may become permanently degraded who does not know  for who that walks through the bystreets of any great city does not see  moreover and this is one of the most fearful problems with which modern civilisation has to dealwe interfere with natural selection by our conscientious care of life as surely as does war itself  if war kills the most fit to live we save alive those wholooking at them from a merely physical point of vieware most fit to die everything which makes it more easy to live every sanitary reform prevention of pestilence medical discovery amelioration of climate drainage of soil improvement in dwellinghouses workhouses gaols every reformatory school every hospital every cure of drunkenness every influence in short which hasso i am toldincreased the average length of life in these islands by nearly onethird since the first establishment of life insurances one hundred and fifty years ago every influence of this kind i say saves persons alive who would otherwise have died and the great majority of these will be even in surgical and zymotic cases those of least resisting power who are thus preserved to produce in time a still less powerful progeny  do i say that we ought not to save these people if we can  god forbid  the weakly the diseased whether infant or adult is here on earth a british citizen no more responsible for his own weakness than for his own existence  society that is in plain english we and our ancestors are responsible for both and we must fulfil the duty and keep him in life and if we can heal strengthen develop him to the utmost and make the best of that which fate and our own deservings have given us to deal with  i do not speak of higher motives still motives which to every minister of religion must be paramount and awful  i speak merely of physical and social motives such as appeal to the conscience of every manthe instinct which bids every humanhearted man or woman to save life alleviate pain like him who causes his sun to shine on the evil and on the good and his rain to fall on the just and on the unjust  but it is palpable that in doing so we must year by year preserve a large percentage of weakly persons who marrying freely in their own class must produce weaklier children and they weaklier children still  must did i say  there are those who are of opinionand i after watching and comparing the histories of many families indeed of every one with whom i have come in contact for now fiveandthirty years in town and country can only fear that their opinion is but too well founded on factthat in the great majority of cases in all classes whatsoever the children are not equal to their parents nor they again to their grandparents of the beginning of the century and that this degrading process goes on most surely and most rapidly in our large towns and in proportion to the antiquity of those towns and therefore in proportion to the number of generations during which the degrading influences have been at work  this and cognate dangers have been felt more and more deeply as the years have rolled on by students of human society  to ward them off theory after theory has been put on paper especially in france which deserve high praise for their ingenuity less for their morality and i fear still less for their common sense for the theorist in his closet is certain to ignore as inconvenient to the construction of his utopia certain of those broad facts of human nature which every active parish priest medical man or poorlaw guardian has to face every day of his life  society and british human nature are what they have become by the indirect influences of long ages and we can no more reconstruct the one than we can change the other  we can no more mend men by theories than we can by coercionto which bythebye almost all these theorists look longingly as their final hope and mainstay we must teach men to mend their own matters of their own reason and their own freewill  we must teach them that they are the arbiters of their own destinies and to a fearfully large degree of their childrens destinies after them  we must teach them not merely that they ought to be free but that they are free whether they know it or not for good and for evil  and we must do that in this case by teaching them sound practical science the science of physiology as applied to health  so and so only can we cheeki do not say stop entirelythough i believe even that to be ideally possible but at least cheek the process of degradation which i believe to be surely going on not merely in these islands but in every civilised country in the world in proportion to its civilisation  it is still a question whether science has fully discovered those laws of hereditary health the disregard of which causes so many marriages disastrous to generations yet unborn  but much valuable light has been thrown on this most mysterious and most important subject during the last few years  that lightand i thank god for itis widening and deepening rapidly  and i doubt not that in a generation or two more enough will be known to be thrown into the shape of practical and provable rules and that if not a public opinion yet at least what is more useful far a widespread private opinion will grow up especially among educated women which will prevent many a tragedy and save many a life  but as to the laws of personal health  enough and more than enough is known already to be applied safely and easily by any adults however unlearned to the preservation not only of their own health but of that of their children  the value of healthy habitations of personal cleanliness of pure air and pure water of various kinds of food according as each tends to make bone fat or muscle provided onlyprovided only that the food be unadulterated the value of various kinds of clothing and physical exercise of a free and equal development of the brain power without undue overstrain in any one direction in one word the method of producing as far as possible the mentem sanam in corpore sano and the wonderful and blessed effects of such obedience to those laws of nature which are nothing but the good will of god expressed in factstheir wonderful and blessed tendency i say to eliminate the germs of hereditary disease and to actually regenerate the human system all this is known known as fully and clearly as any human knowledge need be known it is written in dozens of popular books and pamphlets  and why should this divine voice which cries to man tending to sink into effeminate barbarism through his own hasty and partial civilisation  it is not too late  for your bodies as for your spirits there is an upward as well as a downward path  you or if not you at least the children whom you have brought into the world for whom you toil for whom you hoard for whom you pray for whom you would give your lives they still may be healthy strong it may be beautiful and have all the intellectual and social as well as the physical advantages which health strength and beauty giveah why is this divine voice now as of old wisdom crying in the streets and no man regarding her  i appeal to women who are initiated as we men can never be into the stern mysteries of pain and sorrow and selfsacrificethey who bring forth children weep over children slave for children and if they have none of their own then slave with the holy instinct of the sexless bee for the children of otherslet them say shall this thing be  let my readers pardon me if i seem to write too earnestly  that i speak neither more nor less than the truth every medical man knows full well  not only as a very humble student of physiology but as a parish priest of thirty years standing i have seen so much unnecessary misery and i have in other cases seen similar misery so simply avoided that the sense of the vastness of the evil is intensified by my sense of the easiness of the cure  why thento come to practical suggestionsshould there not be opened in every great town in these realms a public school of health  it might connect itself withi hold that it should form an integral part ofsome existing educational institute  but it should at least give practical lectures for fees small enough to put them within the reach of any respectable man or woman however poor i cannot but hope that such schools of health if opened in the great manufacturing towns of england and scotland and indeed in such an irish town as belfast would obtain pupils in plenty and pupils who would thoroughly profit by what they hear the people of these towns are most of them specially accustomed by their own trades to the application of scientific laws  to them therefore the application of any fresh physical laws to a fresh set of facts would have nothing strange in it  they have already something of that inductive habit of mind which is the groundwork of all rational understanding or action  they would not turn the deaf and contemptuous ear with which the savage and the superstitious receive the revelation of natures mysteries why should not with so hopeful an audience the experiment be tried far and wide of giving lectures on health as supplementary to those lectures on animal physiology which are i am happy to say becoming more and more common  why should not people be taughtthey are already being taught at birminghamsomething about the tissues of the body their structure and uses the circulation of the blood respiration chemical changes in the air respired amount breathed digestion nature of food absorption secretion structure of the nervous systemin fact be taught something of how their own bodies are made and how they work teaching of this kind ought to and will in some more civilised age and country be held a necessary element in the school course of every child just as necessary as reading writing and arithmetic for it is after all the most necessary branch of that technical education of which we hear so much just now namely the technic or art of keeping oneself alive and well  but we can hardly stop there  after we have taught the condition of health we must teach also the condition of disease of those diseases specially which tend to lessen wholesale the health of townsfolk exposed to an artificial mode of life  surely young men and women should be taught something of the causes of zymotic disease and of scrofula consumption rickets dipsomania cerebral derangement and such like  they should be shown the practical value of pure air pure water unadulterated food sweet and dry dwellings  is there one of them man or woman who would not be the safer and happier and the more useful to his or her neighbours if they had acquired some sound notions about those questions of drainage on which their own lives and the lives of their children may every day depend  i saywomen as well as men i should have said women rather than men  for it is the women who have the ordering of the household the bringing up of the children the women who bide at home while the men are away it may be at the other end of the earth  and if any say as they have a right to saybut these are subjects which can hardly be taught to young women in public lectures i rejoinof course not unless they are taught by womenby women of course duly educated and legally qualified let such teach to women what every woman ought to know and what her parents will very properly object to her hearing from almost any man  this is one of the main reasons why i have for twenty years past advocated the training of women for the medical profession and one which countervails in my mind all possible objections to such a movement  and now thank god we are seeing the common sense of great britain and indeed of every civilised nation gradually coming round to that which seemed to me when i first conceived of it a dream too chimerical to be cherished save in secretthe restoring woman to her natural share in that sacred office of healer which she held in the middle ages and from which she was thrust out during the sixteenth century  i am most happy to see for instance that the national health society 3 which i earnestly recommend to the attention of my readers announces a course of lectures for ladies on elementary physiology and hygiene by a lady to which i am also most happy to see governesses are admitted at halffees  alas how much misery disease and even death might have been prevented had governesses been taught such matters thirty years ago i for one know too well  may the day soon come when there will be educated women enough to give such lectures throughout these realms to rich as well as poorfor the rich strange to say need them often as much as the poor doand that we may live to see in every great town health classes for women as well as for men sending forth year by year more young women and young men taught not only to take care of themselves and of their families but to exercise moral influence over their fellowcitizens as champions in the battle against dirt and drunkenness disease and death  there may be those who would answeror rather there would certainly have been those who would have so answered thirty years ago before the socalled materialism of advanced science had taught us some practical wisdom about education and reminded people that they have bodies as well as minds and soulsyou say we are likely to grow weaklier unhealthier  and if it were so what matter  mind makes the man not body  we do not want our children to be stupid giants and bravos but clever able highly educated however weakly providence or the laws of nature may have chosen to make them  let them overstrain their brains a little let them contract their chests and injure their digestion and their eyesight by sitting at desks poring over books  intellect is what we want  intellect makes money  intellect makes the world  we would rather see our son a genius than a mere athlete well  and so would i  but what if intellect alone does not even make money save as messrs dodson and fogg sampson brass and montagu tigg were wont to make it unless backed by an able enduring healthy physique such as i have seen almost without exception in those successful men of business whom i have had the honour and the pleasure of knowing  what if intellect or what is now called intellect did not make the world or the smallest wheel or cog of it  what if for want of obeying the laws of nature parents bred up neither a genius nor an athlete but only an incapable unhappy personage with a huge upright forehead like that of a byzantine greek filled with some sort of pap instead of brains and tempted alternately to fanaticism and strong drink we must in the great majority of cases have the corpus sanem if we want the mentem sanem and healthy bodies are the only trustworthy organs for healthy minds  which is cause and which is effect i shall not stay to debate here  but wherever we find a population generally weakly stunted scrofulous we find in them a corresponding type of brain which cannot be trusted to do good work which is capable more or less of madness whether solitary or epidemic  it may be very active it may be very quick at catching at new and grand ideasall the more quick perhaps on account of its own secret malaise and selfdiscontent but it will be irritable spasmodic hysterical  it will be apt to mistake capacity of talk for capacity of action excitement for earnestness virulence for force and too often cruelty for justice  it will lose manful independence individuality originality and when men act they will act from the consciousness of personal weakness like sheep rushing over a hedge leaning against each other exhorting each other to be brave and swaying about in mobs and masses  these were the intellectual weaknesses which as i read history followed on physical degradation in imperial rome in alexandria in byzantium  have we not seen them reappear under fearful forms in paris but the other day  i do not blame i do not judge  my theory which i hold and shall hold to be fairly founded on a wide induction forbids me to blame and to judge because it tells me that these defects are mainly physical that those who exhibit them are mainly to be pitied as victims of the sins or ignorance of their forefathers  but it tells me too that those who professing to be educated men and therefore bound to know better treat these physical phenomena as spiritual healthy and praiseworthy who even exasperate them that they may make capital out of the weaknesses of fallen man are the most contemptible and yet the most dangerous of public enemies let them cloak their quackery under whatsoever patriotic or scientific or even sacred words  there are those again honest kindly sensible practical men many of them men whom i have no wish to offend whom i had rather ask to teach me some of their own experience and common sense which has learned to discern like good statesmen not only what ought to be done but what can be donethere are those i say who would sooner see this whole question let alone  their feeling as far as i can analyse it seems to be that the evils of which i have been complaining are on the whole inevitable or if not that we can mend so very little of them that it is wisest to leave them alone altogether lest like certain sewers the more you stir them the more they smell  they fear lest we should unsettle the minds of the many for whom these evils will never be mended lest we make them discontented discontented with their houses their occupations their food their whole social arrangements and all in vain  i should answer in all courtesy and humilityfor i sympathise deeply with such men and women and respect them deeply likewise but are not people discontented already from the lowest to the highest  and ought a man in such a piecemeal foolish greedy sinful world as this is and always has been to be anything but discontented  if he thinks that things are going all right must he not have a most beggarly conception of what going right means and if things are not going right can it be anything but good for him to see that they are not going right  can truth and fact harm any human being  i shall not believe so as long as i have a bible wherein to believe  for my part i should like to make every man woman and child whom i meet discontented with themselves even as i am discontented with myself  i should like to awaken in them about their physical their intellectual their moral condition that divine discontent which is the parent first of upward aspiration and then of selfcontrol thought effort to fulfil that aspiration even in part  for to be discontented with the divine discontent and to be ashamed with the noble shame is the very germ and first upgrowth of all virtue  men begin at first as boys begin when they grumble at their school and their schoolmasters to lay the blame on others to be discontented with their circumstancesthe things which stand around them and to cry oh that i had this  oh that i had that  but by that way no deliverance lies  that discontent only ends in revolt and rebellion social or political and that again still in the same worship of circumstancesbut this time desperatewhich ends let it disguise itself under what fine names it will in what the old greeks called a tyranny in whichas in the spanish republics of america and in france more than onceall have become the voluntary slaves of one man because each man fancies that the one man can improve his circumstances for him  but the wise man will learn like epictetus the heroic slave the slave of epaphroditus neros minionand in what baser and uglier circumstances could human being find himselfto find out the secret of being truly free namely to be discontented with no man and no thing save himself  to say notoh that i had this and that but oh that i were this and that  then by gods help and that heroic slave heathen though he was believed and trusted in gods helpi will make myself that which god has shown me that i ought to be and can be  ten thousand a year or ten million a year as epictetus saw full well cannot mend that vulgar discontent with circumstances which he had feltand who with more rightand conquered and despised  for that is the discontent of children wanting always more holidays and more sweets  but i wish my readers to have and to cherish the discontent of men and women  therefore i would make men and women discontented with the divine and wholesome discontent at their own physical frame and at that of their children  i would accustom their eyes to those precious heirlooms of the human race the statues of the old greeks to their tender grandeur their chaste healthfulness their unconscious because perfect might  and saythere these are tokens to you and to all generations yet unborn of what man could be once of what he can be again if he will obey those laws of nature which are the voice of god  i would make them discontented with the ugliness and closeness of their dwellings i would make them discontented with the fashion of their garments and still more just now the women of all ranks with the fashion of theirs and with everything around them which they have the power of improving if it be at all ungraceful superfluous tawdry ridiculous unwholesome  i would make them discontented with what they call their education and say to themyou call the three royal rs education  they are not education  no more is the knowledge which would enable you to take the highest prizes given by the society of arts or any other body  they are not education  they are only instruction a necessary groundwork in an age like this for making practical use of your education  but not the education itself  and if they asked me what then education meant i should point them first i think to noble old lillys noble old euphues of three hundred years ago and ask them to consider what it says about education and especially this passage concerning that mere knowledge which is nowadays strangely miscalled education  there are two principal and peculiar gifts in the nature of man knowledge and reason  the onethat is reasoncommandeth and the otherthat is knowledgeobeyeth  these things neither the whirling wheel of fortune can change nor the deceitful cavillings of worldlings separate neither sickness abate nor age abolish and next i should point them to those pages in mr gladstones juventus mundi where he describes the ideal training of a greek youth in homers days and saythere  that is an education fit for a really civilised man even though he never saw a book in his life the full proportionate harmonious educingthat is bringing out and developingof all the faculties of his body mind and heart till he becomes at once a reverent yet self assured a graceful and yet a valiant an able and yet an eloquent personage  and if any should say to mebut what has this to do with science  homers greeks knew no science i should rejoinbut they had preeminently above all ancient races which we know the scientific instinct the teachableness and modesty the clear eye and quick ear the hearty reverence for fact and nature and for the human body and mind and spirit for human nature in a word in its completeness as the highest fact upon this earth therefore they became in after years not only the great colonisers and the great civilisers of the old worldthe most practical people i hold which the world ever saw but the parents of all sound physics as well as of all sound metaphysics their very religion in spite of its imperfections helped forward their education not in spite of but by means of that anthropomorphism which we sometimes too hastily decry  as mr gladstone says  as regarded all other functions of our nature outside the domain of the life to godwardall those functions which are summed up in what st paul calls the flesh and the mind the psychic and bodily life the tendency of the system was to exalt the human element by proposing a model of beauty strength and wisdom in all their combinations so elevated that the effort to attain them required a continual upward strain  it made divinity attainable and thus it effectually directed the thought and aim of man   along the line of limitless desires   such a scheme of religion though failing grossly in the government of the passions and in upholding the standard of moral duties tended powerfully to produce a lofty selfrespect and a large free and varied conception of humanity  it incorporated itself in schemes of notable discipline for mind and body indeed of a lifelong education and these habits of mind and action had their marked results to omit many other greatnesses in a philosophy literature and art which remain to this day unrivalled or unsurpassed  so much those old greeks did for their own education without science and without christianity  we who have both  what might we not do if we would be true to our advantages and to ourselves    the two breaths 4    ladiesi have been honoured by a second invitation to address you and i dare not refuse it because it gives me an opportunity of speaking on a matter knowledge and ignorance about which may seriously affect your health and happiness and that of the children with whom you may have to do  i must apologise if i say many things which are well known to many persons in this room they ought to be well known to all  but it is generally best to assume total ignorance in ones hearers and to begin from the beginning  i shall try to be as simple as possible to trouble you as little as possible with scientific terms to be practical and at the same time if possible interesting  i should wish to call this lecture the two breaths not merely the breath and for this reason  every time you breathe you breathe two different breaths you take in one you give out another  the composition of those two breaths is different their effects are different  the breath which has been breathed out must not be breathed in again  to tell you why it must not would lead me into anatomical details not quite in place here as yet though the day will come i trust when every woman entrusted with the care of children will be expected to know something about them  but this i may say  those who habitually take in fresh breath will probably grow up large strong ruddy cheerful active clearheaded fit for their work  those who habitually take in the breath which has been breathed out by themselves or any other living creature will certainly grow up if they grow up at all small weak pale nervous depressed unfit for work and tempted continually to resort to stimulants and become drunkards  if you want to see how different the breath breathed out is from the breath taken in you have only to try a somewhat cruel experiment but one which people too often try upon themselves their children and their workpeople  if you take any small animal with lungs like your owna mouse for instanceand force it to breathe no air but what you have breathed already if you put it in a close box and while you take in breath from the outer air send out your breath through a tube into that box the animal will soon faint  if you go on long with this process it will die  take a second instance which i beg to press most seriously on the notice of mothers governesses and nurses  if you allow a child to get into the habit of sleeping with its head under the bed clothes and thereby breathing its own breath over and over again that child will assuredly grow pale weak and ill  medical men have cases on record of scrofula appearing in children previously healthy which could only be accounted for from this habit and which ceased when the habit stopped  let me again entreat your attention to this undoubted fact  take another instance which is only too common  if you are in a crowded room with plenty of fire and lights and company doors and windows all shut tight how often you feel faintso faint that you may require smellingsalts or some other stimulant  the cause of your faintness is just the same as that of the mouses fainting in the box you and your friends and as i shall show you presently the fire and the candles likewise having been all breathing each others breaths over and over again till the air has become unfit to support life  you are doing your best to enact over again the highland tragedy of which sir james simpson tells in his lectures to the workingclasses of edinburgh when at a christmas meeting thirtysix persons danced all night in a small room with a low ceiling keeping the doors and windows shut  the atmosphere of the room was noxious beyond description and the effect was that seven of the party were soon after seized with typhus fever of which two died  you are inflicting on yourselves the torments of the poor dog who is kept at the grotto del cane near naples to be stupefied for the amusement of visitors by the carbonic acid gas of the grotto and brought to life again by being dragged into the fresh air nay you are inflicting upon yourselves the torments of the famous black hole of calcutta and if there was no chimney in the room by which some fresh air could enter the candles would soon burn blue as they do you know when ghosts appear your brains become disturbed and you yourselves ran the risk of becoming ghosts and the candles of actually going out  of this last fact there is no doubt for if instead of putting a mouse into the box you will put a lighted candle and breathe into the tube as before however gently you will in a short time put the candle out  now how is this  first what is the difference between the breath you take in and the breath you give out  and next why has it a similar effect on animal life and a lighted candle  the difference is this  the breath which you take in is or ought to be pure air composed on the whole of oxygen and nitrogen with a minute portion of carbonic acid  the breath which you give out is an impure air to which has been added among other matters which will not support life an excess of carbonic acid  that this is the fact you can prove for yourselves by a simple experiment  get a little limewater at the chemists and breathe into it through a glass tube your breath will at once make the limewater milky  the carbonic acid of your breath has laid hold of the lime and made it visible as white carbonate of limein plain english as common chalk  now i do not wish as i said to load your memories with scientific terms  but i beseech you to remember at least these two oxygen gas and carbonic acid gas and to remember that as surely as oxygen feeds the fire of life so surely does carbonic acid put it out  i say the fire of life  in that expression lies the answer to our second question  why does our breath produce a similar effect upon the mouse and the lighted candle  every one of us is as it were a living fire  were we not how could we be always warmer than the air outside us  there is a process going on perpetually in each of us similar to that by which coals are burnt in the fire oil in a lamp wax in a candle and the earth itself in a volcano  to keep each of those fires alight oxygen is needed and the products of combustion as they are called are more or less the same in each casecarbonic acid and steam  these facts justify the expression i just made use ofwhich may have seemed to some of you fantasticalthat the fire and the candles in the crowded room were breathing the same breath as you were  it is but too true  an average fire in the grate requires to keep it burning as much oxygen as several human beings do each candle or lamp must have its share of oxygen likewise and that a very considerable one and an average gasburnerpray attend to this you who live in rooms lighted with gasconsumes as much oxygen as several candles  all alike are making carbonic acid  the carbonic acid of the fire happily escapes up the chimney in the smoke  but the carbonic acid from the human beings and the candles remains to poison the room unless it be ventilated  now i think you may understand one of the simplest and yet most terrible cases of want of ventilationdeath by the fumes of charcoal  a human being shut up in a room of which every crack is closed with a pan of burning charcoal falls asleep never to wake again  his inward fire is competing with the fire of charcoal for the oxygen of the room both are making carbonic acid out of it  but the charcoal being the stronger of the two gets all the oxygen to itself and leaves the human being nothing to inhale but the carbonic acid which it has made  the human being being the weaker dies first  but the charcoal dies also  when it has exhausted all the oxygen of the room it cools goes out and is found in the morning halfconsumed beside its victim  if you put a giant or an elephant i should conceive into that room instead of a human being the case would be reversed for a time the elephant would put out the burning charcoal by the carbonic acid from his mighty lungs and then when he had exhausted all the air in the room die likewise of his own carbonic acid  now i think we may see what ventilation means and why it is needed  ventilation means simply letting out the foul air and letting in the fresh air letting out the air which has been breathed by men or by candles and letting in the air which has not  to understand how to do that we must remember a most simple chemical law that a gas as it is warmed expands and therefore becomes lighter as it cools it contracts and becomes heavier  now the carbonic acid in the breath which comes out of our mouth is warm lighter than the air and rises to the ceiling and therefore in any unventilated room full of people there is a layer of foul air along the ceiling  you might soon test that for yourselves if you could mount a ladder and put your heads there aloft  you do test it for yourselves when you sit in the galleries of churches and theatres where the air is palpably more foul and therefore more injurious than down below  where again workpeople are employed in a crowded house of many storeys the health of those who work on the upper floors always suffers most  in the old monkeyhouse of the zoological gardens when the cages were on the old plan tier upon tier the poor little fellows in the uppermost tierso i have been toldalways died first of the monkeys constitutional complaint consumption simply from breathing the warm breath of their friends below  but since the cages have been altered and made to range side by side from top to bottom consumptioni understandhas vastly diminished among them  the first question in ventilation therefore is to get this carbonic acid safe out of the room while it is warm and light and close to the ceiling for if you do not this happens  the carbonic acid gas cools and becomes heavier for carbonic acid at the same temperature as common air is so much heavier than common air that you may actuallyif you are handy enoughturn it from one vessel to another and pour out for your enemy a glass of invisible poison  so down to the floor this heavy carbonic acid comes and lies along it just as it lies often in the bottom of old wells or old brewers vats as a stratum of poison killing occasionally the men who descend into it  hence as foolish a practice as i know is that of sleeping on the floor for towards the small hours when the room gets cold the sleeper on the floor is breathing carbonic acid  and here one word to those ladies who interest themselves with the poor  the poor are too apt in times of distress to pawn their bedsteads and keep their beds  never if you have influence let that happen  keep the bedstead whatever else may go to save the sleeper from the carbonic acid on the floor  how then shall we get rid of the foul air at the top of the room  after all that has been written and tried on ventilation i know no simpler method than putting into the chimney one of arnotts ventilators which may be bought and fixed for a few shillings always remembering that it must be fixed into the chimney as near the ceiling as possible  i can speak of these ventilators from twentyfive years experience  living in a house with low ceilings liable to become overcharged with carbonic acid which produces sleepiness in the evening i have found that these ventilators keep the air fresh and pure and i consider the presence of one of these ventilators in a room more valuable than three or four feet additional height of ceiling  i have found too that their working proves how necessary they are from this simple fact  you would suppose that as the ventilator opens freely into the chimney the smoke would be blown down through it in high winds and blacken the ceiling  but this is just what does not happen  if the ventilator be at all properly poised so as to shut with a violent gust of wind it will at all other moments keep itself permanently open proving thereby that there is an updraught of heated air continually escaping from the ceiling up the chimney  another very simple method of ventilation is employed in those excellent cottages which her majesty has built for her labourers round windsor  over each door a sheet of perforated zinc some eighteen inches square is fixed allowing the foul air to escape into the passage and in the ceiling of the passage a similar sheet of zinc allowing it to escape into the roof  fresh air meanwhile should be obtained from outside by piercing the windows or otherwise  and here let me give one hint to all builders of houses  if possible let bedroom windows open at the top as well as at the bottom  let me impress the necessity of using some such contrivances not only on parents and educators but on those who employ workpeople and above all on those who employ young women in shops or in work rooms  what their condition may be in this city i know not but most painful it has been to me in other places when passing through warehouses or workrooms to see the pale sodden and as the french would say etiolated countenances of the girls who were passing the greater part of the day in them and painful also to breathe an atmosphere of which habit had alas made them unconscious but which to one coming out of the open air was altogether noxious and shocking also for it was fostering the seeds of death not only in the present but future generations  why should this be  everyone will agree that good ventilation is necessary in a hospital because people cannot get well without fresh air  do they not see that by the same reasoning good ventilation is necessary everywhere because people cannot remain well without fresh air  let me entreat those who employ women in workrooms if they have no time to read through such books as dr andrew combes physiology applied to health and education and madame de wahls practical hints on the moral mental and physical training of girls to procure certain tracts published by messrs jarrold paternoster row for the ladies sanitary association especially one which bears on this subject  the blackhole in our own bedrooms dr lankesters school manual of health or a manual on ventilation published by the metropolitan working classes association for the improvement of public health  i look forwardi say it openlyto some period of higher civilisation when the acts of parliament for the ventilation of factories and workshops shall be largely extended and made far more stringent when officers of public health shall be empowered to enforce the ventilation of every room in which persons are employed for hire  and empowered also to demand a proper system of ventilation for every new house whether in country or in town to that i believe we must come  but i had sooner far see these improvements carried out as befits the citizens of a free country in the spirit of the gospel rather than in that of the law carried out not compulsorily and from fear of fines but voluntarily from a sense of duty honour and humanity  i appeal therefore to the good feeling of all whom it may concern whether the health of those whom they employ and therefore the supply of fresh air which they absolutely need are not matters for which they are not more or less responsible to their country and their god  and if any excellent person of the old school should answer me why make all this fuss about ventilation  our forefathers got on very well without iti must answer that begging their pardons our ancestors did nothing of the kind  our ancestors got on usually very ill in these matters  and when they got on well it was because they had good ventilation in spite of themselves  first  they got on very ill  to quote a few remarkable instances of longevity or to tell me that men were larger and stronger on the average in old times is to yield to the old fallacy of fancying that savages were peculiarly healthy because those who were seen were active and strong  the simple answer is that the strong alone survived while the majority died from the severity of the training  savages do not increase in number and our ancestors increased but very slowly for many centuries  i am not going to disgust my audience with statistics of disease  but knowing something as i happen to do of the social state and of the health of the middle and elizabethan ages i have no hesitation in saying that the average of disease and death was far greater then than it is now  epidemics of many kinds typhus ague plagueall diseases which were caused more or less by bad airdevastated this land and europe in those days with a horrible intensity to which even the choleras of our times are mild  the back streets the hospitals the gaols the barracks the camps every place in which any large number of persons congregated were so many nests of pestilence engendered by uncleanliness which defiled alike the water which was drunk and the air which was breathed and as a single fact of which the tables of insurance companies assure us the average of human life in england has increased twentyfive per cent since the reign of george i owing simply to our more rational and cleanly habits of life  but secondly i said that when our ancestors got on well they did so because they got ventilation in spite of themselves  luckily for them their houses were illbuilt their doors and windows would not shut  they had latticewindowed houses too to live in one of which as i can testify from long experience is as thoroughly ventilating as living in a lantern with the horn broken out  it was because their houses were full of draughts and still more in the early middle age because they had no glass and stopped out the air only by a shutter at night that they sought for shelter rather than for fresh air of which they sometimes had too much and to escape the wind built their houses in holes such as that in which the old city of winchester stands  shelter i believe as much as the desire to be near fish in lent and to occupy the rich alluvium of the valleys made the monks of old england choose the riverbanks for the sites of their abbeys they made a mistake therein which like most mistakes did not go unpunished  these low situations especially while the forests were yet thick on the hills around were the perennial haunts of fever and ague produced by subtle vegetable poisons carried in the carbonic acid given off by rotten vegetation  so there again they fell in with mans old enemybad air  still as long as the doors and windows did not shut some free circulation of air remained  but now our doors and windows shut only too tight we have plateglass instead of lattices and we have replaced the draughty and smoky but really wholesome open chimney with its wide corners and settles by narrow registers and even by stoves we have done all we can in fact to seal ourselves up hermetically from the outer air and to breath our own breaths over and over again and we pay the penalty of it in a thousand ways unknown to our ancestors through whose rooms all the winds of heaven whistled and who were glad enough to shelter themselves from draughts in the sittingroom by the high screen round the fire and in the sleepingroom by the thick curtains of the four post bedstead which is now rapidly disappearing before a higher civilisation  we therefore absolutely require to make for ourselves the very ventilation from which our ancestors tried to escape  but ladies there is an old and true proverb that you may bring a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink  and in like wise it is too true that you may bring people to the fresh air but you cannot make them breath it  their own folly or the folly of their parents and educators prevents their lungs being duly filled and duly emptied  therefore the blood is not duly oxygenated and the whole system goes wrong  paleness weakness consumption scrofula and too many other ailments are the consequences of illfilled lungs  for without wellfilled lungs robust health is impossible  and if anyone shall answer  we do not want robust health so much as intellectual attainment the mortal body being the lower organ must take its chance and be even sacrificed if need be to the higher organthe immortal mindto such i reply you cannot do it  the laws of nature which are the express will of god laugh such attempts to scorn  every organ of the body is formed out of the blood and if the blood be vitiated every organ suffers in proportion to its delicacy and the brain being the most delicate and highly specialised of all organs suffers most of all and soonest of all as everyone knows who has tried to work his brain when his digestion was the least out of order nay the very morals will suffer  from illfilled lungs which signify illrepaired blood arise year by year an amount not merely of disease but of folly temper laziness intemperance madness and let me tell you fairly crimethe sum of which will never be known till that great day when men shall be called to account for all deeds done in the body whether they be good or evil  i must refer you on this subject again to andrew combes physiology especially chapters iv and vii and also to chapter x of madame de wahls excellent book  i will only say this shortly that the three most common causes of illfilled lungs in children and in young ladies are stillness silence and stays  first stillness a sedentary life and want of exercise  a girl is kept for hours sitting on a form writing or reading to do which she must lean forward and if her schoolmistress cruelly attempts to make her sit upright and thereby keep the spine in an attitude for which nature did not intend it she is thereby doing her best to bring on that disease so fearfully common in girls schools lateral curvature of the spine  but practically the girl will stoop forward  and what happens  the lower ribs are pressed into the body thereby displacing more or less something inside the diaphragm in the meantime which is the very bellows of the lungs remains loose the lungs are never properly filled or emptied and an excess of carbonic acid accumulates at the bottom of them  what follows  frequent sighing to get rid of it heaviness of head depression of the whole nervous system under the influence of the poison of the lungs and when the poor child gets up from her weary work what is the first thing she probably does  she lifts up her chest stretches yawns and breathes deeplynatures voice natures instinctive cure which is probably regarded as ungraceful as what is called lolling is as if sitting upright was not an attitude in itself essentially ungraceful and such as no artist would care to draw  as if lolling which means putting the body in the attitude of the most perfect ease compatible with a fullyexpanded chest was not in itself essentially graceful and to be seen in every reposing figure in greek basreliefs and vases graceful and like all graceful actions healthful at the same time  the only tolerably wholesome attitude of repose which i see allowed in average schoolrooms is lying on the back on the floor or on a sloping board in which case the lungs must be fully expanded  but even so a pillow or some equivalent ought to be placed under the small of the back  or the spine will be strained at its very weakest point  i now go on to the second mistakeenforced silence  moderate reading aloud is good  but where there is any tendency to irritability of throat or lungs too much moderation cannot be used  you may as well try to cure a diseased lung by working it as to cure a lame horse by galloping him  but where the breathing organs are of average health let it be said once and for all that children and young people cannot make too much noise  the parents who cannot bear the noise of their children have no right to have brought them into the world  the schoolmistress who enforces silence on her pupils is committingunintentionally no doubt but still committingan offence against reason worthy only of a convent  every shout every burst of laughter every songnay in the case of infants as physiologists well know every moderate fit of cryingconduces to health by rapidly filling and emptying the lung and changing the blood more rapidly from black to red that is from death to life  andrew combe tells a story of a large charity school in which the young girls were for the sake of their health shut up in the hall and schoolroom during play hours from november till march and no romping or noise allowed the natural consequences were the great majority of them fell ill and i am afraid that a great deal of illness has been from time to time contracted in certain schoolrooms simply through this one cause of enforced silence  some cause or other there must be for the amount of illhealth and weakliness which prevails especially among girls of the middle classes in towns who have not poor things the opportunities which richer girls have of keeping themselves in strong health by riding skating archery that last quite an admirable exercise for the chest and lungs and far preferable to croquet which involves too much unwholesome stoopingeven a game of ball if milliners and shopgirls had room to indulge in one after their sedentary work might bring fresh spirits to many a heart and fresh colour to many a cheek  i spoke just now of the greeks  i suppose you will all allow that the greeks were as far as we know the most beautiful race which the world ever saw  every educated man knows that they were also the cleverest of all races and next to his bible thanks god for greek literature  now these people had made physical as well as intellectual education a science as well as a study  their women practised graceful and in some cases even athletic exercises  they developed by a free and healthy life those figures which remain everlasting and unapproachable models of human beauty  butto come to my third pointthey wore no stays  the first mention of stays that i have ever found is in the letters of dear old synesius bishop of cyrene on the greek coast of africa about four hundred years after the christian era  he tells us how when he was shipwrecked on a remote part of the coast and he and the rest of the passengers were starving on cockles and limpets there was among them a slave girl out of the far east who had a pinched waspwaist such as you may see on the old hindoo sculptures and such as you may see in any street in a british town  and when the greek ladies of the neighbourhood found her out they sent for her from house to house to behold with astonishment and laughter this new and prodigious waist with which it seemed to them it was impossible for a human being to breathe or live and they petted the poor girl and fed her as they might a dwarf or a giantess till she got quite fat and comfortable while her owners had not enough to eat  so strange and ridiculous seemed our present fashion to the descendants of those who centuries before had imagined because they had seen living and moving those glorious statues which we pretend to admire but refuse to imitate  it seems to me that a few centuries hence when mankind has learnt to fear god more and therefore to obey more strictly those laws of nature and of science which are the will of godit seems to me i say that in those days the present fashion of tight lacing will be looked back upon as a contemptible and barbarous superstition denoting a very low level of civilisation in the peoples which have practised it  that for generations past women should have been in the habitnot to please men who do not care about the matter as a point of beautybut simply to vie with each other in obedience to something called fashionthat they should i say have been in the habit of deliberately crushing that part of the body which should be specially left free contracting and displacing their lungs their heart and all the most vital and important organs and entailing thereby disease not only on themselves but on their children after them that for forty years past physicians should have been telling them of the folly of what they have been doing and that they should as yet in the great majority of cases not only turn a deaf ear to all warnings but actually deny the offence of which one glance of the physician or the sculptor who know what shape the human body ought to be brings them in guiltythis i say is an instance ofwhat shall i call itwhich deserves at once the lash not merely of the satirist but of any theologian who really believes that god made the physical universe  let me i pray you appeal to your common sense for a moment  when any one chooses a horse or a dog whether for strength for speed or for any other useful purpose the first thing almost to be looked at is the girth round the ribs the room for heart and lungs  exactly in proportion to that will be the animals general healthiness power of endurance and value in many other ways  if you will look at eminent lawyers and famous orators who have attained a healthy old age you will see that in every case they are men like the late lord palmerston and others whom i could mention of remarkable size not merely in the upper but in the lower part of the chest men who had therefore a peculiar power of using the diaphragm to fill and to clear the lungs and therefore to oxygenate the blood of the whole body  now it is just these lower ribs across which the diaphragm is stretched like the head of a drum which stays contract to a minimum  if you advised owners of horses and hounds to put their horses or their hounds into stays and lace them up tight in order to increase their beauty you would receive i doubt not a very courteous but certainly a very decided refusal to do that which would spoil not merely the animals themselves but the whole stud or the whole kennel for years to come  and if you advised an orator to put himself into tight stays he no doubt again would give a courteous answer but he would replyif he was a really educated manthat to comply with your request would involve his giving up public work under the probable penalty of being dead within the twelvemonth  and how much work of every kind intellectual as well as physical is spoiled or hindered how many deaths occur from consumption and other complaints which are the result of this habit of tight lacing is known partly to the medical men who lift up their voices in vain and known fully to him who will not interfere with the least of his own physical laws to save human beings from the consequences of their own wilful folly  and nowto end this lecture with more pleasing thoughtswhat becomes of this breath which passes from your lips  is it merely harmful merely waste  god forbid  god has forbidden that anything should be merely harmful or merely waste in this so wise and wellmade world  the carbonic acid which passes from your lips at every breathay even that which oozes from the volcano crater when the eruption is pastis a precious boon to thousands of things of which you have daily need  indeed there is a sort of hint at physical truth in the old fairy tale of the girl from whose lips as she spoke fell pearls and diamonds for the carbonic acid of your breath may help hereafter to make the pure carbonate of lime of a pearl or the still purer carbon of a diamond  nay it may goin such a world of transformations do we liveto make atoms of coal strata which after being buried for ages beneath deep seas shall be upheaved in continents which are yet unborn and there be burnt for the use of a future race of men and resolved into their original elements  coal wise men tell us is on the whole breath and sunlight the breath of living creatures who have lived in the vast swamps and forests of some primeval world and the sunlight which transmuted that breath into the leaves and stems of trees magically locked up for ages in that black stone to become when it is burnt at last light and carbonic acid as it was at first  for though you must not breathe your breath again you may at least eat your breath if you will allow the sun to transmute it for you into vegetables or you may enjoy its fragrance and its colour in the shape of a lily or a rose  when you walk in a sunlit garden every word you speak every breath you breathe is feeding the plants and flowers around  the delicate surface of the green leaves absorbs the carbonic acid and parts it into its elements retaining the carbon to make woody fibre and courteously returning you the oxygen to mingle with the fresh air and be inhaled by your lungs once more  thus do you feed the plants just as the plants feed you  while the great lifegiving sun feeds both and the geranium standing in the sick childs window does not merely rejoice his eye and mind by its beauty and freshness but repays honestly the trouble spent on it absorbing the breath which the child needs not and giving to him the breath which he needs  so are the services of all things constituted according to a divine and wonderful order and knit together in mutual dependence and mutual helpfulnessa fact to be remembered with hope and comfort  but also with awe and fear  for as in that which is above nature so in nature itself he that breaks one physical law is guilty of all  the whole universe as it were takes up arms against him and all nature with her numberless and unseen powers is ready to avenge herself on him and on his children after him he knows not when nor where  he on the other hand who obeys the laws of nature with his whole heart and mind will find all things working together to him for good  he is at peace with the physical universe  he is helped and befriended alike by the sun above his head and the dust beneath his feet because he is obeying the will and mind of him who made sun and dust and all things and who has given them a law which cannot be broken    thrift 5    ladiesi have chosen for the title of this lecture a practical and prosaic word because i intend the lecture itself to be as practical and prosaic as i can make it without becoming altogether dull  the question of the better or worse education of women is one far too important for vague sentiment wild aspirations or utopian dreams  it is a practical question on which depends not merely money or comfort but too often health and life as the consequences of a good education or disease and deathi know too well of what i speakas the consequences of a bad one  i beg you therefore to put out of your minds at the outset any fancy that i wish for a social revolution in the position of women or that i wish to see them educated by exactly the same methods and in exactly the same subjects as men  british lads on an average are far too illtaught still in spite of all recent improvements for me to wish that british girls should be taught in the same way  moreover whatever defects there may have beenand defects there must be in all things humanin the past education of british women it has been most certainly a splendid moral success  it has made by the grace of god british women the best wives mothers daughters sisters aunts that the world as far as i can discover has yet seen  let those who will sneer at the women of england  we who have to do the work and to fight the battle of life know the inspiration which we derive from their virtue their counsel their tenderness andbut too oftenfrom their compassion and their forgiveness  there is i doubt not still left in england many a man with chivalry and patriotism enough to challenge the world to show so perfect a specimen of humanity as a cultivated british woman  but just because a cultivated british woman is so perfect a personage therefore i wish to see all british women cultivated because the womanhood of england is so precious a treasure i wish to see none of it wasted  it is an invaluable capital or material out of which the greatest possible profit to the nation must be made  and that can only be done by thrift and that again can only be attained by knowledge  consider that word thrift  if you will look at dr johnsons dictionary or if you know your shakespeare you will see that thrift signified originally profits gain riches gottenin a word the marks of a mans thriving  how then did the word thrift get to mean parsimony frugality the opposite of waste  just in the same way as economywhich first of course meant the management of a householdgot to mean also the opposite of waste  it was found that in commerce in husbandry in any process in fact men throve in proportion as they saved their capital their material their force  now this is a great law which runs through life one of those laws of naturecall them rather laws of godwhich apply not merely to political economy to commerce and to mechanics but to physiology to society to the intellect to the heart of every person in this room  the secret of thriving is thrift saving of force to get as much work as possible done with the least expenditure of power the least jar and obstruction least wear and tear  and the secret of thrift is knowledge  in proportion as you know the laws and nature of a subject you will be able to work at it easily surely rapidly successfully instead of wasting your money or your energies in mistaken schemes irregular efforts which end in disappointment and exhaustion  the secret of thrift i say is knowledge  the more you know the more you can save yourself and that which belongs to you and can do more work with less effort  a knowledge of the laws of commercial credit we all know saves capital enabling a less capital to do the work of a greater knowledge of the electric telegraph saves time knowledge of writing saves human speech and locomotion knowledge of domestic economy saves income knowledge of sanitary laws saves health and life knowledge of the laws of the intellect saves wear and tear of brain and knowledge of the laws of the spiritwhat does it not save  a welleducated moral sense a wellregulated character saves from idleness and ennui alternating with sentimentality and excitement those tenderer emotions those deeper passions those nobler aspirations of humanity which are the heritage of the woman far more than of the man and which are potent in her for evil or for good in proportion as they are left to run wild and undisciplined or are trained and developed into graceful harmonious selfrestraining strength beautiful in themselves and a blessing to all who come under their influence  what therefore i recommend to ladies in this lecture is thrift thrift of themselves and of their own powers  and knowledge as the parent of thrift  and because it is well to begin with the lower applications of thrift and to work up to the higher i am much pleased to hear that the first course of the proposed lectures to women in this place will be one on domestic economy  i presume that the learned gentleman who will deliver these lectures will be the last to mean by that term the mere saving of money that he will tell you asbeing a germanhe will have good reason to know that the young lady who learns thrift in domestic economy is also learning thrift of the very highest faculties of her immortal spirit  he will tell you i doubt not for he must knowhow you may see in germany young ladies living in what we more luxurious british would consider something like poverty cooking waiting at table and performing many a household office which would be here considered menial and yet finding time for a cultivation of the intellect which is unfortunately too rare in great britain  the truth is that we british are too wealthy  we make money if not too rapidly for the good of the nation at large yet too rapidly i fear for the good of the daughters of those who make it  their temptationi do not of course say they all yield to itbut their temptation is to waste of the very simplesti had almost said if i may be pardoned the expression of the most barbarickind to an oriental waste of money and waste of time to a fondness for mere finery pardonable enough but still a waste and to the mistaken fancy that it is the mark of a lady to sit idle and let servants do everything for her  but it is not of this sort of waste of which i wish to speak to day  i only mention the matter in passing to show that high intellectual culture is not incompatible with the performance of homely household duties and that the moral success of which i spoke just now need not be injured any more than it is in germany by intellectual success likewise  i trust that these words may reassure those parents if any such there be here who may fear that these lectures will withdraw women from their existing sphere of interest and activity  that they should entertain such a fear is not surprising after the extravagant opinions and schemes which have been lately broached in various quarters  the programme to these lectures expressly disclaims any such intentions and i as a husband and a father expressly disclaim any such intention likewise  to fit women for the more enlightened performance of their special duties to help them towards learning how to do better what we doubt not many of them are already doing well is i honestly believe the only object of the promoters of this scheme  let us see now how some of these special duties can be better performed by help of a little enlightenment as to the laws which regulate them  now no man will denycertainly no man who is past fortyfive and whose digestion is beginning to quail before the lumps of beef and mutton which are the boast of a british kitchen and to prefer with justice shallow and i presume sir john falstaff also any pretty little tiny kickshawsno man i say who has reached that age but will feel it a practical comfort to him to know that the young ladies of his family are at all events good cooks and understand as the french do thrift in the matter of food  neither will any parent who wishes naturally enough that his daughters should cost him as little as possible and wishes naturally enough also that they should be as well dressed as possible deny that it would be a good thing for them to be practical milliners and mantuamakers and by making their own clothes gracefully and well exercise thrift in clothing  but beside this thrift in clothing i am not alone i believe in wishing for some thrift in the energy which produces it  labour misapplied you will agree is labour wasted and as dress i presume is intended to adorn the person of the wearer the making a dress which only disfigures her may be considered as a plain case of waste  it would be impertinent in me to go into any details  but it is impossible to walk about the streets now without passing young people who must be under a deep delusion as to the success of their own toilette  instead of graceful and noble simplicity of form instead of combinations of colour at once rich and delicate because in accordance with the chromatic laws of nature one meets with phenomena more and more painful to the eye and startling to common sense till one would be hardly more astonished and certainly hardly more shocked if in a year or two one should pass someone going about like a chinese lady with pinched feet or like a savage of the amazons with a wooden bung through her lower lip  it is easy to complain of these monstrosities  but impossible to cure them it seems to me without an education of the taste an education in those laws of nature which produce beauty in form and beauty in colour  for that the cause of these failures lies in want of education is patent  they are most common ini had almost said they are confined tothose classes of welltodo persons who are the least educated who have no standard of taste of their own and who do not acquire any from cultivated friends and relations  who in consequence dress themselves blindly according to what they conceive to be the paris fashions conveyed at thirdhand through an equally uneducated dressmaker in innocent ignorance of the factfor fact i believe it to bethat paris fashions are invented now not in the least for the sake of beauty but for the sake of producing through variety increased expenditure and thereby increased employment according to the strange system which now prevails in france of compelling if not prosperity at least the signs of it and like schoolboys before a holiday nailing up the head of the weatherglass to insure fine weather  let british ladies educate themselves in those laws of beauty which are as eternal as any other of natures laws which may be seen fulfilled as mr ruskin tells us so eloquently in every flower and every leaf in every sweeping down and rippling wave and they will be able to invent graceful and economical dresses for themselves without importing tawdry and expensive ugliness from france  let me now go a step farther and ask you to consider this  there are in england now a vast number and an increasing number of young women who from various circumstances which we all know must in after life be either the mistresses of their own fortunes or the earners of their own bread  and to do that wisely and well they must be more or less women of business and to be women of business they must know something of the meaning of the words capital profit price value labour wages and of the relation between those two last  in a word they must know a little political economy  nay i sometimes think that the mistress of every household might find not only thrift of money but thrift of brain freedom from mistakes anxieties worries of many kinds all of which eat out the health as well as the heart by a little sound knowledge of the principles of political economy  when we consider that every mistress of a household is continually buying if not selling that she is continually hiring and employing labour in the form of servants and very often into the bargain keeping her husbands accounts  i cannot but think that her hardworked brain might be clearer and her hardtried desire to do her duty by every subject in her little kingdom might be more easily satisfied had she read something of what mr john stuart mill has written especially on the duties of employer and employed  a capitalist a commercialist an employer of labour and an accountantevery mistress of a household is all these whether she likes it or not and it would be surely well for her in so very complicated a state of society as this not to trust merely to that motherwit that intuitive sagacity and innate power of ruling her fellowcreatures which carries women so nobly through their work in simpler and less civilised societies  and here i stop to answer those who may sayas i have heard it saidthat a womans intellect is not fit for business that when a woman takes to business she is apt to do it ill and unpleasantly likewise to be more suspicious more irritable more grasping more unreasonable than regular men of business would be  thatas i have heard it puta woman does not fight fair the answer is simple  that a womans intellect is eminently fitted for business is proved by the enormous amount of business she gets through without any special training for it  but those faults in a woman of which some men complain are simply the results of her not having had a special training  she does not know the laws of business  she does not know the rules of the game she is playing and therefore she is playing it in the dark in fear and suspicion apt to judge of questions on personal grounds often offending those with whom she has to do and oftener still making herself miserable over matters of law or of business on which a little sound knowledge would set her head and her heart at rest  when i have seen widows having the care of children of a great household of a great estate of a great business struggling heroically and yet often mistakenly blamed severely for selfishness and ambition while they were really sacrificing themselves with the divine instinct of a mother for their childrens interest  i have stood by with mingled admiration and pity and said to myself  how nobly she is doing the work without teaching  how much more nobly would she have done it had she been taught  she is now doing her work at the most enormous waste of energy and of virtue  had she had knowledge thrift would have followed it she would have done more work with far less trouble  she will probably kill herself if she goes on while sound knowledge would have saved her health saved her heart saved her friends and helped the very loved ones for whom she labours not always with success  a little political economy therefore will at least do no harm to a woman especially if she have to take care of herself in after life neither i think will she be much harmed by some sound knowledge of another subject which i see promised in these lectures  natural philosophy in its various branches such as the chemistry of common life light heat electricity etc etc  a little knowledge of the laws of light for instance would teach many women that by shutting themselves up day after day week after week in darkened rooms they are as certainly committing a waste of health destroying their vital energy and diseasing their brains as if they were taking so much poison the whole time  a little knowledge of the laws of heat would teach women not to clothe themselves and their children after foolish and insufficient fashions which in this climate sow the seeds of a dozen different diseases and have to be atoned for by perpetual anxieties and by perpetual doctors bills and as for a little knowledge of the laws of electricity one thrift i am sure it would producethrift to us men of having to answer continual inquiries as to what the weather is going to be when a slight knowledge of the barometer or of the form of the clouds and the direction of the wind would enable many a lady to judge for herself and not after inquiry on inquiry regardless of all warnings go out on the first appearance of a strip of blue sky and come home wet through with what she calls only a chill but which really means a nail driven into her coffina probable shortening though it may be a very small one of her mortal life because the food of the next twentyfour hours which should have gone to keep the vital heat at its normal standard will have to be wasted in raising it up to that standard from which it has fallen by a chill  ladies these are subjects on which i must beg to speak a little more at length premising them by one statement which may seem jest but is solemn earnestthat if the medical men of this or any other city were what the world now calls alive to their own intereststhat is to the mere making of money instead of being what medical men are the most generous disinterested and highminded class in these realms then they would oppose by all means in their power the delivery of lectures on natural philosophy to women  for if women act upon what they learn in those lecturesand having womens hearts they will act upon it there ought to follow a decrease of sickness and an increase of health especially among children a thrift of life and a thrift of expense besides which would very seriously affect the income of medical men  for let me ask you ladies with all courtesy but with all earnestnessare you aware of certain facts of which every one of those excellent medical men is too well aware  are you aware that more human beings are killed in england every year by unnecessary and preventable diseases than were killed at waterloo or at sadowa  are you aware that the great majority of those victims are children  are you aware that the diseases which carry them off are for the most part such as ought to be specially under the control of the women who love them pet them educate them and would in many cases if need be lay down their lives for them are you aware again of the vast amount of disease which so both wise mothers and wise doctors assure me is engendered in the sleepingroom from simple ignorance of the laws of ventilation and in the schoolroom likewise from simple ignorance of the laws of physiology from an ignorance of which i shall mention no other case here save onethat too often from ignorance of signs of approaching disease a child is punished for what is called idleness listlessness wilfulness sulkiness and punished too in the unwisest wayby an increase of tasks and confinement to the house thus overtasking still more a brain already overtasked and depressing still more by robbing it of oxygen and of exercise a system already depressed  are you aware i ask again of all this  i speak earnest upon this point because i speak with experience  as a single instance  a medical man a friend of mine passing by his own schoolroom heard one of his own little girls screaming and crying and went in  the governess an excellent woman but wholly ignorant of the laws of physiology complained that the child had of late become obstinate and would not learn and that therefore she must punish her by keeping her indoors over the unlearnt lessons  the father who knew that the child was usually a very good one looked at her carefully for a little while sent her out of the schoolroom and then said that child must not open a book for a month  if i had not acted so he said to me i should have had that child dead of braindisease within the year  now in the face of such facts as these is it too much to ask of mothers sisters aunts nurses governessesall who may be occupied in the care of children especially of girlsthat they should study thrift of human health and human life by studying somewhat the laws of life and health  there are booksi may say a whole literature of bookswritten by scientific doctors on these matters which are in my mind far more important to the schoolroom than half the trashy accomplishments socalled which are expected to be known by governesses  but are they bought are they even to be bought from most country booksellers  ah for a little knowledge of the laws to the neglect of which is owing so much fearful disease which if it does not produce immediate death too often leaves the constitution impaired for years to come  ah the waste of health and strength in the young the waste too of anxiety and misery in those who love and tend them  how much of it might be saved by a little rational education in those laws of nature which are the will of god about the welfare of our bodies and which therefore we are as much bound to know and to obey as we are bound to know and obey the spiritual laws whereon depends the welfare of our souls  pardon me ladies if i have given a moments pain to anyone here but i appeal to every medical man in the room whether i have not spoken the truth and having such an opportunity as this i felt that i must speak for the sake of children and of women likewise or else for ever hereafter hold my peace  let me pass on from this painful subjectfor painful it has been to me for many yearsto a question of intellectual thriftby which i mean just now thrift of words thrift of truth restraint of the tongue accuracy and modesty in statement  mothers complain to me that girls are apt to benot intentionally untruthfulbut exaggerative prejudiced incorrect in repeating a conversation or describing an event and that from this fault arise as is to be expected misunderstandings quarrels rumours slanders scandals and what not  now for this waste of words there is but one cure  and if i be told that it is a natural fault of women that they cannot take the calm judicial view of matters which men boast and often boast most wrongly that they can take that under the influence of hope fear delicate antipathy honest moral indignation they will let their eyes and ears be governed by their feelings and see and hear only what they wish to see and heari answer that it is not for me as a man to start such a theory but that if it be true it is an additional argument for some education which will correct this supposed natural defect  and i say deliberately that there is but one sort of education which will correct it one which will teach young women to observe facts accurately judge them calmly and describe them carefully without adding or distorting  and that is some training in natural science  i beg you not to be startled  but if you are then test the truth of my theory by playing tonight at the game called russian scandal in which a story repeated in secret by one player to the other comes out at the end of the game owing to the inaccurate andforgive me if i say ituneducated brains through which it has passed utterly unlike its original not only ludicrously maimed and distorted but often with the most fantastic additions of events details names dates places which each player will aver that he received from the player before him  i am afraid that too much of the average gossip of every city town and village is little more than a game of russian scandal with this difference that while one is but a game the other is but too mischievous earnest  but now if among your party there shall be an average lawyer medical man or man of science you will find that he and perhaps he alone will be able to retail accurately the story which has been told him  and why  simply because his mind has been trained to deal with facts to ascertain exactly what he does see or hear and to imprint its leading features strongly and clearly on his memory  now you certainly cannot make young ladies barristers or attorneys nor employ their brains in getting up cases civil or criminal and as for chemistry they and their parents may have a reasonable antipathy to smells blackened fingers and occasional explosions and poisonings  but you may make them something of botanists zoologists geologists  i could say much on this point  allow me at least to say this  i verify believe that any young lady who would employ some of her leisure time in collecting wild flowers carefully examining them verifying them and arranging them or who would in her summer trip to the seacoast do the same by the common objects of the shore instead of wasting her holiday as one sees hundreds doing in lounging on benches on the esplanade reading worthless novels and criticising dressesthat such a young lady i say would not only open her own mind to a world of wonder beauty and wisdom which if it did not make her a more reverent and pious soul she cannot be the woman which i take for granted she is but would save herself from the habiti had almost said the necessityof gossip because she would have things to think of and not merely persons facts instead of fancies while she would acquire something of accuracy of patience of methodical observation and judgment which would stand her in good stead in the events of daily life and increase her power of bridling her tongue and her imagination  god is in heaven and thou upon earth therefore let thy words be few is the lesson which those are learning all day long who study the works of god with reverent accuracy lest by misrepresenting them they should be tempted to say that god has done that which he has not and in that wholesome discipline i long that women as well as men should share  and now i come to a thrift of the highest kind as contrasted with a waste the most deplorable and ruinous of all thrift of those faculties which connect us with the unseen and spiritual world with humanity with christ with god thrift of the immortal spirit  i am not going now to give you a sermon on duty  you hear such i doubt not in church every sunday far better than i can preach to you  i am going to speak rather of thrift of the heart thrift of the emotions  how they are wasted in these days in reading what are called sensation novels all know but too well how british literatureall that the best hearts and intellects among our forefathers have bequeathed to usis neglected for light fiction the reading of which is as a lady well said the worst form of intemperancedramdrinking and opiumeating intellectual and moral  i know that the young will delightthey have delighted in all ages and will to the end of timein fictions which deal with that oldest tale which is for ever new  novels will be read but that is all the more reason why women should be trained by the perusal of a higher broader deeper literature to distinguish the good novel from the bad the moral from the immoral the noble from the base the true work of art from the sham which hides its shallowness and vulgarity under a tangled plot and melodramatic situations  she should learnand that she can only learn by cultivationto discern with joy and drink in with reverence the good the beautiful and the true and to turn with the fine scorn of a pure and strong womanhood from the bad the ugly and the false  and if any parent should be inclined to reply  why lay so much stress upon educating a girl in british literature  is it not far more important to make our daughters read religious books  i answerof course it is  i take for granted that that is done in a christian land  but i beg you to recollect that there are books and books and that in these days of a free press it is impossible in the long run to prevent girls reading books of very different shades of opinion and very different religious worth  it may be therefore of the very highest importance to a girl to have her intellect her taste her emotions her moral sense in a word her whole womanhood so cultivated and regulated that she shall herself be able to discern the true from the false the orthodox from the unorthodox the truly devout from the merely sentimental the gospel from its counterfeits  i should have thought that there never had been in britain since the reformation a crisis at which young englishwomen required more careful cultivation on these matters if at least they are to be saved from making themselves and their families miserable and from endingas i have known too many endwith broken hearts broken brains broken health and an early grave  take warning by what you see abroad  in every country where the women are uneducated unoccupied where their only literature is french novels or translations of themin every one of those countries the women even to the highest are the slaves of superstition and the puppets of priests  in proportion as in certain other countriesnotably i will say in scotlandthe women are highly educated family life and family secrets are sacred and the woman owns allegiance and devotion to no confessor or director but to her own husband or to her own family  i say plainly that if any parents wish their daughters to succumb at least to some quackery or superstition whether calling itself scientific or calling itself religiousand there are too many of both just nowthey cannot more certainly effect their purpose than by allowing her to grow up ignorant frivolous luxurious vain with her emotions excited but not satisfied by the reading of foolish and even immoral novels  in such a case the more delicate and graceful the organisation the more noble and earnest the nature which has been neglected the more certain it isi know too well what i am sayingto go astray  the time of depression disappointment vacuity all but despair must come  the immortal spirit finding no healthy satisfaction for its highest aspirations is but too likely to betake itself to an unhealthy and exciting superstition  ashamed of its own long selfindulgence it is but too likely to flee from itself into a morbid asceticism  not having been taught its godgiven and natural duties in the world it is but too likely to betake itself from the mere craving for action to selfinvented and unnatural duties out of the world  ignorant of true science yet craving to understand the wonders of nature and of spirit it is but too likely to betake itself to nonsciencenonsense as it is usually calledwhether of spiritrapping and mesmerism or of miraculous relics and winking pictures  longing for guidance and teaching and never having been taught to guide and teach itself it is but too likely to deliver itself up in selfdespair to the guidance and teaching of those who whether they be quacks or fanatics look on uneducated women as their natural prey  you will see i am sure from what i have said that it is not my wish that you should become mere learned women mere female pedants as useless and unpleasing as male pedants are wont to be the education which i set before you is not to be got by mere hearing lectures or reading books  for it is an education of your whole character a selfeducation which really means a committing of yourself to god that he may educate you  hearing lectures is good for it will teach you how much there is to be known and how little you know  reading books is good for it will give you habits of regular and diligent study  and therefore i urge on you strongly private study especially in case a library should be formed here of books on those most practical subjects of which i have been speaking  but after all both lectures and books are good mainly in as far as they furnish matter for reflection while the desire to reflect and the ability to reflect must come as i believe from above  the honest craving after light and power after knowledge wisdom active usefulness must comeand may it come to youby the inspiration of the spirit of god  one word more and i have done  let me ask women to educate themselves not for their own sakes merely but for the sake of others  for whether they will or not they must educate others i do not speak merely of those who may be engaged in the work of direct teaching that they ought to be well taught themselves who can doubt  i speak of thoseand in so doing i speak of every woman young and oldwho exercise as wife as mother as aunt as sister or as friend an influence indirect it may be and unconscious but still potent and practical on the minds and characters of those about them especially of men  how potent and practical that influence is those know best who know most of the world and most of human nature  there are those who considerand i agree with themthat the education of boys under the age of twelve years ought to be entrusted as much as possible to women let me askof what period of youth and manhood does not the same hold true  i pity the ignorance and conceit of the man who fancies that he has nothing left to learn from cultivated women i should have thought that the very mission of woman was to be in the highest sense the educator of man from infancy to old age that that was the work towards which all the godgiven capacities of women pointed for which they were to be educated to the highest pitch  i should have thought that it was the glory of woman that she was sent into the world to live for others rather than for herself and therefore i should saylet her smallest rights be respected her smallest wrongs redressed  but let her never be persuaded to forget that she is sent into the world to teach manwhat i believe she has been teaching him all along even in the savage statenamely that there is something more necessary than the claiming of rights and that is the performing of duties to teach him specially in these socalled intellectual days that there is something more than intellect and that is purity and virtue  let her never be persuaded to forget that her calling is not the lower and more earthly one of selfassertion but the higher and the diviner calling of selfsacrifice and let her never desert that higher life which lives in others and for others like her redeemer and her lord  and if any should answer that this doctrine would keep woman a dependent and a slave i rejoinnot so  it would keep her what she should bethe mistress of all around her because mistress of herself  and more i should express a fear that those who made that answer had not yet seen into the mystery of true greatness and true strength that they did not yet understand the true magnanimity the true royalty of that spirit by which the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many  surely that is womans callingto teach man  and to teach him what  to teach him after all that his calling is the same as hers if he will but see the things which belong to his peace  to temper his fiercer coarser more selfassertive nature by the contact of her gentleness purity selfsacrifice  to make him see that not by blare of trumpets not by noise wrath greed ambition intrigue puffery is good and lasting work to be done on earth  but by wise selfdistrust by silent labour by lofty selfcontrol by that charity which hopeth all things believeth all things endureth all things by such an example in short as women now in tens of thousands set to those around them such as they will show more and more the more their whole womanhood is educated to employ its powers without waste and without haste in harmonious unity  let the woman begin in girlhood if such be her happy lotto quote the words of a great poet a great philosopher and a great churchman william wordsworthlet her begin i say    with all things round about her drawn from maytime and the cheerful dawn a dancing shape an image gay to haunt to startle and waylay   let her develop onwards    a spirit yet a woman too with household motions light and free and steps of virgin liberty a countenance in which shall meet sweet records promises as sweet a creature not too bright and good for human natures daily food for transient sorrows simple wiles praise blame love kisses tears and smiles   but let her highest and her final development be that which not nature but selfeducation alone can bringthat which makes her once and for ever    a being breathing thoughtful breath a traveller betwixt life and death with reason firm with temperate will endurance foresight strength and skill a perfect woman nobly planned to warn to comfort and command and yet a spirit still and bright with something of an angel light    nausicaa in london or the lower education of women    fresh from the marbles of the british museum i went my way through london streets  my brain was still full of fair and grand forms the forms of men and women whose every limb and attitude betokened perfect health and grace and power and self possession and selfrestraint so habitual and complete that it had become unconscious and undistinguishable from the native freedom of the savage  for i had been up and down the corridors of those greek sculptures which remain as a perpetual sermon to rich and poor amid our artificial unwholesome and it may be decaying pseudocivilisation saying with looks more expressive than all wordssuch men and women can be for such they have been and such you may be yet if you will use that science of which you too often only boast  above all i had been pondering over the awful and yet tender beauty of the maiden figures from the parthenon and its kindred temples  and these or such as these i thought to myself were the sisters of the men who fought at marathon and salamis the mothers of many a man among the ten thousand whom xenophon led back from babylon to the black sea shore the ancestresses of many a man who conquered the east in alexanders host and fought with porus in the far punjab  and were these women mere dolls  these men mere gladiators  were they not the parents of philosophy science poetry the plastic arts  we talk of education now  are we more educated than were the ancient greeks  do we know anything about education physical intellectual or aesthetic and i may say moral likewise religious education of course in our sense of the world they had nonebut do we know anything about education of which they have not taught us at least the rudiments  are there not some branches of education which they perfected once and for ever leaving us northern barbarians to follow or else not to follow their example  to produce health that is harmony and sympathy proportion and grace in every faculty of mind and bodythat was their notion of education  to produce that the textbook of their childhood was the poetry of homer and not ofbut i am treading on dangerous ground  it was for this that the seafaring greek lad was taught to find his ideal in ulysses while his sister at home found hers it may be in nausicaa  it was for this that when perhaps the most complete and exquisite of all the greeks sophocles the good beloved by gods and men represented on the athenian stage his drama of nausicaa and as usual could notfor he had no voicehimself take a speaking part he was content to do one thing in which he specially excelled and dressed and masked as a girl to play at ball amid the chorus of nausicaas maidens  that drama of nausicaa is lost and if i dare say so of any play of sophocles i scarce regret it  it is well perhaps that we have no second conception of the scene to interfere with the simplicity so grand and yet so tender of homers idyllic episode  nausicaa it must be remembered is the daughter of a king  but not of a king in the exclusive modern european or old eastern sense  her father alcinous is simply primus inter pares among a community of merchants who are called kings likewise and mayor for lifeso to speakof a new trading city a nascent genoa or venice on the shore of the mediterranean  but the girl nausicaa as she sleeps in her carved chamber is like the immortals in form and face and two handmaidens who sleep on each side of the polished door have beauty from the graces  to her there enters in the shape of some maiden friend none less than pallas athene herself intent on saving worthily her favourite the shipwrecked ulysses and bids her in a dream go forthand wash the clothes 6   nausicaa wherefore doth thy mother bear child so forgetful  this long time doth rest like lumber in the house much raiment fair soon must thou wed and be thyself welldrest and find thy bridegroom raiment of the best these are the things whence good repute is born and praises that make glad a parents breast come let us both go washing with the morn so shalt thou have clothes becoming to be worn  know that thy maidenhood is not for long whom the phoeacian chiefs already woo lords of the land whence thou thyself art sprung soon as the shining dawn comes forth anew for wain and mules thy noble father sue which to the place of washing shall convey girdles and shawls and rugs of splendid hue this for thyself were better than essay thither to walk  the place is distant a long way   startled by her dream nausicaa awakes and goes to find her parents    one by the hearth sat with the maids around and on the skeins of yarn seapurpled spent her morning toil  him to the council bound called by the honoured kings just going forth she found   and calling him as she might now pappa phile dear papa asks for the mulewaggon  but it is her fathers and her five brothers clothes she fain would wash    ashamed to name her marriage to her father dear   but he understood alland she goes forth in the mulewaggon with the clothes after her mother has put in a chest of all kinds of delicate food and meat and wine in a goatskin and last but not least the indispensable cruse of oil for anointing after the bath to which both jews greeks and romans owed so much health and beauty  and then we read in the simple verse of a poet too refined like the rest of his race to see anything mean or ridiculous in that which was not ugly and unnatural how she and her maids got into the polished waggon with good wheels and she took the whip and the studded reins and beat them till they started and how the mules rattled away and pulled against each other till   when they came to the fair flowing river which feeds good lavatories all the year fitted to cleanse all sullied robes soever they from the wain the mules unharnessed there and chased them free to crop their juicy fare by the swift river on the margin green then to the waters dashed the clothes they bare and in the streamfilled trenches stamped them clean which having washed and cleansed they spread before the sunbeams on the beach where most did lie thick pebbles by the seawave washed ashore so having left them in the heat to dry they to the bath went down and byandby rubbed with rich oil their midday meal essay couched in green turf the river rolling nigh then throwing off their veils at ball they play while the whitearmed nausicaa leads the choral lay   the mere beauty of this scene all will feel who have the sense of beauty in them  yet it is not on that aspect which i wish to dwell but on its healthfulness  exercise is taken in measured time to the sound of song as a duty almost as well as an amusement  for this game of ball which is here mentioned for the first time in human literature nearly three thousand years ago was held by the greeks and by the romans after them to be an almost necessary part of a liberal education principally doubtless from the development which it produced in the upper half of the body not merely to the arms but to the chest by raising and expanding the ribs and to all the muscles of the torso whether perpendicular or oblique  the elasticity and grace which it was believed to give were so much prized that a room for ballplay and a teacher of the art were integral parts of every gymnasium and the athenians went so far as to bestow on one famous ballplayer aristonicus of carystia a statue and the rights of citizenship  the rough and hardy young spartans when passing from boyhood into manhood received the title of ball players seemingly from the game which it was then their special duty to learn  in the case of nausicaa and her maidens the game would just bring into their right places all that is liable to be contracted and weakened in women so many of whose occupations must needs be sedentary and stooping while the song which accompanied the game at once filled the lungs regularly and rhythmically and prevented violent motion or unseemly attitude we the civilised need physiologists to remind us of these simple facts and even then do not act on them  those old halfbarbarous greeks had found them out for themselves and moreover acted on them  but fair nausicaa must have beensome will saysurely a mere child of nature and an uncultivated person  so far from it that her whole demeanour and speech show culture of the very highest sort full of sweetness and light intelligent and fearless quick to perceive the bearings of her strange and sudden adventure quick to perceive the character of ulysses quick to answer his lofty and refined pleading by words as lofty and refined and pious withalfor it is she who speaks to her handmaids the once so famous words   strangers and poor men all are sent from zeus and alms though small are sweet   clear of intellect prompt of action modest of demeanour shrinking from the slightest breath of scandal while she is not ashamed when ulysses bathed and dressed looks himself again to whisper to her maidens her wish that the gods might send her such a spousethis is nausicaa as homer draws her and as many a scholar and poet since homer has accepted her for the ideal of noble maidenhood  i ask my readers to study for themselves her interview with ulysses in mr worsleys translation or rather in the grand simplicity of the original greek 7 and judge whether nausicaa is not as perfect a lady as the poet who imagined her or it may be drew her from lifemust have been a perfect gentleman both complete in those manners which says the old proverb make the man but which are the woman herself because with herwho acts more by emotion than by calculationmanners are the outward and visible tokens of her inward and spiritual grace or disgrace and flow instinctively whether good or bad from the instincts of her inner nature  true nausicaa could neither read nor write  no more most probably could the author of the odyssey  no more for that matter could abraham isaac and jacob though they were plainly both in mind and manners most highlycultivated men  reading and writing of course have now become necessaries of humanity and are to be given to every human being that he may start fair in the race of life  but i am not aware that greek women improved much either in manners morals or happiness by acquiring them in after centuries  a wise man would sooner see his daughter a nausicaa than a sappho an aspasia a cleopatra or even an hypatia  full of such thoughts i went through london streets among the nausicaas of the present day the girls of the period the daughters and hereafter mothers of our future rulers the great demos or commercial middle class of the greatest mercantile city in the world  and noted what i had noted with fear and sorrow many a day for many a year a type and an increasing type of young women who certainly had not had the advantages educational and other of that greek nausicaa of old  of course in such a city as london to which the best of everything physical and other gravitates i could not but pass now and then beautiful persons who made me proud of those grandes anglaises aux joues rouges whom the parisiennes ridicule and envy  but i could not help suspecting that their looks showed them to be either countrybred or born of country parents and this suspicion was strengthened by the fact that when compared with their mothers the mothers physique was in the majority of cases superior to the daughters  painful it was to one accustomed to the ruddy wellgrown peasant girl stalwart even when as often squat and plain to remark the exceedingly small size of the average young woman by which i do not mean mere want of heightthat is a little matterbut want of breadth likewise a general want of those large frames which indicate usually a power of keeping strong and healthy not merely the muscles but the brain itself  poor little things  i passed hundredsi pass hundreds every day trying to hide their littleness by the nasty mass of false hair or what does duty for it and by the ugly and useless hat which is stuck upon it making the head thereby look ridiculously large and heavy and by the high heels on which they totter onward having forgotten or never learnt the simple art of walking their bodies tilted forward in that ungraceful attitude which is called why that name of all othersa grecian bend seemingly kept on their feet and kept together at all in that strange attitude by tight stays which prevented all graceful and healthy motion of the hips or sides their raiment meanwhile being purposely misshapen in this direction and in that to hideit must be presumed deficiencies of form  if that chignon and those heels had been taken off the figure which would have remained would have been that too often of a puny girl of sixteen  and yet there was no doubt that these women were not only full grown but some of them alas wives and mothers  poor little thingsand this they have gained by socalled civilisation  the power of aping the fashions by which the wornout parisienne hides her own personal defects and of making themselves by innate want of that taste which the parisienne possesses only the cause of something like a sneer from many a cultivated man and of something like a sneer too from yonder gipsy woman who passes by with bold bright face and swinging hip and footstep stately and elastic far better dressed according to all true canons of taste than most town girls and thanking her fate that she and her rom are no house dwellers and gaslightsightseers but fatten on free air upon the open moor  but the face which is beneath that chignon and that hat  wellit is sometimes pretty  but how seldom handsome which is a higher quality by far  it is not strange to say a wellfed face plenty of money and perhaps too much is spent on those fine clothes  it had been better to judge from the complexion if some of that money had been spent in solid wholesome food  she looks as if she livedas she too often does i hearon tea and breadandbutter or rather on bread with the minimum of butter for as the want of bone indicates a deficiency of phosphatic food so does the want of flesh about the cheeks indicate a deficiency of hydrocarbon  poor little nausicaa that is not her fault our boasted civilisation has not even taught her what to eat as it certainly has not increased her appetite and she knows not what every country fellow knowsthat without plenty of butter and other fatty matters she is not likely to keep even warm  better to eat nasty fat bacon now than to supply the want of it some few years hence by nastier codliver oil  but there is no one yet to tell her that and a dozen other equally simple facts for her own sake and for the sake of that coming demos which she is to bring into the world a demos which if we can only keep it healthy in body and brain has before it so splendid a future  but which if body and brain degrade beneath the influence of modern barbarism is but too likely to follow the demos of ancient byzantium or of modern paris  ay but her intellect  she is so clever and she reads so much and she is going to be taught to read so much more  ah wellthere was once a science called physiognomy  the greeks from what i can learn knew more of it than any people since though the italian painters and sculptors must have known much far more than we  in a more scientific civilisation there will be such a science once more  but its laws though still in the empiric stage are not altogether forgotten by some  little children have often a fine and clear instinct of them  many cultivated and experienced women have a fine and clear instinct of them likewise  and some such would tell us that there is intellect in plenty in the modern nausicaa  but not of the quality which they desire for their countrys future good  self consciousness eagerness volubility petulance in countenance in gesture and in voicewhich last is too often most harsh and artificial the breath being sent forth through the closed teeth and almost entirely at the corners of the mouthand with all this a weariness often about the wrinkling forehead and the drooping lidsall these which are growing too common not among the demos only nor only in the towns are signs they think of the unrest of unhealth physical intellectual spiritual  at least they are as different as two types of physiognomy in the same race can be from the expression both of face and gesture in those old greek sculptures and in the old italian painters and it must be said in the portraits of reynolds and gainsborough copley and romney  not such one thinks must have been the mothers of britain during the latter half of the last century and the beginning of the present when their sons at times were holding half the world at bay  and if nausicaa has become such in town  what is she when she goes to the seaside not to wash the clothes in freshwater but herself in saltthe very saltwater laden with decaying organisms from which though not polluted further by a dozen sewers ulysses had to cleanse himself anointing too with oil ere he was fit to appear in the company of nausicaa of greece she dirties herself with the dirty saltwater and probably chills and tires herself by walking thither and back and staying in too long and then flaunts on the pier bedizened in garments which for monstrosity of form and disharmony of colours would have set that greek nausicaas teeth on edge or those of any average hindoo woman now  or even sadder still she sits on chairs and benches all the weary afternoon her head drooped on her chest over some novel from the library and then returns to tea and shrimps and lodgings of which the fragrance is not unsuggestive sometimes not unproductive of typhoid fever  ah poor nausicaa of england  that is a sad sight to some who think about the present and have read about the past  it is not a sad sight to see your old fathertradesman or clerk or what notwho has done good work in his day and hopes to do some more sitting by your old mother who has done good work in her dayamong the rest that heaviest work of all the bringing you into the world and keeping you in it till nowhonest kindly cheerful folk enough and not inefficient in their own calling though an average northumbrian or highlander or irish easterling beside carrying a brain of five times the intellectual force could drive five such men over the cliff with his bare hands  it is not a sad sight i say to see them sitting about upon those seaside benches looking out listlessly at the water and the ships and the sunlight and enjoying like so many flies upon a wall the novel act of doing nothing  it is not the old for whom wise men are sad  but for you  where is your vitality  where is your lebensgluckseligkeit your enjoyment of superfluous life and power  why you cannot even dance and sing till now and then at night perhaps when you ought to lie safe in bed but when the weak brain after receiving the days nourishment has roused itself a second time into a false excitement of gaslight pleasure what there is left of it is all going into that foolish book which the womanly element in you still healthy and alive delights in because it places you in fancy in situations in which you will never stand and inspires you with emotions some of which it may be you had better never feel  poor nausicaaold some men think before you have been ever young  and now they are going to develop you and let you have your share in the higher education of women by making you read more books and do more sums and pass examinations and stoop over desks at night after stooping over some other employment all day and to teach you latin and even greek  well we will gladly teach you greek if you learn thereby to read the history of nausicaa of old and what manner of maiden she was and what was her education  you will admire her doubtless  but do not let your admiration limit itself to drawing a meagre half mediaevalised design of heras she never looked  copy in your own person and even if you do not descend as lowor rise as highas washing the household clothes at least learn to play at ball and sing in the open air and sunshine not in theatres and concertrooms by gaslight and take decent care of your own health and dress not like a parisiennenor of course like nausicaa of old for that is to ask too much but somewhat more like an average highland lassie and try to look like her and be like her of whom wordsworth sang   a mien and face in which full plainly i can trace benignity and homebred sense ripening in perfect innocence here scattered like a random seed remote from men thou dost not need the embarrassed look of shy distress and maidenly shamefacedness thou wearst upon thy forehead clear the freedom of a mountaineer a face with gladness overspread soft smiles by human kindness bred and seemliness complete that sways thy courtesies about thee plays with no restraint save such as springs from quick and eager visitings of thoughts that lie beyond the reach of thy few words of english speech a bondage sweetly brooked a strife that gives thy gestures grace and life   ah yet unspoilt nausicaa of the north descendant of the dark tenderhearted celtic girl and the fair deephearted scandinavian viking thank god for thy heather and fresh air and the kine thou tendest and the wool thou spinnest and come not to seek thy fortune child in wicked london town nor import as they tell me thou art doing fast the ugly fashions of that london town clumsy copies of parisian cockneydom into thy highland home nor give up the healthful and graceful free and modest dress of thy mother and thy mothers mother to disfigure the little kirk on sabbath days with crinoline and corset highheeled boots and other womens hair  it is proposed just now to assimilate the education of girls more and more to that of boys  if that means that girls are merely to learn more lessons and to study what their brothers are taught in addition to what their mothers were taught then it is to be hoped at least by physiologists and patriots that the scheme will sink into that limbo whither in a free and tolerably rational country all imperfect and illconsidered schemes are sure to gravitate  but if the proposal be a bonafide one  then it must be borne in mind that in the public schools of england and in all private schools i presume which take their tone from them cricket and football are more or less compulsory being considered integral parts of an englishmans education and that they are likely to remain so in spite of all reclamations because masters and boys alike know that games do not in the long run interfere with a boys work that the same boy will very often excel in both that the games keep him in health for his work and the spirit with which he takes to his games when in the lower school is a fair test of the spirit with which he will take to his work when he rises into the higher school and that nothing is worse for a boy than to fall into that loafing tuckshop haunting set who neither play hard nor work hard and are usually extravagant and often vicious  moreover they know well that games conduce not merely to physical but to moral health that in the playingfield boys acquire virtues which no books can give them not merely daring and endurance but better still temper selfrestraint fairness honour unenvious approbation of anothers success and all that give and take of life which stand a man in such good stead when he goes forth into the world and without which indeed his success is always maimed and partial  now  if the promoters of higher education for women will compel girls to any training analogous to our publicschool games if for instance they will insist on that most natural and wholesome of all exercises dancing in order to develop the lower half of the body on singing to expand the lungs and regulate the breath and on some gamesball or what notwhich will ensure that raised chest and upright carriage and general strength of the upper torso without which full oxygenation of the blood and therefore general health is impossible if they will sternly forbid tight stays high heels and all which interferes with free growth and free motion if they will consider carefully all which has been written on the halftime system by mr chadwick and others and accept the certain physical law that in order to renovate the brain day by day the growing creature must have plenty of fresh air and play and that the child who learns for four hours and plays for four hours will learn more and learn it more easily than the child who learns for the whole eight hours if in short they will teach girls not merely to understand the greek tongue but to copy somewhat of the greek physical training of that music and gymnastic which helped to make the cleverest race of the old world the ablest race likewise then they will earn the gratitude of the patriot and the physiologists by doing their best to stay the downward tendencies of the physique and therefore ultimately of the morale in the coming generation of english women  i am sorry to say that as yet i hear of but one movement in this direction among the promoters of the higher education of women 8  i trust that the subject will be taken up methodically by those gifted ladies who have acquainted themselves and are labouring to acquaint other women with the first principles of health and that they may avail to prevent the coming generations under the unwholesome stimulant of competitive examinations and so forth from developing into so many chinesedwarfsor idiots  october 1873    the airmothers1869die natur ist die bewegung    who are these who follow us softly over the moor in the autumn eve  their wings brush and rustle in the firboughs and they whisper before us and behind as if they called gently to each other like birds flocking homeward to their nests  the woodpecker on the pinestems knows them and laughs aloud for joy as they pass  the rooks above the pasture know them and wheel round and tumble in their play  the brown leaves on the oak trees know them and flutter faintly and beckon as they pass and in the chattering of the dry leaves there is a meaning and a cry of weary things which long for rest  take us home take us home you soft airmothers now our fathers the sunbeams are grown dull  our green summer beauty is all draggled and our faces are grown wan and wan and the buds the children whom we nourished thrust us off ungrateful from our seats  waft us down you soft airmothers upon your wings to the quiet earth that we may go to our home as all things go and become air and sunlight once again  and the bold young firseeds know them and rattle impatient in their cones  blow stronger blow fiercer slow airmothers and shake us from our prisons of dead wood that we may fly and spin away northeastward each on his horny wing  help us but to touch the moorland yonder and we will take good care of ourselves henceforth we will dive like arrows through the heather and drive our sharp beaks into the soil and rise again as green trees toward the sunlight and spread out lusty boughs  they never think bold fools of what is coming to bring them low in the midst of their pride of the reckless axe which will fell them and the saw which will shape them into logs and the trains which will roar and rattle over them as they lie buried in the gravel of the way till they are ground and rotted into powder and dug up and flung upon the fire that they too may return home like all things and become air and sunlight once again  and the airmothers hear their prayers and do their bidding  but faintly for they themselves are tired and sad  tired and sad are the airmothers and their gardens rent and wan look at them as they stream over the black forest before the dim southwestern sun long lines and wreaths of melancholy grey stained with dull yellow or dead dun  they have come far across the seas and done many a wild deed upon their way and now that they have reached the land like shipwrecked sailors they will lie down and weep till they can weep no more  ah how different were those soft airmothers when invisible to mortal eyes they started on their long skyjourney five thousand miles across the sea  out of the blazing caldron which lies between the two new worlds they leapt up when the great sun called them in whirls and spouts of clear hot steam and rushed of their own passion to the northward while the whirling earth ball whirled them east  so northeastward they rushed aloft across the gay west indian isles leaving below the glitter of the flyingfish and the sidelong eyes of cruel sharks above the canefields and the plantaingardens and the cocoagroves which fringe the shores above the rocks which throbbed with earthquakes and the peaks of old volcanoes cinderstrewn while far beneath the ghosts of their dead sisters hurried home upon the northeast breeze  wild deeds they did as they rushed onward and struggled and fought among themselves up and down and round and backward in the fury of their blind hot youth  they heeded not the tree as they snapped it nor the ship as they whelmed it in the waves nor the cry of the sinking sailor nor the need of his little ones on shore hasty and selfish even as children and like children tamed by their own rage  for they tired themselves by struggling with each other and by tearing the heavy water into waves and their wings grew clogged with seaspray and soaked more and more with steam  but at last the sea grew cold beneath them and their clear steam shrank to mist and they saw themselves and each other wrapped in dull rainladen clouds  then they drew their white cloudgarments round them and veiled themselves for very shame and said  we have been wild and wayward and alas our pure bright youth is gone  but we will do one good deed yet ere we die and so we shall not have lived in vain  we will glide onward to the land and weep there and refresh all things with soft warm rain and make the grass grow the buds burst quench the thirst of man and beast and wash the soiled world clean  so they are wandering past us the airmothers to weep the leaves into their graves to weep the seeds into their seedbeds and weep the soil into the plains to get the rich earth ready for the winter and then creep northward to the iceworld and there die  weary and still more weary slowly and more slowly still they will journey on far northward across fastchilling seas  for a doom is laid upon them never to be still again till they rest at the north pole itself the still axle of the spinning world and sink in death around it and become white snowclad ghosts  but will they live again those chilled airmothers  yes they must live again  for all things move for ever and not even ghosts can rest  so the corpses of their sisters piling on them from above press them outward press them southward toward the sun once more across the floes and round the icebergs weeping tears of snow and sleet while men hate their wild harsh voices and shrink before their bitter breath  they know not that the cold bleak snowstorms as they hurtle from the black northeast bear back the ghosts of the soft airmothers as penitents to their father the great sun  but as they fly southwards warm life thrills them and they drop their loads of sleet and snow and meet their young live sisters from the south and greet them with flash and thunderpeal  and please god before many weeks are over as we run westwardho we shall overtake the ghosts of these airmothers hurrying back toward their father the great sun  fresh and bright under the fresh bright heaven they will race with us toward our home to gain new heat new life new power and set forth about their work once more  men call them the southwest wind those airmothers and their ghosts the northeast trade and value them and rightly because they bear the traders out and home across the sea  but wise men and little children should look on them with more seeing eyes and say may not these winds be living creatures  they too are thoughts of god to whom all live  for is not our life like their life  do we not come and go as they  out of gods boundless bosom the fount of life we came through selfish stormy youth and contrite tearsjust not too late through manhood not altogether useless through slow and chill old age we return from whence we came to the bosom of god once moreto go forth again it may be with fresh knowledge and fresh powers to nobler work  amen  such was the prophecy which i learnt or seemed to learn from the southwestern wind off the atlantic on a certain delectable evening  and it was fulfilled at night as far as the gentle air mothers could fulfil it for foolish man   there was a roaring in the woods all night the rain came heavily and fell in floods but now the sun is rising calm and bright the birds are singing in the distant woods over his own sweet voice the stockdove broods the jay makes answer as the magpie chatters and all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters   but was i a gloomy and distempered man if upon such a morn as that i stood on the little bridge across a certain brook and watched the water run with something of a sigh  or if when the schoolboy beside me lamented that the floods would surely be out and his days fishing spoiled i said to himah my boy that is a little matter  look at what you are seeing now and understand what barbarism and waste mean  look at all that beautiful water which god has sent us hither off the atlantic without trouble or expense to us  thousands and tens of thousands of gallons will run under this bridge today and what shall we do with it nothing  and yet  think only of the mills which that water would have turned  think how it might have kept up health and cleanliness in poor creatures packed away in the back streets of the nearest town or even in london itself  think even how country folks in many parts of england in three months time may be crying out for rain and afraid of short crops and fever and scarlatina and cattleplague for want of the very water which we are now letting run back wasted into the sea from whence it came  and yet we call ourselves a civilised people  it is not wise i know to preach to boys  and yet sometimes a man must speak his heart even like midass slave to the reeds by the river side  and i had so often fishing up and down full many a stream whispered my story to those same riverreeds and told them that my lord the sovereign demos had like old midas asses ears in spite of all his gold that i thought i might for once tell it the boy likewise in hope that he might help his generation to mend that which my own generation does not seem like to mend  i might have said more to him  but did not  for it is not well to destroy too early the childs illusion that people must be wise because they are grown up and have votes and ruleor think they rulethe world  the child will find out how true that is soon enough for himself  if the truth be forced on him by the hot words of those with whom he lives it is apt to breed in him that contempt stormful and therefore barren which makes revolutions and not that pity calm and therefore helpful which makes reforms  so i might have said to him but did not  and then men pray for rain  my boy did you ever hear the old eastern legend about the gipsies  how they were such good musicians that some great indian sultan sent for the whole tribe and planted them near his palace and gave them land and ploughs to break it up and seed to sow it that they might dwell there and play and sing to him  but when the winter arrived the gipsies all came to the sultan and cried that they were starving  but what have you done with the seedcorn which i gave you  o light of the age we ate it in the summer  and what have you done with the ploughs which i gave you  o glory of the universe we burnt them to bake the corn withal  then said that great sultanlike the butterflies you have lived and like the butterflies you shall wander  so he drove them out and that is how the gipsies came hither from the east  now suppose that the sultan of all sultans who sends the rain should make a like answer to us foolish human beings when we prayed for rain  but what have you done with the rain which i gave you six months since  we have let it run into the sea then ere you ask for more rain make places wherein you can keep it when you have it  but that would be in most cases too expensive  we can employ our capital more profitably in other directions  it is not for me to say what answer might be made to such an excuse  i think a childs still unsophisticated sense of right and wrong would soon supply one and probably oneconsidering the complexity and difficulty and novelty of the whole question somewhat too harsh as childrens judgments are wont to be  but would it not be well if our children without being taught to blame anyone for what is past were taught something about what ought to be done now what must be done soon with the rainfall of these islands and about other and kindred healthquestions on the solution of which depends and will depend more and more the life of millions  one would have thought that those public schools and colleges which desire to monopolise the education of the owners of the soil of the great employers of labour of the clergy and of all indeed who ought to be acquainted with the duties of property the conditions of public health and in a word with the general laws of what is now called social science one would have thought i say that these public schools and colleges would have taught their scholars somewhat at least about such matters that they might go forth into life with at least some rough notions of the causes which make people healthy or unhealthy rich or poor comfortable or wretched useful or dangerous to the state  but as long as our great educational institutions safe or fancying themselves safe in some enchanted castle shut out by ancient magic from the living world put a premium on latin and greek verses  a wise father will during the holidays talk now and then i hope somewhat after this fashion  you must understand my boy that all the water in the country comes out of the sky and from nowhere else and that therefore to save and store the water when it falls is a question of life and death to crops and man and beast for with or without water is life or death  if i took for instance the water from the moors above and turned it over yonder field i could double and more than double the crops in that field henceforth  then why do i not do it  only because the field lies higher than the house and ifnow here is one thing which you and every civilised man should know if you have watermeadows or any irrigated land as it is called above a house or even on a level with it it is certain to breed not merely cold and damp but fever or ague  our forefathers did not understand this and they built their houses as this is built in the lowest places they could find  sometimes because they wanted to be near ponds from whence they could get fish in lent but more often i think because they wanted to be sheltered from the wind  they had no glass as we have in their windows or at least only latticed casements which let in the wind and cold and they shrank from high and exposed and therefore really healthy spots  but now that we have good glass and sash windows and doors that will shut tight we can build warm houses where we like  and if you ever have to do with the building of cottages remember that it is your duty to the people who will live in them and therefore to the state to see that they stand high and dry where no water can drain down into their foundations and where fog and the poisonous gases which are given out by rotting vegetables cannot drain down either  you will learn more about all that when you learn as every civilised lad should in these days something about chemistry and the laws of fluids and gases  but you know already that flowers are cut off by frost in the low grounds sooner than in the high and that the fog at night always lies along the brooks and that the sour moorsmell which warns us to shut our windows at sunset comes down from the hill and not up from the valley  now all these things are caused by one and the same law that cold air is heavier than warm and therefore like so much water must run downhill  but what about the rainfall  well i have wandered a little from the rainfall  though not as far as you fancy for fever and ague and rheumatism usually mean rain in the wrong place  but if you knew how much illness and torturing pain and death and sorrow arise even to this very day from ignorance of these simple laws then you would bear them carefully in mind and wish to know more about them  but now for water being life to the beasts  do you rememberthough you are hardly old enoughthe cattleplague  how the beasts died or had to be killed and buried by tens of thousands and how misery and ruin fell on hundreds of honest men and women over many of the richest counties of england  but how we in this vale had no cattleplague and how there was noneas far as i recollectin the uplands of devon and cornwall nor of wales nor of the scotch highlands  now do you know why that was  simply because we here like those other uplanders are in such a country as palestine was before the foolish jews cut down all their timber and so destroyed their own rainfalla land of brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills there is hardly a field here that has not thank god its running brook or its sweet spring from which our cattle were drinking their health and life while in the claylands of cheshire and in the cambridgeshire fenswhich were drained utterly drythe poor things drank no water too often save that of the very same putrid ponds in which they had been standing all day long to cool themselves and to keep off the flies  i do not say of course that bad water caused the cattleplague  it came by infection from the east of europe  but i say that bad water made the cattle ready to take it and made it spread over the country and when you are old enough i will give you plenty of proofsome from the herds of your own kinsmenthat what i say is true  and as for pure water being life to human beings  why have we never fever here and scarcely ever diseases like feverzymotics as the doctors call them  or if a case comes into our parish from outside why does the fever never spread  for the very same reason that we had no cattleplague  because we have more pure water close to every cottage than we need  and this i tell you that the only two outbreaks of deadly disease which we have had here for thirty years were both of them as far as i could see to be traced to filthy water having got into the poor folks wells  water you must remember just as it is life when pure is death when foul  for it can carry unseen to the eve and even when it looks clear and sparkling and tastes soft and sweet poisons which have perhaps killed more human beings than ever were killed in battle  you have read perhaps how the athenians when they were dying of the plague accused the lacedaemonians outside the walls of poisoning their wells or how in some of the pestilences of the middle ages the common people used to accuse the poor harmless jews of poisoning the wells and set upon them and murdered them horribly  they were right i do not doubt in their notion that the wellwater was giving them the pestilence but they had not sense to see that they were poisoning the wells themselves by their dirt and carelessness or in the case of poor besieged athens probably by mere overcrowding which has cost many a life ere now and will cost more  and i am sorry to tell you my little man that even now too many people have no more sense than they had and die in consequence  if you could see a battlefield and men shot down writhing and dying in hundreds by shell and bullet would not that seem to you a horrid sight theni do not wish to make you sad too early but this is a fact that everyone should knowthat more people and not strong men only but women and little children too are killed and wounded in great britain every year by bad water and want of water together than were killed and wounded in any battle which has been fought since you were born  medical men know this well  and when you are older you may see it for yourself in the registrargenerals reports bluebooks pamphlets and so on without end  but why do not people stop such a horrible loss of life  well my dear boy the true causes of it have only been known for the last thirty or forty years and we english are as good king alfred found us to his sorrow a thousand years ago very slow to move even when we see a thing ought to be done  let us hope that in this matterwe have been so in most matters as yetwe shall be like the tortoise in the fable and not the hare and by moving slowly but surely win the race at last  but now think for yourself  and see what you would do to save these people from being poisoned by bad water  remember that the plain question is this  the rainwater comes down from heaven as water and nothing but water  rainwater is the only pure water after all  how would you save that for the poor people who have none  there run away and hunt rabbits on the moor  but look meanwhile how you would save some of this beautiful and precious water which is roaring away into the sea      well  what would you do  make ponds you say like the old monks ponds now all broken down  dam all the glens across their mouths and turn them into reservoirs  out of the mouths of babes and sucklingswell that will have to be done  that is being done more and more more or less well the good people of glasgow did it first i think and now the good people of manchester and of other northern towns have done it and have saved many a human life thereby already  but it must be done some day all over england and wales and great part of scotland  for the mountain tops and moors my boy by a beautiful law of nature compensate for their own poverty by yielding a wealth which the rich lowlands cannot yield  you do not understand  then see  yon moor above can grow neither corn nor grass  but one thing it can grow and does grow without which we should have no corn nor grass and that iswater  not only does far more rain fall up there than falls here down below but even in drought the high moors condense the moisture into dew and so yield some water even when the lowlands are burnt up with drought  the reason of that you must learn hereafter  that it is so you should know yourself  for on the high chalk downs you know where farmers make a sheeppond they never if they are wise make it in a valley or on a hillside but on the bleakest top of the very highest down and there if they can once get it filled with snow and rain in winter the blessed dews of night will keep some water in it all the summer through while the ponds below are utterly dried up  and even so it is as i know with this very moor  corn and grass it will not grow because there is too little staple that is soluble minerals in the sandy soil but how much water it might grow you may judge roughly for yourself by remembering how many brooks like this are running off it now to carry mere dirt into the river and then into the sea  but why should we not make dams at once and save the water  because we cannot afford it  no one would buy the water when we had stored it  the rich in town and country will always take careand quite right they areto have water enough for themselves and for their servants too whatever it may cost them but the poorer people areand therefore usually alas the more ignorantthe less water they get and the less they care to have water and the less they are inclined to pay for it and the more i am sorry to say they waste what little they do get and i am still more sorry to say spoil and even steal and sellin london at leastthe stopcocks and leadpipes which bring the water into their houses  so that keeping a watershop is a very troublesome and uncertain business and one which is not likely to pay us or anyone round here  but why not let some company manage it as they manage railways and gas and other things  ahyou have been overhearing a good deal about companies of late i see  but this i will tell you that when you grow up and have a vote and influence it will be your duty if you intend to be a good citizen not only not to put the watersupply of england into the hands of fresh companies but to help to take out of their hands what watersupply they manage already especially in london and likewise the gassupply and the railroads and everything else in a word which everybody uses and must use for you must understandat least as soon as you canthat though the men who make up companies are no worse than other men and some of them as you ought to know very good men yet what they have to look to is their profits and the less water they supply and the worse it is the more profit they make  for most water i am sorry to say is fouled before the water companies can get to it as this water which runs past us will be and as the thames water above london is  therefore it has to be cleansed or partly cleansed at a very great expense  so water companies have to be inspectedin plain english watchedat a very heavy expense to the nation by government officers and compelled to do their best and take their utmost care  and so it has come to pass that the london water is not now nearly as bad as some of it was thirty years ago when it was no more fit to drink than that in the cattleyard tank  but still we must have more water and better in london for it is growing year by year  there are more than three millions of people already in what we call london and ere you are an old man there may be between four and five millions now to supply all these people with water is a duty which we must not leave to any private companies  it must be done by a public authority as is fit and proper in a free selfgoverning country in this matter as in all others we will try to do what the royal commission told us four years ago we ought to do  i hope that you will see though i may not the day when what we call london but which is really ninetenths of it only a great nest of separate villages huddled together will be divided into three great self governing cities london westminster and southwark each with its own corporation like that of the venerable and wellgoverned city of london each managing its own watersupply gassupply and sewage and other matters besides and managing them like dublin glasgow manchester liverpool and other great northern towns far more cheaply and far better than any companies can do it for them  but where shall we get water enough for all these millions of people  there are no mountains near london  but we might give them the water off our moors  no no my boy   he that will not when he may when he will he shall have nay   some fifteen years ago the londoners might have had water from us and i was one of those who did my best to get it for them  but the water companies did not choose to take it and now this part of england is growing so populous and so valuable that it wants all its little rainfall for itself  so there is another leaf torn out of the sibylline books for the poor old water companies  you do not understand  you will some day  but you may comfort yourself about london  for it happens to be i think the luckiest city in the world and if it had not been we should have had pestilence on pestilence in it as terrible as the great plague of charles iis time  the old britons without knowing in the least what they were doing settled old london city in the very centre of the most wonderful natural reservoir in this island or perhaps in all europe which reaches from kent into wiltshire and round again into suffolk and that is the dear old chalk downs  why they are always dry  yes  but the turf on them never burns up and the streams which flow through them never run dry and seldom or never flood either do you not know from winchester that that is true  then where is all the rain and snow gone which falls on them year by year but into the chalk itself and into the greensands too below the chalk  there it is soaked up as by a sponge in quantity incalculable enough some think to supply london let it grow as huge as it may  i wish i too were sure of that  but the commission has shown itself so wise and fair and brave likewise too brave i am sorry to say for some who might have supported themthat it is not for me to gainsay their opinion  but if there was not water enough in the chalk are not the londoners rich enough to bring it from any distance  my boy in this also we will agree with the commissionthat we ought not to rob peter to pay paul and take water to a distance which other people close at hand may want  look at the map of england and southern scotland and see for yourself what is just according to geography and nature  there are four mountain ranges four great waterfields  first the hills of the border their rainfall ought to be stored for the lothians and the extreme north of england  then the yorkshire and derbyshire hillsthe central chine of england  their rainfall is being stored already to the honour of the shrewd northern men for the manufacturing counties east and west of the hills  then come the lake mountainsthe finest waterfield of all because more rain by far falls there than in any place in england  but they will be wanted to supply lancashire and some day liverpool itself for liverpool is now using rain which belongs more justly to other towns and besides there are plenty of counties and towns down into cheshire which would be glad of what water lancashire does not want  at last come the snowdon mountains a noble waterfield which i know well for an old dream of mine has been that ere i died i should see all the rain of the carnedds and the glyders and siabod and snowdon itself carried across the conway river to feed the mining districts of north wales where the streams are now all foul with oil and lead and then on into the western coal and iron fields to wolverhampton and birmingham itself  and if i were the engineer who got that done i should be happierprouder i dare not saythan if i had painted nobler pictures than raffaelle or written nobler plays than shakespeare  i say that boy in most deliberate earnest  but meanwhile do you not see that in districts where coal and iron may be found and fresh manufactures may spring up any day in any place each district has a right to claim the nearest rainfall for itself  and now when we have got the water into its proper place let us see what we shall do with it  but why do you say we  can you and i do all this  my boy are not you and i free citizens part of the people the commonsas the good old word runsof this country  and are we notor ought we not to be in timebeside that educated men  by the people remember i mean not only the handworking man who has just got a vote i mean the clergy of all denominations and the gentlemen of the press and last but not least the scientific men  if those four classes together were to tell every governmentfree water we will have and as much as we reasonably choose and tell every candidate for the house of commons unless you promise to get us as much free water as we reasonably choose we will not return you to parliament then i think we four should put such a pressure on government as no water companies or other vested interests could long resist  and if any of those four classes should hang back and waste their time and influence over matters far less important and less pressing the other three must laugh at them and more than laugh at them and ask them  why have you education why have you influence why have you votes why are you freemen and not slaves if not to preserve the comfort the decency the health the lives of men women and childrenmost of those latter your own wives and your own children  but what shall we do with the water  well after all that is a more practical matter than speculations grounded on the supposition that all classes will do their duty  but the first thing we will do will be to give to the very poorest houses a constant supply at high pressure so that everybody may take as much water as he likes instead of having to keep the water in little cisterns where it gets foul and putrid only too often  but will they not waste it then  so far from it wherever the water has been laid on at high pressure the waste which is terrible nowsome say that in london onethird of the water is wastedbegins to lessen and both water and expense are saved  if you will only think you will see one reason why  if a woman leaves a highpressure tap running she will flood her place and her neighbours too  she will be like the magicians servant who called up the demon to draw water for him and so he did  but when he had begun he would not stop and if the magician had not come home man and house would have been washed away  but if it saves money why do not the water companies do it  becauseand really here there are many excuses for the poor old water companies when so many of them swerve and gib at the very mention of constant watersupply like a poor horse set to draw a load which he feels is too heavy for himbecause to keep everything in order among dirty careless and often drunken people there must be officers with lawful authoritywater policemen we will call themwho can enter peoples houses when they will and if they find anything wrong with the water set it to rights with a high hand and even summon the people who have set it wrong  and that is a power which in a free country must never be given to the servants of any private company but only to the officers of a corporation or of the government  and what shall we do with the rest of the water  well we shall have i believe so much to spare that we may at least do this  in each district of each city and the centre of each town we may build public baths and lavatories where poor men and women may get their warm baths when they will for now they usually never bathe at all because they will notand ought not if they be hardworked folkbathe in cold water during nine months of the year  and there they shall wash their clothes and dry them by steam instead of washing them as now at home either under back sheds where they catch cold and rheumatism or too often alas in their own living rooms in an atmosphere of foul vapour which drives the father to the publichouse and the children into the streets and which not only prevents the clothes from being thoroughly dried again but is my dear boy as you will know when you are older a very hotbed of disease  and they shall have other comforts and even luxuries these public lavatories and be made in time graceful and refining as well as merely useful  nay we will even i think have in front of each of them a real fountain not like the drinkingfountains though they are great and needful boonswhich you see here and there about the streets with a tiny dribble of water to a great deal of expensive stone  but real fountains which shall leap and sparkle and plash and gurgle and fill the place with life and light and coolness and sing in the peoples ears the sweetest of all earthly songssave the song of a mother over her childthe song of the laughing water  but will not that be a waste  yes my boy  and for that very reason i think we the people will have our fountains if it be but to make our governments and corporations and all public bodies and officers remember that they allsave her majesty the queenare our servants and not we theirs and that we choose to have water not only to wash with but to play with if we like  and i believefor the world as you will find is full not only of just but of generous souls that if the watersupply were set really right there would be found in many a city many a generous man who over and above his compulsory waterrate would give his poor fellowtownsmen such a real fountain as those which ennoble the great square at carcasonne and the great square at nismes to be a thing of beauty and a joy for ever  and now if you want to go back to your latin and greek you shall translate for me into latini do not expect you to do it into greek though it would turn very well into greek for the greeks know all about the matter long before the romanswhat follows here and you shall verify the facts and the names etc in it from your dictionaries of antiquity and biography that you may remember all the better what it says  and by that time i think you will have learnt something more useful to yourself and i hope to your country hereafter than if you had learnt to patch together the neatest greek and latin verses which have appeared since the days of mr canning      i have often amused myself by fancying one question which an old roman emperor would ask were he to rise from his grave and visit the sights of london under the guidance of some minister of state the august shade would doubtless admire our railroads and bridges our cathedrals and our public parks and much more of which we need not be ashamed  but after awhile i think he would look round whether in london or in most of our great cities inquiringly and in vain for one class of buildings which in his empire were wont to be almost as conspicuous and as splendid because in public opinion almost as necessary as the basilicas and temples  and where he would ask are your public baths and if the minister of state who was his guide should answer  oh great caesar i really do not know  i believe there are some somewhere at the back of that ugly building which we call the national gallery and i think there have been some meetings lately in the east end and an amateur concert at the albert hall for restoring by private subscriptions some baths and washhouses in bethnal green which had fallen to decay  and there may be two or three more about the metropolis for parish vestries have powers by act of parliament to establish such places if they think fit and choose to pay for them out of the rates  then i think the august shade might well make answer  we used to call you in old rome northern barbarians  it seems that you have not lost all your barbarian habits  are you aware that in every city in the roman empire there were as a matter of course public baths open not only to the poorest freeman but to the slave usually for the payment of the smallest current coin and often gratuitously  are you aware that in rome itself millionaire after millionaire emperor after emperor from menenius agrippa and nero down to diocletian and constantine built baths and yet more baths and connected with them gymnasia for exercise lecturerooms libraries and porticoes wherein the people might have shade and shelter and rest  i remark bythebye that i have not seen in all your london a single covered place in which the people may take shelter during a shower  are you aware that these baths were of the most magnificent architecture decorated with marbles paintings sculptures fountains what not  and yet i had heard in hades down below that you prided yourselves here on the study of the learned languages and indeed taught little but greek and latin at your public schools  then if the minister should make reply  oh yes we know all this  even since the revival of letters in the end of the fifteenth century a whole literature has been writtena great deal of it i fear by pedants who seldom washed even their hands and facesabout your greek and roman baths  we visit their colossal ruins in italy and elsewhere with awe and admiration and the discovery of a new roman bath in any old city of our isles sets all our antiquaries buzzing with interest  then why the shade might ask do you not copy an example which you so much admire  surely england must be much in want either of water or of fuel to heat it with  on the contrary our rainfall is almost too great our soil so damp that we have had to invent a whole art of subsoil drainage unknown to you while as for fuel our coalmines make us the great fuelexporting people of the world  what a quiet sneer might curl the lip of a constantine as he replied  not in vain as i said did we call you some fifteen hundred years ago the barbarians of the north  but tell me good barbarian whom i know to be both brave and wisefor the fame of your young british empire has reached us even in the realms below and we recognise in you with all respect a people more like us romans than any which has appeared on earth for many centuries how is it you have forgotten that sacred duty of keeping the people clean which you surely at one time learnt from us  when your ancestors entered our armies and rose some of them to be great generals and even emperors like those two teuton peasants justin and justinian who long after my days reigned in my own constantinople  then at least you saw baths and used them and felt after the bath that you were civilised men and not sordidi ac foetentes as we used to call you when fresh out of your bullockwaggons and cattlepens  how is it that you have forgotten that lesson  the minister i fear would have to answer that our ancestors were barbarous enough not only to destroy the roman cities and temples and basilicas and statues but the roman baths likewise and then retired each man to his own freehold in the country to live a life not much more cleanly or more graceful than that of the swine which were his favourite food  but he would have a right to plead as an excuse that not only in england but throughout the whole of the conquered latin empire the latin priesthood who in some respects wereto their honourthe representatives of roman civilisation and the protectors of its remnants were the determined enemies of its cleanliness that they looked on personal dirtlike the old hermits of the thebaid as a sign of sanctity and discouragedas they are said to do still in some of the romance countries of europethe use of the bath as not only luxurious but also indecent  at which answer it seems to me another sneer might curl the lip of the august shade as he said to himself  this at least i did not expect when i made christianity the state religion of my empire  but you good barbarian look clean enough  you do not look on dirt as a sign of sanctity  on the contrary sire the upper classes of our empire boast of being the cleanliestperhaps the only perfectly cleanlypeople in the world  except of course the savages of the south seas and dirt is so far from being a thing which we admire that our scientific menthan whom the world has never seen wiserhave proved to us for a whole generation past that dirt is the fertile cause of disease and drunkenness misery and recklessness  and therefore replies the shade ere he disappears of discontent and revolution  followed by a tyranny endured as in rome and many another place by men once free because tyranny will at least do for them what they are too lazy and cowardly and greedy to do for themselves  farewell and prosper as you seem likely to prosper on the whole  but if you wish me to consider you a civilised nation  let me hear that you have brought a great river from the depths of the earth be they a thousand fathoms deep or from your nearest mountains be they five hundred miles away and have washed out londons dirtand your own shame  till then abstain from judging too harshly a constantine or even a caracalla for they whatever were their sins built baths and kept their people clean  but do your gymnasiayour schools and universities teach your youth naught about all this    the tree of knowledge    the more i have contemplated that ancient story of the fall the more it has seemed to me within the range of probability and even of experience  it must have happened somewhere for the first time for it has happened only too many times since  it has happened as far as i can ascertain in every race and every age and every grade of civilisation  it is happening round us now in every region of the globe  always and everywhere it seems to me have poor human beings been tempted to eat of some tree of knowledge that they may be even for an hour as gods wise but with a false wisdom careless but with a frantic carelessness and happy but with a happiness which when the excitement is past leaves too oftenas with that hapless pair in eden depression shame and fear  everywhere and in all ages as far as i can ascertain has man been inventing stimulants and narcotics to supply that want of vitality of which he is so painfully aware and has asked nature and not god to clear the dull brain and comfort the weary spirit  this has been and will be perhaps for many a century to come almost the most fearful failing of this poor exceptional over organised diseased and truly fallen being called man who is in doubt daily whether he be a god or an ape and in trying wildly to become the former ends but too often in becoming the latter  for man whether savage or civilised feels and has felt in every age that there is something wrong with him  he usually confesses this factas is to be expectedof his fellowmen rather than of himself and shows his sense that there is something wrong with them by complaining of hating and killing them  but he cannot always conceal from himself the fact that he too is wrong as well as they and as he will not usually kill himself he tries wild ways to make himself at least feelif not to besomewhat better  philosophers may bid him be content and tell him that he is what he ought to be and what nature has made him  but he cares nothing for the philosophers  he knows usually that he is not what he ought to be that he carries about with him in most cases a body more or less diseased and decrepit incapable of doing all the work which he feels that he himself could do or expressing all the emotions which he himself longs to express a dull brain and dull senses which cramp the eager infinity within him asso goethe once said with pitythe horses single hoof cramps the fine intelligence and generosity of his nature and forbids him even to grasp an object like the more stupid cat and baser monkey  and man has a self too within from which he longs too often to escape as from a household ghost who pulls out at unfortunately rude and unwelcome hours the ledger of memory  and so when the tempterbe he who he maysays to him take this and you will feel better  take this and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil then if the temptation was as the old story says too much for man while healthy and unfallen what must it be for his unhealthy and fallen children  in vain we say to man   tis life not death for which you pant tis life whereof your nerves are scant more life and fuller that you want   and your tree of knowledge is not the tree of life  it is in every case the tree of death of decrepitude madness misery he prefers the voice of the tempter  thou shalt not surely die nay he will say at last  better be as gods awhile and die than be the crawling insufficient thing i am and live  hedid i say  alas i must say she likewise  the sacred story is only too true to fact when it represents the woman as falling not merely at the same time as the man but before the man  only let us remember that it represents the woman as tempted tempted seemingly by a rational being of lower race and yet of superior cunning who must therefore have fallen before the woman  who or what the being was who is called the serpent in our translation of genesis it is not for me to say  we have absolutely i think no facts from which to judge and rabbinical traditions need trouble no man much  but i fancy that a missionary preaching on this story to negroes telling them plainly that the serpent meant the first obeah man and then comparing the experiences of that hapless pair in eden with their own after certain orgies not yet extinct in africa and elsewhere would be only too well understood  so well indeed that he might run some risk of eating himself not of the tree of life but of that of death  the sorcerer or sorceress tempting the woman and then the woman tempting the man this seems to be certainly among savage peoples and alas too often among civilised peoples also the usual course of the worldwide tragedy  butparadoxical as it may seemthe womans yielding before the man is not altogether to her dishonour as those old monks used to allege who hated and too often tortured the sex whom they could not enjoy  it is not to the womans dishonour if she felt before her husband higher aspirations than those after mere animal pleasure  to be as gods knowing good and evil is a vain and foolish but not a base and brutal wish  she proved herself therebythough at an awful costa woman and not an animal  and indeed the womans more delicate organisation her more vivid emotions her more voluble fancy as well as her mere physical weakness and weariness have been to her in all ages a special source of temptation which it is to her honour that she has resisted so much better than the physically stronger and therefore more culpable man  as for what the tree of knowledge was there really is no need for us to waste our time in guessing  if it was not one plant then it was another  it may have been something which has long since perished off the earth  it may have beenas some learned men have guessedthe sacred soma or homa of the early brahmin race and that may have been a still existing narcotic species of asclepias  it certainly was not the vine  the language of the hebrew scripture concerning it and the sacred use to which it is consecrated in the gospels forbid that notion utterly at least to those who know enough of antiquity to pass by with a smile the theory that the wines mentioned in scripture were not intoxicating  and yetas a fresh corroboration of what i am trying to sayhow fearfully has that noble gift to man been abused for the same end as a hundred other vegetable products ever since those mythic days when dionusos brought the vine from the far east amid troops of human maenads and halfhuman satyrs and the bacchae tore pentheus in pieces on cithaeron for daring to intrude upon their sacred rites and since those historic days too when less than two hundred years before the christian era the bacchic rites spread from southern italy into etruria and thence to the matrons of rome and under the guidance of poenia annia a campanian lady took at last shapes of which no man must speak but which had to be put down with terrible but just severity by the consuls and the senate  but it matters little i say what this same tree of knowledge was  was every vine on earth destroyed tomorrow and every vegetable also from which alcohol is now distilled man would soon discover something else wherewith to satisfy the insatiate craving  has he not done so already  has not almost every people had its tree of knowledge often more deadly than any distilled liquor from the absinthe of the cultivated frenchman and the opium of the cultivated chinese down to the bushpoisons wherewith the tropic sorcerer initiates his dupes into the knowledge of good and evil and the fungus from which the samoiede extracts in autumn a few days of brutal happiness before the setting in of the long six months night  god grant that modern science may not bring to light fresh substitutes for alcohol opium and the rest and give the white races in that state of effeminate and godless quasicivilisation which i sometimes fear is creeping upon them fresh means of destroying themselves delicately and pleasantly off the face of the earth  it is said by some that drunkenness is on the increase in this island  i have no trusty proof of it  but i can believe it possible for every cause of drunkenness seems on the increase overwork of body and mind circumstances which depress health temptation to drink and drink again at every corner of the streets and finally money and ever more money in the hands of uneducated people who have not the desire and too often not the means of spending it in any save the lowest pleasures  these it seems to me are the true causes of drunkenness increasing or not  and if we wish to become a more temperate nation we must lessen them if we cannot eradicate them  first overwork  we all live too fast and work too hard  all things are full of labour man cannot utter it  in the heavy struggle for existence which goes on all around us each man is tasked more and moreif he be really worth buying and usingto the utmost of his powers all day long  the weak have to compete on equal terms with the strong and crave in consequence for artificial strength  how we shall stop that i know not while every man is making haste to be rich and piercing himself through with many sorrows and falling into foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition  how we shall stop that i say i know not  the old prophet may have been right when he said  surely it is not of the lord that the people shall labour in the very fire and weary themselves for very vanity and in some juster wiser more sober system of society somewhat more like the kingdom of the father come on earthit may be that poor human beings will not need to toil so hard and to keep themselves up to their work by stimulants but will have time to sit down and look around them and think of god and gods quiet universe with something of quiet in themselves something of rational leisure and manful sobriety of mind as well as of body  but it seems to me also that in such a state of society whenas it was once well putevery one has stopped running about like ratsthat those who work hard whether with muscle or with brain would not be surrounded as now with every circumstance which tempts toward drink by every circumstance which depresses the vital energies and leaves them an easy prey to pestilence itself by bad light bad air bad food bad water bad smells bad occupations which weaken the muscles cramp the chest disorder the digestion  let any rational man fresh from the countryin which i presume god having made it meant all men more or less to livego through the back streets of any city or through whole districts of the black countries of england and then ask himself  is it the will of god that his human children should live and toil in such dens such deserts such dark places of the earth  lot him ask himself  can they live and toil there without contracting a probably diseased habit of body without contracting a certainly dull weary sordid habit of mind which craves for any pleasure however brutal to escape from its own stupidity and emptiness  when i run through by rail certain parts of the ironproducing countrystreets of furnaces collieries slag heaps mud slop brick houserows smoke dirt and that is all and when i am told whether truly or falsely that the main thing which the wellpaid and wellfed men of those abominable wastes care for isgood fightingdogs  i can only answer that i am not surprised  i sayas i have said elsewhere and shall do my best to say it againthat the craving for drink and narcotics especially that engendered in our great cities is not a disease but a symptom of disease of a far deeper disease than any which drunkenness can produce namely of the growing degeneracy of a population striving in vain by stimulants and narcotics to fight against those slow poisons with which our greedy barbarism miscalled civilisation has surrounded them from the cradle to the grave  i may be answered that the old german angle dane drank heavily i know it  but why did they drink save for the same reason that the fenman drank and his wife took opium at least till the fens were drained why but to keep off the depressing effects of the malaria of swamps and new clearings which told on themwho always settled in the lowest groundsin the shape of fever and ague  here it may be answered again that stimulants have been during the memory of man the destruction of the red indian race in america  i reply boldly that i do not believe it  there is evidence enough in jacques cartiers voyages to the rivers of canada and evidence more than enough in stracheys travaile in virginiato quote only two authorities out of manyto prove that the red indians when the white man first met with them were in north and south alike a diseased decaying and as all their traditions confess decreasing race  such a race would naturally crave for the water of life the usquebagh or whisky as we have contracted the old name now  but i should have thought that the white man by introducing among these poor creatures iron firearms blankets and above all horses wherewith to follow the buffaloherds which they could never follow on foot must have done ten times more towards keeping them alive than he has done towards destroying them by giving them the chance of a weeks drunkenness twice a year when they came in to his forts to sell the skins which without his gifts they would never have got  such a race would of course if wanting vitality crave for stimulants  but if the stimulants and not the original want of vitality combined with morals utterly detestable and worthy only of the gallowsand here i know what i say and dare not tell what i know from eyewitnesseshave been the cause of the red indians extinction then how is it let me ask that the irishman and the scotsman have often to their great harm been drinking as much whiskyand usually very bad whiskynot merely twice a year but as often as they could get it during the whole iron age and for aught anyone can tell during the bronze age and the stone age before that and yet are still the most healthy able valiant and prolific races in europe  had they drunk less whisky they would doubtless have been more healthy able valiant and perhaps even more prolific than they are now  they show no sign however as yet of going the way of the red indian  but if the craving for stimulants and narcotics is a token of deficient vitality then the deadliest foe of that craving and all its miserable results is surely the sanatory reformer the man who preaches andas far as ignorance and vested interests will allow him procuresfor the masses pure air pure sunlight pure water pure dwellinghouses pure food  not merely every fresh drinkingfountain but every fresh public bath and wash house every fresh open space every fresh growing tree every fresh open window every fresh flower in that windoweach of these is so much as the old persians would have said conquered for ormuzd the god of light and life out of the dominion of ahriman the king of darkness and of death so much taken from the causes of drunkenness and disease and added to the causes of sobriety and health  meanwhile one thing is clear  that if this present barbarism and anarchy of covetousness miscalled modern civilisation were tamed and drilled into something more like a kingdom of god on earth then we should not see the reckless and needless multiplication of liquor shops which disgraces this country now  as a single instance  in one country parish of nine hundred inhabitants in which the population has increased only oneninth in the last fifty years there are now practically eight public houses where fifty years ago there were but two  one that is for every hundred and tenor rather omitting children farmers shopkeepers gentlemen and their households one for every fifty of the inhabitants  in the face of the allurements often of the basest kind which these dens offer the clergyman and the schoolmaster struggle in vain to keep up night schools and young mens clubs and to inculcate habits of providence  the young labourers over a great part of the south and east at least of englandthough never so well off for several generations as they are noware growing up thriftless shiftless inferior it seems to me to their grandfathers in everything save that they can usually read and write and their grandfathers could not and that they wear smart cheap cloth clothes instead of their grandfathers smockfrocks  and if it be so in the country how must it be in towns  there must come a thorough change in the present licensing system in spite of all the pressure which certain powerful vested interests may bring to bear on governments  and it is the duty of every good citizen who cares for his countrymen and for their children after them to help in bringing about that change as speedily as possible  again  i said just now that a probable cause of increasing drunkenness was the increasing material prosperity of thousands who knew no recreation beyond low animal pleasure  if i am right and i believe that i am righti must urge on those who wish drunkenness to decrease the necessity of providing more and more refined recreation for the people  men drink and women too remember not merely to supply exhaustion not merely to drive away care but often simply to drive away dulness  they have nothing to do save to think over what they have done in the day or what they expect to do to morrow and they escape from that dreary round of business thought in liquor or narcotics  there are still those by no means of the handworking class but absorbed all day by business who drink heavily at night in their own comfortable homes simply to recreate their overburdened minds  such cases doubtless are far less common than they were fifty years ago  but why  is not the decrease of drinking among the richer classes certainly due to the increased refinement and variety of their tastes and occupations  in cultivating the aesthetic side of mans nature in engaging him with the beautiful the pure the wonderful the truly natural with painting poetry music horticulture physical sciencein all this lies recreation in the true and literal sense of that word namely the recreating and mending of the exhausted mind and feelings such as no rational man will now neglect either for himself his children or his workpeople  but how little of all this is open to the masses all should know but too well  how little opportunity the average handworker or his wife has of eating of any tree of knowledge save of the very basest kind is but too palpable  we are mending thank god in this respect  free libraries and museums have sprung up of late in other cities beside london  gods blessing rest upon them all and the crystal palace and still later the bethnal green museum have been i believe of far more use than many average sermons and lectures from many average orators  but are we not still far behind the old greeks and the romans of the empire likewise in the amount of amusement and instruction and even of shelter which we provide for the people  recollect theto medisgraceful fact that there is not as far as i am aware throughout the whole of london a single portico or other covered place in which the people can take refuge during a shower  and this in the climate of england  where they do take refuge on a wet day the publican knows but too well as he knows also where thousands of the lower classes simply for want of any other place to be in save their own sordid dwellings spend as much as they are permitted of the sabbath day  let us put down sunday drinking by all means if we can  but let us remember that by closing the publichouses on sunday we prevent no man or woman from carrying home as much poison as they choose on saturday night to brutalise themselves therewith perhaps for eightand forty hours  and let us seein the name of him who said that he had made the sabbath for man and not man for the sabbathlet us see i say if we cannot do something to prevent the townsmans sabbath being not a day of rest but a day of mere idleness the day of most temptation because of most dulness of the whole seven  and here perhaps some sweet soul may look up reprovingly and say he talks of rest  does he forget and would he have the working man forget that all these outward palliatives will never touch the seat of the disease the unrest of the soul within  does he forget and would he have the working man forget who it was who saidwho only has the right to say  come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest   ah no sweet soul  i know your words are true  i know that what we all want is inward rest rest of heart and brain the calm strong selfcontained selfdenying character which needs no stimulants for it has no fits of depression which needs no narcotics for it has no fits of excitement which needs no ascetic restraints for it is strong enough to use gods gifts without abusing them the character in a word which is truly temperate not in drink or food merely but in all desires thoughts and actions freed from the wild lusts and ambitions to which that old adam yielded and seeking for light and life by means forbidden found thereby disease and death  yes i know that and know too that that rest is found only where you have already found it  and yet in such a world as this governed by a being who has made sunshine and flowers and green grass and the song of birds and happy human smiles and who would educate by themif we would let himhis human children from the cradle to the grave in such a world as this will you grudge any particle of that education even any harmless substitute for it to those spirits in prison whose surroundings too often tempt them from the cradle to the grave to fancy that the world is composed of bricks and iron and governed by inspectors and policemen  preach to those spirits in prison as you know far better than we parsons how to preach but let them have besides some glimpses of the splendid fact that outside their prisonhouse is a world which god not man has made wherein grows everywhere that tree of knowledge which is likewise the tree of life and that they have a right to some small share of its beauty and its wonder and its rest for their own health of soul and body and for the health of their children after them    great cities and their influence for good and evil 9    the pleasure gentlemen and ladies of addressing you here is mixed in my mind with very solemn feelings the honour which you have done me is tempered by humiliating thoughts  for it was in this very city of bristol twentyseven years ago that i received my first lesson in what is now called social science and yet alas more than ten years elapsed ere i could even spell out that lesson though it had been written for me as well as for all england in letters of flame from the one end of heaven to the other  i was a schoolboy in clifton up above  i had been hearing of political disturbances even of riots of which i understood nothing and for which i cared nothing  but on one memorable sunday afternoon i saw an object which was distinctly not political  otherwise i should have no right to speak of it here  it was an afternoon of sullen autumn rain  the fog hung thick over the docks and lowlands  glaring through that fog i saw a bright mass of flamealmost like a halfrisen sun  that i was told was the gate of the new gaol on fire  that the prisoners in it had been set free that but why speak of what too many here recollect but too well  the fog rolled slowly upward  dark figures even at that great distance were flitting to and fro across what seemed the mouth of the pit  the flame increasedmultipliedat one point after another till by ten oclock that night i seemed to be looking down upon dantes inferno and to hear the multitudinous moan and wail of the lost spirits surging to and fro amid that sea of fire  right behind brandon hillhow can i ever forget itrose the great central mass of fire till the little mound seemed converted into a volcano from the peak of which the flame streamed up not red alone but delicately green and blue pale rose and pearly white while crimson sparks leapt and fell again in the midst of that rainbow not of hope but of despair and dull explosions down below mingled with the roar of the mob and the infernal hiss and crackle of the flame  higher and higher the fog was scorched and shrivelled upward by the fierce heat below glowing through and through with red reflected glare till it arched itself into one vast dome of red hot iron fit roof for all the madness down belowand beneath it miles away i could see the lonely tower of dundie shining red the symbol of the old faith looking down in stately wonder and sorrow upon the fearful birththroes of a new age  yeswhy did i say just now despair  i was wrong  birththroes and not death pangs those horrors were  else they would have no place in my discourse no place indeed in my mind  why talk over the signs of disease decay death  let the dead bury their dead and let us follow him who dieth not by whose command   the old order changeth giving place to the new and god fulfils himself in many ways   if we will believe thisif we will look on each convulsion of society however terrible for the time being as a token not of decrepitude but of youth not as the expiring convulsions of sinking humanity but as upward struggles upward toward fuller light freer air a juster simpler and more active lifethen we shall be able to look calmly however sadly on the most appalling tragedies of humanityeven on these late indian ones and take our share faithful and hopeful in supplying the new and deeper wants of a new and nobler time  but to return  it was on the tuesday or wednesday after if i recollect right that i saw another and a still more awful sight along the north side of queen square in front of ruins which had been three days before noble buildings lay a ghastly row not of corpses but of corpsefragments  i have no more wish than you to dilate upon that sight  but there was one charred fragmentwith a scrap of old red petticoat adhering to it which i never forgot which i trust in god that i never shall forget  it is good for a man to be brought once at least in his life face to face with fact ultimate fact however horrible it may be and have to confess to himself shuddering what things are possible upon gods earth when man has forgotten that his only welfare lies in living after the likeness of god  not that i learnt the lesson then  when the first excitement of horror and wonder were past what i had seen made me for years the veriest aristocrat full of hatred and contempt of these dangerous classes whose existence i had for the first time discovered  it required many yearsyears too of personal intercourse with the poorto explain to me the true meaning of what i saw here in october twentyseven years ago and to learn a part of that lesson which god taught to others thereby  and one part at least of that lesson was this  that the social state of a city depends directly on its moral state andi fear dissenting voices but i must say what i believe to be truththat the moral state of a city dependshow far i know not but frightfully to an extent as yet uncalculated and perhaps incalculableon the physical state of that city on the food water air and lodging of its inhabitants  but that lesson and others connected with it was learnt and learnt well by hundreds  from the sad catastrophe i date the rise of that interest in social science that desire for some nobler more methodic more permanent benevolence than that which stops at mere almsgiving and charityschools  the dangerous classes began to be recognised as an awful fact which must be faced and faced not by repression but by improvement  the perils of the nation began to occupy the attention not merely of politicians but of philosophers physicians priests and the admirable book which assumed that title did but reecho the feeling of thousands of earnest hearts  ever since that time scheme on scheme of improvement has been not only proposed but carried out  a general interest of the upper classes in the lower a general desire to do good and to learn how good can be done has been awakened throughout england such as i boldly say never before existed in any country upon earth and england her eyes opened to her neglect of these classes without whose strong arms her wealth and genius would be useless has put herself into a permanent state of confession of sin repentance and amendment which i verily trust will be accepted by almighty god and will in spite of our present shame and sorrow 10 in spite of shame and sorrow which may be yet in store for us save alive both the soul and the body of this ancient people  let us then that we may learn how to bear our part in this great work of social reform consider awhile great cities their good and evil and let us start from the facts about your own city of which i have just put you in remembrance  the universal law will be best understood from the particular instance and best of all from the instance with which you are most intimately acquainted and do not i entreat you fear that i shall be rude enough to say anything which may give pain to you my generous hosts or presumptuous enough to impute blame to anyone for events which happened long ago and of the exciting causes of which i know little or nothing  bristol was then merely in the same state in which other cities of england were and in which every city on the continent is now and the local exciting causes of that outbreak the personal conduct of a or b in it is just what we ought most carefully to forget if we wish to look at the real root of the matter  if consumption latent in the constitution have broken out in active mischief the wise physician will trouble his head little with the particular accident which woke up the sleeping disease  the disease was there and if one thing had not awakened it some other would  and so if the population of a great city have got into a socially diseased state it matters little what shock may have caused it to explode  politics may in one case fanaticism in another national hatred in a third hunger in a fourthperhaps even as in byzantium of old no more important matter than the jealousy between the blue and the green charioteers in the theatre may inflame a whole population to madness and civil war  our business is not with the nature of the igniting spark but of the powder which is ignited  i will not then to begin go as far as some who say that a great city is a great evil  we cannot say that bristol was in 1830 or is now a great evil  it represents so much realised wealth and that again so much employment for thousands  it represents so much commerce so much knowledge of foreign lands so much distribution of their products so much science employed about that distribution  and it is undeniable that as yet we have had no means of rapid and cheap distribution of goods whether imports or manufactures save by this crowding of human beings into great cities for the more easy despatch of business  whether we shall devise other means hereafter is a question of which i shall speak presently meanwhile no man is to be blamed for the existence hardly even for the evils of great cities  the process of their growth has been very simple  they have gathered themselves round abbeys and castles for the sake of protection round courts for the sake of law round ports for the sake of commerce round coal mines for the sake of manufacture  before the existence of railroads pennyposts electric telegraphs men were compelled to be as close as possible to each other in order to work together  when the population was small and commerce feeble the cities grew to no very great size and the bad effects of this crowding were not felt  the cities of england in the middle age were too small to keep their inhabitants week after week month after month in one deadly vapourbath of foul gas and though the mortality among infants was probably excessive yet we should have seen among the adult survivors few or none of those stunted and etiolated figures so common now in england as well as on the continent  the green fields were close outside the walls where lads and lasses went amaying and children gathered flowers and sober burghers with their wives took the evening walk there were the butts too close outside where stalwart prenticelads ran and wrestled and pitched the bar and played backsword and practised with the longbow and sometimes in stormy times turned out for a few months as readytrained soldiers and like ulysses of old   drank delight of battle with their peers   and then returned again to the workshop and the loom  the very mayor and alderman went forth at five oclock on the summers morning with hawk and leapingpole after a duck and heron or hunted the hare in state probably in the full glory of furred gown and gold chain and then returned to breakfast and doubtless transacted their days business all the better for their mornings gallop on the breezy downs  but there was another side to this genial and healthy picture  a hint that this was a state of society which had its conditions its limit and if those were infringed woe alike to burgher and to prentice  every now and then epidemic disease entered the jolly cityand then down went strong and weak rich and poor before the invisible and seemingly supernatural arrows of that angel of death whom they had been pampering unwittingly in every bedroom  they fasted they prayed but in vain  they called the pestilence a judgment of god and they called it by a true name  but they know not and who are we to blame them for not knowing what it was that god was judging therebyfoul air foul water unclean backyards stifling attics houses hanging over the narrow street till light and air were alike shut outthat there lay the sin and that to amend that was the repentance which god demanded  yet we cannot blame them  they showed that the crowded city life can bring out human nobleness as well as human baseness that to be crushed into contact with their fellowmen forced at least the loftier and tender souls to know their fellowmen and therefore to care for them to love them to die for them  yesfrom one temptation the city life is free to which the country life is sadly exposedthat isolation which selfcontented and self helping forgets in its surly independence that man is his brothers keeper  in cities on the contrary we find that the stories of these old pestilences when the first panic terror has past become however tragical still beautiful and heroic and we read of noblehearted men and women palliating ruin which they could not cure braving dangers which seemed to them miraculous from which they were utterly defenceless spending money time and after all life itself upon sufferers from whom they might without shame have fled  they are very cheering the stories of the old city pestilences and the nobleness which they brought out in the heart of many a townsman who had seemed absorbed in the lust of gainwho perhaps had been really absorbed in ittill that fearful hour awakened in him his better self and taught him not selfaggrandisement but selfsacrifice begetting in him out of the very depth of darkness new and divine light  that nobleness doubt it not exists as ever in the hearts of citizens  may god grant us to see the day when it shall awaken to exert itself not for the palliation not even for the cure but for the prevention yea the utter extermination of pestilence  about the middle of the sixteenth century as far as i can ascertain another and even more painful phenomenon appears in our great citiesa dangerous class  how it arose is not yet clear that the reformation had something to do with the matter we can hardly doubt  at the dissolution of the monasteries the more idle ignorant and profligate members of the mendicant orders unable to live any longer on the alms of the public sunk probably into vicious penury  the frightful misgovernment of this country during the minority of edward the sixth especially the conversion of tilled lands into pasture had probably the effect of driving the surplus agricultural population into the great towns  but the social history of this whole period is as yet obscure and i have no right to give an opinion on it another element and a more potent one is to be found in the discharged soldiers who came home from foreign war and the sailors who returned from our voyages of discovery and from our raids against the spaniards too often crippled by scurvy or by tropic fevers with perhaps a little prize money which was as hastily spent as it had been hastily gained  the later years of elizabeth and the whole of james the firsts reign disclose to us an ugly state of society in the low streets of all our seaport towns and bristol as one of the great startingpoints of west indian adventure was probably during the seventeenth century as bad as any city in england  according to ben jonson and the playwriters of his time the beggars become a regular fourth estate with their own laws and even their own languageof which we may remark that the thieves latin of those days is full of german words indicating that its inventors had been employed in the continental wars of the time  how that class sprung up we may see i suppose pretty plainly from shakespeares henry the fifth  whether nym pistol and bardolph doll and mrs quickly existed in the reign of henry the fifth they certainly existed in the reign of elizabeth  they are probably sketches from life of people whom shakespeare had seen in alsatia and the mint  to these merely rascal elements male and female we must add i fear those whom mere penury from sickness failure want of employment drove into dwellings of the lowest order  such people though not criminal themselves are but too likely to become the parents of criminals  i am not blaming them poor souls god forbid  i am merely stating a fact  when we examine into the ultimate cause of a dangerous class into the one property common to all its members whether thieves beggars profligates or the merely pauperisedwe find it to be this loss of selfrespect  as long as that remains poor souls may struggle on heroically pure amid penury filth degradation unspeakable  but when self respect is lost they are lost with it  and whatever may be the fate of virtuous parents children brought up in dens of physical and moral filth cannot retrieve selfrespect  they sink they must sink into a life on a level with the sights sounds aye the very smells which surround them  it is not merely that the childs mind is contaminated by seeing and hearing in overcrowded houses what he should not hear and see  but the whole physical circumstances of his life are destructive of self respect  he has no means for washing himself properly  but he has enough of the innate sense of beauty and fitness to feel that he ought not to be dirty he thinks that others despise him for being dirty and he half despises himself for being so  in all raged schools and reformatories so they tell me the first step toward restoring selfrespect is to make the poor fellows clean from that moment they begin to look on themselves as new menwith a new start new hopes new duties  for not without the deepest physical as well as moral meaning was baptism chosen by the old easterns and adopted by our lord jesus christ as the sign of a new life and outward purity made the token and symbol of that inward purity which is the parent of selfrespect and manliness and a clear conscience of the free forehead and the eye which meets boldly and honestly the eye of its fellowman  but would that mere physical dirt were all that the lad has to contend with  there is the desire of enjoyment  moral and intellectual enjoyment he has none and can have none  but not to enjoy something is to be dead in life and to the lowest physical pleasures he will betake himself and all the more fiercely because his opportunities of enjoyment are so limited  it is a hideous subject i will pass it by very shortly only asking of you as i have to ask daily of myselfthis solemn question  we who have so many comforts so many pleasures of body soul and spirit from the lowest appetite to the highest aspiration that we can gratify each in turn with due and wholesome moderation innocently and innocuouslywho are we that we should judge the poor untaught and overtempted inhabitant of temple street and lewins mead if having but one or two pleasures possible to him he snatches greedily even foully at the little which he has  and this brings me to another and a most fearful evil of great cities namely drunkenness  i am one of those who cannot on scientific grounds consider drunkenness as a cause of evil but as an effect  of course it is a causea cause of endless crime and misery but i am convinced that to cure you must inquire not what it causes but what causes it  and for that we shall not have to seek far  the main exciting cause of drunkenness is i believe firmly bad air and bad lodging  a man shall spend his days between a foul alley where he breathes sulphuretted hydrogen a close workshop where he breathes carbonic acid and a close and foul bedroom where he breathes both  in neither of the three places meanwhile has he his fair share of that mysterious chemical agent without which health is impossible the want of which betrays itself at once in the dull eye the sallow cheeknamely light  believe me it is no mere poetic metaphor which connects in scripture light with life  it is the expression of a deep law one which holds as true in the physical as in the spiritual world a case in which as perhaps in all cases the laws of the visible world are the counterparts of those of the invisible world and earth is the symbol of heaven  deprive then the man of his fair share of fresh air and pure light and what follows  his blood is not properly oxygenated his nervous energy is depressed his digestion impaired especially if his occupation be sedentary or requires much stooping and the cavity of the chest thereby becomes contracted and for that miserable feeling of languor and craving he knows but one remedythe passing stimulus of alcohola passing stimulus leaving fresh depression behind it and requiring fresh doses of stimulant till it becomes a habit a slavery a madness  again there is an intellectual side to the question  the depressed nervous energy the impaired digestion depress the spirits  the man feels low in mind as well as in body  whence shall he seek exhilaration  not in that stifling home which has caused the depression itself  he knows none other than the tavern and the company which the tavern brings god help him  yes ladies and gentlemen it is easy to say god help him but it is not difficult for man to help him also  drunkenness is a very curable malady  the last fifty years has seen it all but die out among the upper classes of this country  and what has caused the improvement  certainly in the first place the spread of education  every man has now a hundred means of rational occupation and amusement which were closed to his grandfather and among the deadliest enemies of drunkenness we may class the printingpress the railroad and the importation of foreign art and foreign science which we owe to the late forty years peace  we can find plenty of amusement now beside the old one of sitting round the table and talking over wine  why should not the poor man share in our gain  but over and above there are causes simply physical  our houses are better ventilated  the stifling old fourpost bed has given place to the airy curtainless one and what is more than allwe wash that morning cold bath which foreigners consider as young englands strangest superstition has done as much believe me to abolish drunkenness as any other cause whatsoever  with a clean skin in healthy action and nerves and muscles braced by a sudden shock men do not crave for artificial stimulants  i have found that coeteris paribus a mans sobriety is in direct proportion to his cleanliness  i believe it would be so in all classes had they the means  and they ought to have the means  whatever other rights a man has or ought to have this at least he has if society demands of him that he should earn his own livelihood and not be a torment and a burden to his neighbours  he has a right to water to air to light  in demanding that he demands no more than nature has given to the wild beast of the forest  he is better than they treat him then as well as god has treated them  if we require of him to be a man we must at least put him on a level with the brutes  we have then first of all to face the existence of a dangerous class of this kind into which the weaker as well as the worst members of society have a continual tendency to sink  a class which not respecting itself does not respect others which has nothing to lose and all to gain by anarchy in which the lowest passions seldom gratified are ready to burst out and avenge themselves by frightful methods  for the reformation of that class thousands of good men are now working hundreds of benevolent plans are being set on foot honour to them all whether they succeed or fail each of them does some good each of them rescues at least a few fellowmen dear to god as you and i are out of the nether pit  honour to them all i say but i should not be honest with you this night if i did not assert most solemnly my conviction that reformatories ragged schools even hospitals and asylums treat only the symptoms not the actual causes of the disease and that the causes are only to be touched by improving the simple physical conditions of the class by abolishing foul air foul water foul lodging overcrowded dwellings in which morality is difficult and common decency impossible  you may breed a pig in a sty ladies and gentlemen and make a learned pig of him after all but you cannot breed a man in a sty and make a learned man of him or indeed in the true sense of that great word a man at all  and remember that these physical influences of great cities physically depressing and morally degrading influence though to a less extent the classes above the lowest stratum  the honest and skilled workman feels their effects  compelled too often to live where he can in order to be near his work he finds himself perpetually in contact with a class utterly inferior to himself and his children exposed to contaminating influences from which he would gladly remove them but how can he  next door to him even in the same house with him may be enacted scenes of brutality or villainy which i will not speak of here  he may shut his own eyes and ears to them but he cannot shut his childrens he may vex his righteous soul daily like lot of old with the foul conversation of the wicked but like lot of old he cannot keep his children from mixing with the inhabitants of the wicked city learning their works and at last being involved in their doom  oh ladies and gentlemen if there be one class for whom above all others i will plead in season and out of season if there be one social evil which i will din into the ears of my countrymen whenever god gives me a chance it is this  the honest and the virtuous workman and his unnatural contact with the dishonest and the foul  i know well the nobleness which exists in the average of that class in men and in wivestheir stern uncomplaining valorous selfdenial and nothing more stirs my pity than to see them struggling to bring up a family in a moral and physical atmosphere where right education is impossible  we lavish sympathy enough upon the criminal for gods sake let us keep a little of it for the honest man  we spend thousands in carrying out the separation of classes in prison for gods sake let us try to separate them a little before they go to prison  we are afraid of the dangerous classes for gods sake let us bestir ourselves to stop that reckless confusion and neglect which reign in the alleys and courts of our great towns and which recruit those very dangerous classes from the class which ought to be and is still in spite of our folly englands strength and englands glory  let us no longer stand by idle and see moral purity in street after street pent in the same noisome den with moral corruption to be involved in one common doom as the latin tyrant of old used to bind together the dead corpse and the living victim  but let the man who would deserve well of his city well of his country set his heart and brain to the great purpose of giving the workmen dwellings fit for a virtuous and a civilised being and like the priest of old stand between the living and the dead that the plague may be stayed  hardly less is the present physical state of our great cities felt by that numerous class which is next to the employer the most important in a city  i mean the shopmen clerks and all the men principally young ones who are employed exclusively in the work of distribution  i have a great respect i may say affection for this class  in bristol i know nothing of them save that from what i hear the clerks ought in general to have a better status here than in most cities  i am told that it is the practice here for merchants to take into their houses very young boys and train them to their business that this connection between employer and employed is hereditary and that clerkships pass from father to son in the same family  i rejoice to hear it  it is pleasant to find anywhere a relic of the old patriarchal bond the permanent nexus between master and man which formed so important and so healthful an element of the ancient mercantile system  one would gladly overlook a little favouritism and nepotism a little sticking square men into round holes and of round men into square holes for the sake of having a class of young clerks and employes who felt that their masters business was their business his honour theirs his prosperity theirs  but over and above this whenever i have come in contact with this clerk and shopman class they have impressed me with considerable respect not merely as to what they may be hereafter but what they are now  they are the class from which the ranks of our commercial men our emigrants are continually recruited therefore their right education is a matter of national importance  the lad who stands behind a bristol counter may be fiveand twenty years hence a large employeran owner of houses and land in far countries across the seasa member of some colonial parliamentthe founder of a wealthy family  how necessary for the honour of britain for the welfare of generations yet unborn that that young man should have in body soul and spirit the loftiest and yet the most practical of educations  his education too such as it is is one which makes me respect him as one of a class  of course he is sometimes one of those gents whom punch so ruthlessly holds up to just ridicule  he is sometimes a vulgar fop sometimes fond of low profligacyof bettinghouses and casinos  welli know no class in any age or country among which a fool may not be found here and there  but that the gent is the average type of this class i should utterly deny from such experience as i have had  the peculiar note and mark of the average clerk and shopman is i think in these days intellectual activity a keen desire for self improvement and for independence honourable because self acquired  but as he is distinctly a creature of the city as all city influences bear at once on him more than on any other class so we see in him i think more than in any class the best and the worst effects of modern city life  the worst of course is low profligacy but of that i do not speak here  i mean that in the same man the good and evil of a city life meet  and in this way  in a countryman like me coming up out of wild and silent moorlands into a great city the first effect of the change is increased intellectual activity  the perpetual stream of human faces the innumerable objects of interest in every shopwindow are enough to excite the mind to action which is increased by the simple fact of speaking to fifty different human beings in the day instead of five  now in the citybred youth this excited state of mind is chronic permanent  it is denoted plainly enough by the difference between the countrymans face and that of the townsman the former in its best type and it is often very noble composed silent selfcontained often stately often listless the latter mobile eager observant often brilliant often selfconscious  now if you keep this rapid and tense mind in a powerful and healthy body it would do right good work  right good work it does indeed as it is but still it might do better  for what are the faults of this class  what do the obscurantists now thank god fewer every day allege as the objection to allowing young men to educate themselves out of working hours  they become it is said discontented conceited dogmatical they take up hasty notions they condemn fiercely what they have no means of understanding they are too fond of fine words of the excitement of spouting themselves and hearing others spout  well  i suppose there must be a little truth in the accusation or it would not have been invented  there is no smoke without fire and these certainly are the faults of which the cleverest middleclass young men whom i know are most in danger  butone fair look at these mens faces ought to tell common sense that the cause is rather physical than moral  confined to sedentary occupations stooping over desks and counters in close rooms unable to obtain that fair share of bodily exercise which nature demands and in continual mental effort their nerves and brain have been excited at the expense of their lungs their digestion and their whole nutritive system  their complexions show a general illhealth  their mouths too often hint at latent disease  what wonder if there be an irritability of brain and nerve  i blame them no more for it than i blame a man for being somewhat touchy while he is writhing in the gout  indeed less for gout is very often a mans own fault but these mens illhealth is not  and therefore everything which can restore to them health of body will preserve in them health of mind everything which ministers to the corpus sanum will minister also to the mentem sanam and a walk on durham downs a game of cricket a steamer excursion to chepstow shall send them home again happier and wiser men than poring over many wise volumes or hearing many wise lectures  how often is a worthy fellow spending his leisure honourably in hard reading when he had much better have been scrambling over hedge and ditch without a thought in his head save what was put there by the grass and the butterflies and the green trees and the blue sky  and therefore i do press earnestly both on employers and employed the incalculable value of athletic sports and country walks for those whose business compels them to pass the day in the heart of the city i press on you with my whole soul the excellency of the earlyclosing movement not so much because it enables young men to attend mechanics institutes as because it enables them if they choose to get a good game of leapfrog  you may smile but try the experiment and see how as the chest expands the muscles harden and the cheek grows ruddy and the lips firm and sound sleep refreshes the lad for his next days work the temper will become more patient the spirits more genial there will be less tendency to brood angrily over the inequalities of fortune and to accuse society for evils which as yet she knows not how to cure  there is a class again above all these which is doubtless the most important of all and yet of which i can say little herethe capitalist small and great from the shopkeeper to the merchant prince  heaven forbid that i should speak of them with aught but respect there are few figures indeed in the world on which i look with higher satisfaction than on the british merchant the man whose ships are on a hundred seas who sends comfort and prosperity to tribes whom he never saw and honourably enriches himself by enriching others  there is something to me chivalrous even kingly in the merchant life and there were men in bristol of oldas i doubt not there are nowwho nobly fulfilled that ideal i cannot forget that bristol was the nurse of america that more than two hundred years ago the daring and genius of bristol converted yonder narrow stream into a mighty artery down which flowed the young lifeblood of that great transatlantic nation destined to be hereafter i believe the greatest which the world ever saw  yeswere i asked to sum up in one sentence the good of great cities i would point first to bristol and then to the united states and say that is what great cities can do  by concentrating in one place and upon one object men genius information and wealth they can conquer newfound lands by arts instead of arms they can beget new nations and replenish and subdue the earth from pole to pole  meanwhile there is one fact about employers in all cities which i know which may seem commonplace to you but which to me is very significant  whatsoever business they may do in the city they take good care if possible not to live in it  as soon as a man gets wealthy nowadays his first act is to take to himself a villa in the country  do i blame him  certainly not  it is an act of common sense  he finds that the harder he works the more he needs of fresh air free country life innocent recreation and he takes it and does his city business all the better for it lives all the longer for it is the cheerfuller more genial man for it one great social blessing i think which railroads have brought is the throwing open country life to men of business  i say blessing both to the men themselves and to the country where they settle  the citizen takes an honest pride in rivalling the old country gentleman in beating him in his own sphere as gardener agriculturist sportsman head of the village and by his superior business habits and his command of ready money he very often does so  for fifty miles round london wherever i see progress improved farms model cottages new churches new schoolsi find in three cases out of four that the author is some citizen who fifty years ago would have known nothing but the narrow city life and have had probably no higher pleasures than those of the table whose dreams would have been not as now of model farms and schools but of turtle and portwine  my only regret when i see so pleasant a sight is  oh that the good man could have taken his workmen with him  taken his workmen with him  i assure you that after years of thought i see no other remedy for the worst evils of city life  if says the old proverb the mountain will not come to muhammed then muhammed must go to the mountain  and if you cannot bring the country into the city the city must go into the country  do not fancy me a dreamer dealing with impossible ideals  i know well what cannot be done fair and grand as it would be if it were done a model city is impossible in england  we have here no eastern despotism and it is well we have not to destroy an old babylon as that mighty genius nabuchonosor did and build a few miles off a new babylon onehalf the area of which was park and garden fountain and watercoursea diviner work of art to my mind than the finest picture or statue which the world ever saw we have not either and it is well for us that we have not a model republic occupying a new uncleared land  we cannot as they do in america plan out a vast city on some delicious and healthy site amid the virgin forest with streets one hundred feet in breadth squares and boulevards already planted by gods hand with majestic trees and then leave the great design to be hewn out of the wilderness street after street square after square by generations yet unborn  that too is a magnificent ideal but it cannot be ours  and it is well for us i believe that it cannot the great value of land the enormous amount of vested interests the necessity of keeping to ancient sites around which labour as in manchester or commerce as in bristol has clustered itself on account of natural advantages all these things make any attempts to rebuild in cities impossible  but they will cause us at last i believe to build better things than cities  they will issue in a complete interpenetration of city and of country a complete fusion of their different modes of life and a combination of the advantages of both such as no country in the world has ever seen we shall have i believe and trust ere another generation has past model lodginghouses springing up not in the heart of the town but on the hills around it and those will beeconomy as well as science and good government will compel them to benot illbuilt rows of undrained cottages each rented for awhile and then left to run into squalidity and disrepair but huge blocks of building each with its common eatinghouse bar baths washhouses readingroom common conveniences of every kind where in free and pure country air the workman will enjoy comforts which our own grandfathers could not command and at a lower price than that which he now pays for such accommodation as i should be ashamed to give to my own horses while from these great blocks of building branch lines will convey the men to or from their work by railroad without loss of time labour or health  then the city will become what it ought to be the workshop and not the dwellinghouse of a mighty and healthy people  the old foul alleys as they become gradually depopulated will be replaced by fresh warehouses fresh public buildings and the city in spite of all its smoke and dirt will become a place on which the workman will look down with pride and joy because it will be to him no longer a prison and a poisontrap but merely a place for honest labour  this gentlemen and ladies is my ideal and i cannot but hope and believe that i shall live to see it realised here and there gradually and cautiously as is our good and safe english habit but still earnestly and well  did i see but the movement commenced in earnest i should be inclined to cry a nunc domine dimittisi have lived long enough to see a noble work begun which cannot but go on and prosper so beneficial would it be found  i tell you that but this afternoon as the bath train dashed through the last cutting and your noble vale and noble city opened before me i looked round upon the overhanging crags the wooded glens and said to myself  there upon the rock in the free air and sunlight and not here beneath yon pall of smoke by the lazy pools and festering tidal muds ought the bristol workman to live  oh that i may see the time when on the blessed sabbath eve these hills shall swarm as thick with living men as bean fields with the summer bees when the glens shall ring with the laughter of ten thousand children with limbs as steady and cheeks as ruddy as those of my own lads and lasses at home and the artisan shall find his sabbath a day of rest indeed in which not only soul but body may gather health and nerve for the weeks work under the soothing and purifying influences of those common natural sights and sounds which god has given as a heritage even to the gipsy on the moor and of which no man can be deprived without making his life a burden to himself perhaps a burden to those around him  but it will be asked  will such improvements pay  i respect that question  i do not sneer at it and regard it as some are too apt to do as a sign of the mercenary and moneyloving spirit of the present age  i look on it as a healthy sign of the english mind a sign that we believe as the old jews did that political and social righteousness is inseparably connected with wealth and prosperity  the old psalms and prophets have taught us that lesson and god forbid that we should forget it  the world is right well made and the laws of trade and of social economy just as much as the laws of nature are divine facts and only by obeying them can we thrive  and i had far sooner hear a people asking of every scheme of good will it pay than throwing themselves headlong into that merely sentimental charity to which superstitious nations have always been pronecharity which effects no permanent good which whether in hindostan or in italy debases instead of raising the suffering classes because it breaks the laws of social economy  no let us still believe that if a thing is right it will sooner or later pay and in social questions make the profitableness of any scheme a test of its rightness  it is a rough test not an infallible one at all but it is a fair one enough to work by  and as for the improvements at which i have hinted i will boldly answer that they will pay  they will pay directly and at once in the saving of poorrates they will pay by exterminating epidemics and numberless chronic forms of disease which now render thousands burdens on the public purse consumers instead of producers of wealth  they will pay by gradually absorbing the dangerous classes and removing from temptation and degradation a generation yet unborn  they will pay in the increased content cheerfulness which comes with health in increased goodwill of employed towards employers  they will pay by putting the masses into a state fit for education  they will pay too in such fearful times as these by the increased physical strength and hardihood of the town populations  for it is from the city rather than from the country that our armies must mainly be recruited  not only is the townsman more ready to enlist than the countryman because in the town the labour market is most likely to be overstocked but the townsman actually makes a better soldier than the countryman  he is a shrewder more active more selfhelping man give him but the chances of maintaining the same physical strength and health as the countryman and he will support the honour of the british arms as gallantly as the highlander or the connaughtman and restore the days when the invincible prenticeboys of london carried terror into the heart of foreign lands  in all ages in all times whether for war or for peace it will pay  the true wealth of a nation is the health of her masses  it may seem to some here that i have dealt too much throughout this lecture with merely material questions that i ought to have spoken more of intellectual progress perhaps as a clergyman more also of spiritual and moral regeneration  i can only answer that if this be a fault on my part it is a deliberate one  i have spoken whether rightly or wrongly concerning what i knowconcerning matters which are to me articles of faith altogether indubitable irreversible divine  be it that these are merely questions of physical improvement  i see no reason in that why they should be left to laymen or urged only on worldly grounds and selfinterest  i do not find that when urged on those grounds the advice is listened to  i believe that it will not be listened to until the consciences of men as well as their brains are engaged in these questions until they are put on moral grounds shown to have connection with moral laws and so made questions not merely of interest but of duty honour chivalry  i cannot but see moreover how many phenomena which are supposed to be spiritual are simply physical how many cases which are referred to my profession are properly the object of the medical man  i cannot but see that unless there be healthy bodies it is impossible in the long run to have a generation of healthy souls i cannot but see that mankind are as prone now as ever to deny the sacredness and perfection of gods physical universe as an excuse for their own ignorance and neglect thereof to search the highest heaven for causes which lie patent at their feet and like the heathen of old time to impute to some capricious anger of the gods calamities which spring from their own greed haste and ignorance  and therefore because i am a priest and glory in the name of a priest i have tried to fulfil somewhat of that which seems to me the true office of a priestnamely to proclaim to man the divine element which exists in all even the smallest thing because each thing is a thought of god himself to make men understand that god is indeed about their path and about their bed spying out all their ways that they are indeed fearfully and wonderfully made and that gods hand lies for ever on them in the form of physical laws sacred irreversible universal reaching from one end of the universe to the other that whosoever persists in breaking those laws reaps his sure punishment of weakness and sickness sadness and selfreproach that whosoever causes them to be broken by others reaps his sure punishment in finding that he has transformed his fellowmen into burdens and curses instead of helpmates and blessings  to say this is a priests duty and then to preach the good news that the remedy is patent easy close at hand that many of the worst evils which afflict humanity may be exterminated by simple common sense and the justice and mercy which does to others as it would be done by to awaken men to the importance of the visible world that they may judge from thence the higher importance of that invisible world whereof this is but the garment and the type and in all times and places instead of keeping the key of knowledge to pamper ones own power or pride to lay that key frankly and trustfully in the hand of every human being who hungers after truth and to say  child of god this key is thine as well as mine  enter boldly into thy fathers house and behold the wonder the wisdom the beauty of its laws and its organisms from the mightiest planet over thy head to the tiniest insect beneath thy feet  look at it trustfully joyfully earnestly for it is thy heritage  behold its perfect fitness for thy life here and judge from thence its fitness for thy nobler life hereafter    heroism    it is an open question whether the policeman is not demoralising us and that in proportion as he does his duty well whether the perfection of justice and safety the complete preservation of body and goods may not reduce the educated and comfortable classes into that lapdog condition in which not conscience but comfort doth make cowards of us all  our forefathers had on the whole to take care of themselves we find it more convenient to hire people to take care of us  so much the better for us in some respects but it may be so much the worse in others  so much the better because as usually results from the division of labour these people having little or nothing to do save to take care of us do so far better than we could and so prevent a vast amount of violence and wrong and therefore of misery especially to the weak for which last reason we will acquiesce in the existence of policemen and lawyers as we do in the results of arbitration as the lesser of two evils  the odds in war are in favour of the bigger bully in arbitration in favour of the bigger rogue and it is a question whether the lion or the fox be the safer guardian of human interests  but arbitration prevents war and that in three cases out of four is full reason for employing it  on the other hand the lapdog condition whether in dogs or in men is certainly unfavourable to the growth of the higher virtues  safety and comfort are good indeed for the good for the brave the selforiginating the earnest  they give to such a clear stage and no favour wherein to work unhindered for their fellowmen  but for the majority who are neither brave self originating nor earnest but the mere puppets of circumstance safety and comfort may and actually do merely make their lives mean and petty effeminate and dull  therefore their hearts must be awakened as often as possible to take exercise enough for health and they must be reminded perpetually and importunately of what a certain great philosopher called whatsoever things are true honourable just pure lovely and of good report if there be any manhood and any just praise to think of such things  this pettiness and dulness of our modern life is just what keeps alive our stage to which people go to see something a little less petty a little less dull than what they see at home  it is too the cause ofi had almost said the excuse forthe modern rage for sensational novels  those who read them so greedily are conscious poor souls of capacities in themselves of passion and action for good and evil for which their frivolous humdrum daily life gives no room no vent  they know too well that human nature can be more fertile whether in weeds and poisons or in flowers and fruits than it is usually in the streets and houses of a wellordered and tolerably sober city  and because the study of human nature is after all that which is nearest to everyone and most interesting to everyone therefore they go to fiction since they cannot go to fact to see what they themselves might be had they the chance to see what fantastic tricks before high heaven men and women like themselves can play and how they play them  well it is not for me to judge for me to blame  i will only say that there are those who cannot read sensational novels or indeed any novels at all just because they see so many sensational novels being enacted round them in painful facts of sinful flesh and blood  there are those too who have looked in the mirror too often to wish to see their own disfigured visage in it any more who are too tired of themselves and ashamed of themselves to want to hear of people like themselves who want to hear of people utterly unlike themselves more noble and able and just and sweet and pure who long to hear of heroism and to converse with heroes and who if by chance they meet with an heroic act bathe their spirits in that as in maydew and feel themselves thereby if but for an hour more fair  if any such shall chance to see these words let me ask them to consider with me that one word hero and what it means  hero heroic heroism  these words point to a phase of human nature the capacity for which we all have in ourselves which is as startling and as interesting in its manifestations as any and which is always beautiful always ennobling and therefore always attractive to those whose hearts are not yet seared by the world or brutalised by selfindulgence  but let us first be sure what the words mean  there is no use talking about a word till we have got at its meaning  we may use it as a cant phrase as a party cry on platforms we may even hate and persecute our fellowmen for the sake of it  but till we have clearly settled in our own minds what a word means it will do for fighting with but not for working with  socrates of old used to tell the young athenians that the ground of all sound knowledge wasto understand the true meaning of the words which were in their mouths all day long and socrates was a wiser man than we shall ever see  so instead of beginning an oration in praise of heroism i shall ask my readers to think with me what heroism is  now we shall always get most surely at the meaning of a word by getting at its etymologythat is at what it meant at first  and if heroism means behaving like a hero we must find out it seems to me not merely what a hero may happen to mean just now but what it meant in the earliest human speech in which we find it  a hero or a heroine then among the old homeric greeks meant a man or woman who was like the gods and who from that likeness stood superior to his or her fellowcreatures  gods heroes and men is a threefold division of rational beings with which we meet more than once or twice  those grand old greeks felt deeply the truth of the poets saying    unless above himself he can exalt himself how poor a thing is man   but more  the greeks supposed these heroes to be in some way or other partakers of a divine nature akin to the gods usually either they or some ancestor of theirs descended from a god or goddess  those who have read mr gladstones juventus mundi will remember the section cap ix 6 on the modes of the approximation between the divine and the human natures and whether or not they agree with the author altogether all will agree i think that the first idea of a hero or a heroine was a godlike man or godlike woman  a godlike man  what varied what infinite forms of nobleness that word might include ever increasing as mens notions of the gods became purer and loftier or alas decreasing as their notions became degraded  the old greeks with that intense admiration of beauty which made them in after ages the mastersculptors and draughtsmen of their own and indeed of any age would of course require in their hero their godlike man beauty and strength manners too and eloquence and all outward perfections of humanity and neglect his moral qualities  neglect i say but not ignore  the hero by virtue of his kindred with the gods was always expected to be a better man than common men as virtue was then understood  and how better  let us see  the hero was at least expected to be more reverent than other men to those divine beings of whose nature he partook whose society he might enjoy even here on earth  he might be unfaithful to his own high lineage he might misuse his gifts by selfishness and selfwill he might like ajax rage with mere jealousy and wounded pride till his rage ended in shameful madness and suicide he might rebel against the very gods and all laws of right and wrong till he perished his greek text    smitten down blind in his pride for a sign and a terror to mortals   but he ought to have he must have to be true to his name of hero justice selfrestraint and greek textthat highest form of modesty for which we have alas no name in the english tongue that perfect respect for the feelings of others which springs out of perfect selfrespect  and he must have tooif he were to be a hero of the highest typethe instinct of helpfulness the instinct that if he were a kinsman of the gods he must fight on their side through toil and danger against all that was unlike them and therefore hateful to them  who loves not the old legends unsurpassed for beauty in the literature of any race in which the hero stands out as the deliverer the destroyer of evil  theseus ridding the land of robbers and delivering it from the yearly tribute of boys and maidens to be devoured by the minotaur perseus slaying the gorgon and rescuing andromeda from the seabeast heracles with his twelve famous labours against giants and monsters and all the rest    who dared in the godgiven might of their manhood greatly to do and to suffer and far in the fens and the forests smite the devourers of men heavenhated brood of the giants transformed strange without like who obey not the goldenhaired rulers   these are figures whose divine moral beauty has sunk into the hearts not merely of poets or of artists but of men and women who suffered and who feared the memory of them fables though they may have been ennobled the old greek heart they ennobled the heart of europe in the fifteenth century at the rediscovery of greek literature  so far from contradicting the christian ideal they harmonised withi had almost said they supplemented that more tender and saintly ideal of heroism which had sprung up during the earlier middle ages  they justified and actually gave a new life to the old noblenesses of chivalry which had grown up in the later middle ages as a necessary supplement of active and manly virtue to the passive and feminine virtue of the cloister they inspired mingling with these two other elements a literature both in england france and italy in which the three elements the saintly the chivalrous and the greek heroic have become one and undistinguishable because all three are human and all three divine a literature which developed itself in ariosto in tasso in the hypnerotomachia the arcadia the euphues and other forms sometimes fantastic sometimes questionable but which reached its perfection in our own spensers fairy queen perhaps the most admirable poem which has ever been penned by mortal man  and why  what has made these old greek myths live myths though they be and fables and fair dreams  whatthough they have no body and perhaps never hadhas given them an immortal soul which can speak to the immortal souls of all generations to come  what but this that in themdim it may be and undeveloped but still therelies the divine idea of selfsacrifice as the perfection of heroism of selfsacrifice as the highest duty and the highest joy of him who claims a kindred with the gods  let us say then that true heroism must involve selfsacrifice those stories certainly involve it whether ancient or modern which the hearts not of philosophers merely or poets but of the poorest and the most ignorant have accepted instinctively as the highest form of moral beautythe highest form and yet one possible to all  grace darling rowing out into the storm towards the wreck  the

your wifes sake dont wait for me  and that was all heard in the din  heard of tom flynn  flynn of virginia   or the engineer again on the mississippi who when the steamer caught fire held as he had

be too hard on a man that died for men   to which gallant poem of colonel john haysand he has written many gallant and beautiful poemsi have but one demurrer  jim bludso did not merely do his duty but more than his duty  he did a voluntary deed to which he was bound by no code or contract civil or moral just as he who introduced me to that poem won his victoria crossas many a cross victoria and other has been won by volunteering for a deed to which he too was bound by no code or contract military or moral  and it is of the essence of self sacrifice and therefore of heroism that it should be voluntary a work of supererogation at least towards society and man an act to which the hero or heroine is not bound by duty but which is above though not against duty  nay on the strength of that same element of selfsacrifice i will not grudge the epithet heroic which my revered friend mr darwin justly applies to the poor little monkey who once in his life did that which was above his duty who lived in continual terror of the great baboon and yet when the brute had sprung upon his friend the keeper and was tearing out his throat conquered his fear by love and at the risk of instant death sprang in turn upon his dreaded enemy and bit and shrieked till help arrived  some would nowadays use that story merely to prove that the monkeys nature and the mans nature are after all one and the same  well  i at least have never denied that there is a monkeynature in man as there is a peacocknature and a swine nature and a wolfnatureof all which four i see every day too much  the sharp and stern distinction between men and animals as far as their natures are concerned is of a more modern origin than people fancy  of old the assyrian took the eagle the ox and the lionand not unwiselyas the three highest types of human capacity  the horses of homer might be immortal and weep for their masters death  the animals and monsters of greek myth like the ananzi spider of negro fableglide insensibly into speech and reason  birdsthe most wonderful of all animals in the eyes of a man of science or a poetare sometimes looked on as wiser and nearer to the gods than man  the norsemanthe noblest and ablest human being save the greek of whom history can tell uswas not ashamed to say of the bear of his native forests that he had ten mens strength and eleven mens wisdom how could reinecke fuchs have gained immortality in the middle ages and since save by the truth of its too solid and humiliating theoremthat the actions of the world of men were on the whole guided by passions but too exactly like those of the lower animals  i have said and say again with good old vaughan   unless above himself he can exalt himself how mean a thing is man   but i cannot forget that many an old greek poet or sage and many a sixteenth and seventeenth century one would have interpreted the monkeys heroism from quite a different point of view and would have said that the poor little creature had been visited suddenly by some divine afflatusan expression quite as philosophical and quite as intelligible as most philosophic formulas which i read nowadaysand had been thus raised for the moment above his abject selfish monkeynature just as man requires to be raised above his  but that theory belongs to a philosophy which is out of date and out of fashion and which will have to wait a century or two before it comes into fashion again  and now if selfsacrifice and heroism be as i believe identical i must protest against the use of the word sacrifice which is growing too common in newspapercolumns in which we are told of an enormous sacrifice of life an expression which means merely that a great many poor wretches have been killed quite against their own will and for no purpose whatsoever no sacrifice at all unless it be one to the demons of ignorance cupidity or mismanagement  the stout whig undergraduate understood better the meaning of such words who when asked in what sense might charles the first be said to be a martyr answered in the same sense that a man might be said to be a martyr to the gout  and i must protest in like wise against a misuse of the words hero heroism heroic which is becoming too common namely applying them to mere courage  we have borrowed the misuse i believe as we have more than one beside from the french press i trust that we shall neither accept it nor the temper which inspires it  it may be convenient for those who flatter their nation and especially the military part of it into a ruinous selfconceit to frame some such syllogism as this  courage is heroism  every frenchman is naturally courageous  therefore every frenchman is a hero  but we who have been trained at once in a sounder school of morals and in a greater respect for facts and for language as the expression of facts shall be careful i hope not to trifle thus with that potent and awful enginehuman speech  we shall eschew likewise i hope a like abuse of the word moral which has crept from the french press now and then not only into our own press but into the writings of some of our military men who as englishmen should have known better  we were told again and again during the late war that the moral effect of such a success had been great that the morale of the troops was excellent or again that the morale of the troops had suffered or even that they were somewhat demoralised  but when one came to test what was really meant by these fine words one discovered that morals had nothing to do with the facts which they expressed that the troops were in the one case actuated simply by the animal passion of hope in the other simply by the animal passion of fear  this abuse of the word moral has crossed i am sorry to say the atlantic and a witty american whom we must excuse though we must not imitate when some one had been blazing away at him with a revolver he being unarmed is said to have described his very natural emotions on the occasion by saying that he felt dreadfully demoralised  we i hope shall confine the word demoralisation as our generals of the last century would have done when applied to soldiers to crime including of course the neglect of duty or of discipline and we shall mean by the word heroism in like manner whether applied to a soldier or to any human being not mere courage not the mere doing of duty but the doing of something beyond duty something which is not in the bond some spontaneous and unexpected act of self devotion  i am glad but not surprised to see that miss yonge has held to this sound distinction in her golden little book of golden deeds and said obedience at all costs and risks is the very essence of a soldiers life  it has the solid material but it has hardly the exceptional brightness of a golden deed  i know that it is very difficult to draw the line between mere obedience to duty and express heroism  i know also that it would be both invidious and impertinent in an utterly unheroic personage like me to try to draw that line and to sit at home at ease analysing and criticising deeds which i could not do myself but to give an instance or two of what i mean  to defend a post as long as it is tenable is not heroic  it is simple duty  to defend it after it has become untenable and even to die in so doing is not heroic but a noble madness unless an advantage is to be gained thereby for ones own side  then indeed it rises towards if not into the heroism of self sacrifice  who for example will not endorse the verdict of all ages on the conduct of those spartans at thermopylae when they sat combing their yellow hair for death on the seashore  they devoted themselves to hopeless destruction but why  they felti must believe that for they behaved as if they feltthat on them the destinies of the western world might hang that they were in the forefront of the battle between civilisation and barbarism between freedom and despotism and that they must teach that vast mob of persian slaves whom the officers of the great king were driving with whips up to their lancepoints that the spirit of the old heroes was not dead and that the greek even in defeat and death was a mightier and a nobler man than they  and they did their work  they produced if you will a moral effect which has lasted even to this very day  they struck terror into the heart not only of the persian host but of the whole persian empire  they made the event of that war certain and the victories of salamis and plataea comparatively easy  they made alexanders conquest of the east one hundred and fifty years afterwards not only possible at all but permanent when it came and thus helped to determine the future civilisation of the whole world  they did not of course foresee all this  no great or inspired man can foresee all the consequences of his deeds but these men were as i hold inspired to see somewhat at least of the mighty stake for which they played and to count their lives worthless if sparta had sent them thither to help in that great game  or shall we refuse the name of heroic to those three german cavalry regiments who in the battle of marslatour were bidden to hurl themselves upon the chassepots and mitrailleuses of the unbroken french infantry and went to almost certain death over the corpses of their comrades on and in and through reeling man over horse horse over man and clung like bulldogs to their work and would hardly leave even at the buglecall till in one regiment thirteen officers out of nineteen were killed or wounded and why  because the french army must be stopped if it were but for a quarter of an hour  a respite must be gained for the exhausted third corps  and how much might be done even in a quarter of an hour by men who knew when and where and why to die  who will refuse the name of heroes to these men  and yet they probably would have utterly declined the honour  they had but done that which was in the bond  they were but obeying orders after all as miss yonge well says of all heroic persons  i have but done that which it was my duty to do is the natural answer of those capable of such actions  they have been constrained to them by duty or pity have never deemed it possible to act otherwise and did not once think of themselves in the matter at all  these last true words bring us to another element in heroism  its simplicity  whatsoever is not simple whatsoever is affected boastful wilful covetous tarnishes even destroys the heroic character of a deed because all these faults spring out of self on the other hand wherever you find a perfectly simple frank unconscious character there you have the possibility at least of heroic action  for it is nobler far to do the most commonplace duty in the household or behind the counter with a single eye to duty simply because it must be donenobler far i say than to go out of your way to attempt a brilliant deed with a double mind and saying to yourself not onlythis will be a brilliant deed but alsoand it will pay me or raise me or set me off into the bargain  heroism knows no into the bargain  and therefore again i must protest against applying the word heroic to any deeds however charitable however toilsome however dangerous performed for the sake of what certain french ladies i am told call faire son salutsaving ones soul in the world to come  i do not mean to judge  other and quite unselfish motives may be and doubtless often are mixed up with that selfish one  womanly pity and tenderness love for and desire to imitate a certain incarnate ideal of selfsacrifice who is at once human and divine  but that motive of saving the soul which is too often openly proposed and proffered is utterly unheroic  the desire to escape pains and penalties hereafter by pains and penalties here the balance of present loss against future gainwhat is this but selfishness extended out of this world into eternity  not worldliness indeed as a satirist once said with bitter truth but otherworldliness  moreoverand the young and the enthusiastic should also bear this in mindthough heroism means the going beyond the limits of strict duty it never means the going out of the path of strict duty  if it is your duty to go to london go thither  you may go as much farther as you choose after that  but you must go to london first  do your duty first it will be time after that to talk of being heroic  and therefore one must seriously warn the young lest they mistake for heroism and selfsacrifice what is merely pride and selfwill discontent with the relations by which god has bound them and the circumstances which god has appointed for them  i have known girls think they were doing a fine thing by leaving uncongenial parents or disagreeable sisters and cutting out for themselves as they fancied a more useful and elevated line of life than that of mere home duties while after all poor things they were only saying with the pharisees of old corban it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me and in the name of god neglecting the command of god to honour their father and mother  there are men too who will neglect their households and leave their children unprovided for and even uneducated while they are spending their money on philanthropic or religious hobbies of their own  it is ill to take the childrens bread and cast it to the dogs or even to the angels  it is ill i say trying to make presents to god before we have tried to pay our debts to god the first duty of every man is to the wife whom he has married and to the children whom she has brought into the world and to neglect them is not heroism but selfconceit the conceit that a man is so necessary to almighty god that god will actually allow him to do wrong if he can only thereby secure the mans invaluable services  be sure that every motive which comes not from the single eye every motive which springs from self is by its very essence unheroic let it look as gaudy or as beneficent as it may  but i cannot go so far as to say the same of the love of approbationthe desire for the love and respect of our fellow men  that must not be excluded from the list of heroic motives i know that it is or may be proved to be by victorious analysis an emotion common to us and the lower animals  and yet no man excludes it less than that true hero st paul  if those brave spartans if those brave germans of whom i spoke just now knew that their memories would be wept over and worshipped by brave men and fair women and that their names would become watchwords to children in their fatherland what is that to us save that it should make us rejoice if we be truly human that they had that thought with them in their last moments to make selfdevotion more easy and death more sweet  and yetand yetis not the highest heroism that which is free even from the approbation of our fellowmen even from the approbation of the best and wisest  the heroism which is known only to our father who seeth in secret  the godlike deeds alone in the lonely chamber  the godlike lives lived in obscuritya heroism rare among us men who live perforce in the glare and noise of the outer world  more common among women women of whom the world never hears who if the world discovered them would only draw the veil more closely over their faces and their hearts and entreat to be left alone with god  true they cannot always hide  they must not always hide or their fellowcreatures would lose the golden lesson  but nevertheless it is of the essence of the perfect and womanly heroism in which as in all spiritual forces the woman transcends the man that it would hide if it could  and it was a pleasant thought to me when i glanced lately at the golden deeds of women in miss yonges bookit was a pleasant thought to me that i could say to myselfah yes  these heroines are known and their fame flies through the mouths of men  but if so how many thousands of heroines there must have been how many thousands there may be now of whom we shall never know  but still they are there  they sow in secret the seed of which we pluck the flower and eat the fruit and know not that we pass the sower daily in the street perhaps some humble ill dressed woman earning painfully her own small sustenance  she who nurses a bedridden mother instead of sending her to the workhouse  she who spends her heart and her money on a drunken father a reckless brother on the orphans of a kinsman or a friend  she whobut why go on with the long list of great little heroisms with which a clergyman at least comes in contact daily and it is one of the most ennobling privileges of a clergymans high calling that he does come in contact with themwhy go on i say save to commemorate one more form of great little heroism the commonest and yet the least remembered of allnamely the heroism of an average mother  ah when i think of that last broad fact i gather hope again for poor humanity and this dark world looks bright this diseased world looks wholesome to me once more because whatever else it is or is not full of it is at least full of mothers  while the satirist only sneers as at a stock butt for his ridicule at the managing mother trying to get her daughters married off her hands by chicaneries and meannesses which every novelist knows too well how to drawwould to heaven he or rather alas she would find some more chivalrous employment for his or her penfor were they not too born of womani only say to myselfhaving had always a secret fondness for poor rebecca though i love esau more than jacoblet the poor thing alone with pain she brought these girls into the world  with pain she educated them according to her light  with pain she is trying to obtain for them the highest earthly blessing of which she can conceive namely to be well married and if in doing that last she manoeuvres a little commits a few basenesses even tells a few untruths what does all that come to save thisthat in the confused intensity of her motherly selfsacrifice she will sacrifice for her daughters even her own conscience and her own credit  we may sneer if we will at such a poor harddriven soul when we meet her in society our duty both as christians and ladies and gentlemen seems to me to beto do for her something very different indeed  but to return  looking at the amount of great little heroisms which are being as i assert enacted around us every day no one has a right to say what we are all tempted to say at times  how can i be heroic  this is no heroic age setting me heroic examples  we are growing more and more comfortable frivolous pleasureseeking moneymaking more and more utilitarian more and more mercenary in our politics in our morals in our religion thinking less and less of honour and duty and more and more of loss and gain  i am born into an unheroic time  you must not ask me to become heroic in it  i do not deny that it is more difficult to be heroic while circumstances are unheroic round us  we are all too apt to be the puppets of circumstances all too apt to follow the fashion all too apt like so many minnows to take our colour from the ground on which we lie in hopes like them of comfortable concealment lest the new tyrant deity called public opinion should spy us out and like nebuchadnezzar of old cast us into a burning fiery furnacewhich public opinion can make very hotfor daring to worship any god or man save the will of the temporary majority  yes it is difficult to be anything but poor mean insufficient imperfect people as like each other as so many sheep and like so many sheep having no will or character of our own but rushing altogether blindly over the same gap in foolish fear of the same dog who after all dare not bite us and so it always was and always will be  for the third time i say   unless above himself he can exalt himself how poor a thing is man   but nevertheless any man or woman who will in any age and under any circumstances can live the heroic life and exercise heroic influences  if any ask proof of this i shall ask them in return to read two novels novels indeed but in their method and their moral partaking of that heroic and ideal element which will make them live i trust long after thousands of mere novels have returned to their native  dust  i mean miss mulochs john halifax gentleman and mr thackerays esmond two books which no man or woman ought to read without being the nobler for them  john halifax gentleman is simply the history of a poor young clerk who rises to be a wealthy millowner in the manufacturing districts in the early part of this century  but he contrives to be an heroic and ideal clerk and an heroic and ideal millowner and that without doing anything which the world would call heroic or ideal or in anywise stepping out of his sphere minding simply his own business and doing the duty which lies nearest him  and how  by getting into his head from youth the strangest notion that in whatever station or business he may be he can always be what he considers a gentleman and that if he only behaves like a gentleman all must go right at last  a beautiful book  as i said before somewhat of an heroic and ideal book  a book which did me good when first i read it which ought to do any young man good who will read it and then try to be like john halifax a gentleman whether in the shop the countinghouse the bank or the manufactory  the otheran even more striking instance of the possibility at least of heroism anywhere and everywhereis mr thackerays esmond  on the meaning of that book i can speak with authority for my dear and regretted friend told me himself that my interpretation of it was the true one that this was the lesson which he meant men to learn therefrom  esmond is a man of the first half of the eighteenth century living in a coarse drunken ignorant profligate and altogether unheroic age  he isand here the high art and the high morality of mr thackerays genius is shownaltogether a man of his own age  he is not a sixteenthcentury or a nineteenthcentury man born out of time  his information his politics his religion are no higher than of those round him  his manners his views of human life his very prejudices and faults are those of his age the temptations which he conquers are just those under which the men around him fall  but how does he conquer them  by holding fast throughout to honour duty virtue  thus and thus alone he becomes an ideal eighteenthcentury gentleman an eighteenth century hero  this was what mr thackeray meant for he told me so himself i saythat it was possible even in englands lowest and foulest times to be a gentleman and a hero if a man would but be true to the light within him  but i will go farther  i will go from ideal fiction to actual and yet ideal fact and say that as i read history the most unheroic age which the civilised world ever saw was also the most heroic that the spirit of man triumphed most utterly over his circumstances at the very moment when those circumstances were most against him  how and why he did so is a question for philosophy in the highest sense of that word  the fact of his having done so is matter of history  shall i solve my own riddle  then have we not heard of the early christian martyrs  is there a doubt that they unlettered men slaves weak women even children did exhibit under an infinite sense of duty issuing in infinite selfsacrifice a heroism such as the world had never seen before did raise the ideal of human nobleness a whole stage rather say a whole heavenhigher than before and that wherever the tale of their great deeds spread men accepted even if they did not copy those martyrs as ideal specimens of the human race till they were actually worshipped by succeeding generations wrongly it may be but pardonably as a choir of lesser deities  but is there on the other hand a doubt that the age in which they were heroic was the most unheroic of all ages that they were bred lived and died under the most debasing of materialist tyrannies with art literature philosophy family and national life dying or dead around them and in cities the corruption of which cannot be told for very shamecities compared with which paris is the abode of arcadian simplicity and innocence  when i read petronius and juvenal and recollect that they were the contemporaries of the apostles whento give an instance which scholars and perhaps happily only scholars can appreciatei glance once more at trimalchios feast and remember that within a mile of that feast st paul may have been preaching to a christian congregation some of whomfor st paul makes no secret of that strange factmay have been ere their conversion partakers in just such vulgar and bestial orgies as those which were going on in the rich freedmans halls after that i say i can put no limit to the possibility of mans becoming heroic even though he be surrounded by a hell on earth no limit to the capacities of any human being to form for himself or herself a high and pure ideal of human character and without playing fantastic tricks before high heaven to carry out that ideal in everyday life and in the most commonplace circumstances and the most menial occupations to live worthy ofas i conceiveour heavenly birthright and to imitate the heroes who were the kinsmen of the gods    the massacre of the innocents 11    let me begin by asking the ladies who are interesting themselves in this good work whether they have really considered what they are about to do in carrying out their own plans  are they aware that if their society really succeeds they will produce a very serious some would think a very dangerous change in the state of this nation  are they aware that they would probably save the lives of some thirty or forty per cent of the children who are born in england and that therefore they would cause the subjects of queen victoria to increase at a very far more rapid rate than they do now  and are they aware that some very wise men inform us that england is already overpeopled and that it is an exceedingly puzzling question where we shall soon be able to find work or food for our masses so rapidly do they increase already in spite of the thirty or forty per cent which kind nature carries off yearly before they are five years old  have they considered what they are to do with all those children whom they are going to save alive  that has to be thought of and if they really do believe with some political economists that over population is a possibility to a country which has the greatest colonial empire that the world has ever seen then i think they had better stop in their course and let the children die as they have been in the habit of dying  but if on the other hand it seems to them as i confess it does to me that the most precious thing in the world is a human being that the lowest and poorest and the most degraded of human beings is better than all the dumb animals in the world that there is an infinite priceless capability in that creature fallen as it may be a capability of virtue and of social and industrial use which if it is taken in time may be developed up to a pitch of which at first sight the child gives no hint whatsoever if they believe again that of all races upon earth now the english race is probably the finest and that it gives not the slightest sign whatever of exhaustion that it seems to be on the whole a young race and to have very great capabilities in it which have not yet been developed and above all the most marvellous capability of adapting itself to every sort of climate and every form of life which any race except the old roman ever has had in the world if they consider with me that it is worth the while of political economists and social philosophers to look at the map and see that about fourfifths of the globe cannot be said as yet to be in anywise inhabited or cultivated or in the state into which men could put it by a fair supply of population and industry and human intellect  then perhaps they may think with me that it is a duty one of the noblest of duties to help the increase of the english race as much as possible and to see that every child that is born into this great nation of england be developed to the highest pitch to which we can develop him in physical strength and in beauty as well as in intellect and in virtue  and then in that light it does seem to me that this institutionsmall now but i do hope some day to become great and to become the mother institution of many and valuable childrenis one of the noblest most rightminded straightforward and practical conceptions that i have come across for some years  we all know the difficulties of sanitary legislation  one looks at them at times almost with despair  i have my own reasons with which i will not trouble this meeting for looking on them with more despair than ever  not on account of the government of the time or any possible government that could come to england but on account of the peculiar class of persons in whom the ownership of the small houses has become more and more vested and who are becoming more and more i had almost said the arbiters of the popular opinion and of every election of parliament  however that is no business of ours here that must be settled somewhere else and a fearfully long time it seems to me it will be before it is settled  but in the meantime what legislation cannot do i believe private help and above all womans help can do even better  it can do this it can improve the condition of the working man  and not only of him i must speak also of the middle classes of the men who own the house in which the working man lives  i must speak too of the wealthy tradesman i must speak it is a sad thing to have to say itof our own class as well as of others  sanitary reform as it is called or in plain english the art of health is so very recent a discovery as all true physical science is that we ourselves and our own class know very little about it and practise it very little  and this society i do hope will bear in mind that it is not simply to seek the working man not only to go into the foul alley  but it is to go to the door of the farmer to the door of the shopkeeper aye to the door of ladies and gentlemen of the same rank as ourselves  women can do in that work what men cannot do  the private correspondence private conversation private example of ladies above all of married women of mothers of families may do what no legislation can do  i am struck more and more with the amount of disease and death i see around me in all classes which no sanitary legislation whatsoever could touch unless you had a complete housetohouse visitation by some government officer with powers to enter every dwelling to drain it and ventilate it and not only that but to regulate the clothes and the diet of every inhabitant and that among all ranks  i can conceive of nothing short of that which would be absurd and impossible and would also be most harmful morally which would stop the present amount of disease and death which i see around me without some such private exertion on the part of women above all of mothers as i do hope will spring from this institution more and more  i see this that three persons out of every four are utterly unaware of the general causes of their own illhealth and of the illhealth of their children  they talk of their afflictions and their misfortunes and if they be pious people they talk of the will of god and of the visitation of god  i do not like to trench upon those matters here but when i read in my book and in your book that it is not the will of our father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish it has come to my mind sometimes with very great strength that that may have a physical application as well as a spiritual one and that the father in heaven who does not wish the childs soul to die may possibly have created that childs body for the purpose of its not dying except in a good old age  for not only in the lower class but in the middle and upper classes when one sees an unhealthy family then in three cases out of four if one will take time trouble and care enough one can with the help of the doctor who has been attending them run the evil home to a very different cause than the will of god and that is to stupid neglect stupid ignorance or what is just as bad stupid indulgence  now i do believe that if those tracts which you are publishing which i have read and of which i cannot speak too highly are spread over the length and breadth of the land and if women clergymens wives the wives of manufacturers and of great employers district visitors and schoolmistresses have these books put into their hands and are persuaded to spread them and to enforce them by their own example and by their own counsel that then in the course of a few years this system being thoroughly carried out you would see a sensible and large increase in the rate of population  when you have saved your children alive then you must settle what to do with them  but a living dog is better than a dead lion i would rather have the living child and let it take its chance than let it return to godwasted  o it is a distressing thing to see children die god gives the most beautiful and precious thing that earth can have and we just take it and cast it away we toss our pearls upon the dunghill and leave them  a dying child is to me one of the most dreadful sights in the world  a dying man a man dying on the field of battlethat is a small sight he has taken his chance he is doing his duty he has had his excitement he has had his glory if that will be any consolation to him if he is a wise man he has the feeling that he is dying for his country and his queen  and that is and ought to be enough for him  i am not horrified or shocked at the sight of the man who dies on the field of battle let him die so  it does not horrify or shock me again to see a man dying in a good old age even though the last struggle be painful as it too often is  but it does shock me it does make me feel that the world is indeed out of joint to see a child die  i believe it to be a priceless boon to the child to have lived for a week or a day  but oh what has god given to this thankless earth and what has the earth thrown away and in nine cases out of ten from its own neglect and carelessness what that boy might have been what he might have done as an englishman if he could have lived and grown up healthy and strong  and i entreat you to bear this in mind that it is not as if our lower or our middle classes were not worth saving  bear in mind that the physical beauty strength intellectual power of the middle classesthe shopkeeping class the farming class down to the lowest working classwhenever you give them a fair chance whenever you give them fair food and air and physical education of any kind prove them to be the finest race in europe  not merely the aristocracy splendid race as they are but down and down and down to the lowest labouring man to the navigatorwhy there is not such a body of men in europe as our navigators and no body of men perhaps have had a worse chance of growing to be what they are and yet see what they have done  see the magnificent men they become in spite of all that is against them dragging them down tending to give them rickets and consumption and all the miserable diseases which children contract see what men they are and then conceive what they might be  it has been said again and again that there are no more beautiful race of women in europe than the wives and daughters of our london shopkeepers and yet there are few races of people who lead a life more in opposition to all rules of hygiene  but in spite of all that so wonderful is the vitality of the english race they are what they are and therefore we have the finest material to work upon that people ever had  and therefore again we have the less excuse if we do allow english people to grow up puny stunted and diseased  let me refer again to that word that i used deaththe amount of death  i really believe there are hundreds of good and kind people who would take up this subject with their whole heart and soul if they were aware of the magnitude of the evil  lord shaftesbury told you just now that there were one hundred thousand preventable deaths in england every year  so it is  we talk of the loss of human life in war  we are the fools of smoke and noise because there are cannonballs forsooth and swords and red coats and because it costs a great deal of money and makes a great deal of talk in the papers we think  what so terrible as war  i will tell you what is ten times and ten thousand times more terrible than war and that is outraged nature  war we are discovering now is the clumsiest and most expensive of all games we are finding that if you wish to commit an act of cruelty and folly the most costly one that you can commit is to contrive to shoot your fellowmen in war  so it is and thank god that so it is but nature insidious inexpensive silent sends no roar of cannon no glitter of arms to do her work she gives no warning note of preparation she has no protocols nor any diplomatic advances whereby she warns her enemy that war is coming silently i say and insidiously she goes forth no she does not even go forth she does not step out of her path but quietly by the very same means by which she makes alive she puts to death and so avenges herself of those who have rebelled against her  by the very same laws by which every blade of grass grows and every insect springs to life in the sunbeam she kills and kills and kills and is never tired of killing till she has taught man the terrible lesson he is so slow to learn that nature is only conquered by obeying her  and bear in mind one thing more  man has his courtesies of war and his chivalries of war he does not strike the unarmed man he spares the woman and the child  but nature is as fierce when she is offended as she is bounteous and kind when she is obeyed  she spares neither woman nor child  she has no pity for some awful but most good reason she is not allowed to have any pity silently she strikes the sleeping babe with as little remorse as she would strike the strong man with the spade or the musket in his hand  ah would to god that some man had the pictorial eloquence to put before the mothers of england the mass of preventable suffering the mass of preventable agony of mind and body which exists in england year after year and would that some man had the logical eloquence to make them understand that it is in their power in the power of the mothers and wives of the higher class i will not say to stop it allgod only knows that but to stop as i believe threefourths of it  it is in the power i believe of any woman in this room to save three or four liveshuman livesduring the next six months  it is in your power ladies and it is so easy  you might save several lives apiece if you choose without i believe interfering with your daily business or with your daily pleasure or if you choose with your daily frivolities in any way whatsoever  let me ask then those who are here and who have not yet laid these things to heart  will you let this meeting to day be a mere passing matter of two or three hours interest which you may go away and forget for the next book or the next amusement  or will you be in earnest  will you learni say it openlyfrom the noble chairman how easy it is to be in earnest in life how every one of you amid all the artificial complications of english society in the nineteenth century can find a work to do a noble work to do a chivalrous work to do just as chivalrous as if you lived in any old magic land such as spenser talked of in his faerie queene how you can be as true a knighterrant or ladyerrant in the present century as if you had lived far away in the dark ages of violence and rapine  will you i ask learn this  will you learn to be in earnest and to use the position and the station and the talent that god has given you to save alive those who should live  and will you remember that it is not the will of your father that is in heaven that one little one that plays in the kennel outside should perish either in body or in soul    a mad world my masters 12    the cholera as was to be expected has reappeared in england again and england as was to be expected has taken no sufficient steps towards meeting it so that if as seems but too probable the plague should spread next summer we may count with tolerable certainty upon a loss of some ten thousand lives  that ten thousand or one thousand innocent people should die of whom most if not all might be saved alive would seem at first sight a matter serious enough for the attention of philanthropists  those who abhor the practice of hanging one man would one fancies abhor equally that of poisoning many and would protest as earnestly against the painful capital punishment of diarrhoea as against the painless one of hempen rope  those who demand mercy for the sepoy and immunity for the coolie women of delhi unsexed by their own brutal and shameless cruelty would one fancies demand mercy also for the british workman and immunity for his wife and family  one is therefore somewhat startled at finding that the british nation reserves to itself though it forbids to its armies the right of putting to death unarmed and unoffending men women and children  after further consideration however one finds that there are as usual two sides to the question  one is bound indeed to believe even before proof that there are two sides  it cannot be without good and sufficient reason that the british public remains all but indifferent to sanitary reform that though the science of epidemics as a science has been before the world for more than twenty years nobody believes in it enough to act upon it save some few dozen of fanatics some of whom have it cannot be denied a direct pecuniary interest in disturbing what they choose to term the poisonmanufactories of free and independent britons  yes we should surely respect the expressed will and conviction of the most practical of nations arrived at after the experience of three choleras stretching over a whole generation  public opinion has declared against the necessity of sanitary reform and is not public opinion known to be in these last days the ithuriels spear which is to unmask and destroy all the follies superstitions and cruelties of the universe  the immense majority of the british nation will neither cleanse themselves nor let others cleanse them  and are we not governed by majorities are not majorities confessedly always in the right even when smallest and a show of hands a surer test of truth than any amount of wisdom learning or virtue  how much more then when a whole free people is arrayed in the calm magnificence of self confident conservatism against a few innovating and perhaps sceptical philosophasters  then surely if ever vox populi is vox coeli  and in fact when we come to examine the first and commonest objection against sanitary reformers we find it perfectly correct  they are said to be theorists dreamers of the study who are ignorant of human nature and who in their materialist optimism have forgotten the existence of moral evil till they almost fancy at times that they can set the world right simply by righting its lowest material arrangements  the complaint is perfectly true  they have been ignorant of human nature they have forgotten the existence of moral evil and if any religious periodical should complain of their denying original sin they can only answer that they did in past years fall into that folly but that subsequent experience has utterly convinced them of the truth of the doctrine  for misled by this ignorance of human nature they expected help from time to time from various classes of the community from whom no help as they ought to have known at first is to be gotten  some as a fact expected the assistance of the clergy and especially of the preachers of those denominations who believe that every human being by the mere fact of his birth into this world is destined to endless torture after death unless the preacher can find an opportunity to deliver him therefrom before he dies  they supposed that to such preachers the mortal lives of men would be inexpressibly precious that any science which held out a prospect of retarding death in the case of lost millions would be hailed as a heavenly boon and would be carried out with the fervour of men who felt that for the souls sake no exertion was too great in behalf of the body  a little more reflection would have quashed their vain hope  they would have recollected that each of these preachers was already connected with a congregation that he had already a hold on them and they on him that he was bound to provide for their spiritual wants before going forth to seek for fresh objects of his ministry  they would have recollected that on the old principle and a very sound one of a bird in the hand being worth two in the bush the minister of a congregation would feel it his duty as well as his interest not to defraud his flock of his labours by spending valuable time on a secular subject like sanitary reform in the hope of possibly preserving a few human beings whose souls he might hereafter and that again would be merely a possibility benefit  they would have recollected again that these congregations are almost exclusively composed of those classes who have little or nothing to fear from epidemics and what is even more important who would have to bear the expenses of sanitary improvements  but so sanguine so reckless of human conditions had their theories made them that they actually expected that parish rectors already burdened with overwork and vestry quarrelsnay even that preachers who got their bread by pewrents and whose life long struggle was therefore to keep those pews filled and those renters in good humourshould astound the respectable house owners and ratepayers who sat beneath them by the appalling words you and not the visitation of god are the cause of epidemics and of you now that you are once fairly warned of your responsibility will your brothers blood be required  conceive sanitary reformers expecting this of ministers let their denomination be what it mightmany of the poor men too with a wife and seven children  truly has it been said that nothing is so cruel as the unreasonableness of a fanatic  they forgot too that sanitary science like geology must be at first sight suspect in the eyes of the priests of all denominations at least till they shall have arrived at a much higher degree of culture than they now possess  like geology it interferes with that deus e machina theory of human affairs which has been in all ages the stronghold of priestcraft  that the deity is normally absent and not present that he works on the world by interference and not by continuous laws that it is the privilege of the priesthood to assign causes for these judgments and visitations of the almighty and to tell mankind why he is angry with them and has broken the laws of nature to punish themthis in every age has seemed to the majority of priests a doctrine to be defended at all hazards for without it so they hold their occupation were gone at once 13 no wonder then if they view with jealousy a set of laymen attributing these judgments to purely chemical laws and to misdoings and ignorance which have as yet no place in the ecclesiastical catalogue of sins  true it may be that the sanitary reformers are right but they had rather not think so and it is very easy not to think so  they only have to ignore to avoid examining the facts  their canon of utility is a peculiar one and with facts which do not come under that canon they have no concern  it may be true for instance that the eighteenth century which to the clergy is a period of scepticism darkness and spiritual death is the very century which saw more done for science for civilisation for agriculture for manufacture for the prolongation and support of human life than any preceding one for a thousand years and more  what matter  that is a secular question of which they need know nothing  and sanitary reform if true is just such another a matter as slavery has been seen to be by the preachers of the united states for the legislator and not for those whose kingdom is not of this world  others again expected with equal wisdom the assistance of the political economist  the fact is undeniable but at the same time inexplicable  what they could have found in the doctrines of most modern political economists which should lead them to suppose that human life would be precious in their eyes is unknown to the writer of these pages  those whose bugbear has been over population whose motto has been an euphuistic version of   the more the merrier but the fewer the better fare    cannot be expected to lend their aid in increasing the population by saving the lives of twothirds of the children who now die prematurely in our great cities and so still further overcrowding this unhappy land with those helpless and expensive sources of national povertyrational human beings in strength and health  moreoverand this point is worthy of serious attentionthat school of political economy which has now reached its full development has taken all along a view of mans relation to nature diametrically opposite to that taken by the sanitary reformer or indeed by any other men of science  the sanitary reformer holds in common with the chemist or the engineer that nature is to be obeyed only in order to conquer her that man is to discover the laws of her existing phenomena in order that he may employ them to create new phenomena himself to turn the laws which he discovers to his own use if need be to counteract one by another  in this power it has seemed to them lay his dignity as a rational being  it was this the power of invention which made him a progressive animal not bound as the bird and the bee are to build exactly as his forefathers built five thousand years ago  by political economy alone has this faculty been denied to man in it alone he is not to conquer nature but simply to obey her let her starve him make him a slave a bankrupt or what not he must submit as the savage does to the hail and the lightning laissezfaire says the science du neant the science de la misere as it has truly and bitterly been called laissez faire  analyse economic questions if you will  but beyond analysis you shall not step  any attempt to raise political economy to its synthetic stage is to break the laws of nature to fight against factsas if facts were not made to be fought against and conquered and put out of the way whensoever they interfere in the least with the welfare of any human being  the drowning man is not to strike out for his life lest by keeping his head above water he interfere with the laws of gravitation  not that the political economist or any man can be true to his own fallacy  he must needs try his hand at the synthetic method though he forbids it to the rest of the world  but the only deductive hint which he has as yet given to mankind is quaintly enough the most unnatural eidolon specus which ever entered the head of a dehumanised pedantnamely that once famous preventive check which if a nation did ever apply itas it never will could issue as every doctor knows in nothing less than the questionable habits of abortion childmurder and unnatural crime  the only explanation of such conduct though one which the men themselves will hardly accept is thisthat they secretly share somewhat in the doubt which many educated men have of the correctness of their inductions that these same laws of political economy where they leave the plain and safe subjectmatter of trade have been arrived at somewhat too hastily that they are in plain english not quite sound enough yet to build upon and that we must wait for a few more facts before we begin any theories  be it so  at least these men in their present temper of mind are not likely to be very useful to the sanitary reformer  would that these men or the clergy had been the only bruised reed in which the sanitary reformers put their trust  they found another reed however and that was public opinion but they forgot that whatever the stumporators may say about this being the age of electric thought when truth flashes triumphant from pole to pole etc we have no proof whatsoever that the proportion of fools is less in this generation than in those before it or that truth when unpalatable as it almost always is travels any faster than it did five hundred years ago  they forgot that every social improvement and most mechanical ones have had to make their way against laziness ignorance envy vested wrongs vested superstitions and the whole vis inertiae of the world the flesh and the devil  they were guilty indeed in this case not merely of ignorance of human nature but of forgetfulness of fact  did they not know that the excellent new poorlaw was greeted with the curses of those very farmers and squires who now not only carry it out lovingly and willingly to the very letter but are often too ready to resist any improvement or relaxation in it which may be proposed by that very poorlaw board from which it emanated  did they not know that agricultural science though of sixty years steady growth has not yet penetrated into a third of the farms of england and that hundreds of farmers still dawdle on after the fashion of their forefathers when by looking over the next hedge into their neighbours field they might double their produce and their profits  did they not know that the adaptation of steam to machinery would have progressed just as slowly had it not been a fact patent to babies that an engine is stronger than a horse and that if cotton like wheat and beef had taken twelve months to manufacture instead of five minutes manchester foresight would probably have been as short and as purblind as that of the british farmer  what right had they to expect a better reception for the facts of sanitary sciencefacts which ought to and ultimately will disturb the vested interests of thousands will put them to inconvenience possibly at first to great expense and yet facts which you can neither see nor handle but must accept and pay hundreds of thousands of pounds for on the mere word of a doctor or inspector who gets his living thereby  poor john bull  to expect that you would accept such a gospel cheerfully was indeed to expect too much  but yet though the public opinion of the mass could not be depended on there was a body left distinct from the mass and priding itself so much on that distinctness that it was ready to say at timesof course in more courteousat least in what it considered more scriptural language  this people which knoweth not the law is accursed  to it thereforeto the religious worldsome oversanguine sanitary reformers turned their eyes they saw in it ready organised so it professed for all good works a body such as the world had never seen before  where the religions public of byzantium alexandria or rome numbered hundreds that of england numbered its thousands  it was divided indeed on minor points but it was surely united by the one aim of saving every man his own soul and of professing the deepest reverence for that divine book which tells men that the way to attain that aim is to be good and to do good and which contains among other commandments this onethou shaft not kill  its wealth was enormous  it possessed so much political power that it would have been able to command elections to compel ministers to encourage the weak hearts of willing but fearful clergymen by fair hopes of deaneries and bishoprics  its members were no clique of unpractical fanaticsno men less  though it might number among them a few martinet expostcaptains and noblemen of questionable sanity capable of no more practical study than that of unfulfilled prophecy the vast majority of them were landowners merchants bankers commercial men of all ranks full of worldly experience and of the science of organisation skilled all their lives in finding and in employing men and money  what might not be hoped from such a body to whom that commercial imperium in imperio of the french protestants which the edict of nantes destroyed was poor and weak  add to this that these mens charities were boundless that they were spending yearly and on the whole spending wisely and well ten times as much as ever was spent before in the world on educational schemes missionary schemes church building reformatories ragged schools needlewomens charitieswhat not  no object of distress it seemed could be discovered no fresh means of doing good devised but these mens money poured bountifully and at once into that fresh channel and an organisation sprang up for the employment of that money as thrifty and as handy as was to be expected from the moneyholding classes of this great commercial nation  what could not these men do  what were they not bound by their own principles to do  no wonder that some weak mens hearts beat high at the thought  what if the religious world should take up the cause of sanitary reform  what if they should hail with joy a cause in which all whatever their theological differences might join in one sacred crusade against dirt degradation disease and death  what if they should rise at the hustings to inquire of every candidate  will you or will you not pledge yourself to carry out sanitary reform in the place for which you are elected and let the health and the lives of the local poor be that local interest which you are bound by your election to defend  do you confess your ignorance of the subject  then know sir that you are unfit at this point of the nineteenth century to be a member of the british senate  you go thither to make laws for the preservation of life and property  you confess yourself ignorant of those physical laws stronger and wider than any which you can make upon which all human life depends by infringing which the whole property of a district is depreciated  again what might not the religious world and the public opinion of professing christians have done in the last twentyay in the last three years  what it has done is too patent to need comment here  the reasons of so strange an anomaly are to be approached with caution  it is a serious thing to impute motives to a vast body of men of whom the majority are really respectable kindhearted and useful and if in giving ones deliberate opinion one seems to blame them let it be recollected that the blame lies not so much on them as on their teachers  on those who for some reasons best known to themselves have truckled to and even justified the selfsatisfied ignorance of a comfortable moneyed class  but let it be said and said boldly that these mens conduct in the matter of sanitary reform seems at least to show that they value virtue not for itself but for its future rewards  to the great majority of these men with some heroic exceptions whose names may be written in no subscription list but are surely written in the book of life the great truth has never been revealed that good is the one thing to be done at all risks for its own sake that good is absolutely and infinitely better than evil whether it pay or not to all eternity  ask one of them is it better to do right and go to hell or do wrong and go to heaventhey will look at you puzzled half angry suspecting you of some secret blasphemy and if hard pressed put off the new and startling question by saying that it is absurd to talk of an impossible hypothesis  the human portion of their virtue is not mercenary for they are mostly worthy men the religious part thereof that which they keep for sundays and for charitable institutions is too often mercenary though they know it not their religion is too often one of loss and gain as much as father newmans own and their actions whether they shall call them good works or fruits of faith are so much spiritual capital to be repaid with interest at the last day  therefore like all religionists they are most anxious for those schemes of good which seem most profitable to themselves and to the denomination to which they belong and the best of all such works is of course as with all religionists the making of proselytes  they really care for the bodies but still they care more for the souls of those whom they assistand not wrongly either were it not that to care for a mans soul usually means in the religious world to make him think with you at least to lay him under such obligations as to give you spiritual power over him  therefore it is that all religious charities in england are more and more conducted just as much as those of jesuits and oratorians with an ulterior view of proselytism therefore it is that the religious world though it has invented perhaps no new method of doing good though it has been indebted for educational movements prison visitations infant schools ragged schools and so forth to quakers cobblers even in some cases to men whom they call infidels have gladly adopted each and every one of them as fresh means of enlarging the influence or the numbers of their own denominations and of baiting for the body in order to catch the soul  a fair sample of too much of their labour may be seen anywhere in those tracts in which the prettiest stories with the prettiest binding and pictures on the most secular even sometimes scientificof subjects end by a few words of pious exhortation inserted by a different hand from that which indites the carnal mass of the book  they did not invent the science or the art of storytelling or the woodcutting or the plan of getting books up prettilyor indeed the notion of instructing the masses at all but finding these things in the hands of the world they have spoiled the egyptians and fancy themselves beating satan with his own weapons  if indeed these men claimed boldly all printing all woodcutting all storytelling all human arts and sciences as gifts from god himself and said as the book which they quote so often says  the spirit of god gives man understanding these too are his gifts sacred miraculous to be accounted for to him then they would be consistent and then too they would have learnt perhaps to claim sanitary science for a gift divine as any other  but nothing alas is as yet further from their creed  and therefore it is that sanitary reform finds so little favour in their eyes  you have so little in it to show for your work  you may think you have saved the lives of hundreds but you cannot put your finger on one of them  and they know you not know not even their own danger much less your beneficence therefore you have no lien on them not even that of gratitude you cannot say to a man  i have prevented you having typhus therefore you must attend my chapel  no  sanitary reform makes no proselytes  it cannot be used as a religious engine  it is too simply human too little a respecter of persons too like to the works of him who causes his sun to shine on the evil and the good and his rain to fall on the just and on the unjust and is good to the unthankful and to the evil to find much favour in the eyes of a generation which will compass sea and land to make one proselyte  yes  too like the works of our father in heaven as indeed all truly natural and human science needs must be  true to those who believe that there is a father in heaven this would one supposes be the highest recommendation  but how many of this generation believe that  is not their doctrine the doctrine to testify for which the religious world exists the doctrine which if you deny you are met with one universal frown and snarlthat man has no father in heaven  but that if he becomes a member of the religious world by processes varying with each denomination he maystrange paradoxcreate a father for himself  but so it is  the religious world has lost the belief which even the elder greeks and romans had of a zeus father of gods and men  even that it has lost  therefore have man and the simple human needs of man no sacredness in their eyes therefore is nature to them no longer the will of god exprest in facts and to break a law of nature no longer to sin against him who looked on all that he had made and behold it was very good  and yet they read their bibles and believe that they believe in him who stood by the lakeside in galilee and told men that not a sparrow fell to the ground without their fathers knowledgeand that they were of more value than many sparrows  do those words now seem to some so selfevident as to be needless  they will never seem so to the sanitary reformer who has called on the british public to exert themselves in saving the lives of thousands yearly and has received practical answers which will furnish many a bitter jest for the voltaire of the next socalled age of unbelief or fill a sad but an instructive chapter in some future enlarged edition of adelungs history of human folly  all but despairing sanitary reformers have turned again and again to her majestys government  alas for them  the government was ready and willing enough to help  the wicked world said  of course  it will create a new department  it will give them more places to bestow  but the real reason of the willingness of government seems to be that those who compose it are thoroughly awake to the importance of the subject  but what can a poor government do whose strength consists as that of all english governments must in not seeming too strong which is allowed to do anything only on condition of doing the minimum  of course a government is morally bound to keep itself in existence for is it not bound to believe that it can govern the country better than any other knot of men  but its only chance of selfpreservation is to know with hesiods wise man how much better the half is than the whole and to throw over many a measure which it would like to carry for the sake of saving the few which it can carry  an english government nowadays is simply at the mercy of the forty or fifty members of the house of commons who are crotchety enough or dishonest enough to put it unexpectedly in a minority and they with the vast majority of the house are becoming more and more the delegates of that very class which is most opposed to sanitary reform  the honourable member goes to parliament not to express his opinions for he has stated most distinctly at the last election that he has no opinions whatsoever but to protect the local interests of his constituents  and the great majority of those constituents are small houseownersthe poorer portion of the middle class  were he to support government in anything like a sweeping measure of sanitary reform woe to his seat at the next election and he knows it and therefore even if he allow the government to have its central board of health he will take good care for his own sake that the said board shall not do too much and that it shall not compel his constituents to do anything at all  no wonder that while the attitude of the house of commons is such toward a matter which involves the lives of thousands yearly some educated men should be crying that representative institutions are on their trial and should sigh for a strong despotism  there is an answer nevertheless to such sentimentalists and one hopes that people will see the answer for themselves and that the infection of imperialism which seems spreading somewhat rapidly will be stopped by common sense and honest observation of facts  a despotism doubtless could carry out sanitary reform  but doubtless also it would not  a despot in the nineteenth century knows well how insecure his tenure is  his motto must be let us eat and drink for to morrow we die and therefore the first objects of his rule will be private luxury and a standing army while if he engage in public works for the sake of keeping the populace quiet they will be certain not to be such as will embroil him with the middle classes while they will win him no additional favour with the masses utterly unaware of their necessity  would the masses of paris have thanked louis napoleon the more if instead of completing the tuileries he had sewered the st antoine  all arguments to the contrary are utterly fallacious which are drawn from ancient despotisms roman eastern peruvian or other and for this simple reason that they had no middle class  if they did work well which is a question it was just because they had no middle classthat class which in a free state is the very life of a nation and yet which in a despotism is sure to be the root of its rottenness  for a despot who finds as louis napoleon has done a strong middle class already existing must treat it as he does he must truckle to it pander to its basest propensities seem to make himself its tool in order that he may make it his for the sake of his own life he must do it and were a despot to govern england tomorrow we should see that the man who was shrewd enough to have climbed to that bad eminence would be shrewd enough to know that he could scarcely commit a more suicidal act than by some despotic measure of sanitary reform to excite the illwill of all the most covetous the most stupid and the most stubborn men in every town of england  there is another answer too to imperialists who talk of representative institutions being on their trial and let it be made boldly just now  it will be time to talk of representative institutions being good or bad when the people of england are properly represented  in the first place it does seem only fair that the class who suffer most from epidemics should have some little share in the appointment of the men on whose votes extermination of epidemics now mainly depends  but that is too large a question to argue here  let the government see to it in the coming session  yet how much soever or how little soever the suffrage be extended in the direction of the working man let it be extended at least in some equal degree in the direction of the educated man  few bodies in england now express the opinions of educated men less than does the present house of commons  it is not chosen by educated men any more than it is by proletaires  it is not on an average composed of educated men and the many educated men who are in it have for the most part to keep their knowledge very much to themselves for fear of hurting the feelings of ten pound jack or of the local attorney who looks after jacks vote and therefore the house of commons does not represent public opinion  for to enounce with fitting clearness a great but muchforgotten truth to have an opinion you must have an opinion  strange  but true and pregnant too  for from it may be deduced this corollary that ninetenths of what is called public opinion is no opinion at all for on the matters which come under the cognizance of the house of commons save where superstition as in the case of the sabbath or the jew bill sets folks thinking generally on the wrong side nine people out of ten have no opinion at all know nothing about the matter and care less wherefore having no opinions to be represented it is not important whether that nothing be represented or not  the true public opinion of england is composed of the opinions of the shrewd honest practical men in her whether educated or not and of such thank god there are millions  but it consists also of the opinions of the educated men in her men who have had leisure and opportunity for study who have some chance of knowing the future because they have examined the past who can compare england with other nations english creeds laws customs with those of the rest of mankind who know somewhat of humanity human progress human existence who have been practised in the processes of thought and who from study have formed definite opinions differing doubtless in infinite variety but still all founded upon facts by something like fair and scientific induction  till we have this class of men fairly represented in the house of commons there is little hope for sanitary reform  when it is so represented we shall have no reason to talk of representative institutions being on their trial  and it is one of the few hopeful features of the present time that an attempt is at last being made to secure for educated men of all professions a fair territorial representation  a memorial to the government has been presented appended to which in very great numbers are the names of men of note of all ranks all shades in politics and religion all professionslegal clerical military medical and literary  a list of names representing so much intellect so much learning so much acknowledged moderation so much good work already done and acknowledged by the country has never perhaps been collected for any political purpose and if their scheme the details of which are not yet made public should in anywise succeed it will do more for the prospects of sanitary reform than any forward movement of the quarter of a century  for if sanitary reform or perhaps any really progressive measure is to be carried out henceforth we must go back to something like the old principle of the english constitution by which intellect as such had its proper share in the public councils  during those middle ages when all the intellect and learning was practically possessed by the clergy they constituted a separate estate of the realm  this was the old planthe best which could be then devised  after learning became common to the laity the educated classes were represented more and more only by such clever young men as could be thrust into parliament by the private patronage of the aristocracy  since the last reform bill even that supply of talent has been cut off and the consequence has been the steady deterioration of our house of commons toward such a level of mediocrity as shall satisfy the ignorance of the practically electing majority namely the tail of the middle class men who are apt to possess all the failings with few of the virtues of those above them and below them who have no more intellectual training than the simple working man and far less than the average shopman and who yet lose under the influence of a small competence that practical training which gives to the working man made strong by wholesome necessity chivalry endurance courage and selfrestraint whose business morality is made up of the lowest and narrowest maxims of the commercial world unbalanced by that public spirit that political knowledge that practical energy that respect for the good opinion of his fellows which elevate the large employer  on the hustings of course this description of the average free and independent elector would be called a calumny and yet where is the member of parliament who will not in his study assent to its truth and confess that of all men whom he meets those who least command his respect are those among his constituents to secure whom he takes most trouble unless indeed it be the pettifoggers who manage his election for him  whether this is the class to whose public opinion the health and lives of the masses are to be entrusted is a question which should be settled as soon as possible  meanwhile let every man who would awake to the importance of sanitary questions do his best to teach and preach in season and out of season and to instruct as far as he can that public opinion which is as yet but public ignorance  let him throw for instance what weight he has into the national association for the advancement of social science  in it he will learn as well as teach not only on sanitary reforms but upon those cognate questions which must be considered with it if it is ever to be carried out  indeed this new national association seems the most hopeful and practical move yet made by the sanitarists  it may be laughed at somewhat at first as the british association was but the world will find after a while that like the british association it can do great things towards moulding public opinion and compel men to consider certain subjects simply by accustoming people to hear them mentioned  the association will not have existed in vain if it only removes that dull fear and suspicion with which englishmen are apt to regard a new subject simply because it is new  but the association will do far more than that  it has wisely not confined itself to any one branch of social science but taken the subject in all its complexity  to do otherwise would have been to cripple itself  it would have shut out many subjectslaw reform for instancewhich are necessary adjuncts to any sanitary scheme while it would have shut out that very large class of benevolent people who have as yet been devoting their energies to prisons workhouses and schools  such will now have an opportunity of learning that they have been treating the symptoms of social disease rather than the disease itself  they will see that vice is rather the effect than the cause of physical misery and that the surest mode of attacking it is to improve the physical conditions of the lower classes to abolish foul air fouled water foul lodging and overcrowded dwellings in which morality is difficult and common decency impossible  they will not give upheaven forbid that they should give uptheir special good works but they will surely throw the weight of their names their talents their earnestness into the great central object of preserving human life as soon as they shall have recognised that prevention is better than cure and that the simple and one method of prevention is to give the working man his rights  water air light  a right to these three at least he has  in demanding them he demands no more than god gives freely to the wild beast of the forest  till society has given him them it does him an injustice in demanding of him that he should be a useful member of society  if he is expected to be a man let him at least be put on a level with the brutes  when the benevolent of the land and they may be numbered by tens of thousands shall once have learnt this plain and yet awful truth a vast upward step will have been gained  because this new association will teach it them during the next ten or twenty years may gods blessing be on it and on the noble old man who presides over it  often already has he deserved well of his country but never better than now when he has lent his great name and great genius to the object of preserving human life from wholesale destruction by unnecessary poison  and meanwhile let the sanitary reformer work and wait  go not after the world said a wise man for if thou stand still long enough the world will come round to thee  and to sanitary reform the world will come round at last  grumbling scoffing cursing its benefactors boasting at last as usual that it discovered for itself the very truths which it tried to silence it will come and will be glad at last to accept the one sibylline leaf at the same price at which it might have had the whole  the sanitary reformer must make up his mind to see no fruit of his labours much less thanks or reward  he must die in faith as st paul says all true men die not having received the promises worn out perhaps by illpaid and unappreciated labour as that truesthearted and most unselfish of men charles robert walsh died but two years ago  but his works will follow himnot as the preachers tell us to heavenfor of what use would they be there to him or to mankindbut here on earth where he set them that they might go on in his path after his example and prosper and triumph long years after he is dead when his memory shall be blessed by generations not merely yet unborn but who never would have been born at all had he not inculcated into their unwilling fathers the simplest laws of physical health decency lifelaws which the wild cat of the wood burying its own excrement apart from its lair has learnt by the light of nature but which neither nature nor god himself can as yet teach to a selfish perverse and hypocritical generation    footnotes  1  this lecture was one of a series of lectures to ladies given in london in 1855 at the needlewomans

at hitchin whence the college was removed  and that the wise ladies who superintend that establishment propose also that most excellent institutiona swimmingbath  a paper moreover read before the london association of schoolmistresses in 1866 on physical exercises and recreation for girls deserves all attention  may those who promote such things prosper as they deserve  9  lecture delivered at
