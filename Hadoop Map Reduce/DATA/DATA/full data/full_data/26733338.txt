26733338	the rudder grangers abroad and other stories     by  frank r stockton   1891 1894      contents     i euphemia among the pelicans  ii the rudder grangers in england iii pomonas daughter  iv derelict   v the baker of barnbury  vi the waterdevil     euphemia among the pelicans   the sun shone warm and soft as it shines in winter time in the semitropics the wind blew strong as it blows whenever and wherever it listeth seven pelicans labored slowly through the air a flock of ducks rose from the surface of the river a school of mullet disturbed by a shark or some other unscrupulous pursuer sprang suddenly out of the water just before us and fell into it again like the splashing of a sudden shower  i lay upon the roof of the cabin of a little yacht euphemia stood below her feet upon the messchest and her elbows resting on the edge of the cabin roof a sudden squall would have unshipped her still if one would be happy there are risks that must be assumed at the open entrance of the cabin busily writing on a hangingshelf that served as a table sat a paying teller on the high box which during most of the day covered our stove was a little lady writing in a notebook on the forward deck at the foot of the mast sat a young man in a state of placidness his feet stuck out on the bowsprit while his mildly contemplative eyes went forth unto the roundabout  at the tiller stood our guide and boatman his sombre eye steady on the southbyeast around the horizon of his countenance there spread a dark and sixdays beard like a slowly rising thundercloud ever and anon there was a gleam of white teeth like a bright break in the sky but it meant nothing during all our trip the sun never shone in that face it never stormed but it was always cloudy but he was the best boatman on those waters and when he stood at the helm we knew we sailed secure we wanted a man familiar with storms and squalls and if this familiarity had developed into facial sympathy it mattered not we could attend to our own sunshine at his feet sat humbly his boy of twelve whom we called the crew he was making fancy knots in a bit of rope this and the occupation of growing up were the only labors in which he willingly engaged  euphemia and i had left rudder grange to spend a month or two in florida and we were now on a little sloopyacht on the bright waters of the indian river it must not be supposed that because we had a paying teller with us we had set up a floating bank with this paying teller from a distant state we had made acquaintance on our first entrance into florida he was travelling in what euphemia called a group which consisted of his wifethe little lady with the notebookthe contemplative young man on the forward deck and himself  this paying teller had worked so hard and so rapidly at his business for several years and had paid out so much of his health and strength that it was necessary for him to receive large deposits of these essentials before he could go to work again but the peculiar habits of his profession never left him he was continually paying out something if you presented a conversational check to him in the way of a remark he would figuratively speaking immediately jump to his little window and proceed to cash it sometimes astonishing you by the amount of small change he would spread out before you  when he heard of our intention to cruise on indian river he wished to join his group to our party and as he was a good fellow we were glad to have him do so his wife had been or was still a schoolteacher her bright and cheerful face glistened with information  the contemplative young man was a distant connection of the teller and his first name being quincy was commonly called quee if he had wanted to know any of the many things the little teacher wished to tell he would have been a happy youth but his  contemplation seldom crystallized into a knowledge of what he did want to know  and how can i she once said to euphemia and myself be expected ever to offer him any light when he can never bring himself to actually roll up a question  this was said while i was rolling a cigarette  the group was greatly given to writing in journals and making estimates euphemia and i did little of this as it was our holiday but it was often pleasant to see the work going on the business in which the paying teller was now engaged was the writing of his journal and his wife held a pencil in her kidded fingers and a little blankbook on her knees  this was our first day upon the river  where are we asked euphemia i know we are on the indian river but where is the indian river  it is here i said  but where is here reiterated euphemia  there are only three places in the world said the teacher looking up from her bookhere there and we dont know where every spot on earth is in one or the other of those three places  as far as i am concerned said euphemia the indian river is in the last place  then we must hasten to take it out said the teacher and she dived into the cabin soon reappearing with a folding map of florida here she said do you see that wide river running along part of the atlantic coast of the state and extending down as far as jupiter inlet that is indian river and we are on it its chief characteristics are that it is not a river but an arm of the sea and that it is full of fish  it seems to me to be so full said i that there is not room for them allthat is if we are to judge by the way the mullet jump out  i think said the teacher making a spot with her pencil on the map that just now we are about here  it is the first time said euphemia that i ever looked upon an unknown region on the map and felt i was there  our plans for travel and living were very simple we had provided ourselves on starting with provisions for several weeks and while on the river we cooked and ate on board our little vessel when we reached jupiter inlet we intended to go into camp every night we anchored near the shore euphemia and i occupied the cabin of the boat a tent was pitched on shore for the teller and his wife there was another tent for the captain and his boy and this was shared by the contemplative young man  our second night on the river was tinged with incident we had come to anchor near a small settlement and our craft had been moored to a rude wharf about the middle of the night a windstorm arose and euphemia and i were awakened by the bumping of the boat against the wharfposts through the open end of the cabin i could see that the night was very dark and i began to consider the question whether or not it would be necessary for me to get up much  preferring however that the wind should go down before i had made up my mind we heard a step on the cabin above us and then a quick and hurried tramping i put my head out of the little window by me and cried  whos there  the voice of the boatman replied out of the darkness  shell bump herself to pieces against this pier im going to tow you out into the stream and so he cast us loose and getting into the little boat which was fastened to our stern and always followed us as a colt its mother he towed us far out into the stream there he anchored us and rowed away the bumps now ceased but the wind still blew violently the waves ran high and the yacht continually wobbled up and down tugging and jerking at her anchor neither of us was frightened but we could not sleep  i know nothing can happen said euphemia for he would not have left us here if everything had not been all right but one might as well try to sleep in a cornpopper as in this bed  after a while the violent motion ceased and there was nothing but a gentle surging up and down  i am so glad the wind has lulled said euphemia from the other side of the centreboard partition which partially divided the cabin  although i could still hear the wind blowing strongly outside i too was glad that its force had diminished so far that we felt no more the violent jerking that had disturbed us and i soon fell asleep  in the morning when i awoke i saw that the sun was shining brightly and that a large seagrape bush was hanging over our stern i sprang out of bed and found that we had run stern foremost upon a sandy beach about forty feet away upon the shore stood two possums gazing with white triangular faces upon our stranded craft except these and some ducks swimming near us with seven pelicans flying along on the other side of the river there was no sign of life within the range of my sight i was not long in understanding the situation it had not been the lulling of the storm but the parting of our cable which had caused the uneasy jerking of our little yacht to cease we had been blown i knew not how far down the river for the storm had come from the north and had stranded i knew not where taking out my pocketcompass i found that we were on the eastern shore of the river and that the wind had changed completely and was now blowing not very strong from the southeast i made up my mind what must be done we were probably far from the settlement and the rest of the party and we must go back the wind was in our favor and i knew i could sail the boat i had never sailed a boat in my life and was only too glad to have the opportunity untrammelled by any interference  i awoke euphemia and told her what had happened the two possums stood upon the shore and listened to our conversation euphemia was much impressed by the whole affair and for a time said nothing  we must sail her back i suppose she remarked at length but do you know how to start her  the hardest thing to do is to get her off the beach i answered but i think i can do that  i rolled up my trousers and with bare feet jumped out upon the sand the two possums retired a little but still watched my proceedings after a great deal of pushing and twisting and lifting i got the yacht afloat and then went on board to set the sail after much pulling and tugging and making myself very warm i hoisted the mainsail i did not trouble myself about the jib one sail being enough for me to begin with as the wind was blowing in the direction in which we wished to go i let the sail out until it stood nearly at right angles with the vessel and was delighted to see that we immediately began to move through the water i took the tiller and steered gradually toward the middle of the river the wind blew steadily and the yacht moved bravely on i was as proud as a man drawn by a conquered lion and as happy as one who did not know that conquered lions may turn and rend sometimes the vessel rolled so much that the end of the boom skimmed the surface of the water and sometimes the sail gave a little jerk and flap but i saw no necessity for changing our course and kept our bow pointed steadily up the river i was delighted that the direction of the wind enabled me to sail with what might be called a horizontal deck of course as the boatman afterward informed me this was the most dangerous way i could steer for if the sail should suddenly jibe there would be no knowing what would happen euphemia sat near me perfectly placid and cheerful and her absolute  trust in me gave me renewed confidence and pleasure there is one great comfort she remarked as she sat gazing into the waterif anything should happen to the boat we can get out and walk  there was force in this remark for the indian river in some of its widest parts is very shallow and we could now plainly see the bottom a few feet below us  is that the reason you have seemed so trustful and content i asked  that is the reason said euphemia on we went and on the yacht seeming sometimes a little restive and impatient and sometimes rolling more than i could see any necessity for but still it proceeded euphemia sat in the shadow of the cabin serene and thoughtful and i holding the tiller steadily amidship leaned back and gazed up into the clear blue sky  in the midst of my gazing there came a shock that knocked the tiller out of my hand euphemia sprang to her feet and screamed there were screams and shouts on the other side of the sail which seemed to be wrapping itself about some object i could not see in an instant another mast beside our own appeared above the mainsail and then a man with a red face jumped on the forward deck with a quick determined  air and without saying a word or seeming to care for my permission he proceeded to lower our sail then he stepped up on top of the cabin and looking down at me inquired what in thunder i was trying to do  i made no answer but looked steadily before me now that the sail was down i could see what had happened i had collided with a yacht which we had seen before it was larger than ours and contained a grandfather and a grandmother a father and a mother several aunts and a great many children they had started on the river the same day as ourselves but did not intend to take so extended a trip as ours was to be the whole party was now in the greatest confusion i did not understand what they said nor did i attend to it i was endeavoring for myself to grasp the situation euphemia was calling to me from the cabin into which she had retreated the man was still talking to me from the cabin roof and the people in the other boat were vociferating and screaming but i paid no attention to any one until i had satisfied myself that nothing serious had happened i had not run into them head on but had come up diagonally and the side of our bow had struck the side of their stern the collision as i afterward learned had happened in this wise i had not seen the other boat because lying back as i had been the sail concealed her from me and they had not seen us because their boatman was in the forward part of their cabin collecting materials for breakfast and the tiller was left in charge of one of the boys who like all the rest of his party who sat outside had discreetly turned his back to the sun  the grandfather stood up in the stern he wore a black silk hat and carried a heavy grapevine cane unsteadily balancing himself on his legs and shaking his cane at me he cried  what is the meaning of this sir are you trying to drown a whole family sir  if hed run his bowsprit in among you said the boatman from the cabin roof hed a killed a lot of you before youd been drowned  euphemia screamed to me to come to her the father was standing on his cabin roof shouting something to me the women in the other boat were violently talking among themselves some of the little children were crying the girls were hanging to the ladies and all the boys were clambering on board our boat it was a time of great excitement and something must be instantly said by me my decision was quick  have you any tea i said addressing the old gentleman  tea he roared what do you mean by that  we have plenty of coffee on board i answered but some of our party cant drink it if you have any tea i should like to borrow some i can send it to you when we reach a store  from every person of the other party came as in a chorus the one word tea and euphemia put her pale face out of the cabin and said in a tone of wondering inquiry tea  did you bang into us this way to borrow tea roared the old gentleman  i did not intend of course to strike you so hard i said and i am sorry i did so but i should like to borrow some tea  euphemia whispered to me  we have tea  i looked at her and she locked her lips  of course we can give you some tea if you want some said the redfaced boatman but i never heerd of a thing like this since i was first born nor ever shall again i hope  i dont want you to give me any tea i said i shall certainly return it and a very little will dojust  a handful  the two boats had not drifted apart for the father standing on the cabin roof had held tightly to our rigging and the boatman still muttering went on board his vessel to get the tea he brought it wrapped in a piece of a newspaper  here comes your man he said pointing to a little boat which was approaching us we told him wed look out for you but we didnt think youd come smashing into us like this  in a few moments our boatman had pulled alongside his face full of a dark inquiry he looked at me for authoritative information  i came here i said to him after tea  before breakfast i should say cried the old gentleman and every one of his party burst out laughing  much was now said chiefly by the party of the other part but our boatman paid little attention to any of it the boys scrambled on board their own vessel we pushed apart hoisted sail and were soon speeding away  good bye shouted the father a genial man let us know if you want any more groceries and well send them to you  for six days from our time of starting we sailed down the indian river sometimes the banks were miles apart and sometimes they were very near each other sometimes we would come upon a solitary house or little cluster of dwellings and then there would be many many miles of wooded shore before another human habitation was to be seen inland to the west stretched a vast expanse of lonely forest where panthers bears and wildcats prowled to the east lay a long strip of land through whose tall palmettoes came the roar of the great ocean the blue sky sparkled over us every day now and then we met a little solitary craft countless waterfowl were scattered  about on the surface of the stream a school of mullet was usually jumping into the air an alligator might sometimes be seen steadily swimming across the river with only his nose and back exposed and nearly always either to the right or to the left going north or going south were seven pelicans slowly flopping  through the air  a portion of the river far southward called the narrows presented a very peculiar scene the banks were scarcely fifty feet apart and yet there were no banks the river was shut in to the right by the inland shore and to the left by a farreaching island and yet there was no inland shore nor any island to the left on either side were great forests of mangrove  trees standing tiptoe on their myriad downdropping  roots each root midleg in the water as far as we could see among the trees there was no sign of ground of any kindnothing but a grotesque network  of roots on which the forest stood in this greenbordered avenue of water which extended nine or ten miles the thick foliage shut out the breeze and our boatman was obliged to go ahead in his little boat and tow us along  there are indians out west said euphemia as she sat gazing into the mangroves who live on roots but i dont believe they could live on these the pappooses  would certainly fall through  at jupiter inlet about a hundred and fifty miles from our point of starting we went into camp in which delightful condition we proposed to remain for a week or more there was no trouble whatever in finding a suitable place for a camp the spot selected was a point of land swept by cool breezes with a palmetto forest in the rear of it on two sides of the point stretched the clear waters of the river while half a mile to the east was jupiter inlet on each side of which rolled and tumbled the surf of the atlantic about a mile away was jupiter lighthouse the only human habitation within twenty miles we built a palmetto hut for a kitchen we set up the tents in a permanent way we constructed a little pier for the yacht we built a washstand a table and a bench and then considering that we had actually gone into camp we got out our fishinglines  fishing was to be the great work here near the inlet through which the waters of the ocean poured into and out of our river on a long sandy beach we stood in line two or three hours every day except sunday and fished such fishing we had never imaginedthere  were so many fishes and they were so big the paying teller had never fished in his life before he came to florida he had tried at st augustine with but little success if the sport had been to chuck fish into the river he had said that would be more in my line of business but getting them out of it did not seem to suit me but here it was quite a different thing it was a positive delight to him he said to be obliged so often to pay out his line  one day when tired of struggling with gamy bluefish  and powerful cavalios if that is the way to spell it i wound up my line and looked about to see what the others were doing the paying teller stood near on tiptoe as usual with his legs wide apart his hat thrown back his eyes flashing over the water and his right arm stretched far out ready for a jerk quee was farther along the beach he had just landed a fish and was standing gazing meditatively upon it as it lay upon the sand the hook was still in its mouth and every now and then he would give the line a little pull as if to see if there really was a connection between it and the fish then he would stand a little longer and meditate a little more still looking  alternately at the line and the fish having made up his mind at last that the two things must be separated he kneeled down upon his flopping prize and proceeded meditatively to extract the hook the teacher was struggling at her line hand over hand she pulled it in as it came nearer and nearer her fish swam wildly from side to side making the tightened line fairly hiss as it swept through the water but still she pulled and pulled until red and breathless she landed her prize upon the sand  hurrah shouted the paying teller thats the biggest bluefish yet but he did not come to take the fish from the hook he was momentarily expecting a bite  euphemia was not to be seen this did not surprise  me as she frequently gave up fishing long before the others and went to stroll upon the seabeach a few hundred yards away she was fond of fishing but it soon tired her if you want to know what it is like she wrote to a friend in the north just tie a long string around your boy charlie and try to haul him out of the back yard into the house  but euphemia was not upon the seabeach today i walked a mile or so along the sand but did not find her she had gone around the little bluff to our sharkline this was a long rope like a clothesline with a short chain at the end and a great hook which was baited with a large piece of fish it was thrown out every day the land end tied to a stout stake driven into the sand and the whole business given into the charge of the crew who was to report if a shark should bite but today the little rascal had wandered away and euphemia was managing the line  i thought i would try to catch a shark all by myself she said i wonder if theres one on the hook now would you mind feeling the line  i laughed as i took the rope from her hand  if you had a shark on the hook my dear said i you would have no doubt upon the subject  it would be a splendid thing to catch the first one she said and there must be lots of them in here for we have seen their back fins so often  i was about to answer this remark when i began to walk out into the water i did not at the time know exactly why i did this but it seemed as if some one had taken me by the hand and was leading me into the depths but the water splashing above my ankles and a scream from euphemia made me drop the line which immediately spun out to its full length making the stake creak and move in the sand  goodness gracious cried euphemia her face pale as the beach isnt it horrible weve got one  horrible i cried didnt you want to get one and seizing the axe which lay near by i drove the stake deep down into the sand now it will hold him i cried he cant pull that out  but how are we to pull him in exclaimed euphemia this line is as tight as a guitarstring  this was true i took hold of the rope but could make no impression on it suddenly it slackened in my hand  hurrah i cried we may have him yet but we must play him  play him exclaimed euphemia you can never play a huge creature like that let me go and call some of the others to help  no no i said perhaps we can do it all by ourselves wind the line quickly around the top of the stake as i pull it in  euphemia knelt down and rapidly wound several yards of the slack cord around the stake in a few moments it tightened again jerking itself out of my hand  there now said euphemia he is off again you can never haul him in now  just wait i said when he finds that he cannot break away he rushes toward shore trying to bite the line above the chain then i must haul it in and you must wind it up if you and i and the shark continue to act in this way perhaps after a time we may get him into shallow water but dont scream or shout i dont want the others to know anything about it  sure enough in a minute or two the line slackened again when it was rapidly drawn in and wound around the stake  there he is exclaimed euphemia i can see him just under the water out there  the dark form of the shark appearing at first like the shadow of a little cloud could be seen near the surface about fifteen yards away then his back fin rose his tail splashed violently for an instant and he disappeared again the line was loosened and again the slack was hauled in and wound up this was repeated i dont know how many times when suddenly  the shark in his desperation rushed into shallow water and grounded himself he would have floundered  off in a few moments however had we not quickly tightened the line now we could see him plainly he was eight or nine feet long and struggled  violently exciting euphemia so much that it was only by clapping her hand over her mouth that she prevented herself from screaming i would have pulled the shark farther in shore but this was impossible  and it was needless to expect him to move himself  into shallower water so quickly rolling up my trousers i seized the axe and waded in toward the floundering creature  you neednt be afraid to go right up to him said euphemia so long as he dont turn over on his back he cant bite you  i had heard this bit of natural history before but nevertheless i went no nearer to the shark than was necessary in order to whack him over the head with the axe this i did several times with such effect that he soon became a dead shark  when i came out triumphant euphemia seized me in her arms and kissed me  this is perfectly splendid she said who can show as big a fish as this one none of the others can ever crow over you again  until one of them catches a bigger shark i said  which none of them ever will said euphemia decidedly it isnt in them  the boatman was now seen approaching in his boat to take the party back to camp and the crew having returned to his duty was sent off in a state of absolute amazement to tell the others to come and look at our prize our achievement certainly created a sensation even the boatman could find no words to express his astonishment he waded in and fastened a rope to the sharks tail and then we all took hold and hauled the great fish ashore  what is the good of it now you have got it asked quee  glory is some good exclaimed euphemia  and im going to have you a belt made from a strip of its skin i said  this seemed to euphemia a capital idea she would be delighted to have such a trophy of our deed and the boatman was set to work to cut a suitable strip from the fish and this belt having been properly tanned lined and fitted with buckles is now one of her favorite adornments and cost i am bound to add about three times as much as any handsome leathern belt to be bought in the stores  every day the paying teller his wife and quee carefully set down in their notebooks the weight of fish each individual had caught with all necessary details and specifications relating thereunto every day we wandered on the beach or explored the tropical  recesses of the palmetto woods every evening the boatman rowed over to the lighthouse to have a bit of gossip and to take thither the fish we did not need every day the sun was soft and warm and the sky was blue and every morning going oceanward and every evening going landward seven pelicans flew slowly by our camp  my greatest desire at this time was to shoot a pelican to have him properly prepared and to take him to rudder grange where suitably set up with his wings spread out full seven feet from tip to tip he would be a grand trophy and reminder of these indian river days this was the reason why nearly every morning and every evening i took a shot at these seven pelicans but i never hit one of them we had only a shotgun and the pelicans flew at a precautionary distance but being such big birds they always looked to me much nearer than they were euphemia earnestly desired that i should have a pelican and although she always wished i should hit one of these she was always glad when i did not  think how mournful it would be she said if they should take their accustomed flights morning and evening with one of their number missing  repeating wordsworths verses i suppose remarked  the little teacher  i had been disappointed in the number of pelicans we had seen i knew that florida was one of the homes of the pelican and i had not expected to see these birds merely in small detachments but our boatman assured me that on our return trip he would give me a chance of seeing and shooting as many pelicans  as i could desire we would touch at pelican island which was inhabited entirely by these birds and whence the parties of seven were evidently sent out  when we had had all the fishing we wanted we broke up our camp and started northward we had all been very happy and contented during our ten days sojourn in this delightful place but when at last our departure was determined upon the paying teller became possessed with a wild desire to go go go there was some reason never explained nor fully expressed why no day hour minute or second should be lost in speeding to the far northwest the boatman too impelled by what impulse i know not seemed equally anxious to get home as for the paying tellers group it always did exactly as he wished therefore although euphemia and i would have been glad to linger here and there upon our homeward way we could not gainsay the desire of the majority of the party and consequently we sailed northward as fast as wind and sometimes oars would take us  only one cause for delay seemed tolerable to the paying teller this was to stop at every postoffice we had received but one mail while in camp which had been brought in a sailboat from an office twenty miles away but the paying teller had given and written the most intricate and complex directions for the retention or forwarding of his mail to every postmaster  in the country we had passed through and these directions as we afterward found had so puzzled  and unsettled the minds of these postmasters that for several weeks his letters had been moving like shuttlecocks up and down the st johns and indian riversnever stopping anywhere never being delivered  but crossing and recrossing each other as if they were imbued with their owners desire to go go go some of the postoffices where we stopped were lonely little buildings with no other habitation near these we usually found shut up being opened only on maildays  and in such cases nothing could be done but to slip a protesting postal into the little slit in the wall apparently intended for letters whether these postals were eaten by rats or read by the pms we never discovered wherever an office was found open we left behind us an irate postmaster breathing all sorts of contemplated vengeance upon the disturbers of his peace we heard of letters that had been sent north and sent south but there never were any at the particular place where we happened to be and i suppose  that the accumulated mail of the paying teller may for several years drop gradually upon him through the meshes of the deadletter office  there were a great many points of interest which we had passed on our downward trip the boatman assuring us that with the wind we had and which might cease at any moment the great object was to reach jupiter as soon as possible and that we would stop at the interesting places on the way up but now the wind according to his reasoning made it necessary that we should again push forward as fast as we could and as i said before the irresistible attraction of the northwest so worked upon the paying  teller that he was willing to pause nowhere during  the daytime but at a postoffice at one place however i was determined to land this was pelican island the boatman paying no attention to his promise to stop here and give me an opportunity to shoot one of these birds declared when near the place that it would never do with such a wind to drop anchor for a trifle like a pelican the paying teller and quee also strongly objected to a stop and while the teacher had a great desire to investigate the subject of ornithology especially when exemplified by such a subject as a pelican she felt herself obliged to be loyal to her group and so quietly gave her voice to go on but i supported by euphemia remained so firm that we anchored a short distance from pelican island  none of the others had any desire to go ashore and so i with the gun and euphemia took the boat and rowed to the island while we were here the others determined to sail to the opposite side of the river to look for a little postoffice the existence of which the boatman had not mentioned until it had been determined  to make this stoppage here  as we approached the island we saw hundreds of pelicans some flying about some sitting on trunks and branches of dead trees and some waddling about on the shore  you might as well shoot two of them said euphemia  and then we will select the better one to take to rudder grange  the island was very boggy and muddy and before i had found a good place to land and had taken up the gun from the bow of the boat every pelican in sight took wing and flew away i stood up and fired both barrels at the retreating flock they swerved and flew oceanward but not one of them fell i helped euphemia on shore and then gun in hand i made my way as well as i could to the other end of the island there might be some deaf old fellows left who had not made up their minds to fly the ground was very muddy and driftwood and underbrush obstructed my way still i pressed on and went nearly half around the island finding however not a single pelican  soon i heard euphemias voice calling loud she seemed to be about the centre of the island and i ran toward her  ive got one i heard her cry before i came in sight of her she was sitting at the root of a crooked dead tree in front of her she held one hand grasping  each leg what seemed to me to be an ungainly and wingless goose all about her the ground was soft and boggy her clothes were muddy her face was red and the creature she held was struggling violently  what on earth have you got i exclaimed approaching  as near as i could and how did you get out there  dont you come any closer she cried youll sink up to your waist i got here by treading on the little hummocks and holding on to that dead branch but dont you take hold of it for youll break it off and then i cant get back  but what is that thing i repeated  its a young pelican she replied i found a lot of nests on the ground over there and this was in one of them i chased it all about until it flopped out here and hid itself on the other side of this tree then i came out quietly and caught it but how am i going to get it to you  this seemed indeed a problem euphemia declared  that she needed both hands to work her way back by the means of the long horizontal limb which had assisted her passage to the place where she sat and she also needed both hands to hold her prize it was likewise plain that i could not get to her indeed  i could not see how her light steps had taken her over the soft and marshy ground that lay between us i suggested that she should throw the pelican to me this she declined to do  i could never throw it so far she said and it would surely get away i dont want to lose this pelican for i believe it is the last one on the island if there are other young ones they have scuttled off by this time and i should dreadfully hate to go back to the yacht without any pelican at all  i dont call that much of one i said  its a real pelican for all that she replied and about as curious a bird as i ever saw its wings wont stretch out seven feet to be sure  about seven inches i suggested  but it is a great deal easier to carry a young one like this she persisted and i expect a baby pelican is a much more uncommon sight in the north than a grown one  no doubt of it i said we must keep him now youve got him cant you kill him  ive no way of killing him returned euphemia i wonder if you could shoot him if i were to hold him out  this with a shotgun i positively declined to do even if i had had a rifle i suggested that she might swerve for a few moments we remained nonplussed i could not get to euphemia at all and she could not get to me unless she released her bird and this she was determined not to do  euphemia i said presently the ground seems hard a little way in front of you if you step over there i will go out on this strip which seems pretty solid then ill be near enough to you for you to swing the bird to me and ill catch hold of him  euphemia arose and did as i told her and we soon found ourselves about six feet apart she took the bird by one leg and swung it toward me with outstretched  arm i caught it by the other foot but as i did so i noticed that euphemia was growing shorter and also felt myself sinking in the bog instantly i entreated euphemia to stand perfectly still for if we struggled or moved there was no knowing into what more dreadful depths we might get euphemia obeyed me and stood quite still but i could feel that she clutched the pelican with desperate vigor  how much farther down do you think we shall sink she asked her voice trembling a little  not much farther i said i am sure there is firm ground beneath us but it will not do to move if we should fall down we might not be able to get up again  how glad i am she said that we are not entirely separated even if it is only a baby pelican that joins us  indeed i am glad i said giving the warm pressure  to the pelicans leg that i would have given to euphemias hand if i could have reached her euphemia  looked up at me so confidently that i could but believe that in some magnetic way that pressure had been transmitted through the bird  do you think they will come back she said directly  oh yes i replied theres no manner of doubt of that  theyll be dreadfully cross she said  i shouldnt wonder i replied but it makes very little difference to me whether they are or not  it ought to make a difference to you said euphemia they might injure us very much  if they tried anything of the kind i replied theyd find it worse for them than for us  that is boasting said euphemia a little reproachfully  and it does not sound like you  i made no answer to this and then she asked  what do you think they will do when they come  i think they will put a plank out here and pull us out  euphemia looked at me an instant and then her eyes filled with tears  oh dear she exclaimed its dreadful you know they couldnt do it your mind is giving way  she sobbed and i could feel the tremor run through the pelican  what do you mean i cried anxiously my mind giving way  yesyes she sobbed if you were in your right sensesyoud never thinkthat pelicans could bring a plank  i looked at her in astonishment  pelicans i exclaimed did you think i meant the pelicans were coming back  of course she said thats what i was asking you about  i wasnt thinking of pelicans at all i answered i was talking of the people in the yacht  euphemia looked at me and then the little pelican between us began to shake violently as we laughed  i know people sometimes do lose their minds when they get into great danger she said apologetically  hello came a voice from the water what are you laughing about  come and see i shouted back and perhaps you will laugh too  the three men came they had to wade ashore and when they came they laughed they brought a plank and with a good deal of trouble they drew us out but euphemia would not let go of her leg of the little pelican until she was sure i had a tight hold of mine  day after day we now sailed northward until we reached the little town at which we had embarked here we discarded our blue flannels and three halfgrown  beards and slowly made our way through woods and lakes and tortuous streams to the upper waters of the st johns in this region the population  of the river shores seemed to consist entirely of alligators in which monsters euphemia was greatly interested but she seldom got a near view of one for the sportsmen on our little steamer blazed away at every alligator as soon as it came into distant sight and although the ugly creatures were seldom hit they made haste to tumble into the water or disappear among the tall reeds euphemia was very much annoyed at this  i shall never get a good close look at an alligator at all she said i am going to speak to the captain  the captain a big goodnatured man listened to her and entirely sympathized with her  tom said he to the pilot when you see another big gator on shore dont sing out to nobody but call me and slow up  it was not long before chocolatecolored tom called to the captain and rang the bell to lessen speed  gentlemen said the captain walking forward to the group of sportsmen theres a big gator ahead there but dont none of you fire at him hes copyrighted  the men with the guns did not understand him but none of them fired and euphemia and the other ladies soon had the satisfaction of seeing an enormous alligator lying on the bank within a dozen yards of the boat the great creature raised its head and looked at us in apparent amazement at not being shot at then probably considering that we did not know the customs of the river or were out of ammunition he slowly slipped away among the reeds with an air as if like mr turveydrop he had done his duty in showing himself and if we did not take advantage of it it was no affair of his  if we only had a fellow like that for a trophy ejaculated euphemia  hed do very well for a trophy i answered but if in order to get him i had to hold him by one leg while you held him by another i should prefer a baby pelican  our trip down the st johns met with no obstacles except those occasioned by the paying tellers return tickets he had provided himself and his group with all sorts of return tickets from the various points he had expected to visit in florida these were good only on particular steamboats and could be used only to go from one particular point to another fortunately he had lost several of them but there were enough left to give us a good deal of trouble we did not wish to break up the party and consequently we embarked and disembarked whenever the paying tellers group did so and thus in time we all reached that widespread and sandy city which serves for the gate of florida  from here the paying teller and his group with complicated tickets the determinate scope and purpose  of which no one man living could be expected to understand hurried wildly toward the far northwest while we in slower fashion returned to rudder grange  there in a place of honor over the diningroom door stands the baby pelican its little flippers wide outstretched  how often i think euphemia sometimes says of that moment of peril when the only actual bond of union between us was that little pelican     the rudder grangers in england   it was mainly due to pomona that we went to europe at all for years euphemia and i had been anxious to visit the enchanted lands on the other side of the atlantic but the obstacles had always been very great and the matter had been indefinitely postponed pomona and jonas were still living with us and their little girl was about two years old pomona continued to read a great deal but her husbands influence had diverted her mind toward works of history and travel and these she devoured with eager interest but she had not given up her old fancy for romance nearly everything she read was mingled in her mind with middle age legends and tales of strange adventure euphemias frequent reference to a trip to europe had fired pomonas mind and she was now more wildly anxious for the journey than any of us she believed that it would entirely free jonas from the chills and fever that still seemed to permeate his being and besides this what unutterable joy to tread the sounding pavements of those old castles of which she had so often read pomona further perceived that my mental and physical systems required the rest and change of scene which could be given only by a trip to europe when this impression had been produced upon euphemias mind the matter to all intents and purposes was settled a tenant who i suspect was discovered and urged forward by the indefatigable pomona made an application for a years lease of our house and farm in a business view i found i could make the journey profitable and there seemed to be no reason why we should not go and go now  it appeared to be accepted as a foregone conclusion by euphemia and pomona that the latter with her husband and child should accompany us but of this i could not at first see the propriety  we shall not want servants on a trip like that i said and although i like jonas and pomona very much they are not exactly the people i should prefer as travelling companions  if you think you are going to leave pomona behind said euphemia you are vastly mistaken oceans and continents are free to her and she will follow us at a distance if we dont let her go with us she was quite content not to go with us to florida but she is just one tingle from head to foot to go to europe we have talked the whole thing over and i know that she will be of the greatest possible use and comfort to me in ever so many ways and jonas will be needed to take care of the baby jonas has money and they will pay a great part of their own expenses and will not cost us much and you neednt be afraid that pomona will make us ashamed of ourselves if we happen to be talking to the dean of westminster or the archbishop of canterbury by pushing herself into the conversation  indeed said i if we ever happen to be inveigled into a confab with those dignitaries i hope pomona will come to the front and take my place  the only person not entirely satisfied with the proposed journey was jonas  i dont like trapsin round said he from place to place and never did if i could go to some one spot and stay there with the child while the rest of you made trips id be satisfied but i dont like keepin on the steady go  this plan was duly considered and the suitability of certain points was discussed london was not believed sufficiently accessible for frequent return trips paris could scarcely be called very central naples would not be suitable at all times of the year and cairo was a little too far eastward a number of minor places were suggested but jonas announced that he had thought of a capital location and being eagerly asked to name it he mentioned newark new jersey  id feel at home there he said and its about as central as any place when you come to look on the map of the world  but he was not allowed to remain in his beloved new jersey and we took him with us to europe  we did not like the rest of the passengers on the steamer go directly from liverpool to london but stopped for a couple of days in the quaint old town of chester if we dont see it now said euphemia we never shall see it when we once start back we shall be raving distracted to get home and i wouldnt miss chester for anything  there is an old wall there said the enthusiastic pomona to her husband built by julius caesar before the romans became catholics that you kin walk on all round the town an a tower on it which the king of england stood on to see his army defeated though of course it wasnt put up for that purpose besides more oldtimenesses which the book tells of than we can see in a week  i hope said jonas wearily shifting the child from one arm to the other that therell be some good place there to sit down  when we reached chester we went directly to the inn called the gentle boar which was selected by euphemia entirely on account of its name and we found it truly a quaint and cosey little house everything was early english and delightful the coffeerooms the barmaids the funny little apartments the old furniture and a general air of the elizabethan era as euphemia remarked  i should almost call it henryan said pomona gazing about her in rapt wonderment  we soon set out on our expeditions of sightseeing but we did not keep together euphemia and i made our way to the old cathedral the ancient verger who took us about the edifice was obliged to show us everything euphemia being especially anxious to see the stall in the choir which had belonged to charles kingsley and was much disturbed to find that under the seat the monks of the fifteenth century had carved the subject of one of baron munchausens most improbable tales  of course said she they did not know that charles kingsley was to have this stall or they would have cut something more appropriate  those old monks ad a good deal of fun in them said the verger hand they were particular fond of showing up quarrels between men and their wives which they could do you see without urting each others feelings these queer carvings are hunder the seats which turn hup in this way and ive no doubt they looked at them most of the time they were kneeling on the cold floor saying their long latin prayers  yes indeed said euphemia it must have been a great comfort to the poor fellows  we went all through that cathedral exclaimed pomona when she came in the next day the old virgin took us everywhere  verger exclaimed euphemia  well he looked so like a woman in his long gown said pomona i dont wonder i mixed him we put two shillins in his little box though one was enough as i told jonas and then he took us round and pointed out all the beautiful carvins and things on the choir the transits and the nave but when jonas stopped before the carved figger of the devil chawin up a sinner and asked if that was the transit of a knave the old feller didnt know what he meant an then we wandered alone through them ruined cloisters and subterraneal halls an old tombstones of the past till i felt i dont know how there was a girl in new jersey who used to put on airs because her family had lived in one place for a hundred years when i git back ill laugh that girl to scorn  after two days of delight in this quaint old town we took the train londonward without consultation jonas bought tickets for himself and wife while i bought euphemias and mine consequently our servants travelled firstclass while we went in a secondclass  carriage we were all greatly charmed with the beautiful garden country through which we passed it was harvest time and jonas was much impressed by the large crops gathered from the little fields  i might try to do something of that kind when i go back he afterward said but i expect id have to dig a little hole for each grain of wheat and hoe it and water it and tie the blade to a stick if it was weakly  an a nice easy time youd have of it said pomona for you might plant your wheat field round a stump and set there and farm all summer without once gettin up  and that is windsor exclaimed euphemia as we passed within view of that royal castle and there lives the sovereign of our mother country  i was trying to puzzle out in what relationship to the sovereign this placed us when euphemia continued  i am bound to go to windsor castle i have examined into every style of housekeeping french flats and everything and i must see how the queen lives i expect to get ever so many ideas  all right said i and we will visit the royal stables too for i intend to get a new buggy when we get back  we determined that on reaching london we would go directly to lodgings not only because this was a more economical way of living but because it was the way in which many of euphemias favorite heroes and heroines had lived in london  i want to keep house she said in the same way that charles and mary lamb did we will toast a bit of muffin or a potted sprat and well have a hamper of cheese and a tankard of ale just like those old english poets and writers  i think you are wrong about the hamper of cheese i said it couldnt have been as much as that but i have no doubt well have a jolly time  we got into a fourwheeled cab jonas on the seat with the driver and the luggage on top i gave the man a card with the address of the house to which we had been recommended there was a number the name of a street the name of a place the name of a square and initials denoting the quarter of the town  it will confuse the poor man dreadfully said euphemia it would have been a great deal better just to have said where the house was  the man however drove to the given address without mistake the house was small but as there were no other lodgers there was room enough for us euphemia was much pleased with the establishment the house was very well furnished and she had expected  to find things old and stuffy as london lodgings  always were in the books she had read  but if the landlady will only steal our tea she said it will make it seem more like the real thing  as we intended to stay some time in london where i had business to transact for the firm with which i was engaged we immediately began to make ourselves as much at home as possible pomona assisted by jonas undertook at once the work of the house to this the landlady who kept a small servant somewhat objected as it had been her custom to attend to the wants of her lodgers  but whats the good of jonas an me bein here said pomona to us if we dont do the work of course if there was other lodgers that would be  different but as theres only our own family wheres  the good of that woman and her girl doin anything  and so as a sort of excuse for her being in europe she began to get the table ready for supper and sent jonas out to see if there was any place where he could buy provisions euphemia and i were not at all certain  that the good woman of the house would be satisfied  with this state of things but still as jonas and pomona were really our servants it seemed quite proper that they should do our work and so we did not interfere although euphemia found it quite sad she said to see the landlady standing idly about  gazing solemnly upon pomona as she dashed from place to place engaged with her household duties  after we had been in the house for two or three days pomona came into our sittingroom one evening and made a short speech  ive settled matters with the woman here she said an i think youll like the way ive done it i couldnt stand her follerin me about an sayin ow they did things in hingland while her redfaced girl was aspendin the days on the airy steps alookin through the railins now mrs bowlin says i itll just be the ruin of you an the death of me if you keep on makin a picter of yourself like that lonely indian asittin on a pinnacle in the jographys watchin the inroads of civilization with a locomotive an a cogwheel in front an the buffalo an the grisly adisappearin in the distance now itll be much better  for all of us says i if youll git down from your peak and try to make up your mind that the world has got to move aint there some place where you kin go an be quiet an comfortable an not awoundin your proud spirit awatchin me bake hot rolls for breakfast an sich an then she says shed begun to think pretty much that way herself an that she had a sister alivin down in the sussex mews back of gresham terrace camberwell square hankberry place nw by n an she thought she might as well go there an stay while we was here an so i says that was just the thing and the sooner done the happier shed be an i went up stairs and helped her pack her trunk which is a tin one which she calls her box an i got her a cab an shes gone  what i cried gone has she given up her house entirely to us  for the time bein she has answered pomona for she saw very well it was better thus an shes comin every week to git her money an to see when were goin to give notice an the small girl has been sent back to the country  it was impossible for euphemia and myself to countenance this outrageous piece of eviction but in answer to our exclamations of surprise and reproach pomona merely remarked that she had done it for the womans own good and as she was perfectly satisfied she didnt suppose there was any harm done and at any rate it would be lots nicer for us and then she asked euphemia what she was going to have for breakfast the next morning so that jonas could go out to the different mongers and get the things  now said euphemia when pomona had gone down stairs i really feel as if i had a foothold on british soil it doesnt seem as if it was quite right but it is perfectly splendid  and so it was from that moment we set up an english rudder grange in the establishment which pomona had thus rudely wrenched as it were from the claws of the british lion we endeavored to live as far as possible in the english style because we wanted to try the manners and customs of every country we had tea for breakfast and ale for luncheon and we ate shrimps prawns sprats saveloys and yarmouth bloaters we took in the times and to a certain extent we endeavored to cultivate the broad vowels some of these things we did not like but we felt bound to allow them a fair trial  we did not give ourselves up to sightseeing as we had done at chester because now there was plenty of time to see london at our leisure in the mornings i attended to my business and in the afternoons euphemia and i generally went out to visit some of the lions of the grand old city  pomona and jonas also went out whenever a time could be conveniently arranged which was done nearly every day for euphemia was anxious they should see everything they almost always took their child and to this euphemia frequently objected  whats the good she said of carrying a baby not two years old to the tower of london the british museum and the chapel of henry vii she cant take any interest in the smothered princes or the assyrian remnants if i am at home i can look after her as well as not  but you see maam said pomona we dont expect the babyll ever come over here agin an when she gits older ill tell her all about these things an itll expan her intelleck a lot more when she feels shes seed em all without knowin it to be sure the monnyments of bygone days dont always agree with her for jone set her down on the tomb of chaucer the other day an her little legs got as cold as the tomb itself an i told him that there was too big a difference between a tomb nigh four hundred years old an a small baby which dont date back two years for them to be sot together that way an he promised to be more careful after that he gouged a little piece out of chaucers tomb an as we went home we bought a copy of the old gentlemans poems so as we could see what reason there was for keepin him so long an at night i read jone two of the canterbury tales you wouldnt a thought says jone jus by lookin at that little piece of plaster that the old fellow could a got up such stories as them  what i want to see moren anything else said pomona to us one day is a real lord or some kind of nobleman of high degree ive allers loved to read about em in books and id rather see one close to than all the tombs and crypts and lofty domes you could rake together an i dont want to see em neither in the streets nor yet in a house of parliament which aint in session for there i dont believe dressin in common clothes as they do that i could tell em from other people what i want is to penetrate into the home of one of em and see him as he really is its only there that his noble bloodll come out  pomona cried euphemia in accents of alarm dont you try penetrating into any noblemans home you will get yourself into trouble and the rest of us too  oh im not agoin to git you into any trouble maam said pomona you neednt be afeard of that and she went about her household duties  a few days after this as euphemia and i were going to the tower of london in a hansom caband it was one of euphemias greatest delights to be bowled over the smooth london pavements in one of these vehicles with the driver out of sight and the horse in front of us just as if we were driving ourselves only without any of the trouble and on every corner one of the names of the streets we had read about in dickens and thackeray and with the sampson brasses and the pecksniffs and the mrs gamps and the guppys and the sir leicester dedlocks and the becky sharps and the pendennises all walking about just as natural as in the novelswe were surprised to see pomona hurrying along the sidewalk alone the moment our eyes fell upon her a feeling of alarm arose within us where was she going with such an intent purpose in her face and without jonas she was walking westward and we were going to the east at euphemias request i stopped the cab jumped out and ran after her but she had disappeared in the crowd  she is up to mischief said euphemia  but it was of no use to worry our minds on the subject and we soon forgot in the ancient wonders of the tower the probable eccentricities of our modern handmaid  we returned night came on but pomona was still absent jonas did not know where she was and was very much troubled and the baby which had been so skilfully kept in the background by its mother that so far it had never annoyed us at all now began to cry and would not be comforted euphemia with the assistance of jonas prepared the evening meal and when we had nearly eaten it pomona came home euphemia asked no questions although she was burning with curiosity to know where pomona had been considering that it was that young womans duty to inform her without being asked  when pomona came in to wait on us she acted as if she expected to be questioned and was perfectly willing to answer but euphemia stood upon her dignity and said nothing at last pomona could endure it no longer and standing with a tray in her hand she exclaimed  im sorry i made you help git the dinner maam and i wouldnt a done it for anything but the fact is ive been to see a lord an was kep late  what cried euphemia springing to her feet you dont mean that  and i was so amazed that i sat and looked at pomona without saying a word  yes cried pomona her eyes sparkling with excitement ive seen a lord and trod his floors and ill tell you all about it you know i was boun to do it and i wanted to go alone for if jone was with me hed be sure to put in some of his queer sayins an ten to one hurt the mans feelins and cut off the interview an as jone said this afternoon he felt tired with some small creeps in his back an didnt care to go out i knew my time had come and said id go for a walk day before yesterday i went up to a policeman an i asked him if he could tell me if a lord or a earl or a duke lived anywhere near here first he took me for crazy an then he began to ask questions which he thought was funny but i kep stiff to the mark an i made him tell me where a lord did liveabout five blocks from here so i fixed things all ready an today i went there  you didnt have the assurance to suppose hed see you cried euphemia  no indeed i hadnt said pomona at least under common circumstances you may be sure i racked my brains enough to know what i should do to meet him face to face it wouldnt do to go in the common way such as ringin at the front door and askin for him an then offerin to sell him furniterpolish  for his piannerlegs i knowed well enough that any errand like that would only bring me face to face with his bailiff or his master of hounds or something of that kind so at last i got a plan of my own an i goes up the steps and rings the bell an when the flunkey with more of an air of genral upliftedness about him than any one id seen yet excep nelson on top of his pillar opened the door an looked at me i asked him  is earl cobden in  at this the man opened his eyes an remarked  what uv it if he is  then i answers firmly  if hes in i want yer to take him this letter an ill wait here  you dont mean to say cried euphemia that you wrote the earl a letter  yes i did continued pomona and at first the man didnt seem inclined to take it but i held it out so steady that he took it an put it on a little tray whether nickelplated or silver i couldnt make out and carried it up the widest and splendidest pair o stairs that i ever see in a house jus intended to be lived in when he got to the fust landin he met a gentleman and give him the letter when i saw this i was took aback for i thought it was his lordship acomin down an i didnt want to have no interview with a earl at his front door but the second glance i took at him showed me that it wasnt him he opened it notwithstanding an read it all through from beginnin to end when he had done it he looked down at me and then he went back up stairs afollered by the flunk which last pretty soon came down agin an told me i was to go up i dont think i ever felt so much like a wringedout dishcloth as i did when i went up them palatial stairs but i tried to think of things that would prop me up praps i thought my ancient ancestors came to this land with hisn who knows an i might a been switched off on some female line an so lost the name an estates at any rate be brave with such thoughts as these i tried to stiffen my legs figgeratively speakin we went through two or three rooms i hadnt time to count em an then i was showed into the lofty presence of the earl he was standin by the fireplace an the minnit my eyes lit upon him i knowed it was him  why how was that cried euphemia and myself almost in the same breath  i knowed him by his wax figger continued pomona which jone and i see at madame tussauds waxworks theyve got all the head people of these days there now as well as the old kings and the pizeners the clothes wasnt exactly the same though very good on each an there was more of an air of shortenin of the spine in the wax figger than in the other one but the likeness was awful strikin  well my good woman says he aholdin my open letter in his hand so you want to see a lord do you  what on earth did you write to him exclaimed euphemia you mustnt go on a bit further until you have told what was in your letter  well said pomona as near as i can remember it was like this william lord cobden earl of sorsetshire an derry dear sir bein brought up under republican institutions in the land of the free i left out the home of the brave because there wasnt no use crowin about that jus theni havent had no oppertunity of meetin with a individual of lordly blood ever since i was a small girl takin books from the circulatin libery an obliged to read out loud with divided sillerbles ive drank in every word of the tales of lords and other nobles of high degree that the little shops where i genrally got my books an some with the pages out at the most excitin parts contained an so i asks you now sir lord i did put humbly but i scratched that out bein an american womanto do me the favor of a short audience then when i reads about noble earls an dukes in their brilliant lit halls an castles or mounted on their champin chargers aleadin their trusty hordes to victory amid the glittering minarets of fame ill know what they looks like an then i signed my name  yes sir says i in answer to his earlships question said pomona taking up her story i did want to see one upon my word  an now that you have seen him says he what do you think of him  now i had made up my mind before i entered this ducal pile or put my foot on one ancestral stone that id be square and honest through the whole business and not try no counterfeit presentiments with the earl so i says to him  the fust thing i thinks is that youve got on the nicest suit of clothes that ive ever seed yit not bein exactly sunday clothes and yit fit for company an if money can buy eman mens clothes is cheap enough here dear only knowsim goin to have a suit jus like it for jone my husband it was a kind o brown mixed stuff with a little spot of red in it here an there an was about as gay for plain goods an as plain for gay goods as anythin could be an twas easy enough to see that it was all wool of course says i jonell have his coat made different in front for singlebreasted an a buttonin so high up is amost too stylish for him specially as fashions ud change afore the coat was wore out but i neednt bother your earlship about that  an so says he an i imagine i see an air of sadness steal over his features its my clothes after all that interest you  oh no says i i mention them because they come up fust there is no doubt qualities of mind and body  well we wont go into that said his earlship an i want to ask you a question i suppose you represent the middle class in your country  i dont know zactly where society splits with us says i but i guess im somewhere nigh the crack  now dont you really believe says he that you and the people of your class would be happier an feel safer politically speakin if they had among em a aristocracy to which they could look up to in times of trouble as their natral born gardeens i ask yer this because i want to know for myself what are the reel sentiments of yer people  well sir says i when your work is done an your kitchen cleaned up an your lamp lit a lord or a duke is jus tiptop to read about if the type aint too fine an the paper mean beside which it often is in the tencent books but further than this i must say we aint got no use for em at that he kind o steps back and looks as if he was goin to say somethin but i puts in quick but you mustnt think my earl says i that we undervallers you when we remembers the field of agincourt and chevy chase an the tower of london with the block on which three lords was beheaded with the very cuts in it which the headsman made when he chopped em off as well as two crooked ones ashowin his bad licks which little did he think history would preserve forever an the old guildhall where down in the ancient crypt is ahangin our declaration of independence along with the roman pots and kittles dug up in london streets we cant forgit that if it hadnt a been for your old ancestral lines as roots wed never been the flourishin tree we is  well said his earlship when id got through an he kind o looked as if he didnt know whether to laugh or not if you represent the feelins of your class in your country i reckon theyre not just ready for a aristocracy yit  an with that he give me a little nod an walked off into another room it was pretty plain from this that the interview was brought to a close an so i come away the flunk was all ready to show me out an he did it so expeditious though quite polite that i didnt git no chance to take a good look at the furniter and carpets which id a liked to have done an so ive talked to a real earl an if not in his ancestral  pile at any rate in the gorgeousest house i ever see an the brilliantest dream of my youth has come true  when she had finished i rose and looked upon her  pomona said i we may yet visit many foreign countries we may see kings queens dukes counts sheikhs beys sultans khedives pashas rajahs and i dont know what potentates besides and i wish to say just this one thing to you if you dont want to get yourself and us into some dreadful scrape and perhaps bring our journeys to a sudden close you must put a curb on your longing for communing with beings of noble blood  thats true sir said pomona thoughtfully an i made a pretty close shave of it this time for when i was talkin to the earl i was just on the pint of tellin him that i had such a high opinion of his kind o folks that i once named a big black dog after one of em but i jus remembered in time an slipped on to somethin else but i trembled worse than a peanut woman with a hackman goin round the corner to ketch a train an his hubs just grazin the legs of her stand an so i promise you sir that ill put my heel on all hankerin after potentates  and so she made her promise and knowing pomona i felt sure that she would keep itif she could     pomonas daughter   in the pretty walk bordered by bright flowers and low overhanging shrubbery which lies back of the albert memorial in kensington gardens london jonas sat on a green bench with his baby on his knee a few nurses were pushing babycarriages about in different parts of the walk and there were children playing not far away it was drawing toward the close of the afternoon and jonas was thinking it was nearly time to go home when pomona came running to him from the gorgeous monument which she had been carefully inspecting  jone she cried do you know ive been lookin at all them great men thats standin round the bottom of the monnyment an though theres over a hundred of em im sure i cant find a american among em theres poets an artists an leadin men scraped up from all parts an not one of our illustrious dead what dye think of that  i cant believe it said jonas if we go home with a tale like that well hear the recruitingdrum from newark to texas and ten to one ill be drafted  you neednt be makin fun said pomona you come an see for yourself perhaps you kin find jus one american an then ill go home satisfied  all right said jonas  and putting the child on the bench he told her hed be back in a minute and hurried after pomona to give a hasty look for the desired american  corinne the offspring of jonas and pomona had some peculiarities one of these was that she was accustomed to stay where she was put ever since she had been old enough to be carried about she had been carried about by one parent or the other and as it was frequently necessary to set her down she had learned to sit and wait until she was taken up again she was now nearly two years old very strong and active and of an intellect which had already begun to tower she could walk very well but jonas took such delight in carrying her that he seldom appeared to recognize her ability to use her legs she could also talk but how much her parents did not know she was a taciturn child and preferred to keep her thoughts to herself and although she sometimes astonished us all by imitating remarks she had heard she frequently declined to repeat the simplest words that had been taught her  corinne remained on the bench about a minute after her father had left her and then contrary to her usual custom she determined to leave the place where she had been put turning over on her stomach after the manner of babies she lowered her feet to the ground having obtained a foothold she turned herself about and proceeded with sturdy steps to a babycarriage near by which had attracted her attention this carriage which was unattended contained a baby somewhat smaller and younger than corinne who sat up and gazed with youthful interest at the visitor who stood by the side of her vehicle corinne examined with a critical eye the carriage and its occupant she looked at the soft pillow at the babys back and regarded with admiration the afghan crocheted in gay colors which was spread over its lap and the spacious gigtop which shielded it from the sun she stooped down and looked at the wheels and stood up and gazed at the blue eyes and canary hair of the little occupant then in quiet but decided tones corinne said  dit out  the other baby looked at her but made no movement to obey after waiting a few moments an expression of stern severity spreading itself the while over her countenance corinne reached over and put her arms around the fairhaired child then with all her weight and strength she threw herself backward and downward the other baby being light was thus drawn bodily out of its carriage and corinne sat heavily upon the ground her new acquaintance sprawling in her lap notwithstanding that she bore the brunt of the fall upon the gravel corinne uttered no cry but disengaging herself from her encumbrance she rose to her feet the other baby imitated her and corinne taking her by the hand led her to the bench where she herself had been left  dit up said corinne  this however the other baby was unable to do but she stood quite still evidently greatly interested in the proceedings corinne left her and walked to the little carriage into which she proceeded to climb after some extraordinary exertions during which her fat legs were frequently thrust through the spokes of the wheels and ruthlessly drawn out again she tumbled in arranging herself as comfortably as she knew how she drew the gay afghan over her leaned back upon the soft pillow gazed up at the sheltering gigtop and resigned herself to luxurious bliss at this supreme moment the nurse who had had charge of the carriage and its occupant came hurrying around a corner of the path she had been taking leave of some of her nursemaid friends and had stayed longer than she had intended it was necessary for her to take a suitable leave of these ladies for that night she was going on a journey she had been told to take the baby out for an airing and to bring it back early now to her surprise the afternoon had nearly gone and hurrying to the little carriage she seized the handle at the back and rapidly pushed it home without stopping to look beneath the overhanging gigtop or at the green bench with which her somewhat worried soul had no concern if anything could add to corinnes ecstatic delight it was this charming motion closing her eyes contentedly she dropped asleep  the baby with canary hair looked at the receding nurse and carriage with widening eyes and reddening cheeks then opening her mouth she uttered the cry of the deserted but the panicstricken nurse did not hear her and if she had what were the cries of other children to her her only business was to get home quickly with her young charge  about five minutes after these events jonas and pomona came hurrying along the path they too had stayed away much longer than they had intended and had suddenly given up their search for the american whom they had hoped to find in high relief upon the base of the albert memorial stepping quickly to the child who still stood sobbing by the bench jonas exclaimed you poor itty  and then he stopped suddenly pomona also stood for a second and then she made a dash at the child and snatched it up gazing sharply at its tearsmeared countenance she exclaimed whats this  the baby did not seem able to explain what it was and only answered by a tearful sob jonas did not say a word but with the lithe quickness of a dog after a rat he began to search behind and under benches in the bushes on the grass here there and everywhere  about nine oclock that evening pomona came to us with tears in her eyes and the canaryhaired baby in her arms and told us that corinne was lost they had searched everywhere they had gone to the police telegrams had been sent to every station they had done everything that could be done but had found no trace of the child  if i hadnt this sobbed pomona holding out the child i believe id go wild it isnt that she can take the place of my dear baby but by akeepin hold of her i believe well git on the track of corinne  we were both much affected by this news and euphemia joined pomona in her tears  jonas is scourin the town yet said pomona hell never give up till he drops but i felt you ought to know and i couldnt keep this little thing in the nightair no longer its a sweet child and its clothes are lovely if its got a mother shes bound to want to see it before long an if ever i ketch sight of her she dont git away from me till i have my child  it is a very extraordinary case i said children are often stolen but it is seldom we hear of one being taken and another left in its place especially when the children are of different ages and totally unlike  thats so said pomona at first i thought that corinne had been changed off for a princess or something like that but nobody couldnt make anybody believe that my big blackhaired baby was this whiteanyaller thing  cant you find any mark on her clothes asked euphemia by which you could discover her parentage if there are no initials perhaps you can find a coronet or a coat of arms  no said pomona there aint nothin ive looked careful but theres great comfort to think that corinnes well stamped  stamped we exclaimed what do you mean by that  why you see answered pomona when jone an i was goin to bring our baby over here among so many million people we thought there might be danger of its gittin lost or mislaid though we never really believed any such thing would happen or we wouldnt have come an so we agreed to mark her for ive often read about babies bein stole an kept two or three years and when found bein so changed their own mothers didnt know em jone said wed better tattoo corinne for them marks would always be there but i wouldnt agree to have the little creatures skin stuck with needles not even after jone said we might give her chloryform so we agreed to stamp initials on her with perkinss indelible dab it is intended to mark sheep but it dont hurt and it dont never come off we put the letters on the back of her heels where they wouldnt show for shes never to go barefoot an where theyd be easy got at if we wanted to find em we put rg on one heel for the name of the place and jp on the other heel for jonas an me if twenty years from now said pomona her tears welling out afresh i should see a young woman with eyes like corinnes an that i felt was her awalking up to the bridal altar with all the white flowers an the floatin veils an the crowds in the church an the music playin an the minister all ready id jist jerk that young woman into the vestryroom an have off her shoes an stockins in no time an if she had rg on one heel an jp on the other that bridegroom could go home alone  we confidently assured pomona that with such means of identification and the united action of ourselves and the police the child would surely be found and we accompanied her to her lodgings which were now in a house not far from our own  when the nurse reached home with the little carriage it was almost dark and snatching up the child she ran to the nursery without meeting any one the child felt heavy but she was in such a hurry she scarcely noticed that she put it upon the bed and then lighting the gas she unwrapped the afghan in which the little creature was now almost entirely enveloped when she saw the face and the black hair from which the cap had fallen off she was nearly frightened to death but fortunately for herself she did not scream she was rather a stupid woman with but few ideas but she could not fail to see that some one had taken her charge and put this child in its place her first impulse was to run back to the gardens but she felt certain that her baby had been carried off and besides she could not without discovery leave the child here or take it with her and while she stood in dumb horror her mistress sent for her the lady was just going out to dinner and told the nurse that as they were all to start for the continent by the tidal train which left at ten oclock that night she must be ready with the baby well wrapped up for the journey the halfstupefied woman had no words nor courage with which to declare at this moment the true state of the case she said nothing and went back to the nursery and sat there in dumb consternation and without sense enough to make a plan of any kind the strange child soon awoke and began to cry and then the nurse mechanically fed it and it went to sleep again when the summons came to her to prepare for the journey in cowardly haste she wrapped the baby so carefully covering its head that she scarcely gave it a chance to breathe and she and the ladys waitingmaid were sent in a cab to the victoria station the lady was travelling with a party of friends and the nurse and the waitingmaid were placed in the adjoining compartment of the railwaycarriage on the six hours channel passage from newhaven to dieppe the lady was extremely sick and reached france in such a condition that she had to be almost carried on shore it had been her intention to stop a few days at this fashionable wateringplace but she declared that she must go straight on to paris where she could be properly attended to and moreover that she never wanted to see the sea again when she had been placed in the train for paris she sent for the nurse and feebly asked how the baby was and if it had been seasick on being told that it was all right and had not shown a sign of illness she expressed her gratification and lay back among her rugs  the nurse and the waitingmaid travelled together as before but the latter wearied by her nights attendance upon her mistress slept all the way from dieppe to paris when they reached that city they went into the waitingroom until a carriage could be procured for them and there the nurse placing the baby on a seat asked her companion to take care of it for a few minutes she then went out of the station door and disappeared into paris  in this way the brunt of the terrible disclosure which came very soon was thrown upon the waitingmaid no one however attached any blame to her of course the absconding nurse had carried away the fairhaired child the waitingmaid had been separated from her during the passage from the train to the station and it was supposed that in this way an exchange of babies had been easily made by her and her confederates when the mother knew of her loss her grief was so violent that for a time her life was in danger all paris was searched by the police and her friends but no traces could be found of the wicked nurse and the fairhaired child money which of course was considered the object of the inhuman crime was freely offered but to no avail no one imagined for an instant that the exchange was made before the party reached paris it seemed plain enough that the crime was committed when the woman fled  corinne who had been placed in the charge of a servant until it was determined what to do with her was not at all satisfied with the new state of affairs and loudly demanded her papa and mamma behaving for a time in a very turbulent way in a few days the lady recovered her strength and asked to see this child the initials upon corinnes heels had been discovered and when she was told of these the lady examined them closely  the people who left this child she exclaimed do not intend to lose her they know where she is and they will keep a watch upon her and when they get a chance they will take her i too will keep a watch upon her and when they come for her i shall see them  her use of words soon showed corinne to be of english parentage and it was generally supposed that she had been stolen from some travellers and had been used at the station as a means of giving time to the nurse to get away with the other child  in accord with her resolution the griefstricken lady put corinne in the charge of a trusty woman and moreover scarcely ever allowed her to be out of her sight  it was suggested that advertisement be made for the parents of a child marked with eg and jp but to this the lady decidedly objected  if her parents find her she said they will take her away and i want to keep her till the thieves come for her i have lost my child and as this one is the only clue i shall ever have to her i intend to keep it when i have found my child it will be time enough to restore this one  thus selfish is maternal love  pomona bore up better under the loss than did jonas neither of them gave up the search for a day but jonas haggard and worn wandered aimlessly about the city visiting every place into which he imagined a child might have wandered or might have been taken searching even to the crypt in the guildhall and the tower of london pomonas mind worked quite as actively as her husbands body she took great care of little kensington as she called the strange child from the place where she had been found and therefore could not go about as jonas did after days and nights of ceaseless supposition she had come to the conclusion that corinne had been stolen by opera singers  i suppose you never knew it she said to us for i took pains not to let it disturb you but that child has notes in her voice about two stories higher than any operer prymer donner that i ever heard an ive heard lots of em for i used to go into the top gallery of the operer as often as into the theayter an if any operer singer ever heard them high notes of corinnesan there was times when shed let em out without the least bit of a noticeits them thats took her  but my poor pomona said euphemia you dont suppose that little child could be of any use to an opera singer at least not for years and years  oh yes maam replied pomona she was none too little sopranners is like mockingbirds theyve got to be took young  no arguments could shake pomonas belief in this theory and she daily lamented the fact that there was no opera in london at that time that she might go to the performances and see if there was any one on the stage who looked mean enough to steal a child  if she was there said pomona id know it shed feel the scorn of a mothers eye on her an her guilty heart would make her forget her part  pomona frequently went into kensington gardens and laid traps for opera singers who might be sojourning in london she would take little kensington into the gardens and placing her carefully in the corner of a bench would retire to a short distance and pretend to be absorbed in a book while her sharp eyes kept up the watch for a longhaired tenor or a beautifully dressed soprano who should suddenly rush out from the bushes and seize the child  i wouldnt make no fuss if they was to come out she said little kensington would go under my arm not theirn an id walk calmly with em to their home then id say give me my child an take yourn which though she probably hasnt got no voice is a lot too good for you and may the house hurl stools at you the next time you appear is the limit of a mothers curse  but alas for pomona no opera singers ever showed themselves  these days of our stay in london were not pleasant we went about little and enjoyed nothing at last pomona came to us her face pale but determined  its no use she said for us to keep you here no longer when i know youve got through with the place and want to go on an well go too for i dont believe my childs in london shes been took away an we might as well look for her in one place as another the perlice tells us that if shes found here theyll know it fust an theyll telegraph to us wherever we is an if it wasnt fur nuthin else it would be a mercy to git jone out of this place he goes about like a cat after her drowned kittens its abringin out them chills of hisn an the next thing itll kill him i cant make him believe in the findin of corinne as firm as i do but i know as long as perkinss indelible dab holds out an theres no rubbin nor washin it off ill git my child  i admitted but not with pomonas hopefulness that the child might be found as easily in paris as here  and weve seen everything about london said euphemia except windsor castle i did want and still want to see just how the queen keeps house and perhaps get some ideas which might be useful but her majesty is away now and although they say thats the time to go there it is not the time for me youll not find me going about inspecting domestic arrangements when the lady of the house is away  so we packed up and went to paris taking little kensington along notwithstanding our great sympathy with corinnes parents euphemia and myself could not help becoming somewhat resigned to the affliction which had befallen them and we found ourselves obliged to enjoy the trip very much euphemia became greatly excited and exhilarated as we entered paris for weeks i knew she had been pining for this city as she stepped from the train she seemed to breathe a new air and her eyes sparkled as she knew by the prattle and cries about her that she was really in france  we were obliged to wait some time in the station before we could claim our baggage and while we were standing there euphemia drew my attention to a placard on the wall look at that she exclaimed even here on our very entrance to the city we see signs of that politeness which is the very heart of the nation i cant read the whole of that notice from here but those words in large letters show that it refers to the observance of the ancient etiquettes think of it here in a railroad station people are expected to behave to each other with the oldtime dignity and gallantry of our forefathers i tell you it thrills my very soul to think i am among such a people and i am glad they cant understand what i say so that i may speak right out  i never had the heart to throw cold water on euphemias noble emotions and so i did not tell her that the notice merely requested travellers to remove from their trunks the anciennes etiquettes or old railway labels  we were not rich tourists and we all took lodgings in a small hotel to which we had been recommended it was in the latin quarter near the river and opposite  the vast palace of the louvre into whose labyrinth  of picturegalleries euphemia and i were eager to plunge  but first we all went to the office of the american consul and consulted him in regard to the proper measures to be taken for searching for the little corinne in paris after that for some days jonas and pomona spent all their time and euphemia and i part of ours in looking for the child euphemias parisian exhilaration continued to increase but there were some things that disappointed her  i thought said she that people in france took their morning coffee in bed but they do not bring it up to us  but my dear said i i am sure you said before we came here that you considered taking coffee in bed as an abominable habit and that nothing could ever make you like it  i know said she that i have always thought it a lazy custom and not a bit nice and i think so yet but still when we are in a strange country i expect to live as other people do  it was quite evident that euphemia had been looking forward for some time to the novel experience of taking her coffee in bed but the grayhaired old gentleman who acted as our chambermaid never hinted that he supposed we wanted anything of the kind  nothing however excited euphemias indignation so much as the practice of giving a pourboire to cabmen and others it is simply feeding the flames of intemperance she said when she had occasion to take a cab by herself she never conformed to this reprehensible custom when she paid the driver she would add something to the regular fare but as she gave it to him she would say in her most distinct french pour manger comprenezvous the cocher would generally nod his head and thank her very kindly which he had good reason to do for she never forgot that it took more money to buy food than drink  in spite of the attractions of the city our sojourn in paris was not satisfactory apart from the family trouble which oppressed us it rained nearly all the time we were told that in order to see paris at its best we should come in the spring in the month of may it was charming then everybody would be outofdoors  and we would see a whole city enjoying life as we wished to enjoy life without waiting for the spring we determined to move southward and visit during the winter those parts of europe which then lay under blue skies and a warm sun it was impossible at present for pomona and jonas to enjoy life anywhere and they would remain in paris and then if they did not find their child in a reasonable time they would join us neither of them understood french but this did not trouble them in the slightest early in their paris wanderings they had met with a boy who had once lived in new york and they had taken him into pay as an interpreter he charged them a franc and a half a day and i am sure they got their moneys worth  soon after we had made up our minds to move toward the south i came home from a visit to the bankers and joyfully told euphemia that i had met baxter  baxter said she inquiringly who is he  i used to go to school with him i said and to think that i should meet him here  i never heard you mention him before she remarked  no i answered it must be fifteen or sixteen years since i have seen him and really it is a great pleasure to meet him here he is a capital fellow he was very glad to see me  i should think said euphemia if you like each other so much that you would have exchanged visits in america or at least have corresponded  oh it is a very different thing at home i said but here it is delightful to meet an old school friend like baxter he is coming to see us this evening  that evening baxter came he was delighted to meet euphemia and inquired with much solicitude about our plans and movements he had never heard of my marriage and for years had not known whether i was dead or alive now he took the keenest interest in me and mine we were a little sorry to find that this was not baxters first visit to europe he had been here several times and as he expressed it had knocked about a good deal over the continent he was dreadfully familiar with everything and talked about some places we were longing to see in a way that considerably dampened our enthusiasm in fact there was about him an air of superiority which though tempered by much kindliness was not altogether agreeable he highly approved our idea of leaving paris the city is nothing now he said you ought to see it in may we said we had heard that and then spoke of italy you mustnt go there in the winter he said you dont see the country at its best may is the time for italy then it is neither too hot nor too cold and you will find out what an italian sky is we said that we hoped to be in england in the spring and he agreed that we were right there england is never so lovely as in may  well exclaimed euphemia it seems to me from all i hear that we ought to take about twelve years to see europe we should leave the united states every april spend may in some one place and go back in june and this we ought to do each year until we have seen all the places in may this might do very well for any one who had plenty of money and who liked the ocean but i dont think we could stand it as for me she continued i would like to spend these months so cold and disagreeable here in the sunny lands of southern france i want to see the vineyards and the olive groves and the darkeyed  maidens singing in the fields i long for the soft skies of provence and to hear the musical dialect in which frederic mistral wrote his miréio  that sounds very well said baxter but in all those southern countries you must be prepared in winter for the rigors of the climate the sun is pretty warm sometimes at this season but as soon as you get out of it you will freeze to death if you are not careful the only way to keep warm is to be in the sun out of the wind and that wont work on rainy days and winter is the rainy season you know in the houses it is as cold as ice and the fires dont amount to anything you might as well light a bundle of wooden toothpicks and put it in the fireplace if you could sleep all the time you might be comfortable for they give you a featherbed to cover yourself with outside  you may do well enough if you keep up a steady walking but indoors you will have hard work to keep warm you must wear chestprotectors they sell them down theregreat big ones made of rabbitskins  and a nice thing for a man to have to wear in the house is a pair of cloth bags lined with fur they would keep his feet and legs warm when he isnt walking it is well too to have a pair of smaller fur bags for your hands when you are in the house you can have a little hole in the end of one of them through which you can stick a penholder and then you can write letters an indiarubber bag filled with hot water to lower down your back is a great comfort you havent any idea how cold your spine gets in those warm countries and if i were you id avoid a place where you see them carting coal stoves around those are the worst spots and you need not expect to get one of the stoves not while they can sell you wood at two sticks for a franc you had better go to some place where they are not accustomed to having tourists in the regular resorts they are afraid to make any show of keeping warm for fear people will think they are in the habit of having cold weather and in italy youve got to be precious careful or youll be taken sick and another thing i suppose you brought a great deal of baggage with you you for instance said our friend turning to me packed up i suppose a heavy overcoat for cold weather and a lighter one and a good winter suit and a good summer one besides another for spring and fall and an old suit to lie about in in the orange groves and a dress suit besides such convenient articles as old boots for tramping in pocketlanterns and so forth  strange to say i had all these besides many other things of a similar kind and i could not help admitting it  well said baxter youd better get rid of the most of that as soon as you can for if you travel with that sort of heavy weight in the mediterranean countries you might as well write home and get your house mortgaged all along the lines of travel in the south of europe you find the hotels piled up with american baggage left there by travellers wholl never send for it it reminds one of the rows of ox skeletons that used to mark out the roads to california but i guess youll be able to stick it out good bye let me hear from you  when baxter left us we could not but feel a little downhearted and euphemia turned to her guidebook to see if his remarks were corroborated there  well there is one comfort she exclaimed at last this book says that in naples epidemics are not so deadly as they are in some other places and if the traveller observes about a page of directions which are given here and consults a physician the moment he feels himself out of order it is quite possible to ward off attacks of fever that is encouraging and i think we might as well go on  yes said i and here in this newspaper a hotel in venice advertises that its situation enables it to avoid the odors of the grand canal and an undertaker in nice advertises that he will forward the corpses of tourists to all parts of europe and america i think there is a chance of our getting back either dead or alive and so i also say let us go on  but before we left paris we determined to go to the grand opera which we had not yet visited and euphemia proposed that we should take pomona with us the poor girl was looking wretched and woebegone  and needed to have her mind diverted from her trouble jonas at the best of times could not be persuaded to any amusement of this sort but pomona agreed to go we had no idea of dressing for the boxes and we took good front seats in the upper circle where we could see the whole interior of the splendid house as soon as the performance commenced the old dramatic fire began to burn in pomona her eyes sparkled as they had not done for many a day and she really looked like her own bright self the opera was le prophète and as none of us had ever seen anything produced on so magnificent a scale we were greatly interested especially in the act which opens with that wonderful winter scene in the forest with hundreds of people scattered about under the great trees with horses and sleighs and the frozen river in the background where the skaters came gliding on the grouping was picturesque and artistic the scale of the scene was immense there was a vast concourse of people on the stage the dances were beautiful the merry skaters graceful the music was inspiring  suddenly above the voices of the chorus above the drums and bass strings of the orchestra above the highest notes of the sopranos above the great chandelier itself came two notes distinct and plain and the words to which they were set were  mama  like a shot pomona was on her feet with arms outspread and her whole figure dilating until she seemed twice as large as usual i thought she was about to spring over the balcony into the house below i clutched her and euphemia and i both upon our feet followed her gaze and saw upon the stage a little girl in gay array and upturned face it was the lost corinne  without a word pomona made a sudden turn sprang up the steps behind her and out upon the lobby euphemia and i close behind her around and down the steps we swept from lobby to lobby amazing the cloakkeepers and attendants but stopping for nothing down the grand staircase like an avalanche almost into the arms of the astonished military sentinels who startled from their soldierlike propriety sprang muskets in hand toward us it was only then that i was able to speak to pomona and breathlessly ask her where she was going  to the stagedoor she cried making a motion to hurl to the ground the soldier before her but there was no need to go to any stagedoor in a moment there rushed along the corridor a lady dressed apparently in all the colors of the rainbow and bearing in her arms a child there was a quick swoop and in another moment pomona had the child but clinging to its garments the lady cried in excellent english but with some foreign tinge  where is my child you stole  stole your grandmother briefly ejaculated pomona and then in grand forgetfulness of everything but her great joy she folded her arms around her child and standing like a statue of motherly content she seemed in our eyes to rise to the regions of the caryatides and the ceiling frescos not another word she spoke and amid the confusion of questions and exclamations and the wild demands of the lady euphemia and i contrived to make her understand the true state of the case and that her child was probably at our lodgings then there were great exclamations and quick commands and directly four of us were in a carriage whirling to our hotel all the way pomona sat silent with her child clasped tightly while euphemia and i kept up an earnest but unsatisfactory conversation with the lady for as to this strange affair we could tell each other but little we learned from the lady who was an assistant soprano at the grand opera how corinne came to her in paris and how she had always kept her with her even dressing her up and taking her on the stage in that great act where as many men women and children as possible were brought upon the scene when she heard the cry of corinne she knew the child had seen its mother and then whether the opera went on or not it mattered not to her  when the carriage stopped the three women sprang out at once and how they all got through the door i cannot tell there was such a tremendous ring at the gate of the court that the old concierge who opened it by pulling a wire in his little den somewhere  in the rear must have been dreadfully startled in his sleep we rushed through the court and up the stairs past our apartments to pomonas room and there in the open doorway stood jonas his coat off his sandy hair in wild confusion his face radiant and in his hands little kensington in her nightgown  i knew by the row on the stairs youd brought her home he exclaimed as little kensington was snatched from him and corinne was put into his arms  we left jonas and pomona to their wild delight and i accompanied the equally happy lady to the opera house where i took occasion to reclaim the wraps which we had left behind in our sudden flight  when the police of paris were told to give up their search for an absconding nurse accompanied by a child and to look for one without such encumbrance they found her from this woman was obtained much of the story i have told and a good deal more was drawn out little by little from corinne who took especial pleasure in telling in brief sentences how she had ousted the lazy baby from the carriage and how she had scratched her own legs in getting in  what im proud of said pomona is that she did it all herself it wasnt none of your common stealins an findins an it aint everywhere youll see a child that kin git itself lost back of prince alberts monnyment an git itself found at the operer in paris an attend to both ends of the case itself an after all them two high notes of hern was more good than perkinss indelible dab     derelict   a tale of the wayward sea   i  on the 25th of may 1887 i sat alone upon the deck of the sparhawk a threemasted schooner built according to a description in the cabin at sackport me i was not only alone on the deck but i was alone on the ship the sparhawk was a derelict that is if a vessel with a man on board of her can be said to be totally abandoned  i had now been on board the schooner for eight days how long before that she had been drifting about at the mercy of the winds and currents i did not then know but i discovered afterward that during a cyclone early in april she had been abandoned by her entire crew and had since been reported five times to the hydrographic office of the navy department in washington and her positions and probable courses duly marked on the pilot chart  she had now become one of that little fleet abandoned at sea for one cause or another and floating about this way and that as the wild winds blew or the ocean currents ran voyaging without purpose as if manned by the spirits of ignorant landsmen sometimes backward and forward over comparatively small ocean spaces and sometimes drifting for many months and over thousands of miles these derelicts form at night and in fog one of the dangers most to be feared by those who sail upon the sea  as i said before i came on board the abandoned sparhawk on the 17th of may and very glad indeed was i to get my feet again on solid planking three days previously the small steamer thespia from havana  to new york on which i had been a passenger had been burned at sea and all on board had left her in the boats  what became of the other boats i do not know but the one in which i found myself in company with five other men all cuban cigarmakers was nearly upset by a heavy wave during the second night we were out and we were all thrown into the sea as none of the cubans could swim they were all lost but i succeeded in reaching the boat which had righted itself though half full of water  there was nothing in the boat but two oars which had not slipped out of their rowlocks a leather scoop which had been tied to a thwart and the aforementioned  water  before morning i had nearly baled out the boat and fortunate it was for me that up to the time of the upset we had had enough to eat and drink for otherwise i should not have had strength for that work and for what followed  not long after daybreak i sighted the sparhawk and immediately began to make such signals as i could the vessel appeared to be but a few miles distant and i could not determine whether she was approaching me or going away from me i could see no sign that my signals had been noticed and began frantically to row toward her after a quarter of an hour of violent exertion i did not appear to be much nearer to her but observing her more closely i could see even with my landsmans eyes that something was the matter with her portions of her mast and rigging were gone and one large sail at her stern appeared to be fluttering in the wind  but it mattered not to me what had happened to her she was a ship afloat and i must reach her tired hungry and thirsty i rowed and rowed but it was not until long after noon that i reached her she must have been much farther from me than i had supposed  with a great deal of trouble i managed to clamber on board and found the ship deserted i had suspected  that this would be the case for as i had drawn near i would have seen some sign that my approach was noticed had there been anybody on board to perceive  it but i found food and water and when i was no longer hungry or thirsty i threw myself in a berth and slept until the sun was high the next day  i had now been on the derelict vessel for eight days why she had been deserted and left to her fate i was not seaman enough to know it is true that her masts and rigging were in a doleful condition but she did not appear to be leaking and rode well upon the sea there was plenty of food and water on board and comfortable accommodations i afterwards learned that during the terrible cyclone which had overtaken her she had been on her beam ends for an hour before the crew left her in the boats  for the first day or two of my sojourn on the sparhawk  i was as happy as a man could be under the circumstances i thought myself to be perfectly safe and believed it could not be long before i would be picked up of course i did not know my latitude and longitude but i felt sure that the part of the atlantic in which i was must be frequently crossed by steamers and other vessels  about the fourth day i began to feel uneasy i had seen but three sails and these had taken no notice of the signal which i had hung as high in the mizzenmast  as i had dared to climb it was indeed no wonder that the signal had attracted no attention among the fluttering shreds of sails about it  i believe that one ship must have approached quite near me i had been below some time looking over the books in the captains room and when i came on deck i saw the stern of the ship perhaps a mile or two distant and sailing away of course my shouts and wavings were of no avail she had probably recognized  the derelict sparhawk and had made a note of her present position in order to report to the hydrographic office  the weather had been fair for the most part of the time the sea moderately smooth and when the wind was strong the great sail on the mizzenmast which remained hoisted and which i had tightened up a little acted after the manner of the long end of a weathervane and kept the ships head to the sea  thus it will be seen that i was not in a bad plight but although i appreciated this i grew more and more troubled and uneasy for several days i had not seen a sail and if i should see one how could i attract attention it must be that the condition of the vessel  indicated that there was no one on board had i known that the sparhawk was already entered upon the list of derelicts i should have been hopeless indeed  at first i hung out a lantern as a night signal but on the second night it was broken by the wind and i could find only one other in good condition the ships lights must have been blown away in the storm together with her boats and much of her rigging i would not hang out the only lantern left me for fear it should come to grief and that i should be left in the dark at night in that great vessel had i known that i was on a vessel which had been regularly relegated to the ranks of the forsaken i should better have appreciated the importance of allowing passing vessels to see that there was a light on board the sparhawk and therefore in all probability a life  as day after day had passed i had become more and more disheartened it seemed to me that i was in a part of the great ocean avoided by vessels of every kind that i was not in the track of anything going anywhere every day there seemed to be less and less wind and when i had been on board a week the sparhawk was gently rising and falling on a smooth sea in a dead calm hour after hour i swept the horizon with the captains glass but only once did i see anything to encourage me this was what appeared  like a long line of black smoke against the distant  sky which might have been left by a passing steamer but were this the case i never saw the steamer  happily there were plenty of provisions on board of a plain kind i found spirits and wine and even medicines and in the captains room there were pipes tobacco and some books  this comparative comfort gave me a new and strange kind of despair i began to fear that i might become contented to live out my life alone in the midst of this lonely ocean in that case what sort of a man should i become  it was about 830 by the captains chronometer when i came on deck on the morning of the 25th of may i had become a late riser for what was the good of rising early when there was nothing to rise for i had scarcely raised my eyes above the rail of the ship when to my utter amazement i perceived a vessel not a mile away the sight was so unexpected and the surprise was so great that my heart almost stopped beating as i stood and gazed at her  she was a mediumsized iron steamer and lay upon the sea in a peculiar fashion her head being much lower than her stern the latter elevated so much that i could see part of the blades of her motionless propeller she presented the appearance of a ship which was just about to plunge bow foremost into the depths of the ocean or which had just risen stern foremost from those depths  with the exception of her position and the fact that no smokestack was visible she seemed to my eyes to be in good enough trim she had probably been in collision with something and her forward compartments had filled deserted by her crew she had become a derelict and drifting about in her desolation  had fallen in with another derelict as desolate as herself the fact that i was on board the sparhawk did not in my eyes make that vessel any the less forsaken and forlorn  the coming of this steamer gave me no comfort two derelicts in their saddening effects upon the spirits would be twice as bad as one and more than that there was danger should a storm arise that they would dash into each other and both go to the bottom despairing as i had become i did not want to go to the bottom  as i gazed upon the steamer i could see that she was gradually approaching me there was a little breeze this morning and so much of her hull stood out of the water that it caught a good deal of the wind the sparhawk on the contrary was but little affected by the breeze for apart from the fact that the great sail kept her head always to the wind she was heavily laden with sugar and molasses and sat deep in the water the other was not coming directly toward me but would probably pass at a considerable distance i did not at all desire that she should come near the sparhawk  suddenly my heart gave a jump i could distinctly see on the stern of the steamer the flutter of something white it was waved somebody must be waving it  hitherto i had not thought of the spyglass for with my naked eyes i could see all that i cared to see of the vessel but now i dashed below to get it when i brought it to bear upon the steamer i saw plainly that the white object was waved by some one and that some one was a woman i could see above the rail the upper part of her body her uncovered head her uplifted arm wildly waving  presently the waving ceased and then the thought suddenly struck me that receiving no response she had in despair given up signalling cursing my stupidity  i jerked my handkerchief from my pocket and climbing a little way into the rigging i began to wave it madly almost instantly her waving recommenced i soon stopped signalling and so did she no more of that was needed i sprang to the deck and took up the glass  the woman was gone but in a few moments she reappeared armed with a glass this action filled me with amazement could it be possible that the woman was alone on the steamer and that there was no one else to signal and to look out the thing was incredible  and yet if there were men on board why did they not show themselves and why did not one of them wave the signal and use the glass  the steamer was steadily but very slowly nearing the sparhawk when the woman removed the glass and stood up waist high above the rail of the steamer now i could see her much better i fancied i could almost discern her features she was not old she was well shaped her bluish gray dress fitted her snugly holding the rail with one hand she stood up very erect which must have been somewhat difficult considering the inclination of the deck for a moment i fancied i had seen or known some one whose habit it was to stand up very erect as this woman stood upon the steamer the notion was banished as absurd  wondering what i should do what instant action i should take i laid down my glass and as i did so the woman immediately put up hers her object was plain enough she wanted to observe me which she could not well do when a view of my face was obstructed  by the glass and my outstretched arms i was sorry that i had not sooner given her that opportunity  and for some moments i stood and faced her waving my hat as i did so  i was wild with excitement what should i do what could i do there were no boats on the sparhawk  and what had become of the one in which i reached her i did not know thinking of nothing but getting on board the vessel i had forgotten to make the boat fast and when i went to look for it a day or two afterward it was gone on the steamer however i saw a boat hanging from davits near the stern there was hope in that  but there might be no need for a boat under the influence of the gentle breeze the steamer was steadily drawing nearer to the sparhawk perhaps they might touch each other but this idea was soon dispelled for i could see that the wind would carry the steamer past me although perhaps at no great distance then my hopes sprang back to the boat hanging from her davits  but before these hopes could take shape the woman and her glass died out of sight behind the rail of the steamer in about a minute she reappeared stood up erect and applied a speakingtrumpet to her mouth it was possible that a high shrill voice might have been heard from one vessel to the other but it was plain enough that this was a woman who took no useless  chances i too must be prepared to hail as well as to be hailed quickly i secured a speakingtrumpet from the captains room and stood up at my post  across the water came the monosyllable ho and back i shouted hallo  then came these words as clear and distinct as any i ever heard in my life are you mr rockwell  this question almost took away my senses was this reality or had a spirit risen from this lonely ocean to summon me somewhere was this the way people died rockwell yes my name was rockwell at least it had been i was sure of nothing now  again came the voice across the sea why dont you answer it said  i raised my trumpet to my lips at first i could make no sound but controlling my agitation a little i shouted yes  instantly the woman disappeared and for ten minutes  i saw her no more during that time i did nothing but stand and look at the steamer which was moving more slowly than before for the reason that the wind was dying away she was now however nearly opposite me and so near that if the wind should cease entirely conversation might be held without the aid of trumpets i earnestly hoped this might be the case for i had now recovered the possession  of my senses and greatly desired to hear the natural voice of that young woman on the steamer  as soon as she reappeared i made a trial of the power of my voice laying down the trumpet i shouted who are you  back came the answer clear high and perfectly audible i am mary phillips  mary phillips it seemed to me that i remembered the name i was certainly familiar with the erect attitude and i fancied i recognized the features of the speaker but this was all i could not place her  before i could say anything she hailed again dont you remember me she cried i lived in fortysecond street  the middle of a wild and desolate ocean and a voice from fortysecond street what manner of conjecture  was this i clasped my head in my hands and tried to think suddenly a memory came to me a wild surging raging memory  with what person did you live in fortysecond street i yelled across the water  miss bertha nugent she replied  a fire seemed to blaze within me standing on tiptoe  i fairly screamed bertha nugent where is she  the answer came back here and when i heard it my legs gave way beneath me and i fell to the deck i must have remained for some minutes half lying half seated on the deck i was nearly stupefied by the statement i had heard  i will now say a few words concerning miss bertha nugent she was a lady whom i had known well in new york and who for more than a year i had loved well although i never told her so whether or not she suspected my passion was a question about which i had never been able to satisfy myself sometimes i had one opinion sometimes another before i had taken any steps to assure myself positively in regard to this point miss nugent went abroad with a party of friends and for eight months i had neither seen nor heard from her  during that time i had not ceased to berate myself for my inexcusable procrastination as she went away without knowing my feelings toward her of course there could be no correspondence whatever she might have suspected or whatever she might have expected there was nothing between us  but on my part my love for bertha had grown day by day hating the city and even the country where i had seen her and loved her and where now she was not i travelled here and there and during the winter went to the west indies there i had remained until the weather had become too warm for a longer sojourn and then i had taken passage in the thespia for new york i knew that bertha would return to the city in the spring or summer and i wished to be there when she arrived if when i met her i found her free there would be no more delay my life thenceforth  would be black or white and now here she was near me in a halfwrecked steamer on the wide atlantic with no companion as i knew but her maid mary phillips  i now had a very distinct recollection of mary phillips in my visits to the nugent household in fortysecond street i had frequently seen this young woman two or three times when miss nugent had not been at home i had had slight interviews with her she always treated me with a certain cordiality and i had some reason to think that if miss nugent really suspected my feelings mary phillips had given her some hints on the subject  mary phillips was an exceedingly bright and quick young woman and i am quite sure that she could see into the state of a mans feelings as well as any one bertha had given me many instances of her maids facilities for adapting herself to circumstances and i was now thankful from the bottom of my heart that bertha had this woman with her  i was recovering from the stupefaction into which my sudden emotions had plunged me when a hail came across the water first in mary phillipss natural voice and then through a speakingtrumpet i stood up and answered  i was wondering cried mary phillips what had become of you i thought perhaps you had gone down to breakfast in answer i called to her to tell me where miss nugent was how she was how she came to be in this surprising situation and how many people there were on board the steamer  miss nugent has not been at all well answered mary but she brightened up as soon as i told her you were here she cannot come on deck very well because the pitch of the ship makes the stairs so steep but i am going to give her her breakfast now and after she has eaten something she may be stronger and i will try to get her on deck  brightened up when she knew i was near that was glorious that brightened up creation  by this time i needed food also but i did not remain below to eat it i brought my breakfast on deck keeping my eyes all the time fixed upon berthas  steamer the distance between us did not seem to have varied how i longed for a little breeze that might bring us together bertha was on that vessel trusting perhaps entirely to me and what could i do if some breeze did not bring us together i looked about for something on which i might float to her but if i made a raft i was not sure that i could steer or propel it and i might float away and become a third derelict once i thought of boldly springing into the water and swimming to her but the distance  was considerable my swimming powers were only moderate and there might be sharks the risk was too great but surely we would come together even if no kind wind arose there was that strange attraction which draws to each other the bubbles on a cup of tea if bubbles why not ships  it was not long before nearly onehalf of mary phillips appeared above the rail miss nugent aas come on deck she cried and she wants to see you she cant stand up very long because everything is so sliding  before my trembling lips could frame an answer she had bobbed out of sight and presently reappeared supporting another person and that other person was bertha nugent  i could discern her features perfectly she was thinner and paler than when i had last seen her but her beauty was all there the same smile which i had seen so often was upon her face as she waved her handkerchief to me i waved my hat in return but i tried two or three times before i could speak loud enough for her to hear me then i threw into my words all the good cheer and hope that i could  she did not attempt to answer but smiled more brightly than before her expression seemed to indicate  that apart from the extraordinary pleasure of meeting a friend on this waste of waters she was glad that i was that friend  she cant speak loud enough for you to hear her called out mary phillips but she says that now you are here she thinks everything will be all right she wants to know if you are alone on your ship and if you can come to us  i explained my situation but said i did not doubt but the two ships would gradually drift together is there no one to lower your boat i asked  no one but me answered mary and i dont believe i am up to that sort of thing miss nugent says i must not touch it for fear i might fall overboard  do you mean to say i cried that there is nobody but you two on board that steamer  no other living soul said mary and ill tell you how it all happened  then she told their story the friends with whom miss nugent had travelled had determined to go to egypt but as she did not wish to accompany them she had remained in spain and algiers during the early spring and eleven days before she and mary phillips had started from marseilles for home in the steamer la fidélité five days ago the steamer had collided in the night with something mary did not know what and her front part was filled with water everybody was sure that the vessel would soon sink and the captain crew and passengersall frenchwent  away in boats  is it possible i yelled that they deserted you two women  mary phillips replied that this was not the case they had been implored to go in the boats but the night was dark the sea was rough and pitchy and she was sure the boat would upset before they had gone a hundred yards miss nugent and she both agreed that it was much safer to remain on a large vessel like the fidélité even if she was half full of water than to go out on the dark and stormy water in a miserable little shell of a boat the captain got down on his knees and implored them to go but they were resolute he then declared that he would force them into the craft but mary phillips declared that if he tried that she would shoot him she had a pistol ready then when they had all got in the boats but the captain two of the men jumped on board again threw their arms around him and carried him off vowing that he should not lose his life on account of a pair of senseless americans a boat would be left the men said which they might use if they chose but of course this was more a piece of sentiment than anything else  and now you see cried mary phillips i was right and they were wrong this steamer has not sunk and i have no manner of doubt that every soul who went away in those boats is now at the bottom of the sea  this was indeed a wonderful story and the fact that bertha nugent was on board a derelict vessel and should happen to fall in with me on board of another was one of those events which corroborate the trite and hackneyed adage that truth is stranger than fiction  it was surprising how plainly i could hear mary phillips across the smooth still water the ships did not now seem to be moving at all but soon they would be nearer and then i could talk with bertha and soon after it must be so i would be with her  i inquired if they had food and whatever else they needed and mary phillips replied that with the exception of the slanting position of the ship they were very comfortable that she did the cooking and that miss nugent said that they lived a great deal better than when the ships cook cooked  mary also informed me that she had arranged a very nice couch for miss nugent on the afterdeck that she was lying there now and felt better that she wanted to know which i thought the safer ship of the two and that whenever a little wind arose and the vessels were blown nearer each other she wished to get up and talk to me herself  i answered that i thought both the ships were safe enough and should be delighted to talk with miss nugent but in my heart i could not believe that a vessel with her bow as low as that of the fidélité could be safe in bad weather to say nothing of the possibility of at any time the water bursting into other compartments of the ship the sparhawk i believed to be in much better condition despite the fact that she was utterly helpless as far as sailing qualities were concerned the greater part of her masts and rigging being in a wretched condition and her rudder useless she did not appear to be damaged i had no reason to believe that she leaked and she floated well although as i have said she lay rather deep in the water  if the thing were possible i intended to get bertha on board the sparhawk where there was hope that we could all remain safely until we were rescued with this purpose in view the moment mary phillips disappeared i went below and prepared the captains cabin for bertha and her maid i carried to the forward part of the vessel all the pipes bottles and glasses and such other things as were not suitable for a ladys apartment and thoroughly aired the cabin making it as neat and comfortable as circumstances permitted the very thought of offering hospitality to bertha was a joy  i proposed to myself several plans to be used in various contingencies if the two vessels approached near enough i would throw a line to la fidélité and mary phillips would make it fast i knew then with a windlass i might draw the two vessels together then i would spring on board the steamer and when i had transferred bertha and mary to the sparhawk would cut loose la fidélité to drift where she pleased  it was possible that i might convey from one vessel to the other some articles of luxury or necessity but on this point i would not come to any definite conclusion i would consult mary phillips on the subject  another plan was that if we did not approach very close i would endeavor to throw a long light line to the steamer and mary phillips would attach it to the boat which hung from the davits into this she would put a pair of oars and lower it as well as she could then i would haul it to the sparhawk row over to the steamer and transfer bertha and mary to my vessel it was possible that we should not have to be very near each other for me to carry out this plan had i been a seaman i might have thought of some other plan better than these but i was not a seaman  i did not waste any time in the cabin although i was very desirous to make it as pleasant as possible for the reception of bertha but when i returned to the deck i was astonished to find that the steamer was farther away than it had been when i went below there was a slight breeze from the east which had nearly turned the sparhawk about with her bow to the wind but was gently carrying la fidélité before it  i seized the speakingtrumpet and with all my power hailed the steamer and in return there came to me a single sound the sound of the vowel o i could see two handkerchiefs fluttering upon the stern in ten minutes these were scarcely discernible  halfcrazed i stood and gazed and gazed and gazed at the distant steamer the wind died away and i could perceive that she was not becoming more distant then i began to hope another wind might spring up which would bring her back  and in an hour or two the other wind did spring up i felt it in my face and slowly the sparhawk turned her bow toward it and enrapturing sight the steamer with my bertha on board began to move slowly back to me the wind which was now blowing came from the southwest and la fidélité which before had lain to the southward of the sparhawk was passing to the north of my vessel nearer and nearer she came and my whole soul was engaged in the hope that she might not pass too far north  but i soon saw that unless the wind changed the steamer would probably pass within hailing distance  soon i could see mary phillips on deck speakingtrumpet  in hand and seizing my trumpet i hailed when as i thought we were near enough i eagerly inquired after bertha and the high voice of mary phillips came across the water telling me that miss nugent was not feeling at all well this uncertain state of affairs was making her feel very nervous can she come on deck i cried can she use a speakingtrumpet if i could talk to her i might encourage her  she needs it answered mary but she cannot speak through the trumpet she tried it and it made her head ache she is here on deck and i am going to help her stand up as soon as we get nearer perhaps she may be able to speak to you  the two vessels were now near enough for a highpitched  conversation without the assistance of trumpets  and mary phillips assisted bertha to the side of the steamer where i could distinctly see her i shouted as hearty a greeting as ever was sent across the water bidding her to keep up a good heart for help of some kind must surely come to us she tried to answer me but her voice was not strong enough then she shook her head by which i understood that she did not agree with me in my hopeful predictions i called back to her that in all this drifting about the two vessels must certainly come together and then with the assistance of the steamers boat we could certainly devise some way of getting out of this annoying  plight she smiled apparently at the mildness of this expression and again shook her head she now seemed tired for her position by the rail was not an easy one to maintain and her maid assisted her to her couch on the deck then stood up mary phillips speaking loud and promptly  she has a message for you she said which she wanted to give to you herself but she cannot do it she thinksbut i tell her it is of no use thinking that waythat we are bound to be lost you may be saved because your ship seems in a better condition  than ours and she does not believe that the two vessels will ever come together so she wants me to tell you that if you get home and she never does that she wishes her share in the fortysecond street house to go to her married sister and to be used for the education of the children she doesnt want it divided  up in the ordinary way because each one will get so little and it will do no good do you think that will be a good will  dont speak of wills i shouted there is no need of a will she will get home in safety and attend to her own affairs  i think so too cried mary phillips but i had to tell you what she said and now she wants to know if you have any message to send to your parents for we might blow off somewhere and be picked up while this might not happen to you but i dont believe in that sort of thing any more than in the other  i shouted back my disbelief in the necessity of any such messages when mary phillips seized her trumpet and cried that she did not hear me  alas the breeze was still blowing and the steamer was moving away to the northeast through my trumpet i repeated my words and then mary said something which i could not hear the wind was against her i shouted to her to speak louder and she must have screamed with all her force but i could only hear some words to the effect that we were bound to come together again and she waved her handkerchief cheerily  then the steamer moved farther and farther away and speakingtrumpets were of no avail i seized the glass and watched la fidélité until she was nothing but a black spot upon the sea  the wind grew lighter and finally died away and the black spot remained upon the horizon i did not take my eyes from it until night drew on and blotted it out i had not thought of advising mary phillips to hang out a light and she was probably not sufficiently  accustomed to the ways of ships to think of doing it herself although there could be no doubt that there were lanterns suitable for the purpose on the steamer had there been a light upon that vessel i should have watched the glimmer all night as it was i slept upon the deck waking frequently to peer out into the darkness and to listen for a hail from a speakingtrumpet  in the morning there was a black spot upon the horizon i fancied that it was a little nearer than when i last saw it but in the course of the forenoon it faded away altogether then despair seized upon me and i cared not whether i lived or died i forgot to eat and threw myself upon the deck where i remained  for several hours upbraiding myself for my monstrous unpardonable folly in neglecting the opportunities which were now lost  over and over again i told myself bitterly that when i had been near enough to the vessel which bore bertha nugent to converse with mary phillips without  the aid of a speakingtrumpet i should have tried to reach that vessel no matter what the danger or the difficulties i should have launched a rafti should have tried to swimi should have done something  and more than that even had it been impossible for me to reach the steamer i should have endeavored to reach berthas heart i should have told her that i loved her whether she were lost or i were lost or both of us she should have known i loved her she might not have been able to answer me but she could have heard me for that terrible mistake that crime there was no pardon now every chance was gone what reason was there to suppose that these two derelicts ever again would drift together  in the afternoon i rose languidly and looked about me i saw something on the horizon and seizing the glass i knew it to be la fidélité i could recognize the slant of the hull of the masts  now hope blazed up again if she were nearer she must come nearer still i recovered my ordinary state of mind sufficiently to know that i was hungry and that i must eat to be strong and ready for what might happen  upon one thing i was determined if bertha should ever again be brought near enough to hear me i would tell her that i loved her the object of life however much of it might be left me should be to make bertha know that i loved her if i swam toward the vessel or floated on a plank i must get near enough to tell her that i loved her  but there was no wind and the apparent size of the steamer did not increase this was a region or season  of calms or fitful winds during the rest of the day the distant vessel continued to be a black speck upon the smooth and gently rolling sea again i spent the night on deck but i did not wake to listen or watch i was worn out and slept heavily  the day was bright when i was awakened by a chilly feeling a strong breeze was blowing over me i sprang to my feet there was quite a heavy sea the vessel was rolling and pitching beneath me and not far away not more than a mile la fidélité was coming straight toward me lightly laden and with a great part of her hull high out of water the high wind was driving her before it while my vessel her bow to the breeze was moving at a much slower rate  as i looked at the rapidly approaching steamer it seemed as if she certainly must run into the sparhawk but for that i cared not all that i now hoped for was that bertha should come to me whether one vessel sank or the other or whether both went down together i should be with bertha i would live or die with her mary phillips stood full in view on the stern of the oncoming steamer a speakingtrumpet  in her hand i could now see that it was not probable that the two vessels would collide the steamer would pass me but probably very near before  i could make up my mind what i should do in this momentous emergency mary phillips hailed me  when we get near enough she shouted throw me a rope ill tie it to the boat and cut it loose  wildly i looked about me for a line which i might throw cordage there was in abundance but it was broken or fastened to something or too heavy to handle i remembered however seeing a coil of small rope below and hastening down i brought it on deck took the coil in my right hand and stood ready to hurl it when the proper moment should come  that moment came quickly the steamer was not a hundred feet from me when i reached the deck it passed me on the port side  be ready cried mary phillips the instant she saw me it was not now necessary to use a trumpet  throw as soon as i get opposite to you she cried  is bertha well i shouted  yes said mary phillips but what youve got to do is to throw that rope give it a good heave throw now  the two vessels were not fifty feet apart with all my strength i hurled the coil of rope the steamers stern was above me and i aimed high the flying coil went over the deck of la fidélité but in my excitement i forgot to grasp tightly the other end of it and the whole rope flew from me and disappeared beyond the steamer stupefied by this deplorable accident i staggered backward and a heave of the vessel threw me against the rail recovering myself i glared about for another rope but of course there was none  then came a shout from mary phillips but she had already passed me and as i was to the windward of her i did not catch her words as i remembered her appearance she seemed to be tearing her hair in a flash i thought of my resolution rushing to the rail i put the trumpet to my mouth the wind would carry my words to her if it would not bring hers to me  tell bertha to come on deck i shouted mary phillips looked at me but did not move i wished her to rush below and bring up bertha not an instant was to be lost but she did not move  tell her i love her i yelled through the trumpet tell her that i love her now and shall love her forever tell her i love her no matter what happens tell her i love her i love her i love her and this i continued to scream until it was plain i was no longer heard then i threw down my useless trumpet and seized the glass madly i scanned the steamer no sign of bertha was to be seen mary phillips was there and now she waved her handkerchief at all events she forgave me at such a terrible moment what could one do but forgive  i watched and watched and watched but no figure but that of mary phillips appeared upon the steamer and at last i could not even distinguish that now i became filled with desperate fury i determined to sail after bertha and overtake her a great sail was flapping from one of my masts and i would put my ship about and the strong wind should carry me to bertha  i knew nothing of sailing but even if i had known all my efforts would have been useless i rushed to the wheel and tried to move it pulling it this way and that but the rudder was broken or jammedi know not what had happened to it i seized the ropes attached to the boom of the sail i pulled i jerked i hauled i did not know what i was doing i did nothing at last in utter despair and exhaustion i fell to the deck  but before the wind had almost died away and in the afternoon the sea was perfectly calm and when the sun set i could plainly see the steamer on the faroff  edge of the glistening water during the whole of the next day i saw her she neither disappeared nor came nearer sometimes i was in the depths of despair sometimes i began to hope a little but i had one great solace in the midst of my miserybertha knew that i loved her i was positively sure that my words had been heard  it was a strange manner in which i had told my love i had roared my burning words of passion through a speakingtrumpet and i had told them not to bertha herself but to mary phillips but the manner was of no importance bertha now knew that i loved her that was everything to me  as long as light remained i watched la fidélité through the glass but i could see nothing but a black form with a slanting upper line she was becalmed as i was why could she not have been becalmed near me i dared not let my mind rest upon the opportunities i had lost when she had been becalmed near me during the night the wind must have risen again for the sparhawk rolled and dipped a good deal troubling my troubled slumbers very early in the morning i was awakened by what sounded like a distant scream i did not know whether it was a dream or not but i hurried on deck the sun had not risen but as i looked about i saw something which took away my breath which made me wonder if i were awake or dreaming or mad  it was berthas steamer within hailing distance  above the rail i saw the head and body of mary phillips who was screaming through the trumpet i stood and gazed in petrified amazement  i could not hear what mary phillips said perhaps my senses were benumbed perhaps the wind was carrying away her words that it was blowing from me toward her soon became too evident the steamer was receding from the sparhawk the instant i became aware of this my powers of perception and reasoning returned to me with a burning flash  bertha was going away from meshe was almost gone  snatching my trumpet i leaned over the rail and shouted with all my might did you hear me say i loved her did you tell her  mary phillips had put down her trumpet but now she raised it again to her mouth and i could see that she was going to make a great effort the distance between us had increased considerably since i came on deck and she had to speak against the wind  with all the concentrated intensity which highstrung  nerves could give to a man who is trying to hear the one thing to him worth hearing in the world i listened had a wild beast fixed his claws and teeth into me at the moment i would not have withdrawn my attention  i heard the voice of mary phillips faint far away i heard the words yes but and the rest was lost she must have known from my aspect that her message did not reach me for she tried again and again to make herself heard  the wind continued to blow and the steamer continued  to float and float and float away a wind had come up in the night it had blown bertha near me perhaps it had blown her very near me she had not known it and i had not known it mary phillips had not known it until it was too late and now that wind had blown her past me and was blowing her away for a time there was a flutter of a handkerchief but only one handkerchief and then la fidélité with bertha on board was blown away until she disappeared  and i never saw her again  all night i sat upon the deck of the sparhawk thinking wondering and conjecturing i was in a strange state of mind i did not wonder or conjecture whether berthas vessel would come back to me again i did not think of what i should do if it did come back i did not think of what i should do if it never came back all night i thought wondered and conjectured what mary phillips had meant by the word but  it was plain to me what yes had meant my message had been heard and i knew mary phillips well enough to feel positively sure that having received such a message under such circumstances she had given it to bertha therefore i had positive proof that bertha knew that i loved her but what did the but mean  it seemed to me that there were a thousand things that this word might mean it might mean that she was already engaged to be married it might mean that she had vowed never to marry it might mean that she disapproved of such words at such a time i cannot repeat the tenth of the meanings which i thought i might attach to this word but the worst thing that it could purport the most terrible signification of all recurred to me over and over again it might mean that bertha could not return my affection she knew that i loved her but she could not love me  in the morning i ate something and then lay down upon the deck to sleep it was well that i should do this i thought because if bertha came near me again in the daytime mary phillips would hail me if i were not awake all night long i would watch and as there was a moon i would see berthas vessel if it came again  i did watch all that afternoon and all that night and during my watching i never ceased to wonder and conjecture what mary phillips meant by that word but  about the middle of the next day i saw in the distance  something upon the water i first thought it a bit of spray for it was white but as there were now no waves there could be no spray with the glass i could only see that it was something white shining in the sun it might be the glistening body of a dead fish after a time it became plainer to me it was such a little object that the faint breezes which occasionally  arose had more influence upon the sparhawk than upon it and so i gradually approached it  in about an hour i made out that it was something round with something white raised above it and then i discovered that it was a lifepreserver which supported  a little stick to which a white flag probably a handkerchief was attached then i saw that on the lifepreserver lay a little yellow mass  now i knew what it was that i saw it was a message from bertha mary phillips had devised the means of sending it bertha had sent it  the lifepreserver was a circular one filled with air in the centre of this mary by means of many strings had probably secured a stick in an upright position she had then fastened a handkerchief to the top of the stick bertha had written a message and mary had wrapped it in a piece of oiled silk and fastened  it to the lifepreserver she had then lowered this contrivance to the surface of the water hoping that it would float to me or i would float to it  i was floating to it it contained the solution of all my doubts the answer to all my conjectures it was berthas reply to my declaration of love and i was drifting slowly but surely toward it soon i would know  but after a time the course of the sparhawk or the course of the message changed i drifted to the north little by little my course deviated from the line on which i might have met the message at last i saw that i should never meet it when i became convinced of this my first impulse was to spring overboard and swim for it but i restrained this impulse as i had restrained others like it if bertha came back i must be ready to meet her i must run no risks for her sake and my sake she must find me on the sparhawk if she should come back she had left me and she had come back she might come back again even to get her message i must not run the risk of missing her and so with yearning heart and perhaps tearful eyes i watched the little craft disappear and become another derelict  i do not know how many days and nights i watched and waited for berthas ship and wondered and conjectured what mary phillips meant by but i was awake so much and ate so little and thought so hard that i lost strength both of mind and body all i asked of my body was to look out for berthas steamer and all that i asked of my mind was to resolve the meaning of the last words i had heard from that vessel  one day i do not know whether it was in the morning or afternoon i raised my head and on the horizon i saw a steamer quick as a flash my glass was brought to bear upon it in the next minute my arms dropped the telescope fell into my lap my head dropped it was not berthas steamer it was an ordinary steamer with its deck parallel with the water and a long line of smoke coming out of its funnel the shock of the disappointment was very great  when i looked up again i could see that the steamer was headed directly toward me and was approaching with considerable rapidity but this fact affected me little it would not bring me bertha it would not bring me any message from her it was an ordinary vessel of traffic i took no great interest in it one way or the other  before long it was so near that i could see people on board i arose and looked over the rail then some one on the steamer fired a gun or a pistol as this seemed to be a signal i waved my hat then the steamer began to move more slowly and soon lay to and lowered a boat  in ten minutes three men stood on the deck of the sparhawk some one had hailed me in english to lower something i had lowered nothing but here they were on deck they asked me a lot of questions but i answered none of them  is your captain with you i said they answered  that he was not that he was on the steamer then take me to him said i  of course we will said their leader with a smile and they took me  i was received on the steamer with much cordiality and much questioning but to none of it did i pay any attention i addressed the captain  sir said i i will be obliged to you if you will immediately cruise to the southwest and pick up for me a lifepreserver with a little white flag attached to it it also carries a message for me wrapped up in a piece of oiled silk it is very important that i should obtain that message without delay  the captain laughed why man said he what are you thinking of do you suppose that i can go out of my course to cruise after a lifepreserver  i looked at him with scorn unmanly fiend said i  another officer now approached whom i afterward knew to be the ships doctor  come come now he said dont let us have any hard words the captain is only joking of course he will steam after your lifepreserver and no doubt will come up with it very soon in the meantime you must come below and have something to eat and drink and rest yourself  satisfied with this assurance i went below was given food and medicine and was put into a berth where i remained for four days in a halfinsensible condition knowing nothingcaring for nothing  when i came on deck again i was very weak but i had regained my senses and the captain and i talked rationally together i told him how i had come on board the sparhawk and how i had fallen in with the la fidélité half wrecked having on board only a dear friend of mine in answer to his questions i described the details of the communications between the two vessels and could not avoid mentioning the wild hopes and heartbreaking disappointments of that terrible time and somewhat to my languid surprise the captain asked no questions regarding these subjects i finished by thanking him for having taken me from the wreck but added that i felt like a falsehearted coward for having deserted upon the sea the woman i loved who now would never know my fate nor i hers  dont be too sure of that said the captain for you are about to hear from her now  i gazed at him in blank amazement yes said the captain i have seen her and she has sent me to you but i see you are all knocked into a heap and i will make the story as short as i can this vessel of mine is bound from liverpool to la guayra and on the way down we called at lisbon on the morning  of the day i was to sail from there there came into port the glanford a big english merchantman from buenos ayres to london i knew her skipper captain  guy chesters as handsome a young english sailor as ever stood upon a deck  in less than an hour from the time we dropped anchor captain guy was on my vessel he was on the lookout he said for some craft bound for south america or the west indies and was delighted to find me there then he told me that ten days before he had taken two ladies from a halfwrecked french steamer and that they had prayed and besought him to cruise about and look for the sparhawk a helpless ship with a friend of theirs alone on board  you know said captain guy to me i couldnt do that for id lost time enough already and the wind was very light and variable so all i could do was to vow to the ladies that when we got to lisbon wed be bound to find a steamer going south and that she could easily keep a lookout for the sparhawk and take off the friend that was a pretty big contract you marked out for the steamer going south i said and as for the sparhawk shes an old derelict and i sighted her on my voyage north and sent in a report of her position and there couldnt have been anybody on board of her then cant say said captain guy from what i can make out this fellow must have boarded her a good while after she was abandoned and seems to have been lying low after that was that so sir did you lie low  i made no answer my whole soul was engaged in the comprehension of the fact that bertha had sent for me go on i cried  all right said he i ought not to keep you waiting i promised captain guy i would keep a lookout for the sparhawk and take you off if you were on board i promised the quicker because my conscience was growling at me for having perhaps passed a fellowbeing on an abandoned vessel but i had heard of the sparhawk before i had sighted her and so didnt keep a very sharp lookout for living beings aboard then captain guy took me on board his ship to see the two ladies for they wanted to give me instructions themselves and i tell you what sir you dont often see two prettier women on board ship nor anywhere else for that matter captain guy told me that before i saw them he was in great spirits about his luck he is the luckiest fellow in the merchant service now if i had picked up two people that way it would have been two old men but he gets a couple of lovely ladies thats the way the world goes the ladies made me pretty nigh swear that id never set foot on shore till i found you i would have been glad enough to stay there all day and make promises to those women but my time was short and i had to leave them to captain guy so i did keep a lookout for the sparhawk and heard of her from two vessels coming north and finally fell in with you and a regular lunatic you were when i took you on board but thats not to be wondered at and you seem to be all right now  did you not bring me any message from them i asked  oh yes lots said the captain let me see if i can remember some of them and then he knit his brows and tapped his head and repeated some very commonplace expressions of encouragement and sympathy  the effect of these upon me was very different from what the captain had expected i had hoped for a note a lineanything direct from bertha if she had written something which would explain the meaning of those last words from mary phillips whether that explanation were favorable or otherwise i would have been better satisfied but now my terrible suspense must continue  well said the captain you dont seem cheered up much by word from your friends i was too busy looking at them to rightly catch everything they said but i know they told me they were going to london in the glanford this i remembered because it struck me what a jolly piece of good luck it all was for captain guy  and for what port are you bound i asked la guayra he said it isnt a very good time of the year to be there but i dont doubt that you can find some vessel or other there that will take you north so youre all right  i was not all right bertha was saved i was saved but i had received no message i knew nothing  and i was going away from her  two or three days after this the captain came to me and said look here young man you seem to be in the worst kind of doleful dumps people who have been picked up in the middle of the ocean dont generally look like that i wonder if youre not a little lovesick on account of a young woman on the glanford  i made no answer i would not rebuke him for he had saved my life but this was a subject which i did not wish to discuss with a seacaptain  if thats really whats the matter with you said he i can give you a piece of advice which will do you good if you take it i think you told me that you are not engaged to this lady i nodded and that you never proposed to her except through a speakingtrumpet i allowed silence to make assent well now my advice is to give her up to drop all thoughts of her and to make up your mind to tackle onto some other girl when you find one that is good enough you havent the least chance in the world with this one captain guy is mad in love with her he told me so himself and when hes out and out in love with a girl hes bound to get her when i was with him he might have been married once a month if hed chosen to but he didnt choose now he does choose and i can tell you that hes not going to make love through a speakingtrumpet hell go straight at it and hell win too theres every reason why he should win in the first place hes one of the handsomest fellows and i dont doubt one of the best lovemakers that you would be likely to meet on land or sea and then again she has every reason to be grateful to him and to look on him as a hero  i listened without a word the captains reasoning seemed to me very fallacious  you dont know it said he but captain guy did a good deal more than pick up those two women from an abandoned vessel you see he was making his way north with a pretty fair wind from the southwest the first theyd had for several days and when his lookout sighted la fidélité nobody on board thought for a minute that he would try to beat up to her for she lay a long way to the west of his course though pretty well in sight  but captain guy has sharp eyes and a good glass and he vowed that he could see something on the wreck that looked like a handkerchief waved by a woman he told me this himself as we were walking from my ship to his everybody laughed at him and wanted to know if women waved handkerchiefs different  from other people  they said that any bit of canvas might wave like that and that it was plain enough that the vessel was abandoned if it was not it could be for there was a boat still hanging to one of its davits captain guy paid no attention to this but spied a little longer then he vowed that he was going to make for that vessel there was one of the owners on board and he up and forbid captain guy to do it he told him that they had been delayed enough on the voyage by light winds and now that they would be overdue at their port a good many days before they got there every day lost he said was money lost to the owners he had never heard of any skipper undertaking a piece of tomfoolery like this it would take all day to beat up to that wreck and when they reached it they would find an old derelict which was no more than they could see now and as for there being a woman on board that was all stuff the skipper had woman on the brain  to this captain guy answered that he didnt own the ship but he commanded her and as long as he commanded this vessel or any other he was not going to pass a wreck when there were good reasons to believe that there was a human being on board of it and in spite of what anybody said his eyes told him that there was reason to believe that there was somebody waving on that wreck so he ordered the ship put about paying no attention to the cursing and swearing of the owner and beat against a wind that was getting lighter and lighter for over four hours until he reached the french steamer and took off the two ladies  there was nobody on board the glanford that thinks that captain guy will ever sail that ship again and in fact he dont think so himself but said he to me if i can marry that girl the ship can go if i cant get another ship i can sail under a skipper but theres no other girl in the world like this one  and so you see sir he continued there isnt the least chance in the world for you captain guys got her on board his ship hes with her by sunlight and starlight hes lost his ship for her and he wants to marry her and on the other hand itll be weeks and weeks and perhaps months before you can see her or write to her either as like as not and long before that captain guy will have his affair settled and there isnt any reason in my mind to doubt which way it will settle and so you just take my advice sir and stop drawing that long face there are plenty of good girls in the world no reason why you shouldnt get one but if you are moping for the one that captain guys got his heart set on im afraid youll end by being as much out of your head as you were when i found you  to all this i made no answer but walked gloomily toward the stern and looked down into the foaming wake i think i heard the captain tell one of the men to keep an eye on me  when we reached la guayraand the voyage seemed to me a neverending onei immediately set about finding a vessel bound for england my captain advised me to go up on the mountains and wait until a steamer should sail for new york which event might be expected in two or three weeks america would be much better for me he thought than would england but i paid no attention to him and as there was nothing in port that would sail for england i took passage in a spanish steamer bound for barcelona arriving there after a passage long enough to give me plenty of time for the consideration of the last two words i heard from mary phillips and of the value of the communications i had received regarding  captain guy chesters i immediately started by rail for london on this journey i found that what i had heard concerning the rescue of my bertha had had a greater effect upon me than i had supposed trains could not go fast enough for me i was as restless as a maniac i may have looked like one  over and over i tried to quiet myself by comforting reflections saying to myself for instance that if the message which bertha had sent floating on the sea to me had not been a good one she would not have sent it feel as she might she could not have been so hardhearted as to crush the hopes of a man who like herself might soon lie in a watery grave but then there was that terrible word but looked at in certain lights what could be more crushing or heartbreaking  than that  and then again mary phillips may not have understood what i said to her through the speakingtrumpet a grim humor of despair suggested that at that distance and in that blustering wind the faithful maidservant might have thought that instead of shouting that i loved my bertha i was asking her if they had plenty of salt pork and hardtack it was indeed a time of terrible suspense  i did not know berthas address in england i knew that she had friends in london and others in the country but i was sure that i would find her if she were on the island i arrived in london very early in the morning too early to expect to find open any of the bankinghouses or other places where americans would be likely to register unable to remain inactive i took a cab and drove to the london docks  i went to inquire the whereabouts of captain guy chesters  this plan of action was almost repulsive to me but i felt that it offered an opportunity which i should not neglect i would certainly learn about bertha if i saw him and whether it would be anything good or anything bad i ought to know it  in making my inquiries the cabman was of much assistance to me and after having been referred from one person to another i at last found a man first mate of a vessel in the docks who knew captain chesters and could tell me all about him  yes sir said he i can tell you where to find captain chesters hes on shore for he doesnt command the glanford now and as far as i know he hasnt signed articles yet either as skipper or mate in any other craft the fact is hes engaged in business which i suppose he thinks better than sailing the sea he was married about a month ago its only two or three days since hes got back from a little land trip they took on the continent i saw him yesterday hes the happiest man alive but its as like as not that hes ready for business now that hes got through with his honeymoon and if its a skipper youre looking for you cant find a better man than captain guy not about these docks  i stood and looked at the man without seeing him and then in a hollow voice asked where does he live  a hundred and nine lisbury street calistoy road east now that ive told you i wish i hadnt you look as though you were going to measure him for a coffin  thank you said i and walked away  i told the cabman to drive me to the address i had received and in due time we arrived in front of a very goodlooking house in a quiet and respectable street  i was in a peculiar state of mind i had half expected the terrible shock and i had received it but i had not been stunned i had been roused to an unusual condition of mental activity my senses were sharpened by the torment of my soul and i observed everythingthe quarter of the city the street the house  the woman who opened the door started a little when she saw me i asked for mrs captain chesters and walked in without waiting to be told whether the lady was in or not the woman showed me into a little parlor and left me her manner plainly indicated  that she suspected something was the matter with me  in a very short time a tall wellmade man with curly brown hair a handsome sunbrowned face and that fine presence which command at sea frequently gives entered the room  i understand sir said he that you asked for my wife but i thought it better to come to you myself what is your business with her sir and what is your name  my name is charles rockwell i said and my business is to see her if she has already forgotten my name you can tell her that i kept company with her for a while on the atlantic ocean when she was in one wreck and i was in another  good heavens cried the young sailor do you mean to say that you are the man who was on the derelict sparhawk and were you picked up by captain stearns whom i sent after you i supposed he would have written to me about you  i came faster than a letter would come i answered can i see her  of course you can cried captain guy i never knew a man so talked about as you have been since i fell in with the wreck of that french steamer by george sir there was a time when i was dead jealous of you but im married tight and fast now and that sort of thing is done with of course you shall see her  he left the room and presently i heard the sound of running footsteps the door was opened and mary phillips entered closely followed by the captain i started back i shouted as if i had a speakingtrumpet  to my mouth  what i cried is this your wife  yes said captain guy stepping forward of course she is why not i made no answer but with open arms i rushed upon mary phillips and folded her in a wild embrace i heard a burst of nautical oaths and probably would have been felled by a nautical fist had not mary screamed to her husband  stop guy she cried i understand him its all right hes so glad to see me  i released her from my embrace and staggering back sank upon a chair  go get him a glass of sherry guy she said and wheeling up a great easychair she told me to sit in it for i looked dreadfully tired i took the chair and when the wine was brought i drank it  where is miss nugent i asked  miss nugent is all right said mary phillips but im not going to tell you a word about her or anything else until youve had some breakfast i know you have not tasted food this day  i admitted that i had not i would eat i would do anything so that afterward she would tell me about bertha  when i had a cup of coffee and some toast which mary brought to me upon a tray i arose from my chair  now tell me quickly i said where is bertha  not a bit of it said mary phillipsi call her so for i shall never know her by any other name  sit down again mr rockwell and eat these two eggs when you have done that i will talk to you about her you neednt be in a hurry to go to see her because in the house where she is the people are not up yet  might as well sit down and eat said the captain laughing when youre under command of this skipper  you will find that her orders are orders and the quicker you step up and obey them the better so i would advise you to eat your eggs  i began to do so and captain guy laughed a mighty laugh shes a little thing he said but she does know how to make men stand about i didnt believe there was a person in this world who could have kept my hands off you when i saw you hugging my wife but she did it and i tell you sir i was never worse cut up in my whole life than i was when i saw you do that  sir said i looking at him steadfastly if i have caused you any pain any misery any torment of the soul any anguish of heart any agony of jealousy or mental torture of any kind i am heartily glad of it for all of these things you have brought on me  good cried mary phillips you must be feeling  better sir and when you have entirely finished breakfast we will go on and talk  in a few moments i pushed away the tray and mary looking at it declared herself satisfied and placed it on a side table  so you really supposed sir she said sitting near me that captain chesters married miss nugent  i certainly did i answered  no doubt thinking said mary with a smile that no man in his senses would marry anybody else when miss nugent was about which was a very proper opinion of course considering your state of mind  and let me say sir said captain guy if i had married miss nugent more people than you would have been dissatisfied i would have been one of them and i am sure miss nugent would have been another  count me as one of that party said mary phillips and now mr rockwell you shall not be kept waiting a moment longer  of course she is safe and well i said or you would not be here and before you say anything more about her please tell me what you meant by that terrible word but  but repeated mary phillips with a puzzled expression and captain guy echoed but what but  it was the last word i heard from you said i you shouted it to me when your vessel was going away for the last time it has caused me a world of misery it may have been followed by other words but i did not catch them i asked you if you had told her that i loved her and you answered yes but  captain guy slapped his leg by george he said that was enough to put a man on the rack mary you should have told him more than that  mary phillips wrinkled her forehead and gazed steadfastly into her lap suddenly she looked up  i remember it she said i remember exactly what i answered or tried to answer i said yes but she knew it before  i sprang to my feet what do you mean i cried  of course she knew it she cried we must both have been very stupid if we hadnt known that we knew it before we left new york and for my part i wondered why you didnt tell her but as you never mentioned it of course it wasnt for us to bring up the subject  bertha knew i loved her i ejaculated and whatand howwhat did she say of it what did she think of it  well said mary phillips laughing i could never see that she doubted it i could never see that she objected to it in fact from what she said and being just us two of course she had to say a good many things to me i think she was very glad to find out that you knew it as well as we did  mary phillips i cried where is she tell me this moment  look here said captain guy youre leaving me out of this business altogether this is mrs mary chesters  mr rockwell will be all right when he gets over this flurry said mary to her husband  i acknowledged the correction with a nod for i had no time then for words on the subject  dont get yourself flustered sir said mary you cant go to her yet its too early you must give the family time to come down and have breakfast i am not going to be party to a scene before breakfast nor in the middle of a meal i know the ways and manners of that house and ill send you at exactly the right time  i sat down marymrs  dont bother about names just now she interrupted  i know who youre speaking to  do you believe i continued looking steadfastly at her that bertha nugent loves me  i dont know she said that its exactly my business to give this information but under the circumstances  i take it on myself to say that she most certainly does and i tell you and you may tell her if you like that i would not have said this to you if i hadnt believed this thing ought to be clinched the minute there was a chance to do it its been hanging  off and on long enough love you why bless my soul sir shes been thinking of nothing else for the past two or three days but the coming of the postman  expecting a letter from you not considering that you didnt know where to address her or that it was rather scant time for a letter to come from la guayra where captain stearns would take you if he succeeded in picking you up  the whole affair had a scanty air about it said captain guy at least thats the way i look at it  youve never said anything like that before said mary rather sharply  of course not replied the captain i wanted to keep you as merry and cheerful as i could and besides i didnt say i had thought there was no chance of mr rockwells turning up i only said i considered it a little scantish  love you continued mary phillips i should say so i should have brought her on deck to wave her handkerchief to you and kiss her handperhaps when you blew the state of your feelings through a trumpet but she wasnt strong enough she was a pretty weak woman in body and mind about that time but from the moment i told her and she knew that you not only loved her but were willing to say so she began to mend and how she did talk about you and how she did long that the two ships might come together again she kept asking me what i thought about the condition of your vessel and whether it would be like to sink if a storm came on i could not help thinking that as far as i knew anything  about ships youd be likely to float for weeks after wed gone down but i didnt say that to her and then she began to wonder if you had understood that she had received your message and was glad to get it and i told her over and over and over again that you must have heard me for i screamed my very loudest i am very glad that i didnt know that you only caught those two words  dear girl i ejaculated and did she send me a message on a lifepreserver  you mean to say that you got it cried mary phillips  no said i it floated away from me what was it  i got up that little scheme said mary phillips to quiet her i told her that a letter might be floated to you that way and that anyway it would do no harm to try i dont know what she wrote but she must have said a good deal for she took a long time about it i wrapped it up perfectly watertight she made the flag herself out of one of her own handkerchiefs with her initial in the corner she said she thought you would like that  oh that it had come to me i cried  i wish from the bottom of my soul that it had said mary compassionately it would have done you a lot of good on that lonely ship  instead of which observed captain guy some shark probably swallowed it and little good it did him  it put a lot of affection and consideration into him said mary a little brusquely and there are other creatures connected with the sea who wouldnt be hurt by that sort of thing  theres a shot into me cried the captain dont do it again i cry quarter  i must go i said rising i can wait no longer  well said mary you may not be much too soon if you go slowly  but before i go i said tell me this why did she not send me some word from lisbon why did she not give captain stearns a line on a piece of paper or some message  a line a message exclaimed mary she sent you a note she sent you a dozen messages by captain stearns  and ill wager a months pay said captain guy that he never delivered one of them  he gave me no note i cried  its in the pocket of his peajacket now said captain chesters  he did deliver some messages i said after i questioned him but they were such as these keep up a good heart everythings bound to be right in the end the last to get back gets the heartiest welcome now anybody could have sent such words as those  upon my word cried mary phillips those were the messages i sent i remember particularly the one about the last one back and the heartiest welcome  confound that stearns cried captain guy what did he mean by giving all his attention to you and none to the lady that he was sent for to see  good bye mrs chesters i said taking her by the hand i can never thank you enough for what you have done for her and for me but how you could leave her i really do not understand  well said mary coloring a little i can scarcely understand it myself but that man would have it so and hes terribly obstinate but i dont feel that ive left her shes in the best of hands and i see her nearly every day heres her address and when you meet her mr rockwell youll find that in every way ive told you truly i took a hearty leave of captain guy shook mary by the hand once more rushed down stairs roused the sleeping cabby and glancing at the card ordered him to gallop to 9 ravisdock terrace parmley square  i do not know how i got into the house what i said nor what i asked nor whether the family had had their breakfast or not but the moment my eyes fell upon my beloved bertha i knew that in everything mary phillips had told me truly she came into the room with beaming eyes and both hands extended with outstretched arms i rushed to meet her and folded her to my breast this time there was no one to object for some moments we were speechless with joyful emotion but there was no need of our saying anything no need of statements nor explanations mary phillips had attended to all that  when we had cooled down to the point of speech i was surprised to find that i had been expected that bertha knew i was coming when mary phillips had left me that morning to prepare my breakfast she had sent a message to bertha and then she had detained me until she thought it had been received and bertha was prepared to meet me  i did not want any slips or misses she said when she explained the matter to me afterward i dont want to say anything about your personal appearance mr rockwell but there are plenty of servants in london who if they hadnt had their orders would shut the door in the face of a much less wildeyed person than you were sir that morning  bertha and i were married in london and two weeks afterward we returned to america in the new ship glaucus commanded by captain guy chesters and his wife  our marriage in england instead of america was largely due to the influence of mary phillips who thought it would be much safer and more prudent for us to be married before we again undertook the risks of a seavoyage  nobody knows what may happen on the ocean she said but if youre once fairly married that much is accomplished anyway  our choice of a sailingvessel in which to make the passage was due in a great part to our desire to keep company as long as possible with captain chesters and his wife to whom we truly believed we owed each other  when we reached new york and bertha and i were about to start for the catskill mountains where we proposed to spend the rest of the summer we took leave of captain guy and his wife with warmest expressions  of friendship with plans for meeting again  everything seemed to have turned out in the best possible way  we had each other and mary phillips had some one to manage  we should have been grieved if we had been obliged to leave her without occupation  at the moment of parting i drew her aside mary i said we have had some strange experiences together  and i shall never forget them  nor shall i sir she answered some of them were so harrowing and closeshaved and such heartbreaking  disappointments i never had the worst of all was when you threw that rope clean over our ship without holding on to your end of it i had been dead sure that the rope was going to bring us all together  that was a terrible mishap i answered what did bertha think of it  bless my soul ejaculated mary phillips she wasnt on deck and she never knew anything about it when i am nursing up a love match i dont mention that sort of thing     the baker of barnbury   a christmas story  it was three days before christmas and the baker of the little village of barnbury sat in the room behind his shop he was a short and sturdy baker a good fellow and ordinarily of a jolly demeanor but this day he sat grim in his little back room  christmas indeed he said to himself and what of christmas thank you baker and a merry christmas to you and every one of them goes away with the present of a raisincake or a horse gingercake  if they like that better all this for the good of the trade of course confound the trade im tired of trade is there no good in this world but the good of the trade oh yes theyll say theres christmas and thats goodbut what is the good of it to me say i christmas day is a family day and to a man without a family its no day at all im not even fourth cousin to a soul in the town nobody asks me to a family dinner bake baker they cry that we may eat and love each other confound them i am tired of it what is christmas to me i have a mind to skip it  as he said this a smile broke out on his face skip christmas said he that is a good idea they did not think of me last year this would make them think of me this year  as he said this he opened his orderbook and ran his eye over the names heres orders from every one of them said he from the doctor down to cobbler john all have families all give orders its pastry cake or sweetmeats or its meat or fowl to be baked what a jolly christmas they will have without me orders from all of them every one all sent in good time for fear of being crowded out  here he stopped and ran his eye again over the list  no not all he said the widow monk is not here what is the matter with her i wonder the only person in barnbury who has not ordered either pastry cakes or sweetmeats or fowls or meat to be baked if i skip christmas shell not mind it shell be the only onethe only one in all barnbury ha ha  the baker wanted some fresh air and as this was suppertime for the whole village he locked up his shop and went out for a walk the night was clear and frosty he liked this the air was so different from that in his bakery  he walked to the end of the village and at the last house he stopped  its very odd said he to himself no cakes pastry or sweetmeats not even poultry or meat to be baked ill look in and see about this and he knocked at the door  the widow monk was at supper she was a plump little body bright and cheerful to look upon and not more than thirty  good evening baker said she will you sit down and have a cup of tea  the baker put down his hat unwound his long woollen comforter took off his overcoat and had a cup of tea  now then said he to himself as he put down his cup if shed ask me to dinner i wouldnt skip christmas and the whole village might rise up and bless her  we are like to have a fine christmas he said to her  fine enough for the rest of you she said with a smile but i shall not have any christmas this year  hows that cried the baker no christmas widow monk  not this year baker said she and she poured him another cup of tea you see that horseblanket said she pointing to one thrown over a chair  bless me widow monk cried the baker youre not intending to set up a horse  hardly that she answered with a smile but thats the very last horseblanket that i can get to bind they dont put them on horses but they have them bound with red and use them for door curtains thats all the fashion now and all the barnbury folks who can afford them have sent them to me to be bound with red that one is nearly finished and there are no more to be bound  but havent the barnbury folks any more work for you cried the baker havent they shirts or gowns or some other sort of needling  those things they make themselves answered the widow but this binding is heavy work and they give it to me the blankets are coarse you see but they hang well in the doorway  confound the people of barnbury cried the baker every one of them would hang well in a doorway if i had the doing of it and so you cant afford a christmas widow monk  no said she setting herself to work on her horseblanket not this year when i came to barnbury  baker i thought i might do well but i have not done well  did not your husband leave you anything he asked  my husband was a sailor said she and he went down with his brig the mistletoe three years ago and all that he left me is gone baker  it was time for the baker to open his shop and he went away and as he walked home snowdrops and teardrops were all mixed together on his face  i couldnt do this sort of thing before her he said and i am glad it was time to go and open my shop  that night the baker did all his regular work but not a finger did he put to any christmas order the next day at suppertime he went out for a walk  on the way he said to himself if she is going to skip christmas and i am going to skip christmas why should we not skip it together that would truly be most fit and gladsome and it would serve barnbury aright ill go in and lay it before her  the widow monk was at supper and when she asked him to take a cup of tea he put down his hat unwound his woollen comforter and took off his overcoat when he set down his empty cup he told her that he too had made up his mind to skip christmas and he told her why and then he proposed that they should skip it together  now the widow monk forgot to ask him to take a second cup of tea and she turned as red as the binding  she had put on the horseblankets the baker pushed aside the teacups leaned over the table and pressed his suit very hard  when the time came for him to open his shop she said that she would think about the matter and that he might come again  the next day the sun shone golden the snow shone silvery and barnbury was like a paradise to the good baker for the widow monk had told him he might come again and that was almost the same thing as telling him that he and she would skip christmas together and not a finger so far had he put to any christmas order  about noon of that day he was so happy was that good baker that he went into the village inn to have a taste of something hot in the inn he found a tall man with rings in his ears a sunbrowned man he was and a stranger who had just arrived and wanted his dinner he was also a handsome man and a sailor as any one could see  as the baker entered the tall man said to the innkeeper  is there a mrs monk now living in this village  truly there is said the innkeeper and i will show you her house but youll have your dinner first  aye aye said the stranger for ill not go to her hungry  the baker asked for nothing hot but turned him and went out into the cold bleak world as he closed the door behind him he heard the stranger say  on the brig mistletoe  it was not needed that the baker should hear these words already he knew everything his soul had told him everything in the moment he saw the sunbrowned  man with the rings in his ears  on went the baker his head bowed on his breast the sun shining like tawdry brass the snow glistening like a slimy evil thing he knew not where he was going he knew not what he intended to do but on he went  presently a door opened and he was called  i saw you coming said the widow monk and i did not wish to keep you waiting in the cold and she held open the door for him  when he had entered and had seated himself before  the fire she said to him  truly you look chilled you need something hot and she prepared it for him  the baker took the hot beverage this much of good he might at least allow himself he drank it and he felt warmed  and now said the widow monk seating herself  on the other side of the fireplace i shall speak as plainly to you as you spoke to me you spoke very well yesterday and i have been thinking about it ever since and have made up my mind you are alone in the world and i am alone and if you dont wish to be alone any longer why i dont wish to be either and soperhapsit will not be necessary to skip christmas this year  alas for the poor baker here was paradise seen through a barred gate but the bakers heart was moved even in the midst of his misery he could not but be grateful for the widows words there flashed into his eyes a sudden brightness he held out his hands he would thank her first and tell her  afterwards  the widow took his hands lowered her bright eyes and blushed then she suddenly withdrew herself and stood up  now she said with a pretty smile let me do the talking dont look so downcast when i tell you that you have made me very very happy you should look happy too when you came to me  yesterday and said what you said i thought you were in too much of a hurry but now i think that perhaps you were right and that when people of our age have anything important to do it is well to do it at once for in this world there are all sorts of things continually springing up to prevent people from being happy  the whole body of the baker was filled with a great groan but he denied it utterance he must hear what she would say  and so i was going to suggest she continued that instead of skipping christmas together we keep it together that is all the change i propose to your plan  up sprang the baker so suddenly that he overset his chair now he must speak the widow stepped quickly toward the door and turning with a smile held up her hand  now good friend said she stop there at any moment some one might come in hasten back to your shop at three oclock i will meet you at the parsons that will surely be soon enough even for such a hasty man as you  the baker came forward and gasped your  husband  not yet said the widow with a laugh and  kissing the tips of her fingers to him she closed the door behind her  out into the cold went the baker his head was dazed but he walked steadfastly to his shop there was no need for him to go anywhere to tell anybody anything the man with the earrings would settle matters for himself soon enough  the baker put up his shutters and locked his shop door he would do nothing more for the good of trade nothing more for the good of anything skip christmas indeed would he and moreover every holiday and every happy day would now be skipped straight on for the rest of his life he put his house in order he arranged his affairs he attired himself in his best apparel locked his door behind him and went out into the cold world  he longed now to get far away from the village before the sun set there would not be one soul there who would care for him  as he hurried on he saw before him the parsons house  i will take but one thing away with me he said i will ask the good old man to give me his blessing that will i take with me  of course he is in said the parsons maid there in the parlor  as the baker entered the parsons parlor some one hastened to meet him it was the widow monk  you wicked man she whispered you are a quarter of an hour late the parson is waiting  the parson was a little man with white hair he stepped toward the couple standing together and the widow took the bakers hand then the parson began  the little speech he always made on such occasions it was full of good sense and very touching and the widows eyes were dim with tears the baker would have spoken but he had never interrupted a clergyman and he could not do it now  then the parson began his appointed work and the heart of the baker swelled as the widows hand trembled in his own  wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife asked the parson  now for this quoth the poor baker to himself i may bake forever but i cannot draw back nor keep the good man waiting and he said yes  then it was that the baker received what he had come forthe parsons blessing and immediately his fair companion brimming with tears threw herself  into his arms  now said the baker to himself when i leave this house may the devil take me and right welcome shall he be  dearest she exclaimed as she looked into his face you cannot know how happy i am my wedding  day and my brother back from the cruel seas  struck by a sudden blast of bewildering ecstasy the baker raised his eyes and beheld the tall form of the sunbrowned stranger who had been standing behind them  you are not a sailorman quoth the jovial brother like my old mate who went down in the brig mistletoe but my sister tells me you are a jolly good fellow and i wish you fair winds and paying cargoes and after giving the baker a powerful handshake the sailor kissed the bride the parsons wife the parsons daughter and the parsons maid and wished the family were larger having just returned from the cruel seas  the only people in the village of barnbury who thoroughly enjoyed the christmas of that year were the baker his wife and the sailor brother and a rare good time they had for a big seachest arrived and there were curious presents and a tall flask of rare old wine and plenty of time for three merry people to cook for themselves  the baker told his wife of his soulharrowing plight of the day before  now then said he dont you think that by rights i should bake all the same  oh that will be skipped she said with a laugh and now go you and make ready for the cakes pastry and sweetmeats the baked meats and the poultry with which the people of barnbury are to be made right happy on new years day     the waterdevil   a marine tale  in the village of riprock there was neither tavern nor inn for it was but a small place through which few travellers passed but it could not be said to be without a place of entertainment for if by chance a strangeror two or three of them for that matterwished  to stop at riprock for a meal or to pass the night there was the house of blacksmith fryker which was understood to be always open to decent travellers  the blacksmith was a prominent man in the village and his house was a large one with several spare bedrooms and it was said by those who had had an opportunity of judging that nobody in the village lived better than blacksmith fryker and his family  into the village there came late one autumn afternoon a tall man who was travelling on foot with a small valise hanging from his shoulder he had inquired for lodging for the night had been directed to the blacksmiths house had arranged to stop there had had his supper which greatly satisfied him and was now sitting before the fire in the large livingroom smoking blacksmith frykers biggest pipe  this stranger was a redhaired man with a cheery expression and a pair of quick bright eyes he was slenderly but strongly built and was a good fellow who would stand by with his hands in the pockets of his short peajacket and right willingly tell one who was doing something how the thing ought to be done  but the traveller did not sit alone before the crackling fire of logs for the night being cool a table was drawn near to one side of the fireplace and by this sat mistress fryker and her daughter joanna both engaged in some sort of needlework the blacksmith sat between the corner of the fireplace and this table so that when he had finished smoking his aftersupper pipe he might put on his spectacles and read the weekly paper by the light of the big lamp on the other side of the stranger whose chair was in front of the middle of the fireplace sat the schoolmaster andrew cardly by name a middleaged man of sober and attentive aspect and very glad when chance threw in his way a book he had not read or a stranger who could reinforce his stock of information at the other corner of the fireplace in a cushioned chair which was always given to him when he dropped in to spend an evening with the blacksmith sat mr harberry an elderly man a man of substance and a man in whom all riprock not excluding himself placed unqualified confidence as to his veracity his financial soundness and his deep insight into the causes the influences and the final issue of events and conditions  on a night like this said the stranger stretching his long legs toward the blaze there is nothing i like better than a fire of wood except indeed it be the society of ladies who do not object to a little tobacco smoke and he glanced with a smile toward the table with a lamp upon it  now blacksmith fryker was a prudent man and he did not consider that the privileges of his hearthstonealways  freely granted to a decent strangerincluded an acquaintance with his pretty daughter and so without allowing his womenfolk a chance to enter into the conversation he offered the stranger a different subject to hammer upon  in the lower country said he they dont need fires as early in the season as we do what calling do you follow sir some kind of trade perhaps  no said the traveller i follow no trade i follow  the sea  at this the three men looked at him as also the two women his appearance no more suggested that he was a seaman than the appearance of mr harberry suggested that he was what the village of riprock believed him to be i should not have taken you for a sailor said the blacksmith  i am not a sailor said the other i am a soldier a seasoldierin fact a marine  i should say sir remarked the schoolmaster in a manner intended rather to draw out information than to give it that the position of a soldier on a ship possessed advantages over that of a soldier on land the former is not required to make long marches nor to carry heavy baggage he remains at rest in fact while traversing great distances nor is he called on to resist the charges of cavalry nor to form hollow squares on the deadly battlefield  the stranger smiled we often find it hard enough said he to resist the charges made against us by our officers the hollow squares form themselves in our stomachs when we are on short rations and i have known many a man who would rather walk twenty miles than sail one especially when the sea chops  i am very sure sir said schoolmaster cardly that there is nothing to be said against the endurance and the courage of marines we all remember how they presented arms and went down with the royal george  the marine smiled  i suppose said the blacksmith that you never had to do anything of that sort  the stranger did not immediately answer but sat looking into the fire presently he said i have done things of nearly every sort although not exactly that but i have thought my ship was going down with all on board and thats the next worst thing to going down you know  and how was that inquired fryker  well said the other it happened more times than i can tell you of or even remember yes said he meditatively more times than i can remember  i am sure said the schoolmaster that we should all like to hear some of your experiences  the marine shrugged his shoulders these things said he come to a man and then if he lives through them they pass on and he is ready for the next streak of luck good or bad thats the way with us followers of the sea especially if we happen to be marines and have to bear so to speak the responsibility of two professions but sometimes a mischance or a disaster does fix itself upon a mans mind so that he can tell about it if he is called upon and just now there comes to my mind a very odd thing which once happened to me and i can give you the points of that if you like  the three men assured him that they would very much like it and the two women looked as if they were of the same opinion  before he began the marine glanced about him with a certain goodnatured wistfulness which might have indicated to those who understood the countenances of the seagoing classes a desire to wet his whistle but if this expression were so intended it was thrown away for blacksmith fryker took no spirits himself nor furnished them to anybody else giving up all hope in this direction the marine took a long pull at his pipe and began  it was in the winter of 1878 that i was on the bay of bengal on my way to calcutta and about five hundred miles distant from that city i was not on my own ship but was returning from a leave of absence on an american steamer from san francisco to calcutta where my vessel the united states frigate apache was then lying my leave of absence would expire in three days but although the general brooks the vessel i was aboard of was more of a freight than a passenger vessel and was heavily laden we would have been in port in good time if two days before something had not happened to the machinery i am not a machinist myself and dont know exactly what it was that was out of order but the engine stopped and we had to proceed under sail that sounds like a slow business but the brooks was a clipperbuilt vessel with three masts and a lot of sailssquare sails foreandaft sails jib sails and all that sort of thing i am not a regular sailor myself and dont know the names of all the sails but whatever sails she could have she did have and although she was an iron vessel and heavily freighted she was a good sailer we had a strong steady wind from the south and the captain told me that at the rate we were going he didnt doubt that he would get me aboard my vessel before my leave ran out or at least so soon afterward that it wouldnt make any difference  well as i said the wind blew strong and steady behind us the sails were full and the spray dashed up at our bow in a way calculated to tickle the soul of any one anxious to get to the end of his voyage and i was one of that sort i can tell you  in the afternoon of the second day after our engine stopped i was standing at the bow and looking  over when suddenly i noticed that there wasnt any spray dashing up in front of the vessel i thought we must have struck a sudden calm but glancing up i saw the sails were full and the wind blew fair in my face as i turned toward the stern i walked aft to the skipper and touching my cap i said captain how is it that when a ship is dashing along at this rate she doesnt throw up any spray with her cutwater he grinned a little and said but she does you know if you will come forward said i ill show you that she doesnt and then we walked forward and i showed him that she didnt i never saw a man so surprised at first he thought that somebody had been squirting oil in front but even if that had been the case there would have been some sort of a ripple on each side of the bow and there wasnt anything of the kind the skipper took off his cap and scratched his head then he turned and sang out mr rogers throw the log  now the log said the marine turning to mrs fryker and her daughter is a little piece of wood with a long line to it that they throw out behind a vessel to see how fast she is going i am not a regular jack tar myself and dont understand the principle of the thing but it tells you exactly how many miles an hour the ship is going  in about two minutes mr rogers stepped up with his eyes like two augerholes and said he captain  were makin no knots an hour were not sailing  at all  get out roared the captain dont you see the sails dont you feel the wind throw that log again sir  well they threw the log again the captain saw it done and sure enough mr rogers was right the vessel wasnt moving with a wind that ought to have carried her spinning along miles and miles in an hour she was standing stockstill the skipper here let out one of the strongest imprecations used in navigation and said he mr rogers is it possible that there is a sandbar in the middle of the bay of bengal and that weve stuck on it cast the lead  i will just state to the ladies said the marine turning toward the table that the lead is a heavy weight that is lowered to the bottom of a body of water to see how deep it is and this operation is called sounding well they sounded and they sounded but everywherefore aft and midshipthey found plenty of water in fact not having a line for deepsea sounding they couldnt touch bottom at all  i can tell you ladies and gentlemen said the marine looking from one to the other of the party that things now began to feel creepy i am not afraid of storms nor fires at sea nor any of the common accidents of the ocean but for a ship to stand still with plenty of water under her and a strong wind filling her sails has more of the uncanny about it than i fancy pretty near the whole of the crew was on deck by this time and i could see that they felt very much as i did but nobody seemed to know what to say about it  suddenly the captain thought that some unknown current was setting against us and forcing the vessel back with the same power that the wind was forcing her forward and he tried to put the ship about so as to have the wind on her starboard quarter but as she hadnt any headway or for some other reason this didnt work then it struck him that perhaps one of the anchors had been accidentally dropped but they were all in their places and if one of them had dropped its cable would not have been long enough to touch bottom  now i could see that he began to look scared mr browser said he to the chief engineer for some reason or other this ship does not make headway under sail you must go to work and get the engine running and for the rest of that day everybody on board who understood that sort of thing was down below hard at work with the machinery hammering and banging like good fellows  the chief officer ordered a good many of the sails to be taken in for they were only uselessly straining the masts but there were enough left to move her in case the power of the current or whatever it was that stopped her had slackened and she steadily kept her position with the breeze abaft  all the crew who were not working below were crowded together on deck talking about this strange thing i joined them and soon found that they thought it was useless to waste time and labor on the machinery they didnt believe it could be mended and if it should be how could an engine move a vessel that the wind couldnt stir  these men were of many nationalitiesdutch scandinavian spanish italian south american and a lot more like many other american vessels that sail from our ports nearly all the officers and crew were foreigners the captain was a finlander who spoke very good english and the only man who called himself an american was the chief officer and he was only half a one for he was born in germany came to the united states when he was twenty years old stayed there five years which didnt count either way and had now been naturalized for twenty years  the consequence of this variety in nationality was that the men had all sorts of ideas and notions regarding the thing that was happening they had thrown over chips and bits of paper to see if the vessel  had begun to move and had found that she didnt budge an inch and now they seemed afraid to look over the sides  they were a superstitious lot as might be expected  and they all believed that in some way or other the ship was bewitched and in fact i felt like agreeing with them although i did not say so  there was an old portuguese sailor on board an uglylooking weatherbeaten little fellow and when he had listened to everything the others had to say he shuffled himself into the middle of the group look here mates said he in good enough english its no use talking no more about this i know whats the matter ive sailed these seas afore and ive been along the coast of this bay all the way from negapatam to jellasore on the west coast and from chittagong to kraw on the other and i have heard stories of the strange things that are in this bay of bengal and what they do and the worst of them all is the waterdeviland hes got us  when the old rascal said this there wasnt a man on deck who didnt look pale in spite of his dirt and his sunburn the chief officer tried to keep his knees stiff but i could see him shaking whats a waterdevil  said he trying to make believe he thought it all stuff and nonsense the portuguese touched his forelock do you remember sir said he what was the latitude and longitude when you took your observation  today yes said the other it was 15° north and 90° east the portuguese nodded his head thats just about the spot sir just about i cant say exactly where the spot is but its just about here and weve struck it there isnt a native seaman  on any of these coasts that would sail over that point if he knowed it and could help it for thats the spot where the waterdevil lives  it made me jump to hear the grunt that went through that crowd when he said this but nobody asked any questions and he went on this here waterdevil said he is about as big as six whales and in shape very like an oyster without its shell and he fastens himself to the rocks at the bottom with a million claws right out of the middle of him there grows up a long arm that reaches to the top of the water and at the end of this arm is a fist about the size of a yawlboat with fiftytwo fingers to it with each one of them covered with little suckers that will stick fast to anythingiron wood stone or flesh all that this waterdevil gets to eat is what happens to come swimmin or sailin along where he can reach it and it doesnt matter to him whether its a shark or a porpoise or a shipful of people and when he takes a grab of anything that thing never gets away  about this time there were five or six men on their knees saying their prayers such as they were and a good many others looked as if they were just about to drop  now when this waterdevil gets hold of a ship the old fellow went on he dont generally pull her straight down to the bottom but holds on to it till he counts his claws and sees that they are all fastened to the rocks for if a good many of them wasnt  fastened he might pull himself loose instead of pulling the ship down and then hed be a goner for hed be towed away and like as not put in a museum but when he is satisfied that he is moored fast and strong then he hauls on his arm and down comes the ship no matter how big she is as the ship is sinkin he turns her over every now and then keel uppermost and gives her a shake and when the people drop out he sucks them into a sort of funnel which is his mouth  does he count fast asked one of the men this being the first question that had been asked  ive heard said the portuguese that hes a rapid calculator and the minute hes got to his millionth  claw and finds its hooked tight and fast he begins to haul down the ship  at this point the marine stopped and glanced around at the little group the blacksmiths wife and daughter had put down their work and were gazing at him with an air of horrified curiosity the blacksmith held his pipe in his hand and regarded the narrator with the steadiness and impassiveness of an anvil the schoolmaster was listening with the greatest eagerness he was an enthusiast on natural history and mythology and had written an article for a weekly paper on the reconciliation of the beasts of tradition with the fauna of today mr harberry was not looking at the marine his eyes were fixed upon the schoolmaster  mr cardly said he did you ever read of an animal like that  i cannot say that i have was his reply but it is certain that there are many strange creatures especially in the sea of which scientists are comparatively  ignorant  such as the seaserpent added the marine quickly and a great many other monsters who are not in the books but who have a good time at the bottom of the sea all the same well to go on with my story you must understand that though this portuguese spoke broken english which i havent tried to give you he made himself perfectly plain to all of us and i can assure you that when he got through talking there was a shaky lot of men on that deck  the chief officer said he would go below and see how the captain was getting on and the crew huddled together in the bow and began whispering among themselves as if they were afraid the waterdevil would hear them i turned to walk aft feeling pretty queer i can tell you when i saw miss minturn just coming up from the cabin below  i havent said anything about miss minturn but she and her father who was an elderly english gentleman  and an invalid who had never left his berth since we took him up at singapore were our only passengers except of course myself she was a beautiful girl with soft blue eyes and golden hair and a little pale from constantly staying below to nurse her father  of course i had had little or nothing to say to her for her father was a good deal of a swell and i was only a marine but now she saw me standing there by myself and she came right up to me can you tell me sir she said if anything else has happened they are making a great din in the engineroom i have been looking out of our port and the vessel seems to me to be stationary she stopped at that and waited to hear what i had to say but i assure you i would have liked to have had her go on talking for half an hour her voice was rich and sweet like that of so many englishwomen although i am happy to say a great many of my countrywomen have just as good voices and when i meet any of them for the first time i generally give them the credit of talking in soft and musical notes even though i have not had the pleasure of hearing them speak  look here said the blacksmith cant you skip the girl and get back to the devil  no said the marine i couldnt do that the two are mixed together so to speak so that i have to tell you of both of them  you dont mean to say exclaimed mrs fryker speaking for the first time and by no means in soft and musical tones that he swallowed her  ill go on with the story said the marine thats the best way and everything will come up in its place now of course i wasnt going to tell this charming young woman with a sick father anything about the waterdevil though what reason to give her for our standing still here i couldnt imagine but of course i had to speak and i said dont be alarmed miss we have met with an unavoidable detention that sort of thing often happens in navigation i cant explain it to you but you see the ship is perfectly safe and sound and she is merely under sail instead of having her engines going  i understood about that said she and father and i were both perfectly satisfied for he said that if we had a good breeze we would not be long in reaching  calcutta but we seem to have a breeze and yet we dont go youll notice said i that the sails are not all set and for some reason the wind does not serve when the engines are mended we shall probably  go spinning along she looked as if she was trying to appear satisfied thank you sir she said i hope we may shortly proceed on our way but in the meantime i shall not say anything to my father about this detention i think he has not noticed it that would be very wise i replied and as she turned toward the companionway i was wild to say to her that it would be a lot better for her to stay on deck and get some good fresh air instead of cooping herself up in that close cabin but i didnt know her well enough for that  now that you are through with the girl said the blacksmith what did the devil do  i havent got to him yet said the marine but after miss minturn went below i began to think of him and the more i thought of him the less i liked him i think the chief officer must have told the men below about the waterdevil for pretty soon the whole kit and boodle of them left their work and came on deck skipper and all they told me they had given up the engine as a bad job and i thought to myself that most likely they were all too nervous to rightly know what they were about the captain threw out the log again but it floated alongside like a cork on a fishingline and at this he turned pale and walked away from the ships side forgetting to pull it in again  it was now beginning to grow dark and as nobody seemed to think about supper i went below to look into that matter it wouldnt do for miss minturn and her father to go without their regular meal for that would be sure to scare them to death and if im to have a big scare i like to take it on a good square meal so i went below to see about it but i wasnt needed for miss minturns maid who was an elderly woman and pretty sharp set in her temper was in the cooks galley superintending supper for her people and after she got through i superintended some for myself  after that i felt a good deal bolder and i lighted a pipe and went on deck there i found the whole ships company officers and crew none of them doing anything and most of them clustered together in little groups whispering or grunting  i went up to the captain and asked him what he was going to do next do said he there is nothing to do ive done everything that i can do im all upset i dont know whether i am myself or some other man and then he walked away  i sat there and smoked and looked at them and i can tell you the sight wasnt cheerful there was the ship just as good and sound as far as anybody could see as anything that floated on the ocean and here were all her people shivering and shaking and not speaking above their breath looking for all the world under the light of the stars and the ships lamps which some of them had had sense enough to light as if they expected in the course of the next halfhour to be made to walk the plank and to tell the truth what they were afraid of would come to pretty much the same thing  mr cardly here interrupted mr harberry how long does it take to count a million  that depends said the schoolmaster on the rapidity of the calculator some calculators count faster than others an ordinary boy counting two hundred a minute would require nearly three days and a half to count a million  very good said mr harberry please go on with your story sir  of course said the marine there is a great difference between a boy and a waterdevil and it is impossible  for anybody to know how fast the latter can count especially  as he may be supposed to be used to it well i couldnt stand  it any longer on deck and having nothing else to do i turned  in and went to sleep  to sleep went to sleep exclaimed mrs fryker i dont see how you could have done that  ah madam said the marine we soldiers of the sea are exposed to all sorts of dangerscombination dangers you might call themand in the course of time we get used to it if we didnt we couldnt do our duty  as the ship had been in its present predicament for six or seven hours and nothing had happened there was no reason to suppose that things would not remain as they were for six or seven hours more in which time i might get a good sleep and be better prepared for what might come theres nothing like a good meal and a good sleep as a preparation for danger  it was daylight when i awakened and rapidly glancing about me i saw that everything appeared to be all right looking out of the porthole i could see that the vessel was still motionless i hurried on deck and was greatly surprised to find nobody thereno  one on watch no one at the wheel no one anywhere i ran down into the focastle which is the sailors quarters but not a soul could i see i called i whistled i searched everywhere but no one answered i could find no one then i dashed up on deck and glared around me every boat was gone  now i knew what had happened the cowardly rascals from captain to cook had deserted the ship in the night and i had been left behind  for some minutes i stood motionless wondering how men could be so unfeeling as to do such a thing i soon became convinced from what i had seen of the crew that they had not all gone off together that there had been no concerted action a number of them had probably quietly lowered a boat and sneaked away then another lot had gone off hoping their mates would not hear them and therefore crowd into their boat and so they had all departed not one boatload thinking of anybody but themselves or if they thought at all about others quieting their consciences  by supposing that there were enough boats on the vessel and that the other people were as likely to get off as they were  suddenly i thought of the other passengers had they been left behind i ran down below and i had scarcely reached the bottom of the steps when i met miss minturns maid it seems to me she said sharply that the people on this ship are neglecting their duty theres nobody in the kitchen and i want some gruel my good woman said i who do you want it for who she replied why for mr minturn of course and miss minturn may like some too  then i knew that all the passengers had been left behind  if you want any gruel said i you will have to go into the galley and make it yourself and then in a low tone i told her what had happened for i knew that it would be much better for me to do this than for her to find it out for herself without a word she sat right down on the floor and covered her head with her apron now dont make a row said i and frighten your master and mistress to death were all right so far and all youve got to do is to take care of mr and miss minturn and cook their meals the steamer is tight and sound and it cant be long before some sort of a craft will come by and take us off i left her sniffling with her apron over her head but when i came back ten minutes afterward she was in the galley making gruel  i dont think you will be surprised my friends continued the marine when i tell you that i now found myself in a terrible state of mind of course i hadnt felt very jovial since the steamer had been so wonderfully stopped but when the captain and all the crew were aboard i had that sort of confidence which comes from believing that when there are people about whose duty it is to do things when the time comes to do the things they will do them but now practically speaking there was nobody but me the others on board were not to be counted except as encumbrances in truth i was alonealone with the waterdevil  the moment i found no one to depend upon but myself and that i was deserted in the midst of this lonely mass of water in that moment did my belief in the waterdevil begin to grow when i first heard of the creature i didnt consider that it was my business either to believe in it or not to believe in it and i could let the whole thing drop out of my mind if i chose but now it was a different matter i was bound to think for myself and the more i thought the more i believed in the waterdevil  the fact was there wasnt anything else to believe in i had gone over the whole question and the skipper  had gone all over it and everybody else had gone all over it and no one could think of anything but a waterdevil that could stop a steamer in this way in the middle of the bay of bengal and hold her there hour after hour in spite of wind and wave and tide it could not be anything but the monster the portuguese  had told us of and all i now could do was to wonder whether when he was done counting his million  claws he would be able to pull down a vessel of a thousand tons for that was about the size of the general brooks  i think i should now have begun to lose my wits if it had not been for one thing and that was the coming of miss minturn on deck the moment i saw her lovely face i stiffened up wonderfully sir said she i would like to see the captain i am representing  the captain miss i said with a bow what is it that i can do for you i want to speak to him about the steward she said i think he is neglecting his duty i also represent the steward i replied tell me what you wish of him she made no answer to this but looked about her in a startled way where are all the men she said miss minturn said i i represent the crewin fact i represent the whole ships company except the cook and his place must be taken by your maid what do you mean she asked looking at me with her wideopened beautiful eyes  then as there was no help for it i told her everything  except that i did not mention the waterdevil in connection with our marvellous stoppage i only said that that was caused by something which nobody understood  she did not sit down and cover her head nor did she scream or faint she turned pale but looked steadily at me and her voice did not shake as she asked me what was to be done there is nothing to be done i answered but to keep up good hearts eat three meals a day and wait until a ship comes along and takes us off  she stood silent for about three minutes i think she then said that i will not yet tell my father what has happened and she went below  now strange to say i walked up and down the deck with my hat cocked on one side and my hands in my pockets feeling a great deal better i did not like waterdevils any more than i did before and i did not believe in this one any less than i did before but after all there was some good about him it seems odd but the arm of this submarine monster over a mile long for all that i knew was a bond of union between the lovely miss minturn and me she was a lady i was a marine so far as i knew anything about bonds of union there wasnt one that could have tackled itself to us two except this long slippery arm of the waterdevil with one end in the monstrous flob at the bottom and the other fast to our ship  there was no doubt about it if it hadnt been for that waterdevil she would have been no more to me than the queen of madagascar was but under the circumstances if i wasnt everything to her who could be anythingthat is if one looked at the matter  from a practical point of view  the blacksmith made a little movement of impatience suppose you cut all that said he i dont care about the bond of union i want to know what happened to the ship  it is likely said the marine if i could have cut the bond of union that i spoke of that is to say the waterdevils arm that i would have done it hoping that i might safely float off somewhere with miss minturn but i couldnt cut it then and i cant cut it now that bond is part of my story and it must all go on together  i now set myself to work to do what i thought ought to be done under the circumstances but of course that wasnt very much i hoisted a flag upside down and after considering the matter i concluded to take in all the sails that had been set i thought that a steamer without smoke coming from her funnel and no sails set would be more likely to attract attention from distant vessels than if she appeared to be under sail  i am not a regular sailor as i said before but i got out on the yard and cut the square sail loose and let it drop on the deck and i let the jib come down on a run and managed to bundle it up some way on the bowsprit this sort of thing took all the nautical gymnastics that i was master of and entirely occupied my mind so that i found myself whistling while i worked i hoped miss minturn heard me whistle because it would not only give her courage but would let her see that i was not a man who couldnt keep up his spirits in a case like this  when that work was over i began to wonder what i should do next and then an idea struck me suppose thought i that we are not stationary but that we are in some queer kind of a current and that the water ship and all are steadily moving on together so that after awhile we shall come in sight of land or into the track of vessels  i instantly set about to find out if this was the case it was about noon and it so happened that on the day before when the chief officer took his observation i was seized with a desire to watch him and see how he did it i dont see why i should have had this notion but i had it and i paid the strictest attention to the whole business calculation part and all and i found out exactly how it was done  well then i went and got the quadrantthats the thing they do it withand i took an observation and i found that we were in latitude 15° north 90° east exactly where we had been twentyfour hours before  when i found out this i turned so faint that i wanted to sit down and cover up my head the waterdevil had us there was no mistake about it and no use trying to think of anything else i staggered  along the deck went below and cooked myself a meal in a case like this theres nothing like a square meal to keep a man up  i know you dont like to hear her mentioned said the marine turning to the blacksmith but i am bound to say that in course of the afternoon miss minturn came on deck several times to ask if anything new had happened and if i had seen a vessel i showed her all that i had done and told her i was going to hang out lights at night and did everything i could to keep her on deck as long as possible for it was easy to see that she needed fresh air and i needed company as long as i was talking to her i didnt care a snap of my finger for the waterdevil it is queer what an influence a beautiful woman has on a man but its so and theres no use arguing about it she said she had been puzzling her brains to find out what had stopped us and she supposed it must be that we had run onto a shallow place and stuck fast in the mud but thought it wonderful that there should be such a place so far from land i agreed with her that it was wonderful and added that that was probably  the reason the captain and the crew had been seized with a panic but sensible people like herself and her father i said ought not to be troubled by such an occurrence especially as the vessel remained in a perfectly sound condition  she said that her father was busily engaged in writing his memoirs and that his mind was so occupied  he had not concerned himself at all about our situation that is if he had noticed that we were not moving if he wants to see the steward or anybody else i said please call upon me you know i represent the whole ships company and i shall be delighted to do anything for him or for you she thanked me very much and went below  she came up again after this but her maid came with her and the two walked on deck for a while i didnt have much to say to them that time but just before dark miss minturn came on deck alone and walked forward where i happened to be sir said she and her voice trembled a little as she spoke if anything should happen will you promise me that you will try to save my father you cant imagine how these touching words from this beautiful woman affected me my dear lady said i and i hope she did not take offence at the warmth of my expression i dont see how anything can happen but i promise you on the word of a seasoldier that if danger should come upon us i will save not only your father but yourself and your maid trust me for that  the look she gave me when i said these words and especially the flash of her eye when i spoke of my being a seasoldier made me feel strong enough to tear that seamonsters arm in twain and to sail away with the lovely creature for whom my heart was beginning to throb  its a pity said the blacksmith that you hadnt jumped into the water while the fit was on you and done the tearing  a man often feels strong enough to do a thing said the marine and yet doesnt care to try to do it and that was my case at that time but i vowed to myself that if the time came when there was any saving to be done id attend to miss minturn even if i had to neglect the rest of the family  she didnt make any answer but she gave me her hand and she couldnt have done anything i liked better than that i held it as long as i could which wasnt very long and then she went down to her father  glad of it said the blacksmith  when i had had my supper and had smoked my pipe and everything was still and i knew i shouldnt see anybody any more that night i began to have the quakes and the shakes if even i had had the maid to talk to it would have been a comfort but in the way of faithfully attending to her employers that woman was a trump she cooked for them and did for them and stuck by them straight along so she hadnt any time for chats with me  being alone i couldnt help all the time thinking about the waterdevil and although it seems a foolish thing now that i look back on it i set to work to calculate how long it would take him to count his feet i made it about the same time as you did sir nodding to the schoolmaster only i considered that if he counted twelve hours and slept and rested twelve hours that would make it seven days which would give me a good long time with miss minturn and that would be the greatest of joys to me no matter what happened afterward  but then nobody could be certain that the monster  at the bottom of the bay needed rest or sleep he might be able to count without stopping and how did i know that he couldnt check off four hundred claws a minute if that happened to be the case our time must be nearly up  when that idea came into my head i jumped up and began to walk about what could i do i certainly  ought to be ready to do something when the time came i thought of getting lifepreservers and strapping one on each of us so that if the waterdevil turned over the vessel and shook us out we shouldnt sink down to him but would float on the surface  but then the thought struck me that if he should find the vessel empty of live creatures and should see us floating around on the top all he had to do was to let go of the ship and grab us one at a time when i thought of a fist as big as a yawlboat clapping its fiftytwo fingers on me it sent a shiver through my bones the fact was there wasnt anything to do and so after a while i managed to get asleep which was a great comfort  mr cardly said mr harberry to the schoolmaster  what reason can you assign why a seamonster  such as has been described to us should neglect to seize upon several small boats filled with men who were escaping from a vessel which it held in custody  i do not precisely see answered mr cardly why these men should have been allowed this immunity  but i  oh that is easily explained interrupted the marine for of course the waterdevil could not know that a lot more people were not left in the ship and if he let go his hold on her to try and grab a boat that was moving as fast as men could row it the steamer might get out of his reach and he mightnt have another chance for a hundred years to make fast to a vessel no sir a creature like that isnt apt to take any wild chances when hes got hold of a really good thing anyway we were held tight and fast for at twelve oclock the next day i took another observation and there we were in the same latitude and longitude that we had been in for two days i took the captains glass and i looked all over the water of that bay which as i think i have said before was all the same as the ocean being somewhere  about a thousand miles wide not a sail not a puff of smoke could i see it must have been a slack season for navigation or else we were out of the common track of vessels i had never known that the bay of bengal was so desperately lonely  it seems unnatural and i can hardly believe it when i look back on it but its a fact that i was beginning to get used to the situation we had plenty to eat the weather was finein fact there was now only breeze enough to make things cool and comfortable i was headman on that vessel and miss minturn might come on deck at any moment and as long as i could forget that there was a waterdevil fastened to the bottom of the vessel there was no reason why i should not be perfectly satisfied with things as they were and if things had stayed as they were for two or three months i should have been right well pleased especially since miss minturns  maid by order of her mistress had begun to cook my meals which she did in a manner truly firstclass i believed then and i stand to it now that there is do better proof of a womans good feeling toward a man than for her to show an interest in his meals thats the sort of sympathy that comes home to a man and tells on him body and soul  as the marine made this remark he glanced at the blacksmiths daughter but that young lady had taken up her sewing and appeared to be giving it her earnest attention he then went on with his story  but things did not remain as they were the next morning about half an hour after breakfast i was walking up and down the upper deck smoking my pipe and wondering when miss minturn would be coming up to talk to me about the state of affairs when suddenly i felt the deck beneath me move with a quick sharp jerk something like i imagine a small shock of an earthquake  never in all my life did the blood run so cold in my veins my legs trembled so that i could scarcely stand i knew what had happenedthe waterdevil had begun to haul upon the ship  i was in such a state of collapse that i did not seem to have any power over my muscles but for all that i heard miss minturns voice at the foot of the companionway and knew that she was coming on deck in spite of the dreadful awfulness of that moment i felt it would never do for her to see me in the condition i was in and so shuffling and halftumbling i got forward went below and made my way to the stewards room where i had already discovered some spirits and i took a good dram for although i am not by any means an habitual drinker being principled  against that sort of thing there are times when a man needs the support of some good brandy or whiskey  in a few minutes i felt more like myself and went on deck and there was miss minturn halfscared  to death what is the meaning of that shock she said have we struck anything my dear lady said i with as cheerful a front as i could put on i do not think we have struck anything there is nothing to strike she looked at me for a moment like an angel ready to cry and clasping her hands she said oh tell me sir i pray you sir tell me what has happened my father felt that shock he sent me to inquire about it his mind is disturbed  at that moment before i could make an answer there was another jerk of the ship and we both went down on our knees and i felt as if i had been tripped i was up in a moment however but she continued on her knees i am sure she was praying  but very soon up she sprang oh what is it what is it she cried i must go to my father  i cannot tell you said i i do not know but dont be frightened how can such a little shock hurt so big a ship  it was all very well to tell her not to be frightened but when she ran below she left on deck about as frightened a man as ever stood in shoes there could be no doubt about it that horrible beast was beginning to pull upon the ship whether or not it would be able to draw us down below was a question which must soon be solved  i had had a small opinion of the maid who when i told her the crew had deserted the ship had sat down and covered her head but now i did pretty much the same thing i crouched on the deck and pulled my cap over my eyes i felt that i did not wish to see hear or feel anything  i had sat in this way for about half an hour and had felt no more shocks when a slight gurgling sound came to my ears i listened for a moment then sprang to my feet could we be moving i ran to the side of the ship the gurgle seemed to be coming  from the stern i hurried there and looked over the wheel had been lashed fast and the rudder stood straight out behind us on each side of it there was a ripple in the quiet water we were moving and we were moving backward  overpowered by horrible fascination i stood grasping the rail and looking over at the water beneath  me as the vessel moved slowly and steadily onward stern foremost in spite of the upset condition  of my mind i could not help wondering why the vessel should move in this way  there was only one explanation possible the waterdevil was walking along the bottom and towing  us after him why he should pull us along in this way i could not imagine unless he was making for his home in some dreadful cave at the bottom into which he would sink dragging us down after him  while my mind was occupied with these horrible subjects some one touched me on the arm and turning  i saw miss minturn are we not moving she said yes i answered we certainly are do you not think she then asked that we may have been struck by a powerful current which is now carrying  us onward i did not believe this for there was no reason to suppose that there were currents which wandered about starting off vessels with a jerk but i was glad to think that this idea had come into her head and said that it was possible that this might be the case and now we are going somewhere she said speaking almost cheerfully yes we are i answered and i had to try hard not to groan as i said the words and where do you think we are going she asked it was altogether out of my power to tell that sweet creature that in my private opinion she at least was going to heaven and so i answered that i really did not know well she said if we keep moving were bound at last to get near land or to some place where ships would pass near us  there is nothing in this world said the marine which does a man so much good in time of danger as to see a hopeful spirit in a womanthat is a woman that he cares about some of her courage comes to him and he is better and stronger for having her alongside of him  having made this remark the speaker again glanced at the blacksmiths daughter she had put down her work and was looking at him with an earnest brightness  in her eyes  yes he continued it is astonishing what a change came over me as i stood by the side of that noble girl she was a born lady i was a marine just the same as we had been before but there didnt seem to be the difference between us that there had been her words her spirits everything about her in fact seemed to act on me to elevate me to fill my soul with noble sentiments to make another man of me standing there beside her i felt myself her equal in life or death i would not be ashamed to say here i am ready to stand by you whatever happens  having concluded this sentiment the marine again glanced toward the blacksmiths daughter her eyes were slightly moist and her face was glowing with a certain enthusiasm  look here said the blacksmith i suppose that woman goes along with you into the very maw of the sunken devil but i do wish you could take her more for granted and get on faster with the real part of the story  one part is as real as another said the marine but on we go and on we did go for the whole of the rest of that day at the rate of about half a knot an hour as near as i could guess at it the weather changed and a dirty sort of fog came down on us so that we couldnt see far in any direction  why that waterdevil should keep on towing us and where he was going to take us were things i didnt dare to think about the fog did not prevent me from seeing the water about our stern and i leaned over the rail watching the ripples that flowed on each side of the rudder which showed that we were still going at about the same uniform rate  but toward evening the gurgling beneath me ceased and i could see that the rudder no longer parted the quiet water and that we had ceased to move a flash of hope blazed up within me had the waterdevil found the ship too heavy a load and had he given up the attempt to drag it to its underocean  cave i went below and had my supper i was almost a happy man when miss minturn came to ask me how we were getting along i told her that i thought we were doing very well indeed i did not mention that we had ceased to move for she thought that a favorable symptom she went back to her quarters greatly cheered up not so much i think from my words as from my joyful aspect for i did feel jolly there was no doubt about it if that waterdevil  had let go of us i was willing to take all the other chances that might befall a ship floating about loose on the bay of bengal  the fog was so thick that night that it was damp and unpleasant on deck and so having hung out and lighted a couple of lanterns i went below for a comfortable  smoke in the captains room i was puffing away here at my ease with my mind filled with happy thoughts of two or three weeks with miss minturn on this floating paradise where she was bound to see a good deal of me and couldnt help liking me better and depending on me more and more every day when i felt a little jerking shock it was the same thing that we had felt before the waterdevil still had hold of us  i dropped my pipe my chin fell upon my breast i shivered all over in a few moments i heard the maid calling to me and then she ran into the room miss minturn wants to know sir she said if you think that shock is a sudden twist in the current which is carrying us on i straightened myself up as well as i could and in the dim light i do not think she noticed my condition i answered that i thought it was something of that sort and she went away  more likely a twist of the devils arm i thought as i sat there alone in my misery  in ten or fifteen minutes there came two shocks not very far apart this showed that the creature beneath us was at work in some way or another perhaps  he had reached the opening of his den and was shortening up his arm before he plunged down into it with us after him i couldnt stay any longer in that room alone i looked for the maid but she had put out the galley light and had probably turned in for the night  i went up and looked out on deck but everything was horribly dark and sticky and miserable there i noticed that my lanterns were not burning and then i remembered that i had not filled them but this did not trouble me if a vessel came along and saw our lights she would probably keep away from us and i would have been glad to have a vessel come to us even if she ran into us our steamer would probably float long enough for us to get on board the other one and almost anything would be better than being left alone in this dreadful place at the mercy of the waterdevil  before i left the deck i felt another shock this took out of me whatever starch was left and i shuffled below and got to my bunk where i tumbled in and covered myself up head and all if there had been any man to talk to it would have been different but i dont know when i ever felt more deserted than i did at that time  i tried to forget the awful situation in which i was i tried to think of other things to imagine that i was drilling with the rest of my company with tom rogers on one side of me and old humphrey peters on the other you may say perhaps that this wasnt exactly the way of carrying out my promise of taking care of miss minturn and the others but what was there to do when the time came to do anything and i could see what to do i was ready to do it but there was no use of waking them up now and setting their minds on edge when they were all comfortable in their beds thinking that every jerk of the devils arm was a little twist in the current that was carrying them to calcutta or some other desirable port  i felt some shocks after i got into bed but whether or not there were many in the night i dont know for i went to sleep it was daylight when i awoke and jumping out of my bunk i dashed on deck everything seemed pretty much as it had been and the fog was as thick as ever i ran to the stern and looked over and i could scarcely believe my eyes when i saw that we were moving again still stern foremost but a little faster than before that beastly waterdevil had taken a rest for the night and had probably given us the shocks by turning over in his sleep and now he was off again making up for lost time  pretty soon miss minturn came on deck and bade me good morning and then she went and looked over the stern we are still moving on she said with a smile and the fog doesnt seem to make any difference it surely cannot be long before we get somewhere  no miss said i it cannot be very long you look tired she said and i dont wonder for you must feel the heavy responsibility on you i have told my maid to prepare breakfast for you in our cabin i want my father to know you and i think it is a shame that you the only protector that we have should be shut off so much by yourself so after this we shall eat together after this i groaned to myself  we shall be eaten together at that moment i did not feel that i wanted to breakfast with miss minturn  mr cardly said mr harberry to the schoolmaster  have you ever read in any of your scientific books that the bay of bengal is subject to heavy fogs that last day after day  i cannot say answered the schoolmaster that my researches into the geographical distribution of fogs have resulted  as to fogs interrupted the marine you cant get rid of them you know if you had been in the habit of going to sea you would know that you are likely to run into a fog at any time and in any weather and as to lasting they are just as likely to last for days as for hours it wasnt the fog that surprised me i did not consider that of any account at all i had enough other things to occupy my mind and having settled this little matter he went on with his story  well my friends i did not breakfast with miss minturn and her father before that meal was ready and while i was standing alone at the stern i saw coming out of the water a long way off in the fog which must have been growing thinner about this time a dark and mysterious object apparently without  any shape or form this sight made the teeth chatter in my head i had expected to be pulled down to the waterdevil but i had never imagined that he would come up to us  while my eyes were glued upon this apparition i could see that we were approaching it when i perceived this i shut my eyes and turned my backi  could look upon it no longer my mind seemed to forsake me i did not even try to call out and give the alarm to the others why should i what could they do  if it had been me said mrs fryker in a sort of gasping whisper i should have died right there the marine turned his eyes in the direction of the blacksmiths daughter she was engaged with her work and was not looking at him  i cannot say he continued that had miss minturn been there at that moment that i would not have declared that i was ready to die for her or with her but there was no need of trying to keep up her courage that was all right she knew nothing of our danger that terrible knowledge pressed on me alone is it wonderful that a human soul should sink a little under such an awful load without turning to observe the effect of these last words the marine went on suddenly i heard behind me a most dreadful sound good heavens i exclaimed can a waterdevil bray  the sound was repeated without knowing what i did i turned i heard what sounded like words i saw in the fog the stern of a vessel with a man above it shouting to me through a speakingtrumpet  i do not know what happened next my mind must have become confused when i regained my senses miss minturn old mr minturn and the maid were standing by me the man had stopped shouting from his trumpet and a boat was being lowered from the other ship in about ten minutes there were halfadozen  men on board of us all in the uniform of the british navy i was stiff enough now and felt myself  from top to toe a regular marine in the service of my country i stepped up to the officer in command and touched my cap  he looked at me and my companions in surprise and then glancing along the deck said what has happened to this vessel who is in command i informed him that strictly speaking no one was in command but that i represented the captain officers and crew of this steamer the general brooks from san francisco to calcutta and i then proceeded to tell him the whole story of our misfortunes and concluded  by telling the officer that if we had not moved since his vessel had come in sight it was probably because the waterdevil had let go of us and was preparing  to make fast to the other ship and therefore it would be advisable for us all to get on board his vessel and steam away as quickly as possible  the englishmen looked at me in amazement drunk ejaculated the officer i had addressed cracked i should say suggested another now spoke up mr minturn i do not understand what i have just heard he said what is a waterdevil i am astounded you never said a word of this to me exclaimed miss minturn you never told me that we were in the grasp of a waterdevil and that that was the reason the captain and the crew ran away no said i i never divulged the dreadful danger we were in i allowed you to believe that we were in the influence of a current and that the shocks we felt were the sudden twists of that current the terrible truth i kept to myself not for worlds would i have made known to a tenderly nurtured lady to her invalid father and devoted servant what might have crushed their souls driven them to the borders of frenzy in which case the relief which now has come to us would have been of no avail  the officer stood and steadily stared at me i declare he said you do not look like a crazy man at what time did this waterdevil begin to take you in tow  yesterday morning i answered and he stopped during last night he asked i replied that that was the case then he took off his cap rubbed his head and stood silent for a minute well look into this matter he suddenly exclaimed and turning he and his party left us to ourselves the boat was now sent back with a message to the english vessel and the officers and men who remained scattered themselves over our steamer examining the engineroom hold and every part of her  i was very much opposed to all this delay for although the englishmen might doubt the existence of the waterdevil i saw no reason to do so and in any case i was very anxious to be on the safe side by getting away as soon as possible but of course british officers would not be advised by me and as i was getting very hungry i went down to breakfast i ate this meal alone for my fellowpassengers seemed to have no desire for food  i cannot tell all that happened during the next hour for to tell the truth i did not understand everything  that was done the boat passed several times between the two vessels bringing over a number of mentwo of them scientific fellows i think another was a diver whose submarine suit and airpumping machines came over with him he was lowered over the side and after he had been down about fifteen minutes he was hauled up again and down below was the greatest hammering and hauling that ever you heard the general brooks was put in charge of an officer and some men a sail was hoisted to keep her in hand so that she wouldnt drift into the other ship and in the midst of all the rowdydow we were told that if we liked we might go on board the english vessel immediately  miss minturn and her party instantly accepted this invitation and although under ordinary circumstances  i would have remained to see for myself what these people found out i felt a relief in the thought of leaving that vessel which is impossible for me to express and i got into the boat with the others  we were treated very handsomely on board the english vessel which was a mail steamship at that time in the employment of the english government i told my story at least halfadozen times sometimes to the officers and sometimes to the men and whether they believed me or not i dont think any one ever created a greater sensation with a story of the sea  in an hour or so the officer in charge of the operations on the general brooks came aboard as he passed me on his way to the captain he said we found your waterdevil my man and he truly had us in tow i cried yes you are perfectly correct he said and went on to make his report to the captain  now then said the blacksmith i suppose we are going to get to the pint what did he report  i didnt hear his report said the marine but everybody soon knew what had happened to our unlucky vessel and i can give you the whole story of it the general brooks sailed from san francisco to calcutta with a cargo of stored electricity contained in large strongly made boxes this i knew nothing about not being in the habit of inquiring into cargoes well in some way or other which i dont understand not being a scientific man myself a magnetic  connection was formed between these boxes and also if i got the story straight between them and the iron hull of our vessel so that it became in fact an enormous floating magnet one of the biggest things of the kind on record i have an idea that this magnetic condition was the cause of the trouble to our machinery  every separate part of it was probably turned to a magnet and they all stuck together  mr cardly said mr harberry to the schoolmaster  i do not suppose you have given much attention  to the study of commerce and therefore are not prepared to give us any information in regard to stored electricity as an article of export from this country but perhaps you can tell us what stored electricity  is and how it is put into boxes  in regard to the transportation answered the schoolmaster speaking a little slowly of encased electric potency i cannot  oh bless me interrupted the marine that is all simple enough you can store electricity and send it all over the world if you like in places like calcutta i think it must be cheaper to buy it than to make it they use it as a motive power for sewingmachines appleparers and it can be used in a lot of ways such as digging postholes and churning butter when the stored electricity in a box is all used up all you have to do is to connect a fresh box with your machinery and there you are ready to start again there was nothing strange about our cargo it was the electricity  leaking out and uniting itself and the iron ship into a sort of conglomerate magnet that was out of the way  mr cardly said mr harberry if an iron ship were magnetized in that manner wouldnt it have a deranging effect upon the needle of the compass  the marine did not give the schoolmaster time to make answer generally speaking said he that sort of thing would interfere with keeping the vessel on its proper course but with us it didnt make any difference at all the greater part of the ship was in front of the binnacle where they keep the compass and so the needle naturally pointed that way and as we were going north before a south wind it was all right  being a floating magnet of course did not prevent  our sailing so we went along well enough until we came to longitude 90° latitude 15° north now it so happened that a telegraphic cable which had been laid down by the british government to establish  communication between madras and rangoon had broken some time before and not very far from this point  now you can see for yourselves that when an enormous mass of magnetic iron in the shape of the general brooks came sailing along there the part of that cable which lay under us was so attracted by such a powerful and irresistible force that its broken end raised itself from the bottom of the bay and reached upward until it touched our ship when it laid itself along our keel to which it instantly became fastened as firmly as if it had been bolted and riveted there then as the rest of this part of the cable was on the bottom of the bay all the way to madras of course we had to stop thats simple enough thats the way the waterdevil held us fast in one spot for two days  the british government determined not to repair this broken cable but to take it up and lay down a better one so they chartered a large steamer and fitted her up with engines and a big drum that they use for that sort of thing and set her to work to wind up the madras end of the broken cable she had been at this business a good while before we were caught by the other end and when they got near enough to us for their engines to be able to take up the slack from the bottom between us and them then of course they pulled upon us and we began to move and when they lay to for the night and stopped the winding business of course we stopped and the stretch of cable between the two ships had no effect upon us except when the big mail steamer happened to move this way or that as they kept her head to the wind and thats the way we lay quiet all night except when we got our shocks  when they set the drum going again in the morning it wasnt long before they wound us near enough for them to see us which they would have done sooner if my lights hadnt gone out so early in the evening  and that said the blacksmith with a somewhat severe expression on his face is all that you have to tell about your wonderful waterdevil  all said the marine i should say it was quite enough and nothing could be more wonderful than what really happened a waterdevil is one of two things he is real or hes not real if hes not real hes no more than an ordinary spook or ghost and is not to be practically considered if hes real then hes an alive animal and can be put in a class with other animals and described in books because even if nobody sees him the scientific men know how he must be constructed and then hes no more than a great many other wonderful things which we can see alive stuffed or in plaster casts  but if you want to put your mind upon something really wonderful just think of a snakelike rope of wire five or six hundred miles long lying down at the very bottom of the great bay of bengal with no more life in it than there is in a tenpenny nail  then imagine that long dead wire snake to be suddenly filled with life and to know that there was something far up above it on the surface of the water that it wants to reach up to and touch think of it lifting and flapping its broken end and then imagine  it raising yard after yard of itself up and up through the solemn water more and more of it lifting  itself from the bottom curling itself backward and forward as it rises higher and higher until at last with a sudden jump that must have ripped a mile or more of it from the bottom it claps its end against the thing it wants to touch and which it can neither see nor hear nor smell but which it knows is there could there be anything in this world more wonderful than that  and then if that isnt enough of a wonder think of the rangoon end of that cable squirming and wriggling  and stretching itself out toward our ship but not being able to reach us on account of a want of slack just as alive as the madras part of the cable and just as savage and frantic to get up to us and lay hold of us and then after our vessel had been gradually  pulled away from it think of this other part getting  weaker and weaker minute by minute until it falls flat on the bay as dead as any other iron thing  the marine ceased to speak and mrs fryker heaved a sigh  it makes me shiver to think of all that down so deep she said but i must say i am disappointed  in what way asked the marine  a waterdevil said she as big as six whales and with a funnelly mouth to suck in people is different  but of course after all it was better as it was  look here said the blacksmith what became of the girl i wanted her finished up long ago and you havent done it yet  miss minturn you mean said the marine well there is not much to say about her things happened in the usual way when the danger was all over when she had other people to depend upon besides me and we were on board a fine steamer with a lot of handsomely dressed naval officers and going comfortably to madras of course she thought no more of the humble seasoldier who once stood between her andnobody knew what in fact the only time she spoke to me after we got on board the english steamer she made me feel although she didnt say it in words that she was not at all obliged to me for supposing that she would have been scared to death if i had told her about the waterdevil  i suppose said the blacksmith by the time you got back to your ship you had overstayed your leave of absence a good while did your captain let you off when you told him this story of the newfashioned waterdevil  the marine smiled i never went back to the apache he said when i arrived at madras i found that she had sailed from calcutta it was of course useless for me to endeavor to follow her and i therefore concluded to give up the marine service for a time and go into another line of business about which it is too late to tell you now  mr cardly said mr harberry to the schoolmaster  have you ever read that the british government  has a submarine cable from madras to rangoon  the marine took it upon himself to answer this question the cable of which i spoke to you he said was taken up as i told you and i never heard that another one was laid but it is getting late and i think i will go to bed i have a long walk before me tomorrow so saying he rose put his pipe upon the mantelpiece and bade the company good night as he did so he fixed his eyes on the blacksmiths daughter but that young lady did not look at him she was busily reading the weekly newspaper which her father had left upon the table  mr harberry now rose preparatory to going home and as he buttoned up his coat he looked from one to another of the little group and remarked i have often heard that marines are a class of men who are considered as fit subjects to tell tough stories to but it strikes me that the time has come when the tables are beginning to be turned
