47056751	drift from two shores   by  bret harte     contents    the man on the beach   two saints of the foothills   jinny   roger catrons friend   who was my quiet friend   a ghost of the sierras   the hoodlum band   the man whose yoke was not easy   my friend the tramp   the man from solano   the office seeker   a sleepingcar experience   morning on the avenue   with the entrees     drift from two shores    the man on the beach  i  he lived beside a river that emptied into a great ocean  the narrow strip of land that lay between him and the estuary was covered at high tide by a shining film of water at low tide with the castup offerings of sea and shore  logs yet green and saplings washed away from inland banks battered fragments of wrecks and orange crates of bamboo broken into tiny rafts yet odorous with their lost freight lay in long successive curvesthe fringes and overlappings of the sea  at high noon the shadow of a seagulls wing or a sudden flurry and gray squall of sandpipers themselves but shadows was all that broke the monotonous glare of the level sands  he had lived there alone for a twelvemonth  although but a few miles from a thriving settlement during that time his retirement had never been intruded upon his seclusion remained unbroken  in any other community he might have been the subject of rumor or criticism but the miners at camp rogue and the traders at trinidad head themselves individual and eccentric were profoundly indifferent to all other forms of eccentricity or heterodoxy that did not come in contact with their own  and certainly there was no form of eccentricity less aggressive than that of a hermit had they chosen to give him that appellation  but they did not even do that probably from lack of interest or perception  to the various traders who supplied his small wants he was known as kernel judge and boss  to the general public the man on the beach was considered a sufficiently distinguishing title  his name his occupation rank or antecedents nobody cared to inquire  whether this arose from a fear of reciprocal inquiry and interest or from the profound indifference before referred to i cannot say  he did not look like a hermit  a man yet young erect welldressed cleanshaven with a low voice and a smile half melancholy half cynical was scarcely the conventional idea of a solitary  his dwelling a rude improvement on a fishermans cabin had all the severe exterior simplicity of frontier architecture but within it was comfortable and wholesome  three roomsa kitchen a living room and a bedroomwere all it contained  he had lived there long enough to see the dull monotony of one season lapse into the dull monotony of the other  the bleak northwest tradewinds had brought him mornings of staring sunlight and nights of fog and silence  the warmer southwest trades had brought him clouds rain and the transient glories of quick grasses and odorous beach blossoms  but summer or winter wet or dry season on one side rose always the sharply defined hills with their changeless background of evergreens on the other side stretched always the illimitable ocean as sharply defined against the horizon and as unchanging in its hue  the onset of spring and autumn tides some changes among his feathered neighbors the footprints of certain wild animals along the rivers bank and the hanging out of partycolored signals from the wooded hillside far inland helped him to record the slow months  on summer afternoons when the sun sank behind a bank of fog that moving solemnly shoreward at last encompassed him and blotted out sea and sky his isolation was complete  the damp gray sea that flowed above and around and about him always seemed to shut out an intangible world beyond and to be the only real presence  the booming of breakers scarce a dozen rods from his dwelling was but a vague and unintelligible sound or the echo of something past forever  every morning when the sun tore away the misty curtain he awoke dazed and bewildered as upon a new world  the first sense of oppression over he came to love at last this subtle spirit of oblivion and at night when its cloudy wings were folded over his cabin he would sit alone with a sense of security he had never felt before  on such occasions he was apt to leave his door open and listen as for footsteps for what might not come to him out of this vague nebulous world beyond perhaps even shefor this strange solitary was not insane nor visionary  he was never in spirit alone  for night and day sleeping or waking pacing the beach or crouching over his driftwood fire a womans face was always before himthe face for whose sake and for cause of whom he sat there alone  he saw it in the morning sunlight it was her white hands that were lifted from the crested breakers it was the rustling of her skirt when the sea wind swept through the beach grasses it was the loving whisper of her low voice when the long waves sank and died among the sedge and rushes  she was as omnipresent as sea and sky and level sand  hence when the fog wiped them away she seemed to draw closer to him in the darkness on one or two more gracious nights in midsummer when the influence of the fervid noonday sun was still felt on the heated sands the warm breath of the fog touched his cheek as if it had been hers and the tears started to his eyes  before the fogs camefor he arrived there in winterhe had found surcease and rest in the steady glow of a lighthouse upon the little promontory a league below his habitation  even on the darkest nights and in the tumults of storm it spoke to him of a patience that was enduring and a steadfastness that was immutable later on he found a certain dumb companionship in an uprooted tree which floating down the river had stranded hopelessly upon his beach but in the evening had again drifted away  rowing across the estuary a day or two afterward he recognized the tree again from a blaze of the settlers axe still upon its trunk  he was not surprised a week later to find the same tree in the sands before his dwelling or that the next morning it should be again launched on its purposeless wanderings  and so impelled by wind or tide but always haunting his seclusion he would meet it voyaging up the river at the flood or see it tossing among the breakers on the bar but always with the confidence of its returning sooner or later to an anchorage beside him  after the third month of his selfimposed exile he was forced into a more human companionship that was brief but regular  he was obliged to have menial assistance  while he might have eaten his bread in sorrow carelessly and mechanically if it had been prepared for him the occupation of cooking his own food brought the vulgarity and materialness of existence so near to his morbid sensitiveness that he could not eat the meal he had himself prepared  he did not yet wish to die and when starvation or society seemed to be the only alternative he chose the latter  an indian woman so hideous as to scarcely suggest humanity at stated times performed for him these offices when she did not come which was not infrequent he did not eat  such was the mental and physical condition of the man on the beach on the 1st of january 1869   it was a still bright day following a week of rain and wind  low down the horizon still lingered a few white flecksthe flying squadrons of the stormas vague as distant sails  southward the harbor bar whitened occasionally but lazily even the turbulent pacific swell stretched its length wearily upon the shore  and toiling from the settlement over the low sand dunes a carriage at last halted half a mile from the solitarys dwelling  i reckon yell hev to git out here said the driver pulling up to breathe his panting horses  ye cant git any nigher  there was a groan of execration from the interior of the vehicle a hysterical little shriek and one or two shrill expressions of feminine disapprobation but the driver moved not  at last a masculine head expostulated from the window look here you agreed to take us to the house  why its a mile away at least  thar or tharabouts i reckon said the driver coolly crossing his legs on the box  its no use talking i can never walk through this sand and horrid glare said a female voice quickly and imperatively  then apprehensively well of all the places  well i never  this does exceed everything  its really too idiotic for anything  it was noticeable that while the voices betrayed the difference of age and sex they bore a singular resemblance to each other and a certain querulousness of pitch that was dominant  i reckon ive gone about as fur as i allow to go with them hosses continued the driver suggestively and as times vallyble yed better unload  the wretch does not mean to leave us here alone said a female voice in shrill indignation  youll wait for us driver said a masculine voice confidently  how long asked the driver  there was a hurried consultation within  the words might send us packing may take all night to get him to listen to reason bother whole thing over in ten minutes came from the window the driver meanwhile had settled himself back in his seat and whistled in patient contempt of a fashionable fare that didnt know its own mind nor destination  finally the masculine head was thrust out and with a certain potential air of judicially ending a difficulty said  youre to follow us slowly and put up your horses in the stable or barn until we want you  an ironical laugh burst from the driver  oh yesin the stable or barnin course  but my eyes sorter failin me mebbee now some ev you younger folks will kindly pint out the stable or barn of the kernels  woawill yewoa  give me a chance to pick out that there barn or stable to put ye in  this in arch confidence to the horses who had not moved  here the previous speaker rotund dignified and elderly alighted indignantly closely followed by the rest of the party two ladies and a gentleman  one of the ladies was past the age but not the fashion of youth and her parisian dress clung over her wasted figure and wellbred bones artistically if not gracefully the younger lady evidently her daughter was crisp and pretty and carried off the aquiline nose and aristocratic emaciation of her mother with a certain piquancy and a dash that was charming  the gentleman was young thin with the family characteristics but otherwise indistinctive  with one accord they all faced directly toward the spot indicated by the drivers whip  nothing but the bare bleak rectangular outlines of the cabin of the man on the beach met their eyes  all else was a desolate expanse unrelieved by any structure higher than the tussocks of scant beach grass that clothed it  they were so utterly helpless that the drivers derisive laughter gave way at last to good humor and suggestion  look yer he said finally i dont know ez its your fault you dont know this kentry ez well ez you do yurup so ill drag this yer team over to robinsons on the river give the horses a bite and then meander down this yer ridge and wait for ye  yell see me from the kernels  and without waiting for a reply he swung his horses heads toward the river and rolled away  the same querulous protest that had come from the windows arose from the group but vainly  then followed accusations and recrimination its your fault you might have written and had him meet us at the settlement  you wanted to take him by surprise  i didnt  you know if id written that we were coming hed have taken good care to run away from us  yes to some more inaccessible place  there can be none worse than this etc etc  but it was so clearly evident that nothing was to be done but to go forward that even in the midst of their wrangling they straggled on in indian file toward the distant cabin sinking ankledeep in the yielding sand punctuating their verbal altercation with sighs and only abating it at a scream from the elder lady  wheres maria  gone on ahead grunted the younger gentleman in a bass voice so incongruously large for him that it seemed to have been a ventriloquistic contribution by somebody else  it was too true  maria after adding her pungency to the general conversation had darted on ahead  but alas that swift camilla after scouring the plain some two hundred feet with her demitrain came to grief on an unbending tussock and sat down panting but savage  as they plodded wearily toward her she bit her red lips smacked them on her cruel little white teeth like a festive and sprightly ghoul and lisped  you do look so like guys  for all the world like those english shopkeepers we met on the righi doing the threeguinea excursion in their sunday clothes  certainly the spectacle of these exotically plumed bipeds whose fine feathers were already bedrabbled by sand and growing limp in the sea breeze was somewhat dissonant with the rudeness of sea and sky and shore  a few gulls screamed at them a loon startled from the lagoon arose shrieking and protesting with painfully extended legs in obvious burlesque of the younger gentleman  the elder lady felt the justice of her gentle daughters criticism and retaliated with simple directness  your skirt is ruined your hair is coming down your hat is half off your head and your shoesin heavens name maria what have you done with your shoes  maria had exhibited a slim stockinged foot from under her skirt it was scarcely three fingers broad with an arch as patrician as her nose somewhere between here and the carriage she answered dick can run back and find it while he is looking for your brooch mamma  dicks so obliging  the robust voice of dick thundered but the wasted figure of dick feebly ploughed its way back and returned with the missing buskin  i may as well carry them in my hand like the market girls at saumur for we have got to wade soon said miss maria sinking her own terrors in the delightful contemplation of the horror in her parents face as she pointed to a shining film of water slowly deepening in a narrow swale in the sands between them and the cabin  its the tide said the elder gentleman  if we intend to go on we must hasten permit me my dear madam and before she could reply he had lifted the astounded matron in his arms and made gallantly for the ford  the gentle maria cast an ominous eye on her brother who with manifest reluctance performed for her the same office  but that acute young lady kept her eyes upon the preceding figure of the elder gentleman and seeing him suddenly and mysteriously disappear to his armpits unhesitatingly threw herself from her brothers protecting armsan action which instantly precipitated him into the waterand paddled hastily to the opposite bank where she eventually assisted in pulling the elderly gentleman out of the hollow into which he had fallen and in rescuing her mother who floated helplessly on the surface upheld by her skirts like a gigantic and variegated waterlily dick followed with a single gaiter  in another minute they were safe on the opposite bank  the elder lady gave way to tears maria laughed hysterically dick mingled a bass oath with the now audible surf the elder gentleman whose florid face the salt water had bleached and whose dignity seemed to have been washed away accounted for both by saying he thought it was a quicksand  it might have been said a quiet voice behind them you should have followed the sand dunes half a mile further to the estuary  they turned instantly at the voice  it was that of the man on the beach  they all rose to their feet and uttered together save one the single exclamation james  the elder gentleman said mr north and with a slight resumption of his former dignity buttoned his coat over his damp shirt front  there was a silence in which the man on the beach looked gravely down upon them  if they had intended to impress him by any suggestion of a gay brilliant and sensuous world beyond in their own persons they had failed and they knew it  keenly alive as they had always been to external prepossession they felt that they looked forlorn and ludicrous and that the situation lay in his hands  the elderly lady again burst into tears of genuine distress maria colored over her cheekbones and dick stared at the ground in sullen disquiet  you had better get up said the man on the beach after a moments thought and come up to the cabin  i cannot offer you a change of garments but you can dry them by the fire  they all rose together and again said in chorus james but this time with an evident effort to recall some speech or action previously resolved upon and committed to memory  the elder lady got so far as to clasp her hands and add you have not forgotten usjames oh james the younger gentleman to attempt a brusque why jim old boy that ended in querulous incoherence the young lady to cast a halfsearching halfcoquettish look at him and the old gentleman to begin our desire mr northbut the effort was futile  mr james north standing before them with folded arms looked from the one to the other  i have not thought much of you for a twelvemonth he said quietly but i have not forgotten you  come  he led the way a few steps in advance they following silently  in this brief interview they felt he had resumed the old dominance and independence against which they had rebelled more than that in this half failure of their first concerted action they had changed their querulous bickerings to a sullen distrust of each other and walked moodily apart as they followed james north into his house a fire blazed brightly on the hearth a few extra seats were quickly extemporized from boxes and chests and the elder lady with the skirt of her dress folded over her kneeslooking not unlike an exceedingly overdressed jointed dolldried her flounces and her tears together miss maria took in the scant appointments of the house in one single glance and then fixed her eyes upon james north who the least concerned of the party stood before them grave and patiently expectant  well began the elder lady in a high key after all this worry and trouble you have given us james havent you anything to say do you knowhave you the least idea what you are doing what egregious folly you are committing what everybody is saying  eh heavens and earthdo you know who i am  you are my fathers brothers widow aunt mary returned james quietly  if i am committing any folly it only concerns myself if i cared for what people said i should not be here if i loved society enough to appreciate its good report i should stay with it  but they say you have run away from society to pine alone for a worthless creaturea woman who has used you as she has used and thrown away othersa  a woman chimed in dick who had thrown himself on jamess bed while his patent leathers were drying a woman that all the fellers know never intendedhere however he met james norths eye and muttering something about whole thing being too idiotic to talk about relapsed into silence  you know continued mrs north that while we and all our set shut our eyes to your very obvious relations with that woman and while i myself often spoke of it to others as a simple flirtation and averted a scandal for your sake and when the climax was reached and she herself gave you an opportunity to sever your relations and nobody need have been wiserand shed have had all the blameand its only what shes accustomed toyouyou you james northyou must nonsensically go and by this extravagant piece of idiocy and sentimental tomfoolery let everybody see how serious the whole affair was and how deep it hurt you and here in this awful place alonewhere youre half drowned to get to it and are willing to be wholly drowned to get away  oh dont talk to me  i wont hear itits just too idiotic for anything  the subject of this outburst neither spoke nor moved a single muscle  your aunt mr north speaks excitedly said the elder gentleman yet i think she does not overestimate the unfortunate position in which your odd fancy places you  i know nothing of the reasons that have impelled you to this step i only know that the popular opinion is that the cause is utterly inadequate  you are still young with a future before you  i need not say how your present conduct may imperil that  if you expected to achieve any goodeven to your own satisfactionbut this conduct  yesif there was anything to be gained by it broke in mrs north  if you ever thought shed come backbut that kind of woman dont they must have change  whybegan dick suddenly and as suddenly lying down again  is this all you have come to say asked james north after a moments patient silence looking from one to the other  all screamed mrs north is it not enough  not to change my mind nor my residence at present replied north coolly  do you mean to continue this folly all your life  and have a coroners inquest and advertisements and all the facts in the papers  and have her read the melancholy details and know that you were faithful and she was not  this last shot was from the gentle maria who bit her lips as it glanced from the immovable man  i believe there is nothing more to say continued north quietly i am willing to believe your intentions are as worthy as your zeal  let us say no more he added with grave weariness the tide is rising and your coachman is signaling you from the bank  there was no mistaking the unshaken positiveness of the man which was all the more noticeable from its gentle but utter indifference to the wishes of the party  he turned his back upon them as they gathered hurriedly around the elder gentleman while the words he cannot be in his right mind its your duty to do it its sheer insanity look at his eye all fell unconsciously upon his ear  one word more mr north said the elder gentleman a little portentously to conceal an evident embarrassment  it may be that your conduct might suggest to minds more practical than your own the existence of some aberration of the intellectsome temporary maniathat might force your best friends into a quasilegal attitude of  declaring me insane interrupted james north with the slight impatience of a man more anxious to end a prolix interview than to combat an argument  i think differently  as my aunts lawyer you know that within the last year i have deeded most of my property to her and her family  i cannot believe that so shrewd an adviser as mr edmund carter would ever permit proceedings that would invalidate that conveyance  maria burst into a laugh of such wicked gratification that james north for the first time raised his eyes with something of interest to her face  she colored under them but returned his glance with another like a bayonet flash  the party slowly moved toward the door james north following  then this is your final answer asked mrs north stopping imperiously on the threshold  i beg your pardon queried north half abstractedly  your final answer  oh certainly  mrs north flounced away a dozen rods in rage  this was unfortunate for north  it gave them the final attack in detail dick began come along  you know you can advertise for her with a personal down there and the old woman wouldnt object as long as you were careful and put in an appearance now and then  as dick limped away mr carter thought in confidence that the whole mattereven to suit mr norths sensitive naturemight be settled there  she evidently expects you to return  my opinion is that she never left san francisco  you cant tell anything about these women  with this last sentence on his indifferent ear james north seemed to be left free  maria had rejoined her mother but as they crossed the ford and an intervening sandhill hid the others from sight that piquant young lady suddenly appeared on the hill and stood before him  and youre not coming back she said directly  no  never  i cannot say  tell me what is there about some women to make men love them so  love replied north quietly  no it cannot beit is not that  north looked over the hill and round the hill and looked bored  oh im going now  but one moment jem  i didnt want to come they dragged me here  goodby  she raised a burning face and eyes to his  he leaned forward and imprinted the perfunctory cousinly kiss of the period upon her cheek  not that way she said angrily clutching his wrists with her long thin fingers you shant kiss me in that way james north  with the faintest ghostlike passing of a twinkle in the corners of his sad eyes he touched his lips to hers  with the contact she caught him round the neck pressed her burning lips and face to his forehead his cheeks the very curves of his chin and throat andwith a laugh was gone   ii  had the kinsfolk of james north any hope that their visit might revive some lingering desire he still combated to enter once more the world they represented that hope would have soon died whatever effect this episode had upon the solitaryand he had become so selfindulgent of his sorrow and so careless of all that came between him and it as to meet opposition with profound indifferencethe only appreciable result was a greater attraction for the solitude that protected him and he grew even to love the bleak shore and barren sands that had proved so inhospitable to others  there was a new meaning to the roar of the surges an honest loyal sturdiness in the unchanging persistency of the uncouth and blustering tradewinds and a mute fidelity in the shining sands treacherous to all but him  with such bandogs to lie in wait for trespassers should he not be grateful  if no bitterness was awakened by the repeated avowal of the unfaithfulness of the woman he loved it was because he had always made the observation and experience of others give way to the dominance of his own insight  no array of contradictory facts ever shook his belief or unbelief like all egotists he accepted them as truths controlled by a larger truth of which he alone was cognizant  his simplicity which was but another form of his egotism was so complete as to baffle ordinary malicious cunning and so he was spared the experience and knowledge that come to a lower nature and help debase it  exercise and the stimulus of the few wants that sent him hunting or fishing kept up his physical health  never a lover of rude freedom or outdoor life his sedentary predilections and nice tastes kept him from lapsing into barbarian excess never a sportsman he followed the chase with no feverish exaltation  even dumb creatures found out his secret and at times stalking moodily over the upland the brown deer and elk would cross his path without fear or molestation or idly lounging in his canoe within the river bar flocks of wild fowl would settle within stroke of his listless oar  and so the second winter of his hermitage drew near its close and with it came a storm that passed into local history and is still remembered  it uprooted giant trees along the river and with them the tiny rootlets of the life he was idly fostering  the morning had been fitfully turbulent the wind veering several points south and west with suspicions lulls unlike the steady onset of the regular southwest trades  high overhead the long manes of racing cirro stratus streamed with flying gulls and hurrying waterfowl plover piped incessantly and a flock of timorous sandpipers sought the low ridge of his cabin while a wrecking crew of curlew hastily manned the uprooted tree that tossed wearily beyond the bar  by noon the flying clouds huddled together in masses and then were suddenly exploded in one vast opaque sheet over the heavens  the sea became gray and suddenly wrinkled and old  there was a dumb halfarticulate cry in the airrather a confusion of many sounds as of the booming of distant guns the clangor of a bell the trampling of many waves the creaking of timbers and soughing of leaves that sank and fell ere you could yet distinguish them  and then it came on to blow for two hours it blew strongly  at the time the sun should have set the wind had increased in fifteen minutes darkness shut down even the white sands lost their outlines and sea and shore and sky lay in the grip of a relentless and aggressive power  within his cabin by the leaping light of his gusty fire north sat alone  his first curiosity passed the turmoil without no longer carried his thought beyond its one converging centre  she had come to him on the wings of the storm even as she had been borne to him on the summer fogcloud  now and then the wind shook the cabin but he heeded it not  he had no fears for its safety it presented its low gable to the full fury of the wind that year by year had piled and even now was piling protecting buttresses of sand against it  with each succeeding gust it seemed to nestle more closely to its foundations in the whirl of flying sand that rattled against its roof and windows  it was nearly midnight when a sudden thought brought him to his feet  what if she were exposed to the fury of such a night as this  what could he do to help her perhaps even now as he sat there idle shehark was not that a gunno  yes surely  he hurriedly unbolted the door but the strength of the wind and the impact of drifted sand resisted his efforts  with a new and feverish strength possessing him he forced it open wide enough to permit his egress when the wind caught him as a feather rolled him over and over and then grappling him again held him down hard and fast against the drift  unharmed but unable to move he lay there hearing the multitudinous roar of the storm but unable to distinguish one familiar sound in the savage medley  at last he managed to crawl flat on his face to the cabin and refastening the door threw himself upon his bed  he was awakened from a fitful dream of his cousin maria  she with a supernatural strength seemed to be holding the door against some unseen unknown power that moaned and strove without and threw itself in despairing force against the cabin  he could see the lithe undulations of her form as she alternately yielded to its power and again drew the door against it coiling herself around the loghewn doorpost with a hideous snakelike suggestion  and then a struggle and a heavy blow which shook the very foundations of the structure awoke him  he leaped to his feet and into an inch of water  by the flickering firelight he could see it oozing and dripping from the crevices of the logs and broadening into a pool by the chimney  a scrap of paper torn from an envelope was floating idly on its current was it the overflow of the backedup waters of the river  he was not left long in doubt  another blow upon the gable of the house and a torrent of spray leaped down the chimney scattered the embers far and wide and left him in utter darkness  some of the spray clung to his lips  it was salt  the great ocean had beaten down the river bar and was upon him  was there aught to fly to  no  the cabin stood upon the highest point of the sand spit and the low swale on one side crossed by his late visitors was a seething mass of breakers while the estuary behind him was now the ocean itself  there was nothing to do but to wait  the very helplessness of his situation was to a man of his peculiar temperament an element of patient strength  the instinct of selfpreservation was still strong in him but he had no fear of death nor indeed any presentiment of it yet if it came it was an easy solution of the problem that had been troubling him and it wiped off the slate  he thought of the sarcastic prediction of his cousin and death in the form that threatened him was the obliteration of his home and even the ground upon which it stood there would be nothing to record no stain could come upon the living  the instinct that kept him true to her would tell her how he died if it did not it was equally well  and with this simple fatalism his only belief this strange man groped his way to his bed lay down and in a few moments was asleep  the storm still roared without  once again the surges leaped against the cabin but it was evident that the wind was abating with the tide  when he awoke it was high noon and the sun was shining brightly for some time he lay in a delicious languor doubting if he was alive or dead but feeling through every nerve and fibre an exquisite sense of peacea rest he had not known since his boyhooda relief he scarcely knew from what  he felt that he was smiling and yet his pillow was wet with the tears that glittered still on his lashes  the sand blocking up his doorway he leaped lightly from his window  a few clouds were still sailing slowly in the heavens the trailing plumes of a great benediction that lay on sea and shore  he scarcely recognized the familiar landscape a new bar had been formed in the river and a narrow causeway of sand that crossed the lagoon and marshes to the river bank and the upland trail seemed to bring him nearer to humanity again  he was conscious of a fresh childlike delight in all this and when a moment later he saw the old uprooted tree now apparently forever moored and imbedded in the sand beside his cabin he ran to it with a sense of joy  its trailing roots were festooned with clinging seaweed and the long snaky undulating stems of the seaturnip and fixed between two crossing roots was a bamboo orange crate almost intact  as he walked toward it he heard a strange cry unlike anything the barren sands had borne before  thinking it might be some strange sea bird caught in the meshes of the seaweed he ran to the crate and looked within  it was half filled with seamoss and feathery algae  the cry was repeated he brushed aside the weeds with his hands  it was not a wounded sea bird but a living human child  as he lifted it from its damp enwrappings he saw that it was an infant eight or nine months old  how and when it had been brought there or what force had guided that elfish cradle to his very door he could not determine but it must have been left early for it was quite warm and its clothing almost dried by the blazing morning sun  to wrap his coat about it to run to his cabin with it to start out again with the appalling conviction that nothing could be done for it there occupied some moments  his nearest neighbor was trinidad joe a logger three miles up the river he remembered to have heard vaguely that he was a man of family to half strangle the child with a few drops from his whisky flask to extricate his canoe from the marsh and strike out into the river with his waif was at least to do something  in half an hour he had reached the straggling cabin and sheds of trinidad joe and from the few scanty flowers that mingled with the brushwood fence and a surplus of linen fluttering on the line he knew that his surmise as to trinidad joes domestic establishment was correct  the door at which he knocked opened upon a neat plainlyfurnished room and the figure of a buxom woman of twentyfive  with an awkwardness new to him north stammered out the circumstances of his finding the infant and the object of his visit  before he had finished the woman by some feminine trick had taken the child from his hands ere he knew it and when he paused out of breath burst into a fit of laughter  north tried to laugh too but failed  when the woman had wiped the tears from a pair of very frank blue eyes and hidden two rows of very strong white teeth again she said  look yar  youre that looney sort a chap that lives alone over on the spit yonder aint ye  north hastened to admit all that the statement might imply  and so yeve had a baby left ye to keep you company  lordy here she looked as if dangerously near a relapse and then added as if in explanation of her conduct  when i saw ye paddlin down hereyou thet ez shy as elk in summeri sez hes sick  but a babyoh lordy  for a moment north almost hated her  a woman who in this pathetic perhaps almost tragic picture saw only a ludicrous image and that image himself was of another race than that he had ever mingled with profoundly indifferent as he had always been to the criticism of his equals in station the mischievous laughter of this illiterate woman jarred upon him worse than his cousins sarcasm  it was with a little dignity that he pointed out the fact that at present the child needed nourishment  its very young he added  im afraid it wants its natural nourishment  whar is it to get it asked the woman  james north hesitated and looked around  there should be a baby somewhere there must be a baby somewhere  i thought that you he stammered conscious of an awkward coloringithat isi he stopped short for she was already cramming her apron into her mouth too late however to stop the laugh that overflowed it when she found her breath again she said  look yar  i dont wonder they said you was looney  im trinidad joes onmarried darter and the only woman in this house  any fool could have told you that  now ef you can rig us up a baby out o them facts id like to see it done  inwardly furious but outwardly polite james north begged her pardon deplored his ignorance and with a courtly bow made a movement to take the child  but the woman as quickly drew it away  not much she said hastily  what trust that poor critter to you no sir  thars more ways of feeding a baby young man than you knows on with all your natral nourishment  but it looks kinder logy and stupid  north freezingly admitted that he had given the infant whisky as a stimulant  you did  come now that aint so looney after all  well ill take the baby and when dad comes home well see what can be done  north hesitated  his dislike of the woman was intense and yet he knew no one else and the baby needed instant care  besides he began to see the ludicrousness of his making a first call on his neighbors with a foundling to dispose of  she saw his hesitation and said  ye dont know me in course  well im bessy robinson trinidad joe robinsons daughter  i reckon dad will give me a character if you want references or any of the boys on the river  im only thinking of the trouble im giving you miss robinson i assure you  any expense you may incur  young man said bessy robinson turning sharply on her heel and facing him with her black brows a little contracted if it comes to expenses i reckon ill pay you for that baby or not take it at all but i dont know you well enough to quarrel with you on sight  so leave the child to me and if you choose paddle down here tomorrow after sun upthe ride will do you goodand see it and dad thrown in good by and with one powerful but wellshaped arm thrown around the child and the other crooked at the dimpled elbow a little aggressively she swept by james north and entered a bedroom closing the door behind her  when mr james north reached his cabin it was dark  as he rebuilt his fire and tried to rearrange the scattered and disordered furniture and remove the debris of last nights storm he was conscious for the first time of feeling lonely  he did not miss the child  beyond the instincts of humanity and duty he had really no interest in its welfare or future  he was rather glad to get rid of it he would have preferred to some one else and yet she looked as if she were competent  and then came the reflection that since the morning he had not once thought of the woman he loved the like had never occurred in his twelvemonth solitude  so he set to work thinking of her and of his sorrows until the word looney in connection with his suffering flashed across his memory  looney  it was not a nice word  it suggested something less than insanity something that might happen to a common unintellectual sort of person  he remembered the loon an ungainly feathered neighbor that was popularly supposed to have lent its name to the adjective  could it be possible that people looked upon him as one too hopelessly and uninterestingly afflicted for sympathy or companionship too unimportant and common for even ridicule or was this but the coarse interpretation of that vulgar girl  nevertheless the next morning after sun up james north was at trinidad joes cabin  that worthy proprietor himselfa long lank man with even more than the ordinary rural western characteristics of ill health ill feeding and melancholymet him on the bank clothed in a manner and costume that was a singular combination of the frontiersman and the sailor  when north had again related the story of his finding the child trinidad joe pondered  it mout hev been stowed away in one of them crates for safekeeping he said musingly and washed off the deck o one o them tahiti brigs goin down fer oranges  leastways it never got thar from these parts  but its a miracle its life was saved at all  it must have been some hours in the water  them brigs lays their course well inshore and it was just mebbe a toss up if the vessel clawed off the reef at all  and ez to the child keepin up why dog my skin thats just the contrariness o things continued joe in sententious cynicism  ef an able seaman had fallen from the yardarm that night hed been sunk in sight o the ship and thet baby ez cant swim a stroke sails ashore sound asleep with the waves for a babyjumper  north who was half relieved yet half awkwardly disappointed at not seeing bessy ventured to ask how the child was doing  shell do all right now said a frank voice above and looking up north discerned the round arms blue eyes and white teeth of the daughter at the window  shes all hunky and has an appetiteef she heznt got her natral nourishment  come dad heave ahead and tell the stranger what you and me allow well do and dont stand there swappin lies with him  weel said trinidad joe dejectedly bess allows she can rar that baby and do justice to it  and i dont saythough im her fatherthat she cant  but when bess wants anything she wants it all clean down no halfways nor leavins for her  thats me go on dadyoure chippin in the same notch every time said miss robinson with cheerful directness  well we agree to put the job up this way  well take the child and youll give us a paper or writin makin over all your right and title hows that  without knowing exactly why he did mr north objected decidedly  do you think we wont take good care of it asked miss bessy sharply  that is not the question said north a little hotly  in the first place the child is not mine to give  it has fallen into my hands as a trustthe first hands that received it from its parents  i do not think it right to allow any other hands to come between theirs and mine  miss bessy left the window  in another moment she appeared from the house and walking directly towards north held out a somewhat substantial hand  good she said as she gave his fingers an honest squeeze  you aint so looney after all  dad hes right he shant gin it up but well go halves in it he and me  hell be father and ill be mother til death do us part or the reglar family turns up wellwhat do you say  more pleased than he dared confess to himself with the praise of this common girl mr james north assented  then would he see the baby  he would and trinidad joe having already seen the baby and talked of the baby and felt the baby and indeed had the baby offered to him in every way during the past night concluded to give some of his valuable time to logging and left them together  mr north was obliged to admit that the baby was thriving  he moreover listened with polite interest to the statement that the babys eyes were hazel like his own that it had five teeth that she was for a girl of that probable age a robust child and yet mr north lingered finally with his hand on the doorlock he turned to bessy and said  may i ask you an odd question miss robinson  go on  why did you think i waslooney  the frank miss robinson bent her head over the baby  why  yes why  because you were looney  oh  but  yes  youll get over it  and under the shallow pretext of getting the babys food she retired to the kitchen where mr north had the supreme satisfaction of seeing her as he passed the window sitting on a chair with her apron over her head shaking with laughter  for the next two or three days he did not visit the robinsons but gave himself up to past memories  on the third day he hadit must be confessed not without some effortbrought himself into that condition of patient sorrow which had been his habit  the episode of the storm and the finding of the baby began to fade as had faded the visit of his relatives  it had been a dull wet day and he was sitting by his fire when there came a tap at his door flora by which juvenescent name his aged indian handmaid was known usually announced her presence with an imitation of a curlews cry it could not be her  he fancied he heard the trailing of a womans dress against the boards and started to his feet deathly pale with a name upon his lips  but the door was impatiently thrown open and showed bessy robinson  and the baby  with a feeling of relief he could not understand he offered her a seat she turned her frank eyes on him curiously  you look skeert  i was startled  you know i see nobody here  thets so  but look yar do you ever use a doctor  not clearly understanding her he in turn asked why  cause you must rise up and get one nowthets why  this yer baby of ours is sick  we dont use a doctor at our house we dont beleeve in em haint no call for embut this yer babys parents mebbee did so rise up out o that cheer and get one  james north looked at miss robinson and rose albeit a little in doubt and hesitating  miss robinson saw it  i shouldnt hev troubled ye nor ridden three mile to do it if ther hed been any one else to send  but dads over at eureka buying logs and im alone  hellowher yer goin  north had seized his hat and opened the door  for a doctor he replied amazedly  did ye kalkilate to walk six miles and back  certainlyi have no horse  but i have and youll find her tethered outside  she aint much to look at but when you strike the trail shell go  but youhow will you return  well said miss robinson drawing her chair to the fire taking off her hat and shawl and warming her knees by the blaze i didnt reckon to return  youll find me here when you come back with the doctor go  skedaddle quick  she did not have to repeat the command  in another instant james north was in miss bessys seata mans dragoon saddleand pounding away through the sand  two facts were in his mind one was that he the looney was about to open communication with the wisdom and contemporary criticism of the settlement by going for a doctor to administer to a sick and anonymous infant in his possession the other was that his solitary house was in the hands of a selfinvited largelimbed illiterate but rather comely young woman  these facts he could not gallop away from but to his credit be it recorded that he fulfilled his mission zealously if not coherently to the doctor who during the rapid ride gathered the idea that north had rescued a young married woman from drowning who had since given birth to a child  the few words that set the doctor right when he arrived at the cabin might in any other community have required further explanation but dr duchesne an old army surgeon was prepared for everything and indifferent to all  the infant he said was threatened with inflammation of the lungs at present there was no danger but the greatest care and caution must be exercised particularly exposure should be avoided  that settles the whole matter then said bessy potentially  both gentlemen looked their surprise  it means she condescended to further explain that you must ride that filly home wait for the old man to come tomorrow and then ride back here with some of my duds for thars no daydays nor picknicking for that baby ontil shes better  and i reckon to stay with her ontil she is  she certainly is unable to bear any exposure at present said the doctor with an amused side glance at norths perplexed face miss robinson is right  ill ride with you over the sands as far as the trail  im afraid said north feeling it incumbent upon him to say something that youll hardly find it as comfortable here as  i reckon not she said simply but i didnt expect much  north turned a little wearily away  good night she said suddenly extending her hand with a gentler smile of lip and eye than he had ever before noticed good nighttake good care of dad  the doctor and north rode together some moments in silence  north had another fact presented to him i e that he was going avisiting and that he had virtually abandoned his former life also that it would be profanation to think of his sacred woe in the house of a stranger  i dare say said the doctor suddenly you are not familiar with the type of woman miss bessy presents so perfectly  your life has been spent among the conventional class  north froze instantly at what seemed to be a probing of his secret disregarding the last suggestion he made answer simply and truthfully that he had never met any western girl like bessy  thats your bad luck said the doctor  you think her coarse and illiterate  mr north had been so much struck with her kindness that really he had not thought of it  thats not so said the doctor curtly although even if you told her so she would not think any the less of younor of herself  if she spoke rustic greek instead of bad english and wore a cestus in place of an illfitting corset youd swear she was a goddess  theres your trail  good night   iii  james north did not sleep well that night  he had taken miss bessys bedroom at her suggestion there being but two and dad never using sheets and not bein keerful in his habits  it was neat but that was all  the scant ornamentation was atrocious two or three highly colored prints a shell workbox a ghastly winter bouquet of skeleton leaves and mosses a starfish and two china vases hideous enough to have been worshiped as buddhist idols exhibited the gentle recreation of the fair occupant and the possible future education of the child in the morning he was met by joe who received the message of his daughter with his usual dejection and suggested that north stay with him until the child was better  that event was still remote north found on his return to his cabin that the child had been worse but he did not know until miss bessy dropped a casual remark that she had not closed her own eyes that night  it was a week before he regained his own quarters but an active weekindeed on the whole a rather pleasant week  for there was a delicate flattery in being domineered by a wholesome and handsome woman and mr james north had by this time made up his mind that she was both  once or twice he found himself contemplating her splendid figure with a recollection of the doctors compliment and later emulating her own frankness told her of it  and what did you say she asked  oh i laughed and saidnothing  and so did she  a month after this interchange of frankness she asked him if he could spend the next evening at her house  you see she said theres to be a dance down at the hall at eureka and i havent kicked a fut since last spring  hank fishers comin up to take me over and im goin to let the shanty slide for the night  but whats to become of the baby asked north a little testily  well said miss robinson facing him somewhat aggressively i reckon it wont hurt ye to take care of it for a night  dad cantand if he could he dont know how  liked to have pizened me after mar died no young man i dont propose to ask hank fisher to tote thet child over to eureka and back and spile his fun  then i suppose i must make way for mr hankhankfisher said north with the least tinge of sarcasm in his speech  of course  youve got nothing else to do you know  north would have given worlds to have pleaded a previous engagement on business of importance but he knew that bessy spoke truly  he had nothing to do  and fisher has i suppose he asked  of courseto look after me  a more unpleasant evening james north had not spent since the first day of his solitude  he almost began to hate the unconscious cause of his absurd position as he paced up and down the floor with it was there ever such egregious folly he began but remembering he was quoting maria norths favorite resume of his own conduct he stopped  the child cried missing no doubt the full rounded curves and plump arm of its nurse  north danced it violently with an inward accompaniment that was not musical and thought of the other dancers  doubtless he mused she has told this beau of hers that she has left the baby with the looney man on the beach perhaps i may be offered a permanent engagement as a harmless simpleton accustomed to the care of children  mothers may cry for me  the doctor is at eureka  of course he will be there to see his untranslated goddess and condole with her over the imbecility of the man on the beach  once he carelessly asked joe who the company were  well said joe mournfully thars widder higsby and darter the four stubbs gals in course polly doble will be on hand with that feller thats clerking over at the head for jones and joness wife then thars french pete and whisky ben and that chap that shot archeri disremember his nameand the barberwhats that little mulattos namethat ar kanaka  i swow continued joe drearily ill be forgettin my own nextand  that will do interrupted north only half concealing his disgust as he rose and carried the baby to the other room beyond the reach of names that might shock its ladylike ears  the next morning he met the fromdancereturning bessy abstractedly and soon took his leave full of a disloyal plan conceived in the sleeplessness of her own bedchamber  he was satisfied that he owed a duty to its unknown parents to remove the child from the degrading influences of the barber kanaka and hank fisher especially and he resolved to write to his relatives stating the case asking a home for the waif and assistance to find its parents  he addressed this letter to his cousin maria partly in consideration of the dramatic farewell of that young lady and its possible influence in turning her susceptible heart towards his protege  he then quietly settled back to his old solitary habits and for a week left the robinsons unvisited  the result was a morning call by trinidad joe on the hermit  its a whim of my gals mr north he said dejectedly and ez i told you before and warned ye when that gal hez an idee fower yoke of oxen and seving men cant drag it outer her  shes got a idee o larninnever hevin hed much schoolin and we ony takin the papers permiskiss likeand she says you can teach hernot hevin anythin else to do  do ye folly me  yes said north certainly  well she allows ez mebbee youre proud and didnt like her takin care of the baby for nowt and she reckons that ef youll gin her some book larnin and get her to sling some fancy talk in fashnble stylewhy shell call it squar  you can tell her said north very honestly that i shall be only too glad to help her in any way without ever hoping to cancel my debt of obligation to her  then its a go said the mystified joe with a desperate attempt to convey the foregoing statement to his own intellect in three saxon words  its a go replied north cheerfully  and he felt relieved  for he was not quite satisfied with his own want of frankness to her  but here was a way to pay off the debt he owed her and yet retain his own dignity  and now he could tell her what he had done and he trusted to the ambitious instinct that prompted her to seek a better education to explain his reasons for it  he saw her that evening and confessed all to her frankly  she kept her head averted but when she turned her blue eyes to him they were wet with honest tears  north had a mans horror of a ready feminine lachrymal gland but it was not like bessy to cry and it meant something and then she did it in a large goddesslike way without sniffling or chocking or getting her nose red but rather with a gentle deliquescence a harmonious melting so that he was fain to comfort her with nearer contact gentleness in his own sad eyes and a pressure of her large hand  its all right i spose she said sadly but i didnt reckon on yer havin any relations but thought you was alone like me  james north thinking of hank fisher and the mullater could not help intimating that his relations were very wealthy and fashionable people and had visited him last summer  a recollection of the manner in which they had so visited him and his own reception of them prevented his saying more  but miss bessy could not forego a certain feminine curiosity and asked  did they come with sam bakers team  yes  last july  yes  and sam drove the horses here for a bite  i believe so  and thems your relations  they are  miss robinson reached over the cradle and enfolded the sleeping infant in her powerful arms  then she lifted her eyes wrathful through her still glittering tears and said slowly they donthavethischildthen  but why  oh why  i saw them  thats why and enough  you cant play any such gay and festive skeletons on this poor baby for flesh and blood parents  no sir  i think you judge them hastily miss bessy said north secretly amused my aunt may not at first favorably impress strangers yet she has many friends  but surely you do not object to my cousin maria the young lady  what that dried cuttlefish with nothing livin about her but her eyes  james north ye may be a fool like the old womanperhaps its in the familybut ye aint a devil like that gal that ends it  and it did  north dispatched a second letter to maria saying that he had already made other arrangements for the baby  pleased with her easy victory miss bessy became more than usually gracious and the next day bowed her shapely neck meekly to the yoke of her teacher and became a docile pupil  james north could not have helped noticing her ready intelligence even had he been less prejudiced in her favor than he was fast becoming now  if he had found it pleasant before to be admonished by her there was still more delicious flattery in her perfect trust in his omniscient skill as a pilot over this unknown sea there was a certain enjoyment in guiding her hand over the writingbook that i fear he could not have obtained from an intellect less graciously sustained by its physical nature  the weeks flew quickly by on gossamer wings and when she placed a bunch of larkspurs and poppies in his hand one morning he remembered for the first that it was spring  i cannot say that there was more to record of miss bessys education than this  once north half jestingly remarked that he had never yet seen her admirer mr hank fisher  miss bessy coloring but coolyou never will  north white but hotwhy  miss bessy faintlyid rather not  north resolutelyi insist  bessy yieldingas my teacher north hesitatingly at the limitation of the epithetyees bessyand youll promise never to speak of it again  northnever bessy slowlywell he said i did an awful thing to go over to your cabin and stay  north in the genuine simplicity of a refined naturebut how  miss bessy half piqued but absolutely admiring that naturequit and keep your promise  they were so happy in these new relations that it occurred to miss bessy one day to take james north to task for obliging her to ask to be his pupil  you knew how ignorant i was she added and mr north retorted by relating to her the doctors criticism on her independence to tell you the truth he added i was afraid you would not take it as kindly as he thought  that is you thought me as vain as yourself  it seems to me you and the doctor had a great deal to say to each other  on the contrary laughed north that was all we said  and you didnt make fun of me  perhaps it was not necessary for north to take her hand to emphasize his denial but he did  miss bessy being still reminiscent perhaps did not notice it if it hadnt been for that ari mean that tharno that babyi wouldnt have known you she said dreamily  no returned north mischievously but you still would have known hank fisher  no woman is perfect  miss bessy looked at him with a suddenher first and lastflash of coquetry  then stooped and kissedthe baby  james north was a simple gentleman but not altogether a fool  he returned the kiss but not vicariously  there was a footstep on the porch  these two turned the hues of a dying dolphin and then laughed  it was joe  he held a newspaper in his hand  i reckon ye woz right mr north about my takin these yar papers reglar  for i allow heres suthin that may clar up the mystery o that babys parents  with the hesitation of a slowly grappling intellect joe sat down on the table and read from the san francisco herald as follows it is now ascertained beyond doubt that the wreck reported by the aeolus was the american brig pomare bound hence to tahiti  the worst surmises are found correct  the body of the woman has been since identified as that of the beautiful daughter ofofofterpterpterpishwell i swow that name just tackles me  gin it to me dad said bessy pertly  you never had any education any way  hear your accomplished daughter  with a mock bow to the new schoolmaster and a capital burlesque of a confident school girl she strode to the middle of the room the paper held and folded bookwise in her hands  ahem  where did you leave off  oh the beautiful daughter of terpsichorewhose name was prominently connected with a mysterious social scandal of last yearthe gifted but unfortunate grace chattertonnodont stop metheres some more  the body of her child a lovely infant of six months has not been recovered and it is supposed was washed overboard  there may be thats the child mr north  why dad look o my god  hes falling  catch him dad quick  but her strong arm had anticipated her fathers  she caught him lifted him to the bed on which he lay henceforth for many days unconscious  then fever supervened and delirium and dr duchesne telegraphed for his friends but at the end of a week and the opening of a summer day the storm passed as the other storm had passed and he awoke enfeebled but at peace  bessy was at his sidehe was glad to seealone  bessy dear he said hesitatingly when i am stronger i have something to tell you  i know it all jem she said with a trembling lip i heard it allno not from them but from your own lips in your delirium im glad it came from youeven then  do you forgive me bessy  she pressed her lips to his forehead and said hastily and then falteringly as if afraid of her impulse  yes  yes  and you will still be mother to the child  her child  no dear not hers but mine  she started cried a little and then putting her arms around him said yes  and as there was but one way of fulfilling that sacred promise they were married in the autumn    two saints of the foothills  it never was clearly ascertained how long they had been there  the first settler of roughandreadyone low playfully known to his familiars as the poor indiandeclared that the saints were afore his time and occupied a cabin in the brush when he blazed his way to the north fork  it is certain that the two were present when the water was first turned on the union ditch and then and there received the designation of daddy downey and mammy downey which they kept to the last  as they tottered toward the refreshment tent they were welcomed with the greatest enthusiasm by the boys or to borrow the more refined language of the union recordertheir gray hairs and bent figures recalling as they did the happy paternal eastern homes of the spectators and the blessings that fell from venerable lips when they left those homes to journey in quest of the golden fleece on occidental slopes caused many to burst into tears  the nearer facts that many of these spectators were orphans that a few were unable to establish any legal parentage whatever that others had enjoyed a states guardianship and discipline and that a majority had left their paternal roofs without any embarrassing preliminary formula were mere passing clouds that did not dim the golden imagery of the writer  from that day the saints were adopted as historical lay figures and entered at once into possession of uninterrupted gratuities and endowment  it was not strange that in a country largely made up of ambitious and reckless youth these twotypes of conservative and settled formsshould be thus celebrated  apart from any sentiment or veneration they were admirable foils to the communitys youthful progress and energy  they were put forward at every social gathering occupied prominent seats on the platform at every public meeting walked first in every procession were conspicuous at the frequent funeral and rarer wedding and were godfather and godmother to the first baby born in roughandready  at the first poll opened in that precinct daddy downey cast the first vote and as was his custom on all momentous occasions became volubly reminiscent  the first vote i ever cast said daddy was for andrew jackson the father o some on your peart young chaps wasnt born then he he that was way long in 33 wasnt it  i disremember now but if mammy was here she bein a schoolgal at the time she could say  but my memorys failin me im an old man boys yet i likes to see the young ones go ahead  i recklect that thar vote from a suckumstance  squire adams was present and seein it was my first vote he put a goold piece into my hand and sez he sez squire adams let that always be a reminder of the exercise of a glorious freemans privilege  he did he he lord boys  i feel so proud of ye that i wish i had a hundred votes to cast for ye all  it was hardly necessary to say that the memorial tribute of squire adams was increased tenfold by the judges inspectors and clerks and that the old man tottered back to mammy considerably heavier than he came  as both of the rival candidates were equally sure of his vote and each had called upon him and offered a conveyance it is but fair to presume they were equally beneficent  but daddy insisted upon walking to the pollsa distance of two milesas a moral example and a text for the california paragraphers who hastened to record that such was the influence of the foothill climate that a citizen of roughandready aged eightyfour rose at six oclock and after milking two cows walked a distance of twelve miles to the polls and returned in time to chop a cord of wood before dinner  slightly exaggerated as this statement may have been the fact that daddy was always found by the visitor to be engaged at his woodpile which seemed neither to increase nor diminish under his axe a fact doubtless owing to the activity of mammy who was always at the same time making pies seemed to give some credence to the story  indeed the woodpile of daddy downey was a standing reproof to the indolent and sluggish miner  ole daddy must use up a powful sight of wood every time ive passed by his shanty hes been makin the chips fly  but what gets me is that the pile dont seem to come down said whisky dick to his neighbor  well you derned fool growled his neighbor spose some chap happens to pass by thar and sees the old man doin a mans work at eighty and slouches like you and me lying round drunk and that chap feelin kinder humped goes up some dark night and heaves a load of cut pine over his fence whos got anything to say about it  say  certainly not the speaker who had done the act suggested nor the penitent and remorseful hearer who repeated it next day  the pies and cakes made by the old woman were i think remarkable rather for their inducing the same loyal and generous spirit than for their intrinsic excellence and it may be said appealed more strongly to the nobler aspirations of humanity than its vulgar appetite howbeit everybody ate mammy downeys pies and thought of his childhood  take em dear boys the old lady would say it does me good to see you eat em reminds me kinder of my poor sammy that ef hed lived would hev been ez strong and beg ez you be but was taken down with lung fever at sweetwater  i kin see him yet thats forty year ago dear comin out o the lot to the bakehouse and smilin such a beautiful smile like yours dear boy as i handed him a mince or a lemming turnover  dear dear how i do run on and those days is past but i seems to live in you again  the wife of the hotelkeeper actuated by a low jealousy had suggested that she seemed to live off them but as that person tried to demonstrate the truth of her statement by reference to the cost of the raw material used by the old lady it was considered by the camp as too practical and economical for consideration  besides added cy perkins ef old mammy wants to turn an honest penny in her old age let her do it  how would you like your old mother to make pies on grub wages eh  a suggestion that so affected his hearer who had no mother that he bought three on the spot  the quality of these pies had never been discussed but once  it is related that a young lawyer from san francisco dining at the palmetto restaurant pushed away one of mammy downeys pies with every expression of disgust and dissatisfaction  at this juncture whisky dick considerably affected by his favorite stimulant approached the strangers table and drawing up a chair sat uninvited before him  mebbee young man he began gravely ye dont like mammy downeys pies  the stranger replied curtly and in some astonishment that he did not as a rule eat pie  young man continued dick with drunken gravity mebbee youre accustomed to charlotte rusks and blue mange mebbee ye cant eat unless your grub is got up by one o them french cooks  yet weus boys yar in this campcalls that piea gooda competent pie  the stranger again disclaimed anything but a general dislike of that form of pastry  young man continued dick utterly unheeding the explanationyoung man mebbee you onst had an olea very ole mother who tottering down the vale o years made pies  mebbee and its like your blank epicurean soul ye turned up your nose on the ole woman and went back on the pies and on her  she that dandled ye when ye woz a babya little baby  mebbee ye went back on her and shook her and played off on her and gave her awaydead away  and now mebbee young mani wouldnt hurt ye for the world but mebbee afore ye leave this yar table yell eat that pie  the stranger rose to his feet but the muzzle of a dragoon revolver in the unsteady hands of whisky dick caused him to sit down again he ate the pie and lost his case likewise before a roughandready jury  indeed far from exhibiting the cynical doubts and distrusts of age daddy downey received always with childlike delight the progress of modern improvement and energy  in my day long back in the twenties it took us nigh a weeka week boysto get up a barn and all the young onesi was one thenfor miles round at the raisin and yers you boysrascals ye are tooruns up this yer shanty for mammy and me twixt sunup and dark  eh eh youre teachin the old folks new tricks are ye  ah get along you and in playful simulation of anger he would shake his white hair and his hickory staff at the rascals  the only indication of the conservative tendencies of age was visible in his continual protest against the extravagance of the boys  why he would say a family a hull familyleavin alone me and the old womanmight be supported on what you young rascals throw away in a single spree  ah you young dogs didnt i hear about your scattering halfdollars on the stage the other night when that eyetalian papist was singin  and that money goes out of amerikyivry cent  there was little doubt that the old couple were saving if not avaricious  but when it was known through the indiscreet volubility of mammy downey that daddy downey sent the bulk of their savings gratuities and gifts to a dissipated and prodigal son in the eastwhose photograph the old man always carried with himit rather elevated him in their regard  when ye write to that gay and festive son o yourn daddy said joe robinson send him this yer specimen give him my compliments and tell him ef he kin spend money faster than i can i call him  tell him ef he wants a firstclass jamboree to kem out here and me and the boys will show him what a square drunk is  in vain would the old man continue to protest against the spirit of the gift the miner generally returned with his pockets that much the lighter and it is not improbable a little less intoxicated than he otherwise might have been  it may be premised that daddy downey was strictly temperate  the only way he managed to avoid hurting the feelings of the camp was by accepting the frequent donations of whisky to be used for the purposes of liniment  next to snakeoil my son he would say and dilberryjuiceand ye dont seem to produce em hereaboutswhisky is good for rubbin onto old bones to make em limber  but pure cold water sparklin and bright in its liquid light and so to speak reflectin of gods own linyments on its surfiss is the best onless like poor ol mammy and me ye gets the dumbagur from overuse  the fame of the downey couple was not confined to the foothills the rev henry gushington dd of boston making a bronchial tour of california wrote to the christian pathfinder an affecting account of his visit to them placed daddy downeys age at 102 and attributed the recent conversions in roughandready to their influence  that gifted literary hessian bill smith traveling in the interests of various capitalists and the trustworthy correspondent of four only independent american journals quoted him as an evidence of the longevity superinduced by the climate offered him as an example of the security of helpless life and property in the mountains used him as an advertisement of the union ditch and it is said in some vague way cited him as proving the collateral facts of a timber and oreproducing region existing in the foothills worthy the attention of eastern capitalists  praised thus by the lips of distinguished report fostered by the care and sustained by the pecuniary offerings of their fellowcitizens the saints led for two years a peaceful life of gentle absorption  to relieve them from the embarrassing appearance of eleemosynary receiptsan embarrassment felt more by the givers than the recipientsthe postmastership of roughandready was procured for daddy and the duty of receiving and delivering the united states mails performed by him with the advice and assistance of the boys  if a few letters went astray at this time it was easily attributed to this undisciplined aid and the boys themselves were always ready to make up the value of a missing moneyletter and keep the old mans accounts square  to these functions presently were added the treasurerships of the masons and odd fellows charitable fundsthe old man being far advanced in their respective degreesand even the position of almoner of their bounties was superadded  here unfortunately daddys habits of economy and avaricious propensity came near making him unpopular and very often needy brothers were forced to object to the quantity and quality of the help extended  they always met with more generous relief from the private hands of the brothers themselves and the remark that the ol man was trying to set an examplethat he meant welland that they would yet be thankful for his zealous care and economy  a few i think suffered in noble silence rather than bring the old mans infirmity to the public notice  and so with this honor of daddy and mammy the days of the miners were long and profitable in the land of the foothills  the mines yielded their abundance the winters were singularly open and yet there was no drouth nor lack of water and peace and plenty smiled on the sierrean foothills from their highest sunny upland to the trailing falda of wild oats and poppies  if a certain superstition got abroad among the other camps connecting the fortunes of roughandready with daddy and mammy it was a gentle harmless fancy and was not i think altogether rejected by the old people  a certain large patriarchal bountiful manner of late visible in daddy and the increase of much white hair and beard kept up the poetic illusion while mammy day by day grew more and more like somebodys fairy godmother  an attempt was made by a rival camp to emulate these paying virtues of reverence and an aged mariner was procured from the sailors snug harbor in san francisco on trial but the unfortunate seaman was more or less diseased was not always presentable through a weakness for ardent spirits and finally to use the powerful idiom of one of his disappointed fosterchildren up and died in a week without slinging ary blessin  but vicissitude reaches young and old alike  youthful roughandready and the saints had climbed to their meridian together and it seemed fit that they should together decline  the first shadow fell with the immigration to roughandready of a second aged pair the landlady of the independence hotel had not abated her malevolence towards the saints and had imported at considerable expense her grandaunt and granduncle who had been enjoying for some years a sequestered retirement in the poorhouse at east machias  they were indeed very old  by what miracle even as anatomical specimens they had been preserved during their long journey was a mystery to the camp  in some respects they had superior memories and reminiscences  the old manabner trixhad shouldered a musket in the war of 1812 his wife abigail had seen lady washington  she could sing hymns he knew every text between the leds of a bible  there is little doubt but that in many respects to the superficial and giddy crowd of youthful spectators they were the more interesting spectacle  whether it was jealousy distrust or timidity that overcame the saints was never known but they studiously declined to meet the strangers  when directly approached upon the subject daddy downey pleaded illness kept himself in close seclusion and the sunday that the trixes attended church in the schoolhouse on the hill the triumph of the trix party was mitigated by the fact that the downeys were not in their accustomed pew  you bet that daddy and mammy is lying low jest to ketch them old mummies yet explained a downeyite  for by this time schism and division had crept into the camp the younger and later members of the settlement adhering to the trixes while the older pioneers stood not only loyal to their own favorites but even in the true spirit of partisanship began to seek for a principle underlying their personal feelings  i tell ye what boys observed sweetwater joe if this yer camp is goin to be run by greenhorns and old pioneers like daddy and the rest of us must take back seats its time we emigrated and shoved out and tuk daddy with us  why theyre talkin of rotation in offiss and of putting that skeleton that maam decker sets up at the table to take her boarders appetites away into the postoffice in place o daddy  and indeed there were some fears of such a conclusion the newer men of roughandready were in the majority and wielded a more than equal influence of wealth and outside enterprise  frisco as a downeyite bitterly remarked already owned half the town  the old friends that rallied around daddy and mammy were like most loyal friends in adversity in bad case themselves and were beginning to look and act it was observed not unlike their old favorites  at this juncture mammy died  the sudden blow for a few days seemed to reunite dissevered roughandready  both factions hastened to the bereaved daddy with condolements and offers of aid and assistance  but the old man received them sternly  a change had come over the weak and yielding octogenarian  those who expected to find him maudlin helpless disconsolate shrank from the cold hard eyes and truculent voice that bade them begone and leave him with his dead  even his own friends failed to make him respond to their sympathy and were fain to content themselves with his cold intimation that both the wishes of his dead wife and his own instincts were against any display or the reception of any favor from the camp that might tend to keep up the divisions they had innocently created  the refusal of daddy to accept any service offered was so unlike him as to have but one dreadful meaning  the sudden shock had turned his brain  yet so impressed were they with his resolution that they permitted him to perform the last sad offices himself and only a select few of his nearer neighbors assisted him in carrying the plain deal coffin from his lonely cabin in the woods to the still lonelier cemetery on the hilltop  when the shallow grave was filled he dismissed even these curtly shut himself up in his cabin and for days remained unseen  it was evident that he was no longer in his right mind  his harmless aberration was accepted and treated with a degree of intelligent delicacy hardly to be believed of so rough a community during his wifes sudden and severe illness the safe containing the funds intrusted to his care by the various benevolent associations was broken into and robbed and although the act was clearly attributable to his carelessness and preoccupation all allusion to the fact was withheld from him in his severe affliction  when he appeared again before the camp and the circumstances were considerately explained to him with the remark that the boys had made it all right the vacant hopeless unintelligent eye that he turned upon the speaker showed too plainly that he had forgotten all about it  dont trouble the old man said whisky dick with a burst of honest poetry  dont ye see his memorys dead and lying there in the coffin with mammy perhaps the speaker was nearer right than he imagined  failing in religious consolation they took various means of diverting his mind with worldly amusements and one was a visit to a traveling variety troupe then performing in the town  the result of the visit was briefly told by whisky dick  well sir we went in and i sot the old man down in a front seat and kinder propped him up with some other of the fellers round him and there he sot as silent and awful ez the grave  and then that fancy dancer miss grace somerset comes in and dern my skin ef the old man didnt get to trembling and fidgeting all over as she cut them pidgin wings  i tell ye what boys men is men way down to their bootswhether theyre crazy or not  well he took on so that im blamed if at last that gal herself didnt notice him and she ups suddenly and blows him a kissso with her fingers  whether this narration were exaggerated or not it is certain that the old man downey every succeeding night of the performance was a spectator  that he may have aspired to more than that was suggested a day or two later in the following incident  a number of the boys were sitting around the stove in the magnolia saloon listening to the onset of a winter storm against the windows when whisky dick tremulous excited and bristling with raindrops and information broke in upon them  well boys ive got just the biggest thing out  ef i hadnt seed it myself i wouldnt hev believed it  it aint thet ghost agin growled robinson from the depths of his armchair thet ghosts about played  wot ghost asked a newcomer  why ole mammys ghost that every feller about yer sees when hes half full and out late o nights  where  where  why where should a ghost be  meanderin round her grave on the hill yander in course  its suthin bigger nor thet pard said dick confidently no ghost kin rake down the pot agin the keerds ive got here  this aint no bluff  well go on said a dozen excited voices  dick paused a moment diffidently with the hesitation of an artistic raconteur  well he said with affected deliberation lets see  its nigh onto an hour ago ez i was down thar at the variety show  when the curtain was down betwixt the ax i looks round fer daddy  no daddy thar  i goes out and asks some o the boys  daddy was there a minnit ago they say must hev gone home  bein kinder responsible for the old man i hangs around and goes out in the hall and sees a passage leadin behind the scenes  now the queer thing about this boys ez that suthin in my bones tells me the old man is thar  i pushes in and sure as a gun i hears his voice kinder pathetic kinder pleadin kinder  lovemakin broke in the impatient robinson  youve hit it pardyouve rung the bell every time  but she says wants thet money down or ill and here i couldnt get to hear the rest  and then he kinder coaxes and she says sorter sassy but listenin all the timewoman like ye know eve and the sarpintand she says ill see tomorrow  and he says you wont blow on me and i gets excited and peeps in and may i be teetotally durned ef i didnt see  what yelled the crowd  why daddy on his knees to that there fancy dancer grace somerset now if mammys ghost is meanderin round why ets about time she left the cemetery and put in an appearance in jacksons hall  thets all  look yar boys said robinson rising i dont know ez its the square thing to spile daddys fun  i dont object to it provided she aint takin in the old man and givin him dead away  but ez were his guardeens i propose that we go down thar and see the lady and find out ef her intentions is honorable  if she means marry and the old man persists why i reckon we kin give the young couple a sendoff thet wont disgrace this yer camp  hey boys  it is unnecessary to say that the proposition was received with acclamation and that the crowd at once departed on their discreet mission  but the result was never known for the next morning brought a shock to roughandready before which all other interest paled to nothingness  the grave of mammy downey was found violated and despoiled the coffin opened and half filled with the papers and accounts of the robbed benevolent associations but the body of mammy was gone nor on examination did it appear that the sacred and ancient form of that female had ever reposed in its recesses  daddy downey was not to be found nor is it necessary to say that the ingenuous grace somerset was also missing  for three days the reason of roughandready trembled in the balance no work was done in the ditches in the flume nor in the mills groups of men stood by the grave of the lamented relict of daddy downey as openmouthed and vacant as that sepulchre  never since the great earthquake of 52 had roughandready been so stirred to its deepest foundations  on the third day the sheriff of calaverasa quiet gentle thoughtful manarrived in town and passed from one to the other of excited groups dropping here and there detached but concise and practical information  yes gentlemen you are right mrs downey is not dead because there wasnt any mrs downey  her part was played by george f fenwick of sydneya ticketofleaveman who was they say a good actor downey  oh yes downey was jem flanigan who in 52 used to run the variety troupe in australia where miss somerset made her debut  stand back a little boys  steady  the money oh yes theyve got away with that sure  how are ye joe  why youre looking well and hearty  i rather expected ye court week hows things your way  then they were only playactors joe hall broke in a dozen voices  i reckon returned the sheriff coolly  and for a matter o five blank years said whisky dick sadly they played this camp    jinny  i think that the few who were permitted to know and love the object of this sketch spent the rest of their days not only in an attitude of apology for having at first failed to recognize her higher nature but of remorse that they should have ever lent a credulous ear to a priori tradition concerning her family characteristics she had not escaped that calumny which she shared with the rest of her sex for those youthful follies levities and indiscretions which belong to immaturity  it is very probable that the firmness that distinguished her maturer will in youth might have been taken for obstinacy that her nice discrimination might at the same period have been taken for adolescent caprice and that the positive expression of her quick intellect might have been thought youthful impertinence before her years had won respect for her judgment  she was foaled at indian creek and one month later when she was brought over to sawyers bar was considered the smallest donkey ever seen in the foothills  the legend that she was brought over in one of dan the quartz crushers boots required corroboration from that gentleman but his denial being evidently based upon a masculine vanity regarding the size of his foot rather than a desire to be historically accurate it went for nothing  it is certain that for the next two months she occupied the cabin of dan until perhaps incensed at this and other scandals she one night made her way out  i hadnt the least idee wot woz comin said dan but about midnight i seemed to hear hail onto the roof and a shower of rocks and stones like to a blast started in the canyon when i got up and struck a light thar was suthin like onto a cord o kindlin wood and splinters whar shed stood asleep and a hole in the side o the shanty andno jinny lookin at them hoofs o hernand mighty porty they is to look at tooyou would allow she could do it  i fear that this performance laid the foundation of her later infelicitous reputation and perhaps awakened in her youthful breast a misplaced ambition and an emulation which might at that time have been diverted into a nobler channel  for the fame of this juvenile performanceand its possible promise in the futurebrought at once upon her the dangerous flattery and attention of the whole camp  under intelligently directed provocation she would repeat her misguided exercise until most of the scanty furniture of the cabin was reduced to a hopeless wreck and sprains and callosities were developed upon the limbs of her admirers  yet even at this early stage of her history that penetrating intellect which was in after years her dominant quality was evident to all  she could not be made to kick at quartz tailings at a barrel of boston crackers or at the head or shin of nigger pete  an artistic discrimination economized her surplus energy  ef youll notiss said dan with a large parental softness she never lets herself out to onst like them mules or any jackass ez ive heerd of but kinder holds herself in and so to speak takes her bearingssorter feels round gently with that off foot takes her distance and her rest and then with that ar foot hoverin round in the air softly like an angels wing and a gentle dreamy kind o look in them eyes she lites out  dont ye jinny thar jist ez i told ye continued dan with an artists noble forgetfulness of self as he slowly crawled from the splintered ruin of the barrel on which he had been sitting  thur did ye ever see the like  did ye dream that all the while i was talkin she was a meditatin that  the same artistic perception and noble reticence distinguished her bray  it was one of which a less sagacious animal would have been foolishly vain or ostentatiously prodigal  it was a contralto of great compass and profundityreaching from low g to high cperhaps a trifle stronger in the lower register and not altogether free from a nasal falsetto in the upper  daring and brilliant as it was in the middle notes it was perhaps more musically remarkable for its great sustaining power  the element of surprise always entered into the hearers enjoyment long after any ordinary strain of human origin would have ceased faint echoes of jinnys last note were perpetually recurring  but it was as an intellectual and moral expression that her bray was perfect  as far beyond her size as were her aspirations it was a free and running commentary of scorn at all created things extant with ironical and sardonic additions that were terrible  it reviled all human endeavor it quenched all sentiment it suspended frivolity it scattered reverie it paralyzed action  it was omnipotent more wonderful and characteristic than all the very existence of this tremendous organ was unknown to the camp for six months after the arrival of its modest owner and only revealed to them under circumstances that seemed to point more conclusively than ever to her rare discretion  it was the beginning of a warm night and the middle of a heated political discussion  sawyers bar had gathered in force at the crossing and by the light of flaring pine torches cheered and applauded the rival speakers who from a rude platform addressed the excited multitude  partisan spirit at that time ran high in the foothills crimination and recrimination challenge reply accusation and retort had already inflamed the meeting and colonel bungstarter after a withering review of his opponents policy culminated with a personal attack upon the career and private character of the eloquent and chivalrous colonel culpepper starbottle of siskiyou  that eloquent and chivalrous gentleman was known to be present it was rumored that the attack was expected to provoke a challenge from colonel starbottle which would give bungstarter the choice of weapons and deprive starbottle of his advantage as a dead shot  it was whispered also that the sagacious starbottle aware of this fact would retaliate in kind so outrageously as to leave bungstarter no recourse but to demand satisfaction on the spot  as colonel starbottle rose the eager crowd drew together elbowing each other in rapt and ecstatic expectancy  he cant get even on bungstarter onless he allows his sister ran off with a nigger or that he put up his grandmother at draw poker and lost her whispered the quartz crusher kin he  all ears were alert particularly the very long and hairy ones just rising above the railing of the speakers platform for jinny having a feminine distrust of solitude and a fondness for show had followed her master to the meeting and had insinuated herself upon the platform where way was made for her with that frontier courtesy always extended to her age and sex  colonel starbottle stertorous and purple advanced to the railing there he unbuttoned his collar and laid his neckcloth aside then with his eye fixed on his antagonist he drew off his blue frock coat and thrusting one hand into his ruffled shirt front and raising the other to the dark canopy above him he opened his vindictive lips  the action the attitude were starbottles  but the voice was not  for at that supreme moment a brayso profound so appalling so utterly soulsubduing so paralyzing that everything else sank to mere insignificance beside itfilled woods and sky and air  for a moment only the multitude gasped in speechless astonishmentit was a moment onlyand then the welkin roared with their shouts  in vain silence was commanded in vain colonel starbottle with a ghastly smile remarked that he recognized in the interruption the voice and the intellect of the opposition the laugh continued the more as it was discovered that jinny had not yet finished and was still recurring to her original theme  gentlemen gasped starbottle any attempt by heehaw from jinny brutal buffoonery to restrict the right of free speech to all a prolonged assent from jinny is worthy only the dastardlybut here a diminuendo so long drawn as to appear a striking imitation of the colonels own apoplectic sentences drowned his voice with shrieks of laughter  it must not be supposed that during this performance a vigorous attempt was not made to oust jinny from the platform  but all in vain equally demoralizing in either extremity jinny speedily cleared a circle with her flying hoofs smashed the speakers table and water pitcher sent the railing flying in fragments over the cheering crowd and only succumbed to two blankets in which with her head concealed she was finally dragged half captive half victor from the field even then a muffled and supplemental bray that came from the woods at intervals drew half the crowd away and reduced the other half to mere perfunctory hearers  the demoralized meeting was adjourned colonel starbottles withering reply remained unuttered and the bungstarter party were triumphant  for the rest of the evening jinny was the heroine of the hour but no cajolery nor flattery could induce her to again exhibit her powers  in vain did dean of angels extemporize a short harangue in the hope that jinny would be tempted to reply in vain was every provocation offered that might sting her sensitive nature to eloquent revolt  she replied only with her heels  whether or not this was simple caprice or whether she was satisfied with her maiden effort or indignant at her subsequent treatment she remained silent  she made her little game said dan who was a political adherent of starbottles and who yet from that day enjoyed the great speakers undying hatred and even if me and her dont agree on politicsyou let her alone  alas it would have been well for dan if he could have been true to his instincts but the offer of one hundred dollars from the bungstarter party proved too tempting  she passed irrevocably from his hands into those of the enemy  but any reader of these lines will i trust rejoice to hear that this attempt to restrain free political expression in the foothills failed signally  for although she was again covertly introduced on the platform by the bungstarters and placed face to face with colonel starbottle at murphys camp she was dumb  even a brass band failed to excite her emulation  either she had become disgusted with politics or the higher prices paid by the party to other and less effective speakers aroused her jealousy and shocked her selfesteem but she remained a passive spectator  when the hon sylvester rourback who received for the use of his political faculties for a single night double the sum for which she was purchased outright appeared on the same platform with herself she forsook it hurriedly and took to the woods  here she might have starved but for the intervention of one mccarty a poor market gardener who found her and gave her food and shelter under the implied contract that she should forsake politics and go to work the latter she for a long time resisted but as she was considered large enough by this time to draw a cart mccarty broke her to single harness with a severe fracture of his leg and the loss of four teeth and a small spring wagon  at length when she could be trusted to carry his wares to murphys camp and could be checked from entering a shop with the cart attached to hera fact of which she always affected perfect disbeliefher education was considered as complete as that of the average california donkey it was still unsafe to leave her alone as she disliked solitude and always made it a point to join any group of loungers with her unnecessary cart and even to follow some goodlooking miner to his cabin  the first time this peculiarity was discovered by her owner was on his return to the street after driving a bargain within the walls of the temperance hotel  jinny was nowhere to be seen  her devious course however was pleasingly indicated by vegetables that strewed the road until she was at last tracked to the veranda of the arcade saloon where she was found looking through the window at a game of euchre and only deterred by the impeding cart from entering the building  a visit one sunday to the little catholic chapel at french camp where she attempted to introduce an antiphonal service and the cart brought shame and disgrace upon her unlucky master  for the cart contained freshlygathered vegetables and the fact that mccarty had been sabbathbreaking was painfully evident  father sullivan was quick to turn an incident that provoked only the risibilities of his audience into a moral lesson  its the poor dumb beast that has a more christian sowl than michael he commented but here jinny assented so positively that they were fain to drag her away by main force  to her eccentric and thoughtless youth succeeded a calm maturity in which her conservative sagacity was steadily developed  she now worked for her living subject however to a nice discrimination by which she limited herself to a certain amount of work beyond which neither threats beatings nor cajoleries would force her at certain hours she would start for the stable with or without the incumbrances of the cart or michael turning two long and deaf ears on all expostulation or entreaty  now god be good to me said michael one day picking himself out from a ditch as he gazed sorrowfully after the flying heels of jinny but its only the second load of cabbages im bringin the day and if shes shtruck now its ruined i am entoirely  but he was mistaken after two hours of rumination jinny returned of her own free will having evidently mistaken the time and it is said even consented to draw an extra load to make up the deficiency  it may be imagined from this and other circumstances that michael stood a little in awe of jinnys superior intellect and that jinny occasionally with the instinct of her sex presumed upon it  after the sunday episode already referred to she was given her liberty on that day a privilege she gracefully recognized by somewhat unbending her usual austerity in the indulgence of a saturnine humor  she would visit the mining camps and grazing lazily and thoughtfully before the cabins would by various artifices and coquetries known to the female heart induce some credulous stranger to approach her with the intention of taking a ride she would submit hesitatingly to a halter allow him to mount her back and with every expression of timid and fearful reluctance at last permit him to guide her in a laborious trot out of sight of human habitation  what happened then was never clearly known  in a few moments the camp would be aroused by shouts and execrations and the spectacle of jinny tearing by at a frightful pace with the stranger clinging with his arms around her neck afraid to slip off from terror of her circumvolving heels and vainly imploring assistance  again and again she would dash by the applauding groups adding the aggravation of her voice to the danger of her heels until suddenly wheeling she would gallop to carters pond and deposit her luckless freight in the muddy ditch  this practical joke was repeated until one sunday she was approached by juan ramirez a mexican vaquero booted and spurred and carrying a riata  a crowd was assembled to see her discomfiture  but to the intense disappointment of the camp jinny after quietly surveying the stranger uttered a sardonic bray and ambled away to the little cemetery on the hill whose tangled chapparal effectually prevented all pursuit by her skilled antagonist  from that day she forsook the camp and spent her sabbaths in mortuary reflections among the pine headboards and cold hic jacets of the dead  happy would it have been if this circumstance which resulted in the one poetic episode of her life had occurred earlier for the cemetery was the favorite resort of miss jessie lawton a gentle invalid from san francisco who had sought the foothills for the balsam of pine and fir and in the faint hope that the freshness of the wild roses might call back her own  the extended views from the cemetery satisfied miss lawtons artistic taste and here frequently with her sketchbook in hand she indulged that taste and a certain shy reserve which kept her from contact with strangers  on one of the leaves of that sketchbook appears a study of a donkeys head being none other than the grave features of jinny as once projected timidly over the artists shoulder the preliminaries of this intimacy have never transpired nor is it a settled fact if jinny made the first advances  the result was only known to the men of sawyers bar by a vision which remained fresh in their memories long after the gentle lady and her fourfooted friend had passed beyond their voices  as two of the tunnelmen were returning from work one evening they chanced to look up the little trail kept sacred from secular intrusion that led from the cemetery to the settlement  in the dim twilight against a sunset sky they beheld a palefaced girl riding slowly toward them  with a delicate instinct new to those rough men they drew closer in the shadow of the bushes until she passed there was no mistaking the familiar grotesqueness of jinny there was no mistaking the languid grace of miss lawton  but a wreath of wild roses was around jinnys neck from her long ears floated miss jessies hat ribbons and a mischievous girlish smile was upon miss jessies face as fresh as the azaleas in her hair  by the next day the story of this gentle apparition was known to a dozen miners in camp and all were sworn to secrecy  but the next evening and the next from the safe shadows of the woods they watched and drank in the beauty of that fanciful and all unconscious procession  they kept their secret and never a whisper or footfall from these rough men broke its charm or betrayed their presence  the man who could have shocked the sensitive reserve of the young girl would have paid for it with his life  and then one day the character of the procession changed and this little incident having been told it was permitted that jinny should follow her friend caparisoned even as before but this time by the rougher but no less loving hands of men  when the cortege reached the ferry where the gentle girl was to begin her silent journey to the sea jinny broke from those who held her and after a frantic effort to mount the barge fell into the swiftly rushing stanislaus  a dozen stout arms were stretched to save her and a rope skilfully thrown was caught around her feet  for an instant she was passive and as it seemed saved  but the next moment her dominant instinct returned and with one stroke of her powerful heel she snapped the rope in twain and so drifted with her mistress to the sea    roger catrons friend  i think that from the beginning we all knew how it would end  he had always been so quiet and conventional although by nature an impulsive man always so temperate and abstemious although a man with a quick appreciation of pleasure always so cautious and practical although an imaginative man that when at last one by one he loosed these bands and gave himself up to a life perhaps not worse than other lives which the world has accepted as the natural expression of their various owners we at once decided that the case was a hopeless one  and when one night we picked him up out of the union ditch a begrimed and weatherworn drunkard a hopeless debtor a selfconfessed spendthrift and a halfconscious maudlin imbecile we knew that the end had come the wife he had abandoned had in turn deserted him the woman he had misled had already realized her folly and left him with her reproaches the associates of his reckless life who had used and abused him had found him no longer of service or even amusement and clearly there was nothing left to do but to hand him over to the state and we took him to the nearest penitential asylum conscious of the samaritan deed we went back to our respective wives and told his story  it is only just to say that these sympathetic creatures were more interested in the philanthropy of their respective husbands than in its miserable object  it was good and kind in you dear said loving mrs maston to her spouse as returning home that night he flung his coat on a chair with an air of fatigued righteousness it was like your kind heart to care for that beast but after he left that good wife of histhat perfect saintto take up with that awful woman i think id have left him to die in the ditch  only to think of it dear a woman that you wouldnt speak to  here mr maston coughed slightly colored a little mumbled something about women not understanding some things that men were men etc and then went comfortably to sleep leaving the outcast happily oblivious of all things and especially this criticism locked up in hangtown jail  for the next twelve hours he lay there apathetic and halfconscious recovering from this after a while he became furious vengeful and unmanageable filling the cell and corridor with maledictions of friend and enemy and again sullen morose and watchful  then he refused food and did not sleep pacing his limits with the incessant feverish tread of a caged tiger  two physicians diagnosing his case from the scant facts pronounced him insane and he was accordingly transported to sacramento  but on the way thither he managed to elude the vigilance of his guards and escaped  the alarm was given a hue and cry followed him the best detectives of san francisco were on his track and finally recovered his dead bodyemaciated and wasted by exhaustion and feverin the stanislaus marshes identified it and receiving the reward of 1000 offered by his surviving relatives and family assisted in legally establishing the end we had predicted  unfortunately for the moral the facts were somewhat inconsistent with the theory  a day or two after the remains were discovered and identified the real body of roger catron aged 52 years slight irongray hair and shabby in apparel as the advertisement read dragged itself travelworn trembling and disheveled up the steep slope of deadwood hill  how he should do it he had long since determinedever since he had hidden his derringer a mere baby pistol from the vigilance of his keepers where he should do it he had settled within his mind only within the last few moments  deadwood hill was seldom frequented his body might lie there for months before it was discovered  he had once thought of the river but he remembered it had an ugly way of exposing its secrets on sandbar and shallow and that the body of whisky jim bloated and disfigured almost beyond recognition had been once delivered to the eyes of sandy bar before breakfast on the left bank of the stanislaus  he toiled up through the chimisal that clothed the southern slope of the hill until he reached the bald stormscarred cap of the mountain ironically decked with the picked featherless plumes of a few dying pines  one stripped of all but two lateral branches brought a boyish recollection to his fevered brain  against a background of dull sunset fire it extended two gaunt armsblack rigid and pathetic  calvary  with the very word upon his lips he threw himself face downwards on the ground beneath it and with his fingers clutched in the soil lay there for some moments silent and still  in this attitude albeit a skeptic and unorthodox man he prayed  i cannot sayindeed i dare not saythat his prayer was heard or that god visited him thus  let us rather hope that all there was of god in him in this crucial moment of agony and shame strove outward and upward  howbeit when the moon rose he rose too perhaps a trifle less steady than the planet and began to descend the hill with feverish haste yet with this marked difference between his present haste and his former recklessness that it seemed to have a welldefined purpose  when he reached the road again he struck into a wellworn trail where in the distance a light faintly twinkled following this beacon he kept on and at last flung himself heavily against the door of the little cabin from whose window the light had shone  as he did so it opened upon the figure of a square thickset man who in the impetuosity of catrons onset received him literally in his arms  captain dick said roger catron hoarsely captain dick save me for gods sake save me  captain dick without a word placed a large protecting hand upon catrons shoulder allowed it to slip to his waist and then drew his visitor quietly but firmly within the cabin  yet in the very movement he had managed to gently and unobtrusively possess himself of catrons pistol  save ye  from which asked captain dick as quietly and unobtrusively dropping the derringer in a flour sack  from everything gasped catron from the men that are hounding me from my family from my friends but most of allfrom frommyself  he had in turn grasped captain dick and forced him frenziedly against the wall  the captain released himself and taking the hands of his excited visitor said slowly  ye wan some blue masssuthin to unload your liver  ill get it up for ye  but captain dick im an outcast shamed disgraced  two on them pills taken now and two in the morning continued the captain gravely rolling a bolus in his fingers will bring yer head to the wind again  yer fallin to leeward all the time and ye want to brace up  but captain continued the agonized man again clutching the sinewy arms of his host and forcing his livid face and fixed eyes within a few inches of captain dicks hear me  you must and shall hear me ive been in jaildo you hearin jail like a common felon  ive been sent to the asylum like a demented pauper  ive  two now and two in the morning continued the captain quietly releasing one hand only to place two enormous pills in the mouth of the excited catron thar nowa drink o whiskythar thatll dojust enough to take the taste out of yer mouth wash it down and belay it so to speak  and how are the mills running ginrally over at the bar  captain dick hear meif you are my friend for gods sake hear me an hour ago i should have been a dead man  they say that sam bolin hez sold out of the excelsior  captain dick  listen for gods sake i have suffered  but captain dick was engaged in critically examining his man  i guess ill ladle ye out some o that soothin mixture i bought down at simpsons t other day he said reflectively  and i onderstand the boys up on the bar think the rains will set in airly  but here nature was omnipotent  worn by exhaustion excitement and fever and possibly a little affected by captain dicks later potion roger catron turned white and lapsed against the wall  in an instant captain dick had caught him as a child lifted him in his stalwart arms wrapped a blanket around him and deposited him in his bunk yet even in his prostration catron made one more despairing appeal for mental sympathy from his host  i know im sickdying perhaps he gasped from under the blankets but promise me whatever comes tell my wifesay to  it has been lookin considble like rain lately hereabouts continued the captain coolly in a kind of amphibious slang characteristic of the man but in these yer latitudes no man kin set up to be a weather sharp  captain will you hear me  yer goin to sleep now said the captain potentially  but captain they are pursuing me  if they should track me here  thar is a rifle over thar and yers my navy revolver  when ive emptied them and want you to bear a hand ill call ye  just now your lay is to turn in  its my watch  there was something so positive strong assuring and a little awesome in the captains manner that the trembling nervouslyprostrated man beneath the blankets forbore to question further in a few moments his breathing albeit hurried and irregular announced that he slept  the captain then arose for a moment critically examined the sleeping man holding his head a little on one side whistling softly and stepping backwards to get a good perspective but always with contemplative good humor as if catron were a work of art which he the captain had created yet one that he was not yet entirely satisfied with  then he put a large peajacket over his flannel blouse dragged a mexican serape from the corner and putting it over his shoulders opened the cabin door sat down on the doorstep and leaning back against the doorpost composed himself to meditation  the moon lifted herself slowly over the crest of deadwood hill and looked down not unkindly on his broad white shaven face round and smooth as her own disc encircled with a thin fringe of white hair and whiskers indeed he looked so like the prevailing caricatures in a comic almanac of planets with dimly outlined features that the moon would have been quite justified in flirting with him as she clearly did insinuating a twinkle into his keen gray eyes making the shadow of a dimple on his broad fat chin and otherwise idealizing him after the fashion of her heroworshiping sex touched by these benign influences captain dick presently broke forth in melody  his song was various but chiefly i think confined to the recital of the exploits of one lorenzo who as related by himself      shipped on board of a liner                 renzo boys renzo  a fact that seemed to have deprived him at once of all metre grammar or even the power of coherent narration  at times a groan or a halfarticulate cry would come from the bunk whereon roger catron lay a circumstance that always seemed to excite captain dick to greater effort and more rapid vocalization  toward morning in the midst of a prolonged howl from the captain who was finishing the starboard watch ahoy in three different keys roger catrons voice broke suddenly and sharply from his enwrappings  dry up you dd old fool will you  captain dick stopped instantly  rising to his feet and looking over the landscape he took all nature into his confidence in one inconceivably arch and crafty wink  hes coming up to the wind he said softly rubbing his hands  the pills is fetchin him steady now boys steady  steady as she goes on her course and with another wink of ineffable wisdom he entered the cabin and locked the door   meanwhile the best society of sandy bar was kind to the newlymade widow  without being definitely expressed it was generally felt that sympathy with her was now safe and carried no moral responsibility with it  even practical and pecuniary aid which before had been withheld lest it should be diverted from its proper intent and perhaps through the weakness of the wife made to minister to the wickedness of the husbandeven that was now openly suggested everybody felt that somebody should do something for the widow  a few did it  her own sex rallied to her side generally with large sympathy but unfortunately small pecuniary or practical result  at last when the feasibility of her taking a boardinghouse in san francisco and identifying herself with that large class of american gentlewomen who have seen better days but clearly are on the road never to see them again was suggested a few of her own and her husbands rich relatives came to the front to rehabilitate her  it was easier to take her into their homes as an equal than to refuse to call upon her as the mistress of a lodginghouse in the adjoining street and upon inspection it was found that she was still quite an eligible partie prepossessing and withal in her widows weeds a kind of poetical and sentimental presence as necessary in a wealthy and fashionable american family as a work of art  yes poor caroline has had a sad sad history the languid mrs walker catron would say and we all sympathize with her deeply walker always regards her as a sister  what was this dark history never came out but its very mystery always thrilled the visitor and seemed to indicate plainly the respectability of the hostess  an american family without a genteel skeleton in its closet could scarcely add to that gossip which keeps society from forgetting its members  nor was it altogether unnatural that presently mrs roger catron lent herself to this sentimental deception and began to think that she really was a more exquisitely aggrieved woman than she had imagined  at times when this vague load of iniquity put upon her dead husband assumed through the mystery of her friends the rumor of murder and highway robbery and even an attempt upon her own life she went to her room a little frightened and had a good cry reappearing more mournful and pathetic than ever and corroborating the suspicions of her friends  indeed one or two impulsive gentlemen fired by her pathetic eyelids openly regretted that the deceased had not been hanged to which mrs walker catron responded that thank heaven they were spared at least that disgrace and so sent conviction into the minds of her hearers  it was scarcely two months after this painful close of her matrimonial life that one rainy february morning the servant brought a card to mrs roger catron bearing the following inscription            richard graeme macleod   women are more readily affected by names than we are and there was a certain highland respectability about this that albeit not knowing its possessor impelled mrs catron to send word that she would be down in a few moments  at the end of this femininely indefinite perioda quarter of an hour by the french clock on the mantelpiecemrs roger catron made her appearance in the receptionroom  it was a dull wet day as i have said before but on the contra costa hills the greens and a few flowers were already showing a promise of rejuvenescence and an early spring  there was something of this i think in mrs catrons presence shown perhaps in the coquettish bow of a ribbon in a larger and more delicate ruche in a tighter belting of her black cashmere gown but still there was a suggestion of recent rain in the eyes and threatening weather  as she entered the room the sun came out too and revealed the prettiness and delicacy of her figure and i regret to state also the somewhat obtrusive plainness of her visitor  i knew yed be sorter disappinted at first not gettin the regular bearings o my name but im captain dick  mebbe yeve heard your husbandthat is your husband ez waz roger catronspeak o me  mrs catron feeling herself outraged and deceived in belt ruche and ribbon freezingly admitted that she had heard of him before  in course said the captain why lord love ye mrs catronez wazhe used to be all the time talkin of ye  and allers in a free easy confidential way  why one nightdont ye rememberwhen he came home carryin mebbee more canvas than was seamanlike and you shet him out the house and laid for him with a broomstick or one o them crokay mallets i disremember which and he kem over to me ole captain dick and i sez to him sez i why roger thems only love pats and yer condishun is such ez to make any woman madlike  why lord bless ye there aint enny of them mootool differences you and him hed ez i doesnt knows on and didnt always stand by and lend ye a hand and heave in a word or two of advice when called on  mrs catron ice everywhere but in her pink cheeks was glad that mr catron seemed to have always a friend to whom he confided everything even the base falsehoods he had invented  mebbe now they waz falsehoods said the captain thoughtfully but dont ye go to think he added conscientiously that he kept on that tack all the time  why that day he made a raise gambling i think over at dutch flat and give ye them braceletsregular solid goldwhy it would have done your heart good to have heard him talk about yousaid you had the prettiest arm in californy  well said the captain looking around for a suitable climax well youd have thought that he was sorter proud of ye why i woz with him in frisco when he bought that a1 prize bonnet for ye for 75 and not hevin over 50 in his pocket borryed the other 25 outer me  mebbe it was a little fancy for a bonnet but i allers thought he took it a little too much to heart when you swopped it off for that dollar varden dress just because that lawyer maxwell said the dollar vardens was becomin to ye  ye know i reckon he was always sorter jealous of that thar shark  may i venture to ask what your business is with me interrupted mrs catron sharply  in course said the captain rising  ye see he said apologetically we got to talking o roger and ole times and i got a little out o my course  its a matter of he began to fumble in his pockets and finally produced a small memorandumbook which he glanced overits a matter of 250  i dont understand you said mrs catron in indignant astonishment  on the 15th of july said the captain consulting his memorandumbook roger sold his claim at nyes ford for 1500  now les see  thar was nigh on 350 ez he admitted to me he lost at poker and well add 50 to that for treating suppers and drinks ginrallyput roger down for 400  then there was you  now you spent 250 on your trip to frisco thet summer then 200 went for them presents you sent your aunt jane and thar was 400 for house expenses well thet foots up 1250  now whats become of thet other 250  mrs catrons womans impulse to retaliate sharply overcame her first natural indignation at her visitors impudence  therein she lost womanlike her ground of vantage  perhaps the woman he fled with can tell you she said savagely  thet said the captain slowly is a good a reasonable idee but it aint true from all i can gather she lent him money  it didnt go thar  roger catron left me penniless said mrs catron hotly  thets jist what gets me  you oughter have 250 somewhar lying round  mrs catron saw her error  may i ask what right you have to question me  if you have any i must refer you to my lawyer or my brotherinlaw if you have none i hope you will not oblige me to call the servants to put you from the house  thet sounds reasonable and square too said the captain thoughtfully ive a power of attorney from roger catron to settle up his affairs and pay his debts given a week afore them detectives handed ye over his dead body  but i thought that you and me might save lawyers fees and all fuss and feathers ef in a sociable sadlike waylookin back sorter on roger ez you and me once knew himwe had a quiet talk together  good morning sir said mrs catron rising stiffly  the captain hesitated a moment a slight flush of color came in his face as he at last rose as the lady backed out of the room  good morning maam said the captain and departed  very little was known of this interview except the general impression in the family that mrs catron had successfully resisted a vague attempt at blackmail from one of her husbands former dissolute companions  yet it is only fair to say that mrs catron snapped up quite savagely two male sympathizers on this subject and cried a good deal for two days afterward and once in the hearing of her sisterinlaw to that ladys great horror wished she was dead  a week after this interview as lawyer phillips sat in his office he was visited by macleod  recognizing possibly some practical difference between the widow and the lawyer captain dick this time first produced his credentialsa power of attorney  i need not tell you said phillips that the death of your principal renders this instrument invalid and i suppose you know that leaving no will and no property his estate has not been administered upon  mebbe it is and mebbe it isnt  but i haint askin for anythin but information  there was a bit o propty and a mill onto it over at heavytree ez sold for 10000  i dont see said the captain consulting his memorandumbook ez he got anything out of it  it was mortgaged for 7000 said the lawyer quickly and the interest and fees amount to about 3000 more  the mortgage was given as security for a note  yes a gambling debt said the lawyer sharply  thets so and my belief ez that it wasnt a square game  he shouldnt hev given no note  why dont ye mind way back in 60 when you and me waz in marysville that night that you bucked agin faro and lost seving hundred dollars and then refoosed to take up your checks saying it was fraud and a gambling debt  and dont ye mind when that chap kicked ye and i helped to drag him off yeand  im busy now mr macleod said phillips hastily my clerk will give you all the information you require  good morning  its mighty queer said the captain thoughtfully as he descended the stairs but the moment the conversation gets limber and sociablelike and i gets to runnin free under easy sail its always good morning captain and were becalmed  by some occult influence all the foregoing conversation slightly exaggerated and the whole interview of the captain with the widow with sundry additions became the common property of sandy bar to the great delight of the boys  there was scarcely a person who had ever had business or social relations with roger catron whom the frozen truth as sandy bar delighted to designate the captain had not interviewed as simply and directly  it is said that he closed a conversation with one of the san francisco detectives who had found roger catrons body in these words and now hevin got throo bizness i was goin to ask ye whats gone of matt jones who was with ye in the bush in austraily  lord how he got me quite interested in ye telling me how you and him got out on a ticketofleave and was chased by them milishy guards and at last swam out to a san francisco bark and escaped but here the inevitable pressure of previous business always stopped the captains conversational flow  the natural result of this was a singular reaction in favor of the late roger catron in the public sentiment of sandy bar so strong indeed as to induce the rev mr joshua mcsnagly the next sunday to combat it with the moral of catrons life  after the service he was approached in the vestibule and in the hearing of some of his audience by captain dick with the following compliment in many pints ye hed jess got roger catron down to a hair  i knew yed do it why lord love ye you and him had pints in common and when he giv ye that hundred dollars arter the fire in sacramento to help ye rebuild the parsonage he said to meme not likin ye on account o my being on the committee that invited ye to resign from marysville all along o that affair with deacon pursells darter and a piece she was parson ehwell roger he ups and sez to me every man hez his faults sez he and sez he theres no reason why a parson aint a human being like us and that gal o pursells is pizen ez i know  so ye see i seed that ye was hittin yourself over catrons shoulder like them early martyrs  but here as captain dick was clearly blocking up all egress from the church the sexton obliged him to move on and again he was stopped in his conversational career  but only for a time  before long it was whispered that captain dick had ordered a meeting of the creditors debtors and friends of roger catron at robinsons hall  it was suggested with some show of reason that this had been done at the instigation of various practical jokers of sandy bar who had imposed on the simple directness of the captain and the attendance that night certainly indicated something more than a mere business meeting all of sandy bar crowded into robinsons hall and long before captain dick made his appearance on the platform with his inevitable memorandumbook every inch of floor was crowded  the captain began to read the expenditures of roger catron with relentless fidelity of detail  the several losses by poker the whisky bills and the record of a jamboree at tooleys the vague expenses whereof footed up 275 were received with enthusiastic cheers by the audience  a single milliners bill for 125 was hailed with delight 100 expended in treating the vestal virgin combination troupe almost canonized his memory 50 for a simple buggy ride with deacon fisk brought down the house 500 advanced without security and unpaid for the electioneering expenses of assemblyman jones who had recently introduced a bill to prevent gambling and the sale of lager beer on sundays was received with an ominous groan  one or two other items of money loaned occasioned the withdrawal of several gentlemen from the audience amidst the hisses or ironical cheers of the others  at last captain dick stopped and advanced to the footlights  gentlemen and friends he said slowly  i foots up 25000 as roger catron hez made fair and square in this yer county  i foots up 27000 ez he has spent in this yer county  i puts it to you ez menfarminded menef this man was a pauper and debtor i put it to you ez farminded menez free and easy menez political economistsez this the kind of men to impoverish a county  an overwhelming and instantaneous no almost drowned the last utterance of the speaker  thar is only one item said captain dick slowly only one item that ez menez farminded menez political economistsit seems to me we hez the right to question  its this  thar is an item read to you by me of 2000 paid to certing san francisco detectives paid out o the assets o roger catron for the finding of roger catrons body gentlemen of sandy bar and friends i found that body and yer it is  and roger catron a little pale and nervous but palpably in the flesh stepped upon the platform  of course the newspapers were full of it the next day  of course in due time it appeared as a garbled and romantic item in the san francisco press  of course mrs catron on reading it fainted and for two days said that this last cruel blow ended all relations between her husband and herself  on the third day she expressed her belief that if he had had the slightest feeling for her he would long since for the sake of mere decency have communicated with her  on the fourth day she thought she had been perhaps badly advised had an open quarrel with her relatives and intimated that a wife had certain obligations etc  on the sixth day still not hearing from him she quoted scripture spoke of a seventytimesseven forgiveness and went generally into mild hysterics  on the seventh she left in the morning train for sandy bar  and really i dont know as i have anything more to tell  i dined with them recently and upon my word a more decorous correct conventional and dull dinner i never ate in my life    who was my quiet friend  stranger  the voice was not loud but clear and penetrating  i looked vainly up and down the narrow darkening trail  no one in the fringe of alder ahead no one on the gullied slope behind  o stranger  this time a little impatiently  the california classical vocative o always meant business  i looked up and perceived for the first time on the ledge thirty feet above me another trail parallel with my own and looking down upon me through the buckeye bushes a small man on a black horse  five things to be here noted by the circumspect mountaineer first the localitylonely and inaccessible and away from the regular faring of teamsters and miners  secondly the strangers superior knowledge of the road from the fact that the other trail was unknown to the ordinary traveler  thirdly that he was well armed and equipped fourthly that he was better mounted fifthly that any distrust or timidity arising from the contemplation of these facts had better be kept to ones self  all this passed rapidly through my mind as i returned his salutation  got any tobacco he asked  i had and signified the fact holding up the pouch inquiringly  all right ill come down  ride on and ill jine ye on the slide  the slide  here was a new geographical discovery as odd as the second trail  i had ridden over the trail a dozen times and seen no communication between the ledge and trail  nevertheless i went on a hundred yards or so when there was a sharp crackling in the underbrush a shower of stones on the trail and my friend plunged through the bushes to my side down a grade that i should scarcely have dared to lead my horse  there was no doubt he was an accomplished rideranother fact to be noted  as he ranged beside me i found i was not mistaken as to his size he was quite under the medium height and but for a pair of cold gray eyes was rather commonplace in feature  youve got a good horse there i suggested  he was filling his pipe from my pouch but looked up a little surprised and said of course  he then puffed away with the nervous eagerness of a man long deprived of that sedative finally between the puffs he asked me whence i came  i replied from lagrange  he looked at me a few moments curiously but on my adding that i had only halted there for a few hours he said i thought i knew every man between lagrange and indian spring but somehow i sorter disremember your face and your name  not particularly caring that he should remember either i replied half laughingly that as i lived the other side of indian spring it was quite natural  he took the rebuff if such it was so quietly that as an act of mere perfunctory politeness i asked him where he came from  lagrange  and you are going to  well that depends pretty much on how things pan out and whether i can make the riffle  he let his hand rest quite unconsciously on the leathern holster of his dragoon revolver yet with a strong suggestion to me of his ability to make the riffle if he wanted to and added but just now i was recknin on taking a little pasear with you  there was nothing offensive in his speech save its familiarity and the reflection perhaps that whether i objected or not he was quite able to do as he said  i only replied that if our pasear was prolonged beyond heavytree hill i should have to borrow his beast to my surprise he replied quietly thats so adding that the horse was at my disposal when he wasnt using it and half of it when he was  dick has carried double many a time before this he continued and kin do it again when your mustang gives out ill give you a lift and room to spare  i could not help smiling at the idea of appearing before the boys at red gulch en croupe with the stranger but neither could i help being oddly affected by the suggestion that his horse had done double duty before  on what occasion and why was a question i kept to myself we were ascending the long rocky flank of the divide the narrowness of the trail obliged us to proceed slowly and in file so that there was little chance for conversation had he been disposed to satisfy my curiosity  we toiled on in silence the buckeye giving way to chimisal the westering sun reflected again from the blank walls beside us blinding our eyes with its glare  the pines in the canyon below were olive gulfs of heat over which a hawk here and there drifted lazily or rising to our level cast a weird and gigantic shadow of slowly moving wings on the mountain side  the superiority of the strangers horse led him often far in advance and made me hope that he might forget me entirely or push on growing weary of waiting  but regularly he would halt by a bowlder or reappear from some chimisal where he had patiently halted  i was beginning to hate him mildly when at one of those reappearances he drew up to my side and asked me how i liked dickens  had he asked my opinion of huxley or darwin i could not have been more astonished  thinking it were possible that he referred to some local celebrity of lagrange i said hesitatingly  you mean  charles dickens  of course youve read him  which of his books do you like best  i replied with considerable embarrassment that i liked them allas i certainly did  he grasped my hand for a moment with a fervor quite unlike his usual phlegm and said thats me old man  dickens aint no slouch  you can count on him pretty much all the time  with this rough preface he launched into a criticism of the novelist which for intelligent sympathy and hearty appreciation i had rarely heard equaled  not only did he dwell upon the exuberance of his humor but upon the power of his pathos and the allpervading element of his poetry  i looked at the man in astonishment  i had considered myself a rather diligent student of the great master of fiction but the strangers felicity of quotation and illustration staggered me  it is true that his thought was not always clothed in the best language and often appeared in the slouching slangy undress of the place and period yet it never was rustic nor homespun and sometimes struck me with its precision and fitness  considerably softened toward him i tried him with other literature  but vainly  beyond a few of the lyrical and emotional poets he knew nothing  under the influence and enthusiasm of his own speech he himself had softened considerably offered to change horses with me readjusted my saddle with professional skill transferred my pack to his own horse insisted upon my sharing the contents of his whisky flask and noticing that i was unarmed pressed upon me a silvermounted derringer which he assured me he could warrant  these various offices of good will and the diversion of his talk beguiled me from noticing the fact that the trail was beginning to become obscure and unrecognizable  we were evidently pursuing a route unknown before to me  i pointed out the fact to my companion a little impatiently  he instantly resumed his old manner and dialect  well i reckon one trails as good as another and what hev ye got to say about it  i pointed out with some dignity that i preferred the old trail  mebbe you did  but youre jiss now takin a pasear with me  this yer trail will bring you right into indian spring and onnoticed and no questions asked  dont you mind now ill see you through  it was necessary here to make some stand against my strange companion i said firmly yet as politely as i could that i had proposed stopping over night with a friend  whar  i hesitated  the friend was an eccentric eastern man well known in the locality for his fastidiousness and his habits as a recluse a misanthrope of ample family and ample means he had chosen a secluded but picturesque valley in the sierras where he could rail against the world without opposition  lone valley or boston ranch as it was familiarly called was the one spot that the average miner both respected and feared  mr sylvester its proprietor had never affiliated with the boys nor had he ever lost their respect by any active opposition to their ideas  if seclusion had been his object he certainly was gratified nevertheless in the darkening shadows of the night and on a lonely and unknown trail i hesitated a little at repeating his name to a stranger of whom i knew so little  but my mysterious companion took the matter out of my hands  look yar he said suddenly thar aint but one place twixt yer and indian spring whar ye can stop and that is sylvesters  i assented a little sullenly  well said the stranger quietly and with a slight suggestion of conferring a favor on me ef yer pointed for sylvesterswhyi dont mind stopping thar with ye  its a little off the roadill lose some timebut taking it by and large i dont much mind  i stated as rapidly and as strongly as i could that my acquaintance with mr sylvester did not justify the introduction of a stranger to his hospitality that he was unlike most of the people herein short that he was a queer man etc etc  to my surprise my companion answered quietly oh thats all right ive heerd of him  ef you dont feel like checking me through or if youd rather put c o d on my back why its all the same to me ill play it alone  only you just count me in say sylvester all the time  thats me  what could i oppose to this mans quiet assurance  i felt myself growing red with anger and nervous with embarrassment  what would the correct sylvester say to me  what would the girlsi was a young man then and had won an entree to their domestic circle by my reserveknown by a less complimentary adjective among the boyswhat would they say to my new acquaintance  yet i certainly could not object to his assuming all risks on his own personal recognizances nor could i resist a certain feeling of shame at my embarrassment  we were beginning to descend  in the distance below us already twinkled the lights in the solitary rancho of lone valley  i turned to my companion  but you have forgotten that i dont even know your name  what am i to call you  thats so he said musingly  now lets see  kearney would be a good name  its short and easy like  thars a street in frisco the same title kearney it is  but i began impatiently  now you leave all that to me he interrupted with a superb selfconfidence that i could not but admire  the name aint no account  its the man thats responsible  ef i was to lay for a man that i reckoned was named jones and after i fetched him i found out on the inquest that his real name was smith that wouldnt make no matter as long as i got the man  the illustration forcible as it was did not strike me as offering a prepossessing introduction but we were already at the rancho the barking of dogs brought sylvester to the door of the pretty little cottage which his taste had adorned  i briefly introduced mr kearney  kearney will dokearneys good enough for me commented the soidisant kearney halfaloud to my own horror and sylvesters evident mystification and then he blandly excused himself for a moment that he might personally supervise the care of his own beast  when he was out of earshot i drew the puzzled sylvester aside  i have picked upi mean i have been picked up on the road by a gentle maniac whose name is not kearney  he is well armed and quotes dickens  with care acquiescence in his views on all subjects and general submission to his commands he may be placated  doubtless the spectacle of your helpless family the contemplation of your daughters beauty and innocence may touch his fine sense of humor and pathos meanwhile heaven help you and forgive me  i ran upstairs to the little den that my hospitable host had kept always reserved for me in my wanderings  i lingered some time over my ablutions hearing the languid gentlemanly drawl of sylvester below mingled with the equally cool easy slang of my mysterious acquaintance  when i came down to the sittingroom i was surprised however to find the selfstyled kearney quietly seated on the sofa the gentle may sylvester the lily of lone valley sitting with maidenly awe and unaffected interest on one side of him while on the other that arrant flirt her cousin kate was practicing the pitiless archery of her eyes with an excitement that seemed almost real  who is your deliciously cool friend she managed to whisper to me at supper as i sat utterly dazed and bewildered between the enrapt may sylvester who seemed to hang upon his words and this giddy girl of the period who was emptying the battery of her charms in active rivalry upon him  of course we know his name isnt kearney  but how romantic  and isnt he perfectly lovely  and who is he  i replied with severe irony that i was not aware what foreign potentate was then traveling incognito in the sierras of california but that when his royal highness was pleased to inform me i should be glad to introduce him properly  until then i added i fear the acquaintance must be morganatic  youre only jealous of him she said pertly  look at mayshe is completely fascinated  and her father too  and actually the languid worldsick cynical sylvester was regarding him with a boyish interest and enthusiasm almost incompatible with his nature yet i submit honestly to the clearheaded reason of my own sex that i could see nothing more in the man than i have already delivered to the reader  in the middle of an exciting story of adventure of which he to the already prejudiced mind of his fair auditors was evidently the hero he stopped suddenly  its only some pack train passing the bridge on the lower trail explained sylvester go on  it may be my horse is a trifle oneasy in the stable said the alleged kearney he aint used to boards and covering  heaven only knows what wild and delicious revelation lay in the statement of this fact but the girls looked at each other with cheeks pink with excitement as kearney arose and with quiet absence of ceremony quitted the table  aint he just lovely said kate gasping for breath and so witty  witty said the gentle may with just the slightest trace of defiance in her sweet voice witty my dear why dont you see that his heart is just breaking with pathos  witty indeed why when he was speaking of that poor mexican woman that was hung i saw the tears gather in his eyes  witty indeed  tears laughed the cynical sylvester tears idle tears  why you silly children the man is a man of the world a philosopher quiet observant unassuming  unassuming  was sylvester intoxicated or had the mysterious stranger mixed the insane verb with the family pottage  he returned before i could answer this selfasked inquiry and resumed coolly his broken narrative  finding myself forgotten in the man i had so long hesitated to introduce to my friends i retired to rest early only to hear through the thin partitions two hours later enthusiastic praises of the new guest from the voluble lips of the girls as they chatted in the next room before retiring  at midnight i was startled by the sound of horses hoofs and the jingling of spurs below  a conversation between my host and some mysterious personage in the darkness was carried on in such a low tone that i could not learn its import  as the cavalcade rode away i raised the window  whats the matter  nothing said sylvester coolly only another one of those playful homicidal freaks peculiar to the country  a man was shot by cherokee jack over at lagrange this morning and that was the sheriff of calaveras and his posse hunting him  i told him id seen nobody but you and your friend  by the way i hope the cursed noise hasnt disturbed him  the poor fellow looked as if he wanted rest  i thought so too  nevertheless i went softly to his room  it was empty  my impression was that he had distanced the sheriff of calaveras about two hours    a ghost of the sierras  it was a vast silence of pines redolent with balsamic breath and muffled with the dry dust of dead bark and matted mosses  lying on our backs we looked upward through a hundred feet of clear unbroken interval to the first lateral branches that formed the flat canopy above us  here and there the fierce sun from whose active persecution we had just escaped searched for us through the woods but its keen blade was dulled and turned aside by intercostal boughs and its brightness dissipated in nebulous mists throughout the roofing of the dim brown aisles around us  we were in another atmosphere under another sky indeed in another world than the dazzling one we had just quitted  the grave silence seemed so much a part of the grateful coolness that we hesitated to speak and for some moments lay quietly outstretched on the pine tassels where we had first thrown ourselves finally a voice broke the silence  ask the old major he knows all about it  the person here alluded to under that military title was myself  i hardly need explain to any californian that it by no means followed that i was a major or that i was old or that i knew anything about it or indeed what it referred to  the whole remark was merely one of the usual conventional feelers to conversationa kind of social preamble quite common to our slangy camp intercourse nevertheless as i was always known as the major perhaps for no better reason than that the speaker an old journalist was always called doctor i recognized the fact so far as to kick aside an intervening saddle so that i could see the speakers face on a level with my own and said nothing  about ghosts said the doctor after a pause which nobody broke or was expected to break  ghosts sir  thats what we want to know what are we doing here in this blanked old mausoleum of calaveras county if it isnt to find out something about em eh  nobody replied  thars that haunted house at cave city  cant be more than a mile or two away anyhow  used to be just off the trail  a dead silence  the doctor addressing space generally yes sir it was a mighty queer story  still the same reposeful indifference  we all knew the doctors skill as a raconteur we all knew that a story was coming and we all knew that any interruption would be fatal  time and time again in our prospecting experience had a word of polite encouragement a rash expression of interest even a too eager attitude of silent expectancy brought the doctor to a sudden change of subject  time and time again have we seen the unwary stranger stand amazed and bewildered between our own indifference and the sudden termination of a promising anecdote through his own unlucky interference  so we said nothing the judgeanother instance of arbitrary nomenclaturepretended to sleep  jack began to twist a cigarrito  thornton bit off the ends of pine needles reflectively  yes sir continued the doctor coolly resting the back of his head on the palms of his hands it was rather curious  all except the murder  thats what gets me for the murder had no new points no fancy touches no sentiment no mystery  was just one of the old style subhead paragraphs  oldfashioned miner scrubs along on hardtack and beans and saves up a little money to go home and see relations  oldfashioned assassin sharpens up knife old style loads old flintlock brassmounted pistol walks in on oldfashioned miner one dark night sends him home to his relations away back to several generations and walks off with the swag  no mystery there nothing to clear up subsequent revelations only impertinence  nothing for any ghost to dowho meant business more than that over forty murders same old kind committed every year in calaveras and no spiritual post obits coming due every anniversary no assessments made on the peace and quiet of the surviving community  i tell you what boys ive always been inclined to throw off on the cave city ghost for that alone  its a bad precedent sir  if that kind o thing is going to obtain in the foothills well have the trails full of chaps formerly knocked over by mexicans and road agents every little camp and grocery will have stock enough on hand to go into business and wheres there any security for surviving life and property eh whats your opinion judge as a fairminded legislator  of course there was no response  yet it was part of the doctors system of aggravation to become discursive at these moments in the hope of interruption and he continued for some moments to dwell on the terrible possibility of a state of affairs in which a gentleman could no longer settle a dispute with an enemy without being subjected to succeeding spiritual embarrassment  but all this digression fell upon apparently inattentive ears  well sir after the murder the cabin stood for a long time deserted and tenantless  popular opinion was against it  one day a ragged prospector savage with hard labor and harder luck came to the camp looking for a place to live and a chance to prospect after the boys had taken his measure they concluded that hed already tackled so much in the way of difficulties that a ghost more or less wouldnt be of much account  so they sent him to the haunted cabin  he had a big yellow dog with him about as ugly and as savage as himself and the boys sort o congratulated themselves from a practical viewpoint that while they were giving the old ruffian a shelter they were helping in the cause of christianity against ghosts and goblins  they had little faith in the old man but went their whole pile on that dog thats where they were mistaken  the house stood almost three hundred feet from the nearest cave and on dark nights being in a hollow was as lonely as if it had been on the top of shasta  if you ever saw the spot when there was just moon enough to bring out the little surrounding clumps of chapparal until they looked like crouching figures and make the bits of broken quartz glisten like skulls youd begin to understand how big a contract that man and that yellow dog undertook  they went into possession that afternoon and old hard times set out to cook his supper  when it was over he sat down by the embers and lit his pipe the yellow dog lying at his feet  suddenly rap rap comes from the door  come in says the man gruffly rap again  come in and be dd to you says the man who has no idea of getting up to open the door  but no one responded and the next moment smash goes the only sound pane in the only window seeing this old hard times gets up with the devil in his eye and a revolver in his hand followed by the yellow dog with every tooth showing and swings open the door  no one there  but as the man opened the door that yellow dog that had been so chipper before suddenly begins to crouch and step backward step by step trembling and shivering and at last crouches down in the chimney without even so much as looking at his master  the man slams the door shut again but there comes another smash  this time it seems to come from inside the cabin and it isnt until the man looks around and sees everything quiet that he gets up without speaking and makes a dash for the door and tears round outside the cabin like mad but finds nothing but silence and darkness  then he comes back swearing and calls the dog  but that great yellow dog that the boys would have staked all their money on is crouching under the bunk and has to be dragged out like a coon from a hollow tree and lies there his eyes starting from their sockets every limb and muscle quivering with fear and his very hair drawn up in bristling ridges the man calls him to the door he drags himself a few steps stops sniffs and refuses to go further  the man calls him again with an oath and a threat then what does that yellow dog do  he crawls edgewise towards the door crouching himself against the bunk till hes flatter than a knife blade then half way he stops  then that dd yellow dog begins to walk gingerlylifting each foot up in the air one after the other still trembling in every limb  then he stops again then he crouches  then he gives one little shuddering leapnot straight forward but upclearing the floor about six inches as if  over something interrupted the judge hastily lifting himself on his elbow  the doctor stopped instantly  juan he said coolly to one of the mexican packers quit foolin with that riata  youll have that stake out and that mule loose in another minute  come over this way  the mexican turned a scared white face to the doctor muttering something and let go the deerskin hide  we all upraised our voices with one accord the judge most penitently and apologetically and implored the doctor to go on  ill shoot the first man who interrupts you again added thornton persuasively  but the doctor with his hands languidly under his head had lost his interest  well the dog ran off to the hills and neither the threats nor cajoleries of his master could ever make him enter the cabin again the next day the man left the camp  what time is it getting on to sundown aint it  keep off my leg will you you dd greaser and stop stumbling round there  lie down  but we knew that the doctor had not completely finished his story and we waited patiently for the conclusion  meanwhile the old gray silence of the woods again asserted itself but shadows were now beginning to gather in the heavy beams of the roof above and the dim aisles seemed to be narrowing and closing in around us presently the doctor recommenced lazily as if no interruption had occurred  as i said before i never put much faith in that story and shouldnt have told it but for a rather curious experience of my own  it was in the spring of 62 and i was one of a party of four coming up from oneills when we had been snowed up  it was awful weather the snow had changed to sleet and rain after we crossed the divide and the water was out everywhere every ditch was a creek every creek a river we had lost two horses on the north fork we were dead beat off the trail and sloshing round with night coming on and the level hail like shot in our faces things were looking bleak and scary when riding a little ahead of the party i saw a light twinkling in a hollow beyond  my horse was still fresh and calling out to the boys to follow me and bear for the light i struck out for it  in another moment i was before a little cabin that half burrowed in the black chapparal i dismounted and rapped at the door  there was no response i then tried to force the door but it was fastened securely from within i was all the more surprised when one of the boys who had overtaken me told me that he had just seen through a window a man reading by the fire  indignant at this inhospitality we both made a resolute onset against the door at the same time raising our angry voices to a yell  suddenly there was a quick response the hurried withdrawing of a bolt and the door opened  the occupant was a short thickset man with a pale careworn face whose prevailing expression was one of gentle good humor and patient suffering  when we entered he asked us hastily why we had not sung out before  but we knocked i said impatiently and almost drove your door in  thats nothing he said patiently  im used to that  i looked again at the mans patient fateful face and then around the cabin  in an instant the whole situation flashed before me are we not near cave city i asked  yes he replied its just below  you must have passed it in the storm  i see  i again looked around the cabin  isnt this what they call the haunted house  he looked at me curiously  it is he said simply  you can imagine my delight  here was an opportunity to test the whole story to work down to the bed rock and see how it would pan out  we were too many and too well armed to fear tricks or dangers from outsiders  ifas one theory had been heldthe disturbance was kept up by a band of concealed marauders or road agents whose purpose was to preserve their haunts from intrusion we were quite able to pay them back in kind for any assault  i need not say that the boys were delighted with this prospect when the fact was revealed to them  the only one doubtful or apathetic spirit there was our host who quietly resumed his seat and his book with his old expression of patient martyrdom  it would have been easy for me to have drawn him out but i felt that i did not want to corroborate anybody elses experience only to record my own  and i thought it better to keep the boys from any predisposing terrors  we ate our supper and then sat patiently and expectant around the fire  an hour slipped away but no disturbance another hour passed as monotonously  our host read his book only the dash of hail against the roof broke the silence  but  the doctor stopped  since the last interruption i noticed he had changed the easy slangy style of his story to a more perfect artistic and even studied manner  he dropped now suddenly into his old colloquial speech and quietly said if you dont quit stumbling over those riatas juan ill hobble you  come here there lie down will you  we all turned fiercely on the cause of this second dangerous interruption but a sight of the poor fellows pale and frightened face withheld our vindictive tongues  and the doctor happily of his own accord went on  but i had forgotten that it was no easy matter to keep these highspirited boys bent on a row in decent subjection and after the third hour passed without a supernatural exhibition i observed from certain winks and whispers that they were determined to get up indications of their own  in a few moments violent rappings were heard from all parts of the cabin large stones adroitly thrown up the chimney fell with a heavy thud on the roof  strange groans and ominous yells seemed to come from the outside where the interstices between the logs were wide enough  yet through all this uproar our host sat still and patient with no sign of indignation or reproach upon his goodhumored but haggard features before long it became evident that this exhibition was exclusively for his benefit  under the thin disguise of asking him to assist them in discovering the disturbers outside the cabin those inside took advantage of his absence to turn the cabin topsyturvy  you see what the spirits have done old man said the arch leader of this mischief  theyve upset that there flour barrel while we wasnt looking and then kicked over the water jug and spilled all the water  the patient man lifted his head and looked at the flourstrewn walls then he glanced down at the floor but drew back with a slight tremor  it aint water he said quietly  what is it then  its blood  look  the nearest man gave a sudden start and sank back white as a sheet  for there gentlemen on the floor just before the door where the old man had seen the dog hesitate and lift his feet there theregentlemenupon my honor slowly widened and broadened a dark red pool of human blood  stop him  quick  stop him i say  there was a blinding flash that lit up the dark woods and a sharp report  when we reached the doctors side he was holding the smoking pistol just discharged in one hand while with the other he was pointing to the rapidly disappearing figure of juan our mexican vaquero  missed him by gd said the doctor  but did you hear him  did you see his livid face as he rose up at the name of blood  did you see his guilty conscience in his face  eh  why dont you speak what are you staring at  was it the murdered mans ghost doctor we all panted in one quick breath  ghost be dd  no  but in that mexican vaquerothat cursed juan ramirezi saw and shot at his murderer    the hoodlum band  or  the boy chief the infant politician and the pirate prodigy  by jack whackaway  author of the boy slaver the immature incendiary the precocious pugilist etc etc   chapter i  it was a quiet new england village  nowhere in the valley of the connecticut the autumn sun shone upon a more peaceful pastoral manufacturing community  the wooden nutmegs were slowly ripening on the trees and the white pine hams for western consumption were gradually rounding into form under the deft manipulation of the hardy american artisan  the honest connecticut farmer was quietly gathering from his threshing floor the shoepegs which when intermixed with a fair proportion of oats offered a pleasing substitute for fodder to the effete civilizations of europe  an almost sabbathlike stillness prevailed  doemville was only seven miles from hartford and the surrounding landscape smiled with the conviction of being fully insured  few would have thought that this peaceful village was the home of the three young heroes whose exploits would hereafterbut we anticipate  doemville academy was the principal seat of learning in the county under the grave and gentle administration of the venerable doctor context it had attained just popularity  yet the increasing infirmities of age obliged the doctor to relinquish much of his trust to his assistants who it is needless to say abused his confidence before long their brutal tyranny and deeplaid malevolence became apparent  boys were absolutely forced to study their lessons  the sickening fact will hardly be believed but during school hours they were obliged to remain in their seats with the appearance at least of discipline  it is stated by good authority that the rolling of croquet balls across the floor during recitation was objected to under the fiendish excuse of its interfering with their studies  the breaking of windows by base balls and the beating of small scholars with bats were declared against  at last bloated and arrogant with success the underteachers threw aside all disguise and revealed themselves in their true colors  a cigar was actually taken out of a day scholars mouth during prayers  a flask of whisky was dragged from anothers desk and then thrown out of the window  and finally profanity hazing theft and lying were almost discouraged  could the youth of america conscious of their power and a literature of their own tamely submit to this tyranny  never  we repeat it firmly  never  we repeat it to parents and guardians never  but the fiendish tutors chuckling in their glee little knew what was passing through the cold haughty intellect of charles fanuel hall golightly aged ten what curled the lip of benjamin franklin jenkins aged seven or what shone in the bold blue eyes of bromley chitterlings aged six and a half as they sat in the corner of the playground at recess their only other companion and confidant was the negro porter and janitor of the school known as pirate jim  fitly indeed was he named as the secrets of his early wild careerconfessed freely to his noble young friendsplainly showed  a slaver at the age of seventeen the ringleader of a mutiny on the african coast at the age of twenty a privateersman during the last war with england the commander of a fireship and its sole survivor at twentyfive with a wild intermediate career of unmixed piracy until the rebellion called him to civil service again as a blockaderunner and peace and a desire for rural repose led him to seek the janitorship of the doemville academy where no questions were asked and references not exchanged he was indeed a fit mentor for our daring youth although a man whose days had exceeded the usual space allotted to humanity the various episodes of his career footing his age up to nearly one hundred and fiftynine years he scarcely looked it and was still hale and vigorous  yes continued pirate jim critically i dont think he was any bigger nor you master chitterlings if as big when he stood on the forkstle of my ship and shot the captain o that east injymen dead we used to call him little weevils he was so younglike but bless your hearts boys he want anything to little sammy barlow ez once crep up inter the captains stateroom on a rooshin frigate stabbed him to the heart with a jackknife then put on the captains uniform and his cocked hat took command of the ship and fout her hisself  wasnt the captains clothes big for him asked b franklin jenkins anxiously  the janitor eyed young jenkins with pained dignity  didnt i say the rooshin captain was a small a very small man rooshins is small likewise greeks  a noble enthusiasm beamed in the faces of the youthful heroes  was barlow as large as me asked c f hall golightly lifting his curls from his jovelike brow  yes but then he hed hed so to speak experiences  it was allowed that he had pizened his schoolmaster afore he went to sea but its dry talking boys  golightly drew a flask from his jacket and handed it to the janitor it was his fathers best brandy  the heart of the honest old seaman was touched  bless ye my own pirate boy he said in a voice suffocating with emotion  ive got some tobacco said the youthful jenkins but its finecut i use only that now  i kin buy some plug at the corner grocery said pirate jim only i left my portmoney at home  take this watch said young golightly it is my fathers  since he became a tyrant and usurper and forced me to join a corsairs band ive began by dividing the property  this is idle trifling said young chitterlings mildly  every moment is precious  is this an hour to give to wine and wassail ha we want actionaction  we must strike the blow for freedom tonightaye this very night  the scow is already anchored in the milldam freighted with provisions for a three months voyage i have a black flag in my pocket  why then this cowardly delay  the two elder youths turned with a slight feeling of awe and shame to gaze on the glowing cheeks and high haughty crest of their youngest comradethe bright the beautiful bromley chitterlings alas that very moment of forgetfulness and mutual admiration was fraught with danger  a thin dyspeptic halfstarved tutor approached  it is time to resume your studies young gentlemen he said with fiendish politeness  they were his last words on earth  down tyrant screamed chitterlings  sic himi mean sic semper tyrannis said the classical golightly  a heavy blow on the head from a baseball bat and the rapid projection of a base ball against his empty stomach brought the tutor a limp and lifeless mass to the ground  golightly shuddered let not my young readers blame him too rashly  it was his first homicide  search his pockets said the practical jenkins  they did so and found nothing but a harvard triennial catalogue  let us fly said jenkins  forward to the boats cried the enthusiastic chitterlings  but c f hall golightly stood gazing thoughtfully at the prostrate tutor  this he said calmly is the result of a too free government and the common school system  what the country needs is reform  i cannot go with you boys  traitor screamed the others  c f h golightly smiled sadly  you know me not  i shall not become a piratebut a congressman  jenkins and chitterlings turned pale  i have already organized two caucuses in a base ball club and bribed the delegates of another  nay turn not away  let us be friends pursuing through various ways one common end  farewell they shook hands  but where is pirate jim asked jenkins  he left us but for a moment to raise money on the watch to purchase armament for the scow  farewell  and so the gallant youthful spirits parted bright with the sunrise of hope  that night a conflagration raged in doemville  the doemville academy mysteriously fired first fell a victim to the devouring element  the candy shop and cigar store both holding heavy liabilities against the academy quickly followed  by the lurid gleams of the flames a long low slooprigged scow with every mast gone except one slowly worked her way out of the milldam towards the sound  the next day three boys were missingc f hall golightly b f jenkins and bromley chitterlings  had they perished in the flames who shall say  enough that never more under these names did they again appear in the homes of their ancestors  happy indeed would it have been for doemville had the mystery ended here  but a darker interest and scandal rested upon the peaceful village  during that awful night the boardingschool of madam brimborion was visited stealthily and two of the fairest heiresses of connecticutdaughters of the president of a savings bank and insurance directorwere the next morning found to have eloped  with them also disappeared the entire contents of the savings bank and on the following day the flamingo fire insurance company failed   chapter ii  let my young readers now sail with me to warmer and more hospitable climes  off the coast of patagonia a long low black schooner proudly rides the seas that breaks softly upon the vineclad shores of that luxuriant land  who is this that wrapped in persian rugs and dressed in the most expensive manner calmly reclines on the quarterdeck of the schooner toying lightly ever and anon with the luscious fruits of the vicinity held in baskets of solid gold by nubian slaves or at intervals with daring grace guides an ebony velocipede over the polished black walnut decks and in and out the intricacies of the rigging  who is it well may be asked  what name is it that blanches with terror the cheeks of the patagonian navy  who but the pirate prodigythe relentless boy scourer of patagonian seas  voyagers slowly drifting by the silurian beach coasters along the devonian shore still shudder at the name of bromley chitterlingsthe boy avenger late of hartford connecticut  it has been often asked by the idly curious why avenger and of what let us not seek to disclose the awful secret hidden under that youthful jacket  enough that there may have been that of bitterness in his past life that he      whose soul would sicken oer the heaving wave  or whose soul would heave above the sickening wave did not understand  only one knew him perhaps too wella queen of the amazons taken prisoner off terra del fuego a week previous  she loved the boy avenger  but in vain his youthful heart seemed obdurate  hear me at last he said when she had for the seventh time wildly proffered her hand and her kingdom in marriage and know once and forever why i must decline your flattering proposal i love another  with a wild despairing cry she leaped into the sea but was instantly rescued by the pirate prodigy  yet even in that supreme moment such was his coolness that on his way to the surface he captured a mermaid and placing her in charge of his steward with directions to give her a stateroom with hot and cold water calmly resumed his place by the amazons side  when the cabin door closed on his faithful servant bringing champagne and ices to the interesting stranger chitterlings resumed his narrative with a choking voice  when i first fled from the roof of a tyrannical parent i loved the beautiful and accomplished eliza j sniffen  her father was president of the workingmens savings bank and it was perfectly understood that in the course of time the entire deposits would be his  but like a vain fool i wished to anticipate the future and in a wild moment persuaded miss sniffen to elope with me and with the entire cash assets of the bank we fled together  he paused overcome with emotion  but fate decreed it otherwise  in my feverish haste i had forgotten to place among the stores of my pirate craft that peculiar kind of chocolate caramel to which eliza jane was most partial  we were obliged to put into new rochelle on the second day out to enable miss sniffen to procure that delicacy at the nearest confectioners and match some zephyr worsteds at the first fancy shop  fatal mistake she wentshe never returned  in a moment he resumed in a choking voice after a weeks weary waiting i was obliged to put to sea again bearing a broken heart and the broken bank of her father  i have never seen her since  and you still love her asked the amazon queen excitedly  aye forever  noble youth  here take the reward of thy fidelity for know bromley chitterlings that i am eliza jane  wearied with waiting i embarked on a peruvian guano shipbut its a long story dear  and altogether too thin said the boy avenger fiercely releasing himself from her encircling arms  eliza janes age a year ago was only thirteen and you are forty if a day  true she returned sadly but i have suffered much and time passes rapidly and ive grown  you would scarcely believe that this is my own hair  i know not he replied in gloomy abstraction  forgive my deceit she returned  if you are affianced to another let me at least bea mother to you  the pirate prodigy started and tears came to his eyes  the scene was affecting in the extreme  several of the oldest seamenmen who had gone through scenes of suffering with tearless eyes and unblanched cheeksnow retired to the spiritroom to conceal their emotion  a few went into caucus in the forecastle and returned with the request that the amazonian queen should hereafter be known as the queen of the pirates isle  mother gasped the pirate prodigy  my son screamed the amazonian queen  they embraced  at the same moment a loud flop was heard on the quarterdeck  it was the forgotten mermaid who emerging from her stateroom and ascending the companionway at that moment had fainted at the spectacle  the pirate prodigy rushed to her side with a bottle of smellingsalts  she recovered slowly  permit me she said rising with dignity to leave the ship  i am unaccustomed to such conduct  hear meshe is my mother  she certainly is old enough to be replied the mermaid and to speak of that being her own hair she added with a scornful laugh as she rearranged her own luxuriant tresses with characteristic grace a comb and a small handmirror  if i couldnt afford any other clothes i might wear a switch too hissed the amazonian queen  i suppose you dont dye it on account of the salt water  but perhaps you prefer green dear  a little salt water might improve your own complexion love  fishwoman screamed the amazonian queen  bloomerite shrieked the mermaid  in another instant they had seized each other  mutiny  overboard with them cried the pirate prodigy rising to the occasion and casting aside all human affection in the peril of the moment  a plank was brought and two women placed upon it  after you dear said the mermaid significantly to the amazonian queen youre the oldest  thank you said the amazonian queen stepping back  fish is always served first  stung by the insult with a wild scream of rage the mermaid grappled her in her arms and leaped into the sea  as the waters closed over them forever the pirate prodigy sprang to his feet  up with the black flag and bear away for new london he shouted in trumpetlike tones  ha ha  once more the rover is free  indeed it was too true  in that fatal moment he had again loosed himself from the trammels of human feeling and was once more the boy avenger   chapter iii  again i must ask my young friends to mount my hippogriff and hie with me to the almost inaccessible heights of the rocky mountains there for years a band of wild and untamable savages known as the pigeon feet had resisted the blankets and bibles of civilization  for years the trails leading to their camp were marked by the bones of teamsters and broken wagons and the trees were decked with the drying scalp locks of women and children  the boldest of military leaders hesitated to attack them in their fortresses and prudently left the scalping knives rifles powder and shot provided by a paternal government for their welfare lying on the ground a few miles from their encampment with the request that they were not to be used until the military had safely retired  hitherto save an occasional incursion into the territory of the knockknees a rival tribe they had limited their depredations to the vicinity  but lately a baleful change had come over them  acting under some evil influence they now pushed their warfare into the white settlements carrying fire and destruction with them  again and again had the government offered them a free pass to washington and the privilege of being photographed but under the same evil guidance they refused there was a singular mystery in their mode of aggression schoolhouses were always burned the schoolmasters taken into captivity and never again heard from  a palace car on the union pacific railway containing an excursion party of teachers en route to san francisco was surrounded its inmates captured andtheir vacancies in the school catalogue never again filled  even a board of educational examiners proceeding to cheyenne were taken prisoners and obliged to answer questions they themselves had proposed amidst horrible tortures  by degrees these atrocities were traced to the malign influence of a new chief of the tribe  as yet little was known of him but through his baleful appellations young man who goes for his teacher and he lifts the hair of the school marm  he was said to be small and exceedingly youthful in appearance  indeed his earlier appellative he wipes his nose on his sleeve was said to have been given to him to indicate his still boylike habits  it was night in the encampment and among the lodges of the pigeon toes  dusky maidens flitted in and out among the campfires like brown moths cooking the toothsome buffalo hump frying the fragrant bears meat and stewing the esculent bean for the braves for a few favored ones spitted grasshoppers were reserved as a rare delicacy although the proud spartan soul of their chief scorned all such luxuries  he was seated alone in his wigwam attended only by the gentle mushymush fairest of the pigeon feet maidens  nowhere were the characteristics of her great tribe more plainly shown than in the little feet that lapped over each other in walking  a single glance at the chief was sufficient to show the truth of the wild rumors respecting his youth  he was scarcely twelve of proud and lofty bearing and clad completely in wrappings of variouscolored scalloped cloths which gave him the appearance of a somewhat extrasized penwiper  an enormous eagles feather torn from the wing of a bald eagle who once attempted to carry him away completed his attire  it was also the memento of one of his most superhuman feats of courage he would undoubtedly have scalped the eagle but that nature had anticipated him  why is the great chief sad asked mushymush softly  does his soul still yearn for the blood of the palefaced teachers  did not the scalping of two professors of geology in the yale exploring party satisfy his warriors heart yesterday  has he forgotten that hayden and clarence king are still to follow  shall his own mushymush bring him a botanist tomorrow  speak for the silence of my brother lies on my heart like the snow on the mountain and checks the flow of my speech  still the proud boy chief sat silent  suddenly he said hist and rose to his feet  taking a long rifle from the ground he adjusted its sight  exactly seven miles away on the slope of the mountain the figure of a man was seen walking  the boy chief raised the rifle to his unerring eye and fired  the man fell  a scout was dispatched to scalp and search the body  he presently returned  who was the pale face eagerly asked the chief  a life insurance agent  a dark scowl settled on the face of the chief  i thought it was a bookpeddler  why is my brothers heart sore against the bookpeddler asked mushymush  because said the boy chief fiercely i am again without my regular dime novel and i thought he might have one in his pack hear me mushymush the united states mails no longer bring me my young america or my boys and girls weekly  i find it impossible even with my fastest scouts to keep up with the rear of general howard and replenish my literature from the sutlers wagon  without a dime novel or a young america how am i to keep up this injin business  mushymush remained in meditation a single moment  then she looked up proudly  my brother has spoken  it is well  he shall have his dime novel he shall know what kind of a hairpin his sister mushymush is  and she arose and gamboled lightly as the fawn out of his presence  in two hours she returned  in one hand she held three small flaxen scalps in the other the boy marauder complete in one volume price ten cents  three palefaced children she gasped were reading it in the tail end of an emigrant wagon  i crept up to them softly  their parents are still unaware of the accident and she sank helpless at his feet  noble girl said the boy chief gazing proudly on her prostrate form and these are the people that a military despotism expects to subdue   chapter iv  but the capture of several wagonloads of commissary whisky and the destruction of two tons of stationery intended for the general commanding which interfered with his regular correspondence with the war department at last awakened the united states military authorities to active exertion  a quantity of troops were massed before the pigeon feet encampment and an attack was hourly imminent  shine your boots sir  it was the voice of a youth in humble attire standing before the flap of the commanding generals tent  the general raised his head from his correspondence  ah he said looking down on the humble boy i see i shall write that the appliances of civilization move steadily forward with the army  yes he added you may shine my military boots you understand however that to get your pay you must first  make a requisition on the commissarygeneral have it certified to by the quartermaster countersigned by the postadjutant and submitted by you to the war department  and charged as stationery added the general gently  you are i see an intelligent and thoughtful boy  i trust you neither use whisky tobacco nor are ever profane  i promised my sainted mother  enough  go on with your blacking i have to lead the attack on the pigeon feet at eight precisely  it is now halfpast seven said the general consulting a large kitchen clock that stood in the corner of his tent  the little bootblack looked up the general was absorbed in his correspondence  the bootblack drew a tin putty blower from his pocket took unerring aim and nailed in a single shot the minute hand to the dial  going on with his blacking yet stopping ever and anon to glance over the generals plan of campaign spread on the table before him he was at last interrupted by the entrance of an officer  everything is ready for the attack general  it is now eight oclock  impossible  it is only halfpast seven  but my watch and the watches of your staff  are regulated by my kitchen clock that has been in my family for years  enough  it is only halfpast seven  the officer retired the bootblack had finished one boot  another officer appeared  instead of attacking the enemy general we are attacked ourselves our pickets are already driven in  military pickets should not differ from other pickets interrupted the bootblack modestly  to stand firmly they should be well driven in  ha there is something in that said the general thoughtfully but who are you who speak thus  rising to his full height the bootblack threw off his outer rags and revealed the figure of the boy chief of the pigeon feet  treason shrieked the general order an advance along the whole line  but in vain  the next moment he fell beneath the tomahawk of the boy chief and within the next quarter of an hour the united states army was dispersed  thus ended the battle of bootblack creek   chapter v  and yet the boy chief was not entirely happy  indeed at times he seriously thought of accepting the invitation extended by the great chief at washington immediately after the massacre of the soldiers and once more revisiting the haunts of civilization  his soul sickened in feverish inactivity schoolmasters palled on his taste he had introduced base ball blind hooky marbles and pegtop among his indian subjects but only with indifferent success the squaws insisted in boring holes through the china alleys and wearing them as necklaces his warriors stuck spikes in their base ball bats and made war clubs of them  he could not but feel too that the gentle mushymush although devoted to her palefaced brother was deficient in culinary education her mince pies were abominable her jam far inferior to that made by his aunt sally of doemville  only an unexpected incident kept him equally from the extreme of listless sybaritic indulgence or of morbid cynicism indeed at the age of twelve he already had become disgusted with existence  he had returned to his wigwam after an exhausting buffalo hunt in which he had slain two hundred and seventyfive buffalos with his own hand not counting the individual buffalo on which he had leaped so as to join the herd and which he afterward led into the camp a captive and a present to the lovely mushymush  he had scalped two express riders and a correspondent of the new york herald had despoiled the overland mail stage of a quantity of vouchers which enabled him to draw double rations from the government and was reclining on a bear skin smoking and thinking of the vanity of human endeavor when a scout entered saying that a paleface youth had demanded access to his person  is he a commissioner  if so say that the red man is rapidly passing to the happy huntinggrounds of his fathers and now desires only peace blankets and ammunition obtain the latter and then scalp the commissioner  but it is only a youth who asks an interview  does he look like an insurance agent  if so say that i have already policies in three hartford companies  meanwhile prepare the stake and see that the squaws are ready with their implements of torture  the youth was admitted he was evidently only half the age of the boy chief  as he entered the wigwam and stood revealed to his host they both started  in another moment they were locked in each others arms  jenky old boy  bromley old fel  b f jenkins for such was the name of the boy chief was the first to recover his calmness  turning to his warriors he said proudly  let my children retire while i speak to the agent of our great father in washington  hereafter no latch keys will be provided for the wigwams of the warriors  the practice of late hours must be discouraged  how said the warriors and instantly retired  whisper said jenkins drawing his friend aside i am known here only as the boy chief of the pigeon toes  and i said bromley chitterlings proudly am known everywhere as the pirate prodigythe boy avenger of the patagonian coast  but how came you here  listen  my pirate brig the lively mermaid now lies at meiggss wharf in san francisco disguised as a mendocino lumber vessel  my pirate crew accompanied me here in a palace car from san francisco  it must have been expensive said the prudent jenkins  it was but they defrayed it by a collection from the other passengersyou understand an enforced collection  the papers will be full of it tomorrow  do you take the new york sun  no i dislike their indian policy  but why are you here  hear me jenk  tis a long and a sad story  the lovely eliza j sniffen who fled with me from doemville was seized by her parents and torn from my arms at new rochelle  reduced to poverty by the breaking of the savings bank of which he was presidenta failure to which i largely contributed and the profits of which i enjoyedi have since ascertained that eliza jane sniffen was forced to become a schoolmistress departed to take charge of a seminary in colorado and since then has never been heard from  why did the boy chief turn pale and clutch at the tentpole for support  why indeed  eliza j sniffen gasped jenkins aged fourteen redhaired with a slight tendency to strabismus  the same  heaven help me  she died by my mandate  traitor shrieked chitterlings rushing at jenkins with a drawn poniard  but a figure interposed  the slight girlish form of mushymush with outstretched hands stood between the exasperated pirate prodigy and the boy chief  forbear she said sternly to chitterlings you know not what you do  the two youths paused  hear me she said rapidly  when captured in a confectioners shop at new rochelle e j sniffen was taken back to poverty  she resolved to become a schoolmistress  hearing of an opening in the west she proceeded to colorado to take exclusive charge of the pensionnat of mad choflie late of paris  on the way thither she was captured by the emissaries of the boy chief  in consummation of a fatal vow i made never to spare educational instructors interrupted jenkins  but in her captivity continued mushymush she managed to stain her face with pokeberry juice and mingling with the indian maidens was enabled to pass for one of the tribe  once undetected she boldly ingratiated herself with the boy chiefhow honestly and devotedly he best can tellfor i mushymush the little sister of the boy chief am eliza jane sniffen  the pirate prodigy clasped her in his arms  the boy chief raising his hand ejaculated  bless you my children  there is but one thing wanting to complete this reunion said chitterlings after a pause but the hurried entrance of a scout stopped his utterance  a commissioner from the great father in washington  scalp him shrieked the boy chief this is no time for diplomatic trifling  we have but he still insists upon seeing you and has sent in his card  the boy chief took it and read aloud in agonized accents  charles f hall golightly late page in united states senate and acting commissioner of united states  in another moment golightly pale bleeding and as it were prematurely bald but still cold and intellectual entered the wigwam they fell upon his neck and begged his forgiveness  dont mention it he said quietly these things must and will happen under our present system of government  my story is brief obtaining political influence through caucuses i became at last page in the senate  through the exertions of political friends i was appointed clerk to the commissioner whose functions i now represent knowing through political spies in your own camp who you were i acted upon the physical fears of the commissioner who was an exclergyman and easily induced him to deputize me to consult with you  in doing so i have lost my scalp but as the hirsute signs of juvenility have worked against my political progress i do not regret it  as a partially bald young man i shall have more power  the terms that i have to offer are simply this you can do everything you want go anywhere you choose if you will only leave this place  i have a hundred thousanddollar draft on the united states treasury in my pocket at your immediate disposal  but whats to become of me asked chitterlings  your case has already been under advisement  the secretary of state who is an intelligent man is determined to recognize you as de jure and de facto the only loyal representative of the patagonian government  you may safely proceed to washington as its envoy extraordinary  i dine with the secretary next week  and yourself old fellow  i only wish that twenty years from now you will recognize by your influence and votes the rights of c f h golightly to the presidency  and here ends our story  trusting that my dear young friends may take whatever example or moral their respective parents and guardians may deem fittest from these pages i hope in future years to portray further the career of those three young heroes i have already introduced in the springtime of life to their charitable consideration    the man whose yoke was not easy  he was a spare man and physically an illconditioned man but at first glance scarcely a seedy man  the indications of reduced circumstances in the male of the better class are i fancy first visible in the boots and shirt the boots offensively exhibiting a degree of polish inconsistent with their dilapidated condition and the shirt showing an extent of ostentatious surface that is invariably fatal to the threadbare waistcoat that it partially covers  he was a pale man and i fancied still paler from his black clothes  he handed me a note  it was from a certain physician a man of broad culture and broader experience a man who had devoted the greater part of his active life to the alleviation of sorrow and suffering a man who had lived up to the noble vows of a noble profession a man who locked in his honorable breast the secrets of a hundred families whose face was as kindly whose touch was as gentle in the wards of the great public hospitals as it was beside the laced curtains of the dying narcissa a man who through long contact with suffering had acquired a universal tenderness and breadth of kindly philosophy a man who day and night was at the beck and call of anguish a man who never asked the creed belief moral or worldly standing of the sufferer or even his ability to pay the few coins that enabled him the physician to exist and practice his calling in brief a man who so nearly lived up to the example of the great master that it seems strange i am writing of him as a doctor of medicine and not of divinity  the note was in pencil characteristically brief and ran thus  here is the man i spoke of  he ought to be good material for you  for a moment i sat looking from the note to the man and sounding the dim perilous depths of my memory for the meaning of this mysterious communication  the good material however soon relieved my embarrassment by putting his hand on his waistcoat coming toward me and saying it is just here you can feel it  it was not necessary for me to do so  in a flash i remembered that my medical friend had told me of a certain poor patient once a soldier who among his other trials and uncertainties was afflicted with an aneurism caused by the buckle of his knapsack pressing upon the arch of the aorta  it was liable to burst at any shock or any moment  the poor fellows yoke had indeed been too heavy  in the presence of such a tremendous possibility i think for an instant i felt anxious only about myself  what i should do how dispose of the body how explain the circumstance of his taking off how evade the ubiquitous reporter and the coroners inquest how a suspicion might arise that i had in some way through negligence or for some dark purpose unknown to the jury precipitated the catastrophe all flashed before me  even the note with its darkly suggestive offer of good material for me looked diabolically significant  what might not an intelligent lawyer make of it  i tore it up instantly and with feverish courtesy begged him to be seated  you dont care to feel it he asked a little anxiously  no  nor see it  no  he sighed a trifle sadly as if i had rejected the only favor he could bestow  i saw at once that he had been under frequent exhibition to the doctors and that he was perhaps a trifle vain of this attention this perception was corroborated a moment later by his producing a copy of a medical magazine with a remark that on the sixth page i would find a full statement of his case  could i serve him in any way i asked  it appeared that i could  if i could help him to any light employment something that did not require any great physical exertion or mental excitement he would be thankful  but he wanted me to understand that he was not strictly speaking a poor man that some years before the discovery of his fatal complaint he had taken out a life insurance policy for five thousand dollars and that he had raked and scraped enough together to pay it up and that he would not leave his wife and four children destitute  you see he added if i could find some sort of light work to do and kinder sled along you knowuntil  he stopped awkwardly  i have heard several noted actors thrill their audiences with a single phrase  i think i never was as honestly moved by any spoken word as that until or the pause that followed it  he was evidently quite unconscious of its effect for as i took a seat beside him on the sofa and looked more closely in his waxen face i could see that he was evidently embarrassed and would have explained himself further if i had not stopped him  possibly it was the dramatic idea or possibly chance but a few days afterward meeting a certain kindhearted theatrical manager i asked him if he had any light employment for a man who was an invalid  can he walk  yes  stand up for fifteen minutes yes  then ill take him  hell do for the last scene in the destruction of sennacheribits a tremendous thing you know well have two thousand people on the stage  i was a trifle alarmed at the title and ventured to suggest without betraying my poor friends secret that he could not actively engage in the destruction of sennacherib and that even the spectacle of it might be too much for him  neednt see it at all said my managerial friend put him in front nothing to do but march in and march out and dodge curtain  he was engaged  i admit i was at times haunted by grave doubts as to whether i should not have informed the manager of his physical condition and the possibility that he might some evening perpetrate a real tragedy on the mimic stage but on the first performance of the destruction of sennacherib which i conscientiously attended i was somewhat relieved  i had often been amused with the placid way in which the chorus in the opera invariably received the most astounding information and witnessed the most appalling tragedies by poison or the block without anything more than a vocal protest or command always delivered to the audience and never to the actors but i think my poor friends utter impassiveness to the wild carnage and the terrible exhibitions of incendiarism that were going on around him transcended even that  dressed in a costume that seemed to be the very soul of anachronism he stood a little outside the proscenium holding a spear the other hand pressed apparently upon the secret within his breast calmly surveying with his waxen face the gay auditorium  i could not help thinking that there was a certain pride visible even in his placid features as of one who was conscious that at any moment he might change this simulated catastrophe into real terror  i could not help saying this to the doctor who was with me  yes he said with professional exactitude when it happens hell throw his arms up above his head utter an ejaculation and fall forward on his faceits a singular thing they always fall forward on their faceand theyll pick up the man as dead as julius caesar  after that i used to go night after night with a certain hideous fascination but while it will be remembered the destruction of sennacherib had a tremendous run it will also be remembered that not a single life was really lost during its representation  it was only a few weeks after this modest first appearance on the boards of the man with an aneurism that happening to be at dinner party of practical business men i sought to interest them with the details of the above story delivered with such skill and pathos as i could command  i regret to say that as a pathetic story it for a moment seemed to be a dead failure  at last a prominent banker sitting next to me turned to me with the awful question why dont your friend try to realize on his life insurance  i begged his pardon i didnt quite understand  oh discount sell out  look hereafter a pause  let him assign his policy to me its not much of a risk on your statement wellill give him his five thousand dollars clear  and he did  under the advice of this coolheadedi think i may add warmheartedbanker the man with an aneurism invested his money in the name of and for the benefit of his wife in certain securities that paid him a small but regular stipend  but he still continued upon the boards of the theatre  by reason of some business engagements that called me away from the city i did not see my friend the physician for three months afterward when i did i asked tidings of the man with the aneurism  the doctors kind face grew sad  im afraidthat is i dont exactly know whether ive good news or bad  did you ever see his wife  i never had  well she was younger than he and rather attractive  one of those dollfaced women  you remember he settled that life insurance policy on her and the children she might have waited she didnt  the other day she eloped with some fellow i dont remember his name with the children and the five thousand dollars  and the shock killed him i said with poetic promptitude  nothat isnot yet i saw him yesterday said the doctor with conscientious professional precision looking over his list of calls  well where is the poor fellow now  hes still at the theatre  james if these powders are called for youll find them here in this envelope  tell mrs blank ill be there at sevenand she can give the baby this until i come say theres no danger  these women are an awful bother  yes hes at the theatre yet  which way are you going  down town  why cant you step into my carriage and ill give you a lift and well talk on the way down wellhes at the theatre yet andanddo you remember the destruction of sennacherib  no  yes you do  you remember that woman in pink who pirouetted in the famous ballet scene  you dont why yes you do  well i imagine of course i dont know its only a summary diagnosis but i imagine that our friend with the aneurism has attached himself to her  doctor you horrify me  there are more things mr poet in heaven and earth than are yet dreamt of in your philosophy  listen  my diagnosis may be wrong but that woman called the other day at my office to ask about him his health and general condition  i told her the truthand she fainted it was about as dead a faint as i ever saw i was nearly an hour in bringing her out of it  of course it was the heat of the room her exertions the preceding week and i prescribed for her  queer wasnt it  now if i were a writer and had your faculty id make something out of that  but how is his general health  oh about the same  he cant evade what will come you know at any moment  he was up here the other day  why the pulsation was as plainwhy the entire arch of the aorta  what you get out here goodby  of course no moralist no man writing for a sensitive and strictly virtuous public could further interest himself in this man  so i dismissed him at once from my mind and returned to the literary contemplation of virtue that was clearly and positively defined and of sin that invariably commenced with a capital letter  that this man in his awful condition hovering on the verge of eternity should allow himself to be attracted bybut it was horrible to contemplate  nevertheless a month afterwards i was returning from a festivity with my intimate friend smith my distinguished friend jobling my most respectable friend robinson and my wittiest friend jones  it was a clear starlit morning and we seemed to hold the broad beautiful avenue to ourselves and i fear we acted as if it were so  as we hilariously passed the corner of eighteenth street a coupe rolled by and i suddenly heard my name called from its gloomy depths  i beg your pardon said the doctor as his driver drew up by the sidewalk but ive some news for you  ive just been to see our poor friend   of course i was too late  he was gone in a flash  what dead  as pharaoh  in an instant just as i said  you see the rupture took place in the descending arch of  but doctor  its a queer story  am i keeping you from your friends  no well you see shethat woman i spoke ofhad written a note to him based on what i had told her  he got it and dropped in his dressingroom dead as a herring  how could she have been so cruel knowing his condition  she might with womans tact have rejected him less abruptly  yes but youre all wrong  by jove she accepted him was willing to marry him  what  yes  dont you see  it was joy that killed him  gad we never thought of that  queer aint it  see here dont you think you might make a story out of it  but doctor it hasnt got any moral  humph  thats so  good morning  drive on john    my friend the tramp  i had been sauntering over the clover downs of a certain noted new england seaport  it was a sabbath morning so singularly reposeful and gracious so replete with the significance of the seventh day of rest that even the sabbath bells ringing a mile away over the salt marshes had little that was monitory mandatory or even supplicatory in their drowsy voices  rather they seemed to call from their cloudy towers like some renegade muezzin sleep is better than prayer sleep on o sons of the puritans  slumber still o deacons and vestrymen  let oh let those feet that are swift to wickedness curl up beneath thee those palms that are itching for the shekels of the ungodly lie clasped beneath thy pillow  sleep is better than prayer  and indeed though it was high morning sleep was still in the air wrought upon at last by the combined influences of sea and sky and atmosphere i succumbed and lay down on one of the boulders of a little stony slope that gave upon the sea  the great atlantic lay before me not yet quite awake but slowly heaving the rhythmical expiration of slumber  there was no sail visible in the misty horizon there was nothing to do but to lie and stare at the unwinking ether  suddenly i became aware of the strong fumes of tobacco  turning my head i saw a pale blue smoke curling up from behind an adjacent boulder  rising and climbing over the intermediate granite i came upon a little hollow in which comfortably extended on the mosses and lichens lay a powerfullybuilt man  he was very ragged he was very dirty there was a strong suggestion about him of his having too much hair too much nail too much perspiration too much of those superfluous excrescences and exudations that society and civilization strive to keep under  but it was noticeable that he had not much of anything else  it was the tramp  with that swift severity with which we always visit rebuke upon the person who happens to present any one of our vices offensively before us in his own person i was deeply indignant at his laziness  perhaps i showed it in my manner for he rose to a halfsitting attitude returned my stare apologetically and made a movement toward knocking the fire from his pipe against the granite  shure sur and if id belaved that i was trispassin on yer honors grounds its meself that would hev laid down on the say shore and takin the salt waves for me blankits  but its sivinteen miles ive walked this blessed noight with nothin to sustain me and hevin a mortal wakeness to fight wid in me bowels by reason of starvation and only a bit o baccy that the widdy maloney gi me at the cross roads to kape me up entoirley  but it was the dark day i left me home in milwaukee to walk to boston and if yell oblige a lone man who has left a wife and six children in milwaukee wid the loan of twentyfive cints furninst the time he gits worruk godll be good to ye  it instantly flashed through my mind that the man before me had the previous night partaken of the kitchen hospitality of my little cottage two miles away  that he presented himself in the guise of a distressed fisherman mulcted of his wages by an inhuman captain that he had a wife lying sick of consumption in the next village and two children one of whom was a cripple wandering in the streets of boston  i remembered that this tremendous indictment against fortune touched the family and that the distressed fisherman was provided with clothes food and some small change the food and small change had disappeared but the garments for the consumptive wife where were they  he had been using them for a pillow  i instantly pointed out this fact and charged him with the deception to my surprise he took it quietly and even a little complacently  bedad yer roight ye see sur confidentially ye see sur until i get worrukand its worruk im lukin fori have to desave now and thin to shute the locality  ah god save us but on the saycoast thayr that harrud upon thim that dont belong to the say  i ventured to suggest that a strong healthy man like him might have found work somewhere between milwaukee and boston  ah but ye see i got free passage on a freight train and didnt sthop  it was in the aist that i expected to find worruk  have you any trade  trade is it  im a brickmaker god knows and manys the lift ive had at makin bricks in milwaukee  shure ive as aisy a hand at it as any man  maybe yer honor might know of a kill hereabout  now to my certain knowledge there was not a brick kiln within fifty miles of that spot and of all unlikely places to find one would have been this sandy peninsula given up to the summer residences of a few wealthy people  yet i could not help admiring the assumption of the scamp who knew this fact as well as myself but i said i can give you work for a day or two and bidding him gather up his sick wifes apparel led the way across the downs to my cottage  at first i think the offer took him by surprise and gave him some consternation but he presently recovered his spirits and almost instantly his speech  ah worruk is it  god be praised its meself thats ready and willin though maybe me hand is spoilt wid brickmakin  i assured him that the work i would give him would require no delicate manipulation and so we fared on over the sleepy downs but i could not help noticing that although an invalid i was a much better pedestrian than my companion frequently leaving him behind and that even as a tramp he was etymologically an impostor  he had a way of lingering beside the fences we had to climb over as if to continue more confidentially the history of his misfortunes and troubles which he was delivering to me during our homeward walk and i noticed that he could seldom resist the invitation of a mossy boulder or a tussock of salt grass  ye see sur he would say suddenly sitting down its along uv me misfortunes beginnin in milwaukee that and it was not until i was out of hearing that he would languidly gather his traps again and saunter after me  when i reached my own garden gate he leaned for a moment over it with both of his powerful arms extended downward and said ah but its a blessin that sunday comes to give rest fur the wake and the weary and them as walks sivinteen miles to get it  of course i took the hint  there was evidently no work to be had from my friend the tramp that day  yet his countenance brightened as he saw the limited extent of my domain and observed that the garden so called was only a flowerbed about twentyfive by ten as he had doubtless before this been utilized to the extent of his capacity in digging he had probably expected that kind of work and i daresay i discomfitted him by pointing him to an almost leveled stone wall about twenty feet long with the remark that his work would be the rebuilding of that stone wall with stone brought from the neighboring slopes in a few moments he was comfortably provided for in the kitchen where the cook a woman of his own nativity apparently chaffed him with a raillery that was to me quite unintelligible  yet i noticed that when at sunset he accompanied bridget to the spring for water ostentatiously flourishing the empty bucket in his hand when they returned in the gloaming bridget was carrying the water and my friend the tramp was some paces behind her cheerfully colloguing and picking blackberries  at seven the next morning he started in cheerfully to work  at nine a m he had placed three large stones on the first course in position an hour having been spent in looking for a pick and hammer and in the incidental chaffing with bridget  at ten oclock i went to overlook his work it was a rash action as it caused him to respectfully doff his hat discontinue his labors and lean back against the fence in cheerful and easy conservation are you fond uv blackberries captain  i told him that the children were in the habit of getting them from the meadow beyond hoping to estop the suggestion i knew was coming  ah but captain its meself that with wanderin and havin nothin to pass me lips but the berries id pick from the hedgesits meself knows where to find thim  sure its yer childer and foine boys they are captain thats besaching me to go wid em to the place knownst only to meself  it is unnecessary to say that he triumphed  after the manner of vagabonds of all degrees he had enlisted the women and children on his sideand my friend the tramp had his own way  he departed at eleven and returned at four p m with a tin dinnerpail half filled  on interrogating the boys it appeared that they had had a bully time but on crossexamination it came out that they had picked the berries from four to six three more stones were laid and the arduous labors of the day were over  as i stood looking at the first course of six stones my friend the tramp stretched his strong arms out to their fullest extent and said ay but its worruk thats good for me give me worruk and its all ill be askin fur  i ventured to suggest that he had not yet accomplished much  wait till tomorror  ah but yell see thin  its me hand thats yet onaisy wid brickmakin and sthrange to the shtones  an yell wait till tomorror  unfortunately i did not wait  an engagement took me away at an early hour and when i rode up to my cottage at noon my eyes were greeted with the astonishing spectacle of my two boys hard at work laying the courses of the stone wall assisted by bridget and norah who were dragging stones from the hillsides while comfortably stretched on the top of the wall lay my friend the tramp quietly overseeing the operation with lazy and humorous comment  for an instant i was foolishly indignant but he soon brought me to my senses  shure sur its only larnin the boys the habits uv industhry i wasand may they niver know be the same token what it is to worruk fur the bread betune their lips  shure its but makin em think it play i was  as fur the colleens beyint in the kitchen sure isnt it betther they was helping your honor here than colloguing with themselves inside  nevertheless i thought it expedient to forbid henceforth any interruption of servants or children with my friends worruk perhaps it was the result of this embargo that the next morning early the tramp wanted to see me  and its sorry i am to say it to ye sur he began but its the handlin of this stun thats desthroyin me touch at the brickmakin and its better i should lave ye and find worruk at me own thrade  for its worruk i am nadin  it isnt meself captain to ate the bread of oidleness here  and so goodby to ye and if its fifty cints ye can be givin me ontil ill find a killits god thatll repay ye  he got the money  but he got also conditionally a note from me to my next neighbor a wealthy retired physician possessed of a large domain a man eminently practical and businesslike in his management of it  he employed many laborers on the sterile waste he called his farm and it occurred to me that if there really was any work in my friend the tramp which my own indolence and preoccupation had failed to bring out he was the man to do it  i met him a week after  it was with some embarrassment that i inquired after my friend the tramp  oh yes he said reflectively lets see he came monday and left me thursday  he was i think a stout strong man a wellmeaning goodhumored fellow but afflicted with a most singular variety of diseases the first day i put him at work in the stables he developed chills and fever caught in the swamps of louisiana  excuse me i said hurriedly you mean in milwaukee  i know what im talking about returned the doctor testily he told me his whole wretched storyhis escape from the confederate service the attack upon him by armed negroes his concealment in the bayous and swamps  go on doctor i said feebly you were speaking of his work  yes  well his system was full of malaria the first day i had him wrapped up in blankets and dosed with quinine  the next day he was taken with all the symptoms of cholera morbus and i had to keep him up on brandy and capsicum  rheumatism set in on the following day and incapacitated him for work and i concluded i had better give him a note to the director of the city hospital than keep him here  as a pathological study he was good but as i was looking for a man to help about the stable i couldnt afford to keep him in both capacities  as i never could really tell when the doctor was in joke or in earnest i dropped the subject  and so my friend the tramp gradually faded from my memory not however without leaving behind him in the barn where he had slept a lingering flavor of whisky onions and fluffiness  but in two weeks this had gone and the shebang as my friends irreverently termed my habitation knew him no more  yet it was pleasant to think of him as having at last found a job at brickmaking or having returned to his family at milwaukee or making his louisiana home once more happy with his presence or again tempting the fishproducing mainthis time with a noble and equitable captain  it was a lovely august morning when i rode across the sandy peninsula to visit a certain noted family whereof all the sons were valiant and the daughters beautiful  the front of the house was deserted but on the rear veranda i heard the rustle of gowns and above it arose what seemed to be the voice of ulysses reciting his wanderings  there was no mistaking that voice it was my friend the tramp  from what i could hastily gather from his speech he had walked from st john n b to rejoin a distressed wife in new york who was however living with opulent but objectionable relatives an shure miss i wouldnt be askin ye the loan of a cint if i could get worruk at me trade of carpetwavinand maybe ye know of some mannfacthory where they wave carpets beyant here  ah miss and if ye dont give me a cint its enough for the loikes of me to know that me troubles has brought the tears in the most beautiful oiyes in the wurruld and god bless ye for it miss  now i knew that the most beautiful eyes in the world belonged to one of the most sympathetic and tenderest hearts in the world and i felt that common justice demanded my interference between it and one of the biggest scamps in the world  so without waiting to be announced by the servant i opened the door and joined the group on the veranda  if i expected to touch the conscience of my friend the tramp by a dramatic entrance i failed utterly for no sooner did he see me than he instantly gave vent to a howl of delight and falling on his knees before me grasped my hand and turned oratorically to the ladies  oh but its himselfhimself that has come as a witness to me carrakther  oh but its himself that lifted me four wakes ago when i was lyin with a mortal wakeness on the saycoast and tuk me to his house  oh but its himself that shupported me over the faldes and whin the chills and faver came on me and i shivered wid the cold it was himself god bless him as sthripped the coat off his back and giv it me sayin take it dinnis its shtarved with the cowld say air yell be entoirely  ah but look at himwill ye miss  look at his swate modist facea blushin like your own miss  ah look at him will ye  hell be denyin of it in a minitmay the blessin uv god folly him  look at him miss ah but its a swate pair yed make the rascal knew i was a married man  ah miss if you could see him wroightin day and night with such an illigant hand of his ownhe had evidently believed from the gossip of my servants that i was a professor of chirographyif ye could see him miss as i have yed be proud of him  he stopped out of breath  i was so completely astounded i could say nothing the tremendous indictment i had framed to utter as i opened the door vanished completely  and as the most beautiful eyes in the wurruld turned gratefully to minewell  i still retained enough principle to ask the ladies to withdraw while i would take upon myself the duty of examining into the case of my friend the tramp and giving him such relief as was required  i did not know until afterward however that the rascal had already despoiled their scant purses of three dollars and fifty cents  when the door was closed upon them i turned upon him  you infernal rascal  ah captain and would ye be refusin me a carrakther and me givin ye such a one as oi did  god save us but if yed hav seen the luk that the purty one give ye  well before the chills and faver bruk me spirits entirely when i was a young man and makin me tin dollars a week brickmakin its meself that wud hav given  i consider i broke in that a dollar is a fair price for your story and as i shall have to take it all back and expose you before the next twentyfour hours pass i think you had better hasten to milwaukee new york or louisiana  i handed him the dollar  mind i dont want to see your face again  ye wunt captain  and i did not  but it so chanced that later in the season when the migratory inhabitants had flown to their hotair registers in boston and providence i breakfasted with one who had lingered  it was a certain boston lawyerreplete with principle honesty selfdiscipline statistics aesthetics and a perfect consciousness of possessing all these virtues and a full recognition of their market values  i think he tolerated me as a kind of foreigner gently but firmly waiving all argument on any topic frequently distrusting my facts generally my deductions and always my ideas in conversation he always appeared to descend only half way down a long moral and intellectual staircase and always delivered his conclusions over the balusters  i had been speaking of my friend the tramp  there is but one way of treating that class of impostors it is simply to recognize the fact that the law calls him a vagrant and makes his trade a misdemeanor any sentiment on the other side renders you particeps criminis  i dont know but an action would lie against you for encouraging tramps now i have an efficacious way of dealing with these gentry  he rose and took a doublebarreled fowlingpiece from the chimney  when a tramp appears on my property i warn him off  if he persists i fire on himas i would on any criminal trespasser  fire on him i echoed in alarm  yesbut with powder only  of course he doesnt know that  but he doesnt come back  it struck me for the first time that possibly many other of my friends arguments might be only blank cartridges and used to frighten off other trespassing intellects  of course if the tramp still persisted i would be justified in using shot  last evening i had a visit from one  he was coming over the wall  my shot gun was efficacious you should have seen him run  it was useless to argue with so positive a mind and i dropped the subject  after breakfast i strolled over the downs my friend promising to join me as soon as he arranged some household business  it was a lovely peaceful morning not unlike the day when i first met my friend the tramp  the hush of a great benediction lay on land and sea  a few white sails twinkled afar but sleepily one or two large ships were creeping in lazily like my friend the tramp  a voice behind me startled me  my host had rejoined me  his face however looked a little troubled  i just now learned something of importance he began  it appears that with all my precautions that tramp has visited my kitchen and the servants have entertained him  yesterday morning it appears while i was absent he had the audacity to borrow my gun to go duckshooting at the end of two or three hours he returned with two ducks andthe gun  that was at least honest  yesbut  that fool of a girl says that as he handed back the gun he told her it was all right and that he had loaded it up again to save the master trouble  i think i showed my concern in my face for he added hastily it was only duckshot a few wouldnt hurt him  nevertheless we both walked on in silence for a moment  i thought the gun kicked a little he said at last musingly but the idea of hallo whats this  he stopped before the hollow where i had first seen my tramp  it was deserted but on the mosses there were spots of blood and fragments of an old gown bloodstained as if used for bandages i looked at it closely it was the gown intended for the consumptive wife of my friend the tramp  but my host was already nervously tracking the bloodstains that on rock moss and boulder were steadily leading toward the sea  when i overtook him at last on the shore he was standing before a flat rock on which lay a bundle i recognized tied up in a handkerchief and a crooked grapevine stick  he may have come here to wash his woundssalt is a styptic said my host who had recovered his correct precision of statement  i said nothing but looked toward the sea  whatever secret lay hid in its breast it kept it fast  whatever its calm eyes had seen that summer night it gave no reflection now  it lay there passive imperturbable and reticent  but my friend the tramp was gone    the man from solano  he came toward me out of an opera lobby between the actsa figure as remarkable as anything in the performance  his clothes no two articles of which were of the same color had the appearance of having been purchased and put on only an hour or two beforea fact more directly established by the clothesdealers ticket which still adhered to his coatcollar giving the number size and general dimensions of that garment somewhat obtrusively to an uninterested public  his trousers had a straight line down each leg as if he had been born flat but had since developed and there was another crease down his back like those figures children cut out of folded paper  i may add that there was no consciousness of this in his face which was goodnatured and but for a certain squareness in the angle of his lower jaw utterly uninteresting and commonplace  you disremember me he said briefly as he extended his hand but im from solano in californy  i met you there in the spring of 57 i was tendin sheep and you was burnin charcoal  there was not the slightest trace of any intentional rudeness in the reminder  it was simply a statement of fact and as such to be accepted  what i hailed ye for was only this he said after i had shaken hands with him  i saw you a minnit ago standin over in yon boxchirpin with a ladya young lady peart and pretty  might you be telling me her name  i gave him the name of a certain noted belle of a neighboring city who had lately stirred the hearts of the metropolis and who was especially admired by the brilliant and fascinating young dashboard who stood beside me  the man from solano mused for a moment and then said thets so thets the name  its the same gal  you have met her then i asked in surprise  yees he responded slowly i met her about fower months ago shed bin makin a tour of californy with some friends and i first saw her aboard the cars this side of reno  she lost her baggagechecks and i found them on the floor and gave em back to her and she thanked me i reckon now it would be about the square thing to go over thar and sorter recognize her  he stopped a moment and looked at us inquiringly  my dear sir struck in the brilliant and fascinating dashboard if your hesitation proceeds from any doubt as to the propriety of your attire i beg you to dismiss it from your mind at once  the tyranny of custom it is true compels your friend and myself to dress peculiarly but i assure you nothing could be finer than the way that the olive green of your coat melts in the delicate yellow of your cravat or the pearl gray of your trousers blends with the bright blue of your waistcoat and lends additional brilliancy to that massive oroide watchchain which you wear  to my surprise the man from solano did not strike him  he looked at the ironical dashboard with grave earnestness and then said quietly  then i reckon you wouldnt mind showin me in thar  dashboard was i admit a little staggered at this  but he recovered himself and bowing ironically led the way to the box i followed him and the man from solano  now the belle in question happened to be a gentlewomandescended from gentlewomenand after dashboards ironical introduction in which the man from solano was not spared she comprehended the situation instantly  to dashboards surprise she drew a chair to her side made the man from solano sit down quietly turned her back on dashboard and in full view of the brilliant audience and the focus of a hundred lorgnettes entered into conversation with him  here for the sake of romance i should like to say he became animated and exhibited some trait of excellencesome rare wit or solid sense but the fact is he was dull and stupid to the last degree  he persisted in keeping the conversation upon the subject of the lost baggagechecks and every bright attempt of the lady to divert him failed signally  at last to everybodys relief he rose and leaning over her chair said  i calklate to stop over here some time miss and you and me bein sorter strangers here maybe when theres any show like this goin on youll let me  miss x said somewhat hastily that the multiplicity of her engagements and the brief limit of her stay in new york she feared would etc etc  the two other ladies had their handkerchiefs over their mouths and were staring intently on the stage when the man from solano continued  then maybe miss whenever there is a show goin on that youll attend youll just drop me word to earles hotel to this yer address and he pulled from his pocket a dozen wellworn letters and taking the buff envelope from one handed it to her with something like a bow  certainly broke in the facetious dashboard miss x goes to the charity ball tomorrow night  the tickets are but a trifle to an opulent californian and a man of your evident means and the object a worthy one  you will no doubt easily secure an invitation  miss x raised her handsome eyes for a moment to dashboard  by all means she said turning to the man from solano and as mr dashboard is one of the managers and you are a stranger he will of course send you a complimentary ticket  i have known mr dashboard long enough to know that he is invariably courteous to strangers and a gentleman she settled herself in her chair again and fixed her eyes upon the stage  the man from solano thanked the man of new york and then after shaking hands with every body in the box turned to go  when he had reached the door he looked back to miss x and said  it was one of the queerest things in the world miss that my findin them checks  but the curtain had just then risen on the garden scene in faust and miss x was absorbed  the man from solano carefully shut the box door and retired  i followed him  he was silent until he reached the lobby and then he said as if renewing a previous conversation she is a mighty peart galthats so  shes just my kind and will make a stavin good wife  i thought i saw danger ahead for the man from solano so i hastened to tell him that she was beset by attentions that she could have her pick and choice of the best of society and finally that she was most probably engaged to dashboard  thats so he said quietly without the slightest trace of feeling it would be mighty queer if she wasnt  but i reckon ill steer down to the hotel  i dont care much for this yellin  he was alluding to a cadenza of that famous cantatrice signora batti batti  whats the time  he pulled out his watch  it was such a glaring chain so obviously bogus that my eyes were fascinated by it  youre looking at that watch he said its purty to look at but she dont go worth a cent and yet her price was 125 gold  i gobbled her up in chatham street day before yesterday where they were selling em very cheap at auction  you have been outrageously swindled i said indignantly  watch and chain are not worth twenty dollars  are they worth fifteen he asked gravely  possibly  then i reckon its a fair trade  ye see i told em i was a californian from solano and hadnt anything about me of greenbacks  i had three slugs with me  ye remember them slugs i did the slug was a token issued in the early daysa hexagonal piece of gold a little over twice the size of a twentydollar gold pieceworth and accepted for fifty dollars  well i handed them that and they handed me the watch  you see them slugs i had made myself outer brass filings and iron pyrites and used to slap em down on the boys for a bluff in a game of draw poker  you see not being reglar govment money it wasnt counterfeiting  i reckon they cost me counting time and anxiety about fifteen dollars so if this yer watch is worth that its about a square game aint it  i began to understand the man from solano and said it was  he returned his watch to his pocket toyed playfully with the chain and remarked kinder makes a man look fashnable and wealthy dont it  i agreed with him  but what do you intend to do here i asked  well ive got a cash capital of nigh on seven hundred dollars  i guess until i get into reglar business ill skirmish round wall street and sorter lay low  i was about to give him a few words of warning but i remembered his watch and desisted  we shook hands and parted  a few days after i met him on broadway  he was attired in another new suit but i think i saw a slight improvement in his general appearance only five distinct colors were visible in his attire but this i had reason to believe afterwards was accidental  i asked him if he had been to the ball  he said he had  that gal and a mighty peart gal she was too was there but she sorter fought shy of me  i got this new suit to go in but those waiters sorter run me into a private box and i didnt get much chance to continner our talk about them checks  but that young feller dashboard was mighty perlite  he brought lots of fellers and young women round to the box to see me and he made up a party that night to take me round wall street and in them stock boards  and the next day he called for me and took me and i invested about five hundred dollars in them stocksmay be more  you see we sorter swopped stocks  you know i had ten shares in the peacock copper mine that you was once secretary of  but those shares are not worth a cent  the whole thing exploded ten years ago  thats so may be you say so  but then i didnt know anything more about communipaw central or the naphtha gaslight company and so i thought it was a square game  only i realized on the stocks i bought and i kem up outer wall street about four hundred dollars better  you see it was a sorter risk after all for them peacock stocks might come up  i looked into his face it was immeasurably serene and commonplace i began to be a little afraid of the man or rather of my want of judgment of the man and after a few words we shook hands and parted  it was some months before i again saw the man from solano  when i did i found that he had actually become a member of the stock board and had a little office on broad street where he transacted a fair business  my remembrance going back to the first night i met him i inquired if he had renewed his acquaintance with miss x i heerd that she was in newport this summer and i ran down there fur a week  and you talked with her about the baggagechecks  no he said seriously she gave me a commission to buy some stocks for her  you see i guess them fashnable fellers sorter got to runnin her about me and so she put our acquaintance on a square business footing  i tell you shes a right peart gal  did ye hear of the accident that happened to her  i had not  well you see she was out yachting and i managed through one of those fellers to get an invite too  the whole thing was got up by a man that they say is going to marry her  well one afternoon the boom swings round in a little squall and knocks her overboard there was an awful excitementyouve heard about it may be  no  but i saw it all with a romancers instinct in a flash of poetry  this poor fellow debarred through uncouthness from expressing his affection for her had at last found his fitting opportunity  he had  thar was an awful row he went on  i ran out on the taffrail and there a dozen yards away was that purty creature that peart gal andi  you jumped for her i said hastily  no he said gravely  i let the other man do the jumping  i sorter looked on  i stared at him in astonishment  no he went on seriously  he was the man who jumpedthat was just then his puthis line of business  you see if i had waltzed over the side of that ship and cavoorted in and flummuxed round and finally flopped to the bottom that other man would have jumped naterallike and saved her and ez he was going to marry her anyway i dont exactly see where id hev been represented in the transaction but dont you see ef after hed jumped and hadnt got her hed gone down himself id hev had the next best chance and the advantage of heving him outer the way  you see you dont understand mei dont think you did in californy  then he did save her  of course  dont you see she was all right  if hed missed her id have chipped in  thar warnt no sense in my doing his duty onless he failed  somehow the story got out  the man from solano as a butt became more popular than ever and of course received invitations to burlesque receptions and naturally met a great many people whom otherwise he would not have seen  it was observed also that his seven hundred dollars were steadily growing and that he seemed to be getting on in his business  certain california stocks which i had seen quietly interred in the old days in the tombs of their fathers were magically revived and i remember as one who has seen a ghost to have been shocked as i looked over the quotations one morning to have seen the ghostly face of the dead beat beach mining co rouged and plastered looking out from the columns of the morning paper  at last a few people began to respect or suspect the man from solano  at last suspicion culminated with this incident  he had long expressed a wish to belong to a certain fashnble club and with a view of burlesque he was invited to visit the club where a series of ridiculous entertainments were given him winding up with a card party  as i passed the steps of the clubhouse early next morning i overheard two or three members talking excitedly  he cleaned everybody out  why he must have raked in nigh on 40000  who i asked  the man from solano  as i turned away one of the gentlemen a victim noted for his sporting propensities followed me and laying his hand on my shoulders asked  tell me fairly now  what business did your friend follow in california  he was a shepherd  a what  a shepherd  tended his flocks on the honeyscented hills of solano  well all i can say is dn your california pastorals    the office seeker  he asked me if i had ever seen the remus sentinel  i replied that i had not and would have added that i did not even know where remus was when he continued by saying it was strange the hotel proprietor did not keep the sentinel on his files and that he himself should write to the editor about it  he would not have spoken about it but he himself had been an humble member of the profession to which i belonged and had often written for its columns  some friends of hispartial no doubthad said that his style somewhat resembled juniuss but of course you knowwell what he could say was that in the last campaign his articles were widely sought for  he did not know but he had a copy of one  here his hand dived into the breastpocket of his coat with a certain deftness that indicated long habit and after depositing on his lap a bundle of wellworn documents every one of which was glaringly suggestive of certificates and signatures he concluded he had left it in his trunk  i breathed more freely  we were sitting in the rotunda of a famous washington hotel and only a few moments before had the speaker an utter stranger to me moved his chair beside mine and opened a conversation  i noticed that he had that timid lonely helpless air which invests the bucolic traveler who for the first time finds himself among strangers and his identity lost in a world so much larger so much colder so much more indifferent to him than he ever imagined  indeed i think that what we often attribute to the impertinent familiarity of countrymen and rustic travelers on railways or in cities is largely due to their awful loneliness and nostalgia  i remember to have once met in a smokingcar on a kansas railway one of these lonely ones who after plying me with a thousand useless questions finally elicited the fact that i knew slightly a man who had once dwelt in his native town in illinois during the rest of our journey the conversation turned chiefly upon his fellowtownsman whom it afterwards appeared that my illinois friend knew no better than i did  but he had established a link between himself and his faroff home through me and was happy  while this was passing through my mind i took a fair look at him he was a spare young fellow not more than thirty with sandy hair and eyebrows and eyelashes so white as to be almost imperceptible he was dressed in black somewhat to the rearward o the fashion and i had an odd idea that it had been his wedding suit and it afterwards appeared i was right  his manner had the precision and much of the dogmatism of the country schoolmaster accustomed to wrestle with the feeblest intellects  from his history which he presently gave me it appeared i was right here also  he was born and bred in a western state and as schoolmaster of remus and clerk of supervisors had married one of his scholars the daughter of a clergyman and a man of some little property  he had attracted some attention by his powers of declamation and was one of the principal members of the remus debating society  the various questions then agitating remusis the doctrine of immortality consistent with an agricultural life and are round dances morally wrongafforded him an opportunity of bringing himself prominently before the country people  perhaps i might have seen an extract copied from the remus sentinel in the christian recorder of may 7 1875  no  he would get it for me he had taken an active part in the last campaign  he did not like to say it but it had been universally acknowledged that he had elected gashwiler  who  gen pratt c gashwiler member of congress from our deestrict  oh  a powerful man sira very powerful man a man whose influence will presently be felt here sirhere  well he had come on with gashwiler andwell he did not know whygashwiler did not know why he should not you know a feeble halfapologetic laugh here receive that reward you know for these services which etc etc  i asked him if he had any particular or definite office in view  well no  he had left that to gashwiler  gashwiler had saidhe remembered his very words leave it all to me ill look through the different departments and see what can be done for a man of your talents  and  hes looking  im expecting him back here every minute  hes gone over to the department of tape to see what can be done there  ah here he comes  a large man approached us  he was very heavy very unwieldy very unctuous and oppressive  he affected the honest farmer but so badly that the poorest husbandman would have resented it  there was a suggestion of a cheap lawyer about him that would have justified any selfrespecting judge in throwing him over the bar at once  there was a military suspicion about him that would have entitled him to a courtmartial on the spot  there was an introduction from which i learned that my officeseeking friends name was expectant dobbs  and then gashwiler addressed me  our young friend here is waiting waiting  waiting i may say on the affairs of state  youth continued the hon mr gashwiler addressing an imaginary constituency is nothing but a season of waitingof preparationha ha  as he laid his hand in a fatherly mannera fatherly manner that was as much of a sham as anything else about himi dont know whether i was more incensed at him or his victim who received it with evident pride and satisfaction  nevertheless he ventured to falter out  has anything been done yet  well no i cant say that anythingthat is that anything has been completed but i may say we are in excellent position for an advanceha ha  but we must wait my young friend wait  what is it the latin philosopher says  let us by all means hasten slowlyha ha and he turned to me as if saying confidentially observe the impatience of these boys  i met a moment ago my old friend and boyhoods companion jim mcglasher chief of the bureau for the dissemination of useless information and lowering his voice to a mysterious but audible whisper i shall see him again tomorrow  the all aboard of the railway omnibus at this moment tore me from the presence of this gifted legislator and his protege but as we drove away i saw through the open window the powerful mind of gashwiler operating so to speak upon the susceptibilities of mr dobbs  i did not meet him again for a week  the morning of my return i saw the two conversing together in the hall but with the palpable distinction between this and their former interviews that the gifted gashwiler seemed to be anxious to get away from his friend i heard him say something about committees and tomorrow and when dobbs turned his freckled face toward me i saw that he had got at last some expression into itdisappointment  i asked him pleasantly how he was getting on  he had not lost his pride yet  he was doing well although such was the value set upon his friend gashwilers abilities by his brother members that he was almost always occupied with committee business  i noticed that his clothes were not in as good case as before and he told me that he had left the hotel and taken lodgings in a bystreet where it was less expensive  temporarily of course  a few days after this i had business in one of the great departments from the various signs over the doors of its various offices and bureaus it always oddly reminded me of stewarts or arnold and constables  you could get pensions patents and plants  you could get land and the seeds to put in it and the indians to prowl round it and what not  there was a perpetual clanging of office desk bells and a running hither and thither of messengers strongly suggestive of cash 47  as my business was with the manager of this great national fancy shop i managed to push by the sadeyed eagerfaced crowd of men and women in the anteroom and entered the secretarys room conscious of having left behind me a great deal of envy and uncharitableness of spirit  as i opened the door i heard a monotonous flow of western speech which i thought i recognized there was no mistaking it  it was the voice of the gashwiler  the appointment of this man mr secretary would be most acceptable to the people in my deestrict  his family are wealthy and influential and its just as well in the fall elections to have the supervisors and county judge pledged to support the administration  our delegates to the state central committee are to a manbut here perceiving from the wandering eye of mr secretary that there was another man in the room he whispered the rest with a familiarity that must have required all the politician in the officials breast to keep from resenting  you have some papers i suppose asked the secretary wearily  gashwiler was provided with a pocketful and produced them  the secretary threw them on the table among the other papers where they seemed instantly to lose their identity and looked as if they were ready to recommend anybody but the person they belonged to indeed in one corner the entire massachusetts delegation with the supreme bench at their head appeared to be earnestly advocating the manuring of iowa waste lands and to the inexperienced eye a noted female reformer had apparently appended her signature to a request for a pension for wounds received in battle  by the way said the secretary i think i have a letter here from somebody in your district asking an appointment and referring to you do you withdraw it  if anybody has been presuming to speculate upon my patronage said the hon mr gashwiler with rising rage  ive got the letter somewhere here said the secretary looking dazedly at his table  he made a feeble movement among the papers and then sank back hopelessly in his chair and gazed out of the window as if he thought and rather hoped it might have flown away it was from a mr globbs or gobbs or dobbs of remus he said finally after a superhuman effort of memory  oh thats nothinga foolish fellow who has been boring me for the last month  then i am to understand that this application is withdrawn  as far as my patronage is concerned certainly  in fact such an appointment would not express the sentimentsindeed i may say would be calculated to raise active opposition in the deestrict  the secretary uttered a sigh of relief and the gifted gashwiler passed out  i tried to get a good look at the honorable scamps eye but he evidently did not recognize me  it was a question in my mind whether i ought not to expose the treachery of dobbss friend but the next time i met dobbs he was in such good spirits that i forebore  it appeared that his wife had written to him that she had discovered a second cousin in the person of the assistant superintendent of the envelope flap moistening bureau of the department of tape and had asked his assistance and dobbs had seen him and he had promised it  you see said dobbs in the performance of his duties he is often very near the person of the secretary frequently in the next room and he is a powerful man sira powerful man to know sira very powerful man  how long this continued i do not remember  long enough however for dobbs to become quite seedy for the giving up of wrist cuffs for the neglect of shoes and beard and for great hollows to form round his eyes and a slight flush on his cheekbones  i remember meeting him in all the departments writing letters or waiting patiently in anterooms from morning till night  he had lost all his old dogmatism but not his pride  i might as well be here as anywhere while im waiting he said and then im getting some knowledge of the details of official life  in the face of this mystery i was surprised at finding a note from him one day inviting me to dine with him at a certain famous restaurant i had scarce got over my amazement when the writer himself overtook me at my hotel  for a moment i scarcely recognized him  a new suit of fashionablycut clothes had changed him without however entirely concealing his rustic angularity of figure and outline  he even affected a fashionable dilettante air but so mildly and so innocently that it was not offensive  you see he began explanatorywise ive just found out the way to do it  none of these big fellows these cabinet officers know me except as an applicant  now the way to do this thing is to meet em fust sociably wine em and dine em  why sirhe dropped into the schoolmaster again herei had two cabinet ministers two judges and a general at my table last night  on your invitation  dear no all i did was to pay for it  tom soufflet gave the dinner and invited the people  everybody knows tom  you see a friend of mine put me up to it and said that soufflet had fixed up no end of appointments and jobs in that way  you see when these gentlemen get sociable over their wine he says carelessly by the way theres soandsoa good fellowwants something give it to him  and the first thing you know or they know he gets a promise from them  they get a dinnerand a good oneand he gets an appointment  but where did you get the money  ohhe hesitatedi wrote home and fannys father raised fifteen hundred dollars some way and sent it to me  i put it down to political expenses  he laughed a weak foolish laugh here and added as the old man dont drink nor smoke hed lift his eyebrows to know how the money goes  but ill make it all right when the office comesand shes coming sure pop  his slang fitted as poorly on him as his clothes and his familiarity was worse than his former awkward shyness  but i could not help asking him what had been the result of this expenditure  nothing just yet  but the secretary of tape and the man at the head of the inferior department both spoke to me and one of them said he thought hed heard my name before  he might he added with a forced laugh for ive written him fifteen letters  three months passed  a heavy snowstorm stayed my chariot wheels on a western railroad ten miles from a nervous lecture committee and a waiting audience there was nothing to do but to make the attempt to reach them in a sleigh  but the way was long and the drifts deep and when at last four miles out we reached a little village the driver declared his cattle could hold out no longer and we must stop there bribes and threats were equally of no avail  i had to accept the fact  what place is this  remus  remus remus where had i heard that name before  but while i was reflecting he drove up before the door of the tavern  it was a dismal sleepforbidding place and only nine oclock and here was the long winters night before me  failing to get the landlord to give me a team to go further i resigned myself to my fate and a cigar behind the redhot stove  in a few moments one of the loungers approached me calling me by name and in a rough but hearty fashion condoled with me for my mishap advised me to stay at remus all night and added the quarters aint the best in the world yer at this hotel  but thars an old man yerthe preacher that wasthat for twenty years hez taken in such fellers as you and lodged em free gratis for nothing and hez been proud to do it  the old man used to be rich he aint so now sold his big house on the cross roads and lives in a little cottage with his darter right over yan  but ye couldnt do him a better turn than to go over thar and stay and if he thought id let ye go out o remus without axing ye hed give me hll  stop ill go with ye  i might at least call on the old man and i accompanied my guide through the still falling snow until we reached a little cottage the door opened to my guides knock and with the brief and discomposing introduction yer ole man ive brought you one o them snowbound lecturers he left me on the threshold as my host a kindlyfaced whitehaired man of seventy came forward to greet me  his frankness and simple courtesy overcame the embarrassment left by my guides introduction and i followed him passively as he entered the neat but plainlyfurnished sittingroom  at the same moment a pretty but faded young woman arose from the sofa and was introduced to me as his daughter  fanny and i live here quite alone and if you knew how good it was to see somebody from the great outside world now and then you would not apologize for what you call your intrusion  during this speech i was vaguely trying to recall where and when and under what circumstances i had ever before seen the village the house the old man or his daughter  was it in a dream or in one of those dim reveries of some previous existence to which the spirit of mankind is subject  i looked at them again  in the careworn lines around the once pretty girlish mouth of the young woman in the furrowed seams over the forehead of the old man in the ticking of the oldfashioned clock on the shelf in the faint whisper of the falling snow outside i read the legend patience patience wait and hope  the old man filled a pipe and offering me one continued although i seldom drink myself it was my custom to always keep some nourishing liquor in my house for passing guests but tonight i find myself without any  i hastened to offer him my flask which after a moments coyness he accepted and presently under its benign influence at least ten years dropped from his shoulders and he sat up in his chair erect and loquacious  and how are affairs at the national capital sir he began  now if there was any subject of which i was profoundly ignorant it was this  but the old man was evidently bent on having a good political talk  so i said vaguely yet with a certain sense of security that i guessed there wasnt much being done  i see said the old man in the matters of resumption of the sovereign rights of states and federal interference you would imply that a certain conservative tentative policy is to be promulgated until after the electoral committee have given their verdict  i looked for help towards the lady and observed feebly that he had very clearly expressed my views  the old man observing my look said although my daughters husband holds a federal position in washington the pressure of his business is so great that he has little time to give us mere gossipi beg your pardon did you speak  i had unconsciously uttered an exclamation  this then was remusthe home of expectant dobbsand these his wife and father and the washington banquettable ah me had sparkled with the yearning hearts blood of this poor wife and had been upheld by this tottering caryatid of a father  do you know what position he has  the old man did not know positively but thought it was some general supervising position  he had been assured by mr gashwiler that it was a firstclass clerkship yes a first class  i did not tell him that in this as in many other official regulations in washington they reckoned backward but said  i suppose that your m c mrmr gashwiler  dont mention his name said the little woman rising to her feet hastily he never brought expectant anything but disappointment and sorrow  i hate i despise the man  dear fanny expostulated the old man gently this is unchristian and unjust  mr gashwiler is a powerful a very powerful man  his work is a great one his time is preoccupied with weightier matters  his time was not so preoccupied but he could make use of poor expectant said this wounded dove a little spitefully  nevertheless it was some satisfaction to know that dobbs had at last got a place no matter how unimportant or who had given it to him and when i went to bed that night in the room that had been evidently prepared for their conjugal chamber i felt that dobbss worst trials were over  the walls were hung with souvenirs of their antenuptial days  there was a portrait of dobbs aetat 25 there was a faded bouquet in a glass case presented by dobbs to fanny on examinationday there was a framed resolution of thanks to dobbs from the remus debating society there was a certificate of dobbss election as president of the remus philomathean society there was his commission as captain in the remus independent contingent of home guards there was a freemasons chart in which dobbs was addressed in epithets more fulsome and extravagant than any living monarch  and yet all these cheap glories of a narrow life and narrower brain were upheld and made sacred by the love of the devoted priestess who worshiped at this lonely shrine and kept the light burning through gloom and doubt and despair  the storm tore round the house and shook its white fists in the windows  a dried wreath of laurel that fanny had placed on dobbss head after his celebrated centennial address at the schoolhouse july 4 1876 swayed in the gusts and sent a few of its dead leaves down on the floor and i lay in dobbss bed and wondered what a firstclass clerkship was  i found out early the next summer  i was strolling through the long corridors of a certain great department when i came upon a man accurately yoked across the shoulders and supporting two huge pails of ice on either side from which he was replenishing the pitchers in the various offices  as i passed i turned to look at him again  it was dobbs  he did not set down his burden it was against the rules he said but he gossiped cheerily said he was beginning at the foot of the ladder but expected soon to climb up  that it was civil service reform and of course he would be promoted soon  had gashwiler procured the appointment  no  he believed it was me  i had told his story to assistantsecretary blank who had in turn related it to bureaudirector dashboth good fellowsbut this was all they could do  yes it was a foothold  but he must go now  nevertheless i followed him up and down and cheered up with a rosecolored picture of his wife and family and my visit there and promising to come and see him the next time i came to washington i left him with his selfimposed yoke  with a new administration civil service reform came in crude and illdigested as all sudden and sweeping reforms must be cruel to the individual as all crude reforms will ever be and among the list of helpless men and women incapacitated for other work by long service in the dull routine of federal office who were decapitated the weak foolish emaciated head of expectant dobbs went to the block  it afterward appeared that the gifted gashwiler was responsible for the appointment of twenty clerks and that the letter of poor dobbs in which he dared to refer to the now powerless gashwiler had sealed his fate  the country made an example of gashwiler anddobbs  from that moment he disappeared  i looked for him in vain in anterooms lobbies and hotel corridors and finally came to the conclusion that he had gone home  how beautiful was that july sabbath when the morning train from baltimore rolled into the washington depot  how tenderly and chastely the morning sunlight lay on the east front of the capitol until the whole building was hushed in a grand and awful repose how difficult it was to think of a gashwiler creeping in and out of those enfiling columns or crawling beneath that portico without wondering that yon majestic figure came not down with flat of sword to smite the fat rotundity of the intruder  how difficult to think that parricidal hands have ever been lifted against the great mother typified here in the graceful white chastity of her garments in the noble tranquillity of her face in the gathering up her whiterobed children within her shadow  this led me to think of dobbs when suddenly a face flashed by my carriage window  i called to the driver to stop and looking again saw that it was a woman standing bewildered and irresolute on the street corner  as she turned her anxious face toward me i saw that it was mrs dobbs  what was she doing here and where was expectant  she began an incoherent apology and then burst into explanatory tears when i had got her in the carriage she said between her sobs that expectant had not returned that she had received a letter from a friend here saying he was sickoh very very sickand father could not come with her so she came alone  she was so frightened so lonely so miserable  had she his address  yes just here  it was on the outskirts of washington near georgetown  then i would take her there if i could for she knew nobody  on our way i tried to cheer her up by pointing out some of the children of the great mother before alluded to but she only shut her eyes as we rolled down the long avenues and murmured oh these cruel cruel distances  at last we reached the locality a negro quarter yet clean and neat in appearance  i saw the poor girl shudder slightly as we stopped at the door of a low twostory frame house from which the unwonted spectacle of a carriage brought a crowd of halfnaked children and a comely cleanly kindfaced mulatto woman  yes this was the house  he was upstairs rather poorly but asleep she thought  we went upstairs  in the first chamber clean though poorly furnished lay dobbs  on a pine table near his bed were letters and memorials to the various departments and on the bedquilt unfinished but just as the weary fingers had relaxed their grasp upon it lay a letter to the tape department  as we entered the room he lifted himself on his elbow  fanny he said quickly and a shade of disappointment crossed his face  i thought it was a message from the secretary he added apologetically  the poor woman had suffered too much already to shrink from this last crushing blow  but she walked quietly to his side without a word or cry knelt placed her loving arms around him and i left them so together  when i called again in the evening he was better so much better that against the doctors orders he had talked to her quite cheerfully and hopefully for an hour until suddenly raising her bowed head in his two hands he said do you know dear that in looking for help and influence there was one dear i had forgotten one who is very potent with kings and councilors and i think love i shall ask him to interest himself in my behalf  it is not too late yet darling and i shall seek him tomorrow  and before the morrow came he had sought and found him and i doubt not got a good place    a sleepingcar experience  it was in a pullman sleepingcar on a western road  after that first plunge into unconsciousness which the weary traveler takes on getting into his berth i awakened to the dreadful revelation that i had been asleep only two hours  the greater part of a long winter night was before me to face with staring eyes  finding it impossible to sleep i lay there wondering a number of things why for instance the pullman sleepingcar blankets were unlike other blankets why they were like squares cut out of cold buckwheat cakes and why they clung to you when you turned over and lay heavy on you without warmth why the curtains before you could not have been made opaque without being so thick and suffocating why it would not be as well to sit up all night half asleep in an ordinary passengercar as to lie awake all night in a pullman  but the snoring of my fellowpassengers answered this question in the negative  with the recollection of last nights dinner weighing on me as heavily and coldly as the blankets i began wondering why over the whole extent of the continent there was no local dish why the bill of fare at restaurant and hotel was invariably only a weak reflex of the metropolitan hostelries why the entrees were always the same only more or less badly cooked why the traveling american always was supposed to demand turkey and cold cranberry sauce why the pretty waitergirl apparently shuffled your plates behind your back and then dealt them over your shoulder in a semicircle as if they were a hand at cards and not always a good one  why having done this she instantly retired to the nearest wall and gazed at you scornfully as one who would say fair sir though lowly i am proud if thou dost imagine that i would permit undue familiarity of speech beware  and then i began to think of and dread the coming breakfast to wonder why the ham was always cut half an inch thick and why the fried egg always resembled a glass eye that visibly winked at you with diabolical dyspeptic suggestions to wonder if the buckwheat cakes the eating of which requires a certain degree of artistic preparation and deliberation would be brought in as usual one minute before the train started and then i had a vivid recollection of a fellowpassenger who at a certain breakfast station in illinois frantically enwrapped his portion of this national pastry in his red bandana handkerchief took it into the smokingcar and quietly devoured it en route  lying broad awake i could not help making some observations which i think are not noticed by the day traveler  first that the speed of a train is not equal or continuous  that at certain times the engine apparently starts up and says to the baggage train behind it come come this wont do  why its nearly halfpast two how in hll shall we get through  dont you talk to me  pooh pooh delivered in that rhythmical fashion which all meditation assumes on a railway train exempli gratia  one night having raised my windowcurtain to look over a moonlit snowy landscape as i pulled it down the lines of a popular comic song flashed across me  fatal error  the train instantly took it up and during the rest of the night i was haunted by this awful refrain pull down the bellind pull down the bellind simebodys klink klink o dont be shooshoo  naturally this differs on the different railways  on the new york central where the roadbed is quite perfect and the steel rails continuous i have heard this irreverent train give the words of a certain popular revival hymn after this fashion hold the fort for i am sankey moody slingers still wave the swish swash back from klinky klinky klanky kill on the new york and new haven where there are many switches and the engine whistles at every cross road i have often heard tommy make room for your whooopy thats a little clang bumpity bumpity boopy clikitty clikitty clang  poetry i fear fared little better  one starlit night coming from quebec as we slipped by a virgin forest the opening lines of evangeline flashed upon me  but all i could make of them was this this is the forest primevaleval the groves of the pines and the hemlockslockslockslocksloooock  the train was only slowing or braking up at a station  hence the jar in the metre  i had noticed a peculiar aeolian harplike cry that ran through the whole train as we settled to rest at last after a long runan almost sigh of infinite relief a musical sigh that began in c and ran gradually up to f natural which i think most observant travelers have noticed day and night  no railway official has ever given me a satisfactory explanation of it  as the car in a rapid run is always slightly projected forward of its trucks a practical friend once suggested to me that it was the gradual settling back of the car body to a state of inertia which of course every poetical traveler would reject  four oclock the sound of bootblacking by the porter faintly apparent from the toiletroom  why not talk to him  but fortunately i remembered that any attempt at extended conversation with conductor or porter was always resented by them as implied disloyalty to the company they represented  i recalled that once i had endeavored to impress upon a conductor the absolute folly of a midnight inspection of tickets and had been treated by him as an escaped lunatic  no there was no relief from this suffocating and insupportable loneliness to be gained then  i raised the windowblind and looked out  we were passing a farmhouse  a light evidently the lantern of a farmhand was swung beside a barn  yes the faintest tinge of rose in the far horizon  morning surely at last  we had stopped at a station  two men had got into the car and had taken seats in the one vacant section yawning occasionally and conversing in a languid perfunctory sort of way  they sat opposite each other occasionally looking out of the window but always giving the strong impression that they were tired of each others company  as i looked out of my curtains at them the one man said with a feebly concealed yawn  yes well i reckon he was at one time as poplar an ondertaker ez i knew  the other man inventing a question rather than giving an answer out of some languid social impulse but was hethis yer ondertakera christianhed he jined the church  the one man reflectively well i dont know ez you might call him a purfessin christian but he hedyes he hed conviction  i think dr wylie hed him under conviction  et least that was the way i got it from him  a long dreary pause  the other man feeling it was incumbent upon him to say something but why was he poplar ez an ondertaker  the one man lazily well he was kinder poplar with widders and widdererssorter soothen em a kinder keerless way slung em suthin here and there sometimes outer the book sometimes outer hisself ez a man of experience as hed hed sorror  hed they say very cautiously lost three wives hisself and five children by this yer new diseasediptheryout in wisconsin  i dont know the facts but thats whats got round  the other man but how did he lose his poplarity  the one man well thats the question  you see he interduced some things into ondertaking that waz new  he hed for instance a way as he called it of manniperlating the features of the deceased  the other man quietly how manniperlating  the one man struck with a bright and aggressive thought look yer did ye ever notiss how generally speakin onhandsome a corpse is  the other man had noticed this fact  the one man returning to his fact why there was mary peebles ez was daughter of my wifes bosom frienda mighty pooty girl and a professing christiandied of scarlet fever  well that gali was one of the mourners being my wifes friendwell that gal though i hednt perhaps oughter saylying in that casket fetched all the way from some a1 establishment in chicago filled with flowers and furbelowsdidnt really seem to be of much account  well although my wifes friend and me a mournerwell now i wasdisappointed and discouraged  the other man in palpably affected sympathy sho now  yes sir  well you see this yer ondertaker this wilkins hed a way of correctin all thet  and just by manniperlation  he worked over the face of the deceased ontil he perduced what the survivin relatives called a look of resignationyou know a sort of smile like  when he wanted to put in any extrys he perduced what he calledhevin reglar charges for this kind of worka christians hope  the other man i want to know  yes  well i admit at times it was a little startlin  and ive allers said a little confidentially that i had my doubts of its being scriptoorl or sacred we being ez you know worms of the yearth and i relieved my mind to our pastor but he didnt feel like interferin ez long ez it was confined to church membership but the other day when cy dunham diedyou disremember cy dunham  a long interval of silence  the other man was looking out of the window and had apparently forgotten his companion completely  but as i stretched my head out of the curtain i saw four other heads as eagerly reached out from other berths to hear the conclusion of the story  one head a female one instantly disappeared on my looking around but a certain tremulousness of her windowcurtain showed an unabated interest  the only two utterly disinterested men were the one man and the other man  the other man detaching himself languidly from the window cy dunham  yes cy never hed hed either convictions or purfessions  uster get drunk and go round with permiscous women  sorter like the prodigal son only a little more so ez fur ez i kin judge from the facks ez stated to me  well cy one day petered out down at little rock and was sent up yer for interment  the fammerly being proudlike of course didnt spare no money on that funeral and it waznow between you and meabout ez shapely and firstclass and primemess affair ez i ever saw  wilkins hed put in his extrys he hed put onto that prodigals face the a1 touchhed him fixed up with a christians hope  well it was about the turningpoint for thar waz some of the members and the pastor hisself thought that the line oughter to be drawn somewhere and thar was some talk at deacon tibbets about a reglar conference meetin regardin it  but it wasnt thet which made him onpoplar  another silence no expression nor reflection from the face of the other man of the least desire to know what ultimately settled the unpopularity of the undertaker  but from the curtains of the various berths several eager and one or two even wrathful faces anxious for the result  the other man lazily recurring to the fading topic well what made him onpoplar  the one man quietly extrys i thinkthat is i suppose not knowin cautiously all the facts  when mrs widdecombe lost her husband bout two months ago though shed been through the valley of the shadder of death twicethis bein her third marriage hevin been john barkers widder  the other man with an intense expression of interest no youre foolin me  the one man solemnly ef i was to appear before my maker tomorrow yes she was the widder of barker  the other man well i swow  the one man well this widder widdecombe she put up a big funeral for the deceased  she hed wilkins and thet ondertaker just laid hisself out  just spread hisself  onfortnatlyperhaps fortnatly in the ways of providenceone of widdecombes old friends a doctor up thar in chicago comes down to the funeral  he goes up with the friends to look at the deceased smilin a peaceful sort o heavinly smile and everybody sayin hes gone to meet his reward and this yer friend turns round short and sudden on the widder settin in her pew and kinder enjoyin as

he  hell is full of thet kind of resignation  its pizon  and ill  why dern my skin yes we are yes its joliet  wall now whod hey thought wed been nigh onto an hour  two or three anxious passengers from their berths say look yer stranger  old man  what became of  but the one man and the other man had vanished    morning on the avenue  notes by an early riser  i have always been an early riser  the popular legend that early to bed and early to rise invariably and rhythmically resulted in healthfulness opulence and wisdom i beg here to solemnly protest against  as an unhealthy man as an unwealthy man and doubtless by virtue of this protest an unwise man i am i think a glaring example of the untruth of the proposition  for instance it is my misfortune as an early riser to live upon a certain fashionable avenue where the practice of early rising is confined exclusively to domestics  consequently when i issue forth on this broad beautiful thoroughfare at six a m i cannot help thinking that i am to a certain extent desecrating its traditional customs  i have more than once detected the milkman winking at the maid with a diabolical suggestion that i was returning from a carouse and roundsman 9999 has once or twice followed me a block or two with the evident impression that i was a burglar returning from a successful evening out  nevertheless these various indiscretions have brought me into contact with a kind of character and phenomena whose existence i might otherwise have doubted  first let me speak of a large class of workingpeople whose presence is i think unknown to many of those gentlemen who are in the habit of legislating or writing about them  a majority of these early risers in the neighborhood of which i may call my beat carry with them unmistakable evidences of the american type i have seen so little of that foreign element that is popularly supposed to be the real working class of the great metropolis that i have often been inclined to doubt statistics  the ground that my morning rambles cover extends from twentythird street to washington park and laterally from sixth avenue to broadway  the early rising artisans that i meet here crossing three avenuesthe milkmen the truckdrivers the workman even the occasional trampwherever they may come from or go to or what their real habitat may beare invariably americans  i give it as an honest record whatever its significance or insignificance may be that during the last year between the hours of six and eight a m in and about the locality i have mentioned i have met with but two unmistakable foreigners an irishman and a german  perhaps it may be necessary to add to this statement that the people i have met at those early hours i have never seen at any other time in the same locality  as to their quality the artisans were always cleanly dressed intelligent and respectful  i remember however one morning when the ice storm of the preceding night had made the sidewalks glistening smiling and impassable to have journeyed down the middle of twelfth street with a mechanic so sooty as to absolutely leave a legible track in the snowy pathway  he was the fireman attending the engine in a noted manufactory and in our brief conversation he told me many facts regarding his profession which i fear interested me more than the afterdinner speeches of some distinguished gentlemen i had heard the preceding night  i remember that he spoke of his engine as she and related certain circumstances regarding her inconsistency her aberrations her pettishnesses that seemed to justify the feminine gender  i have a grateful recollection of him as being one who introduced me to a restaurant where chicory thinly disguised as coffee was served with bread at five cents a cup and that he honorably insisted on being the host and paid his ten cents for our mutual entertainment with the grace of a barmecide  i remember in a more genial seasoni think early summerto have found upon the benches of washington park a gentleman who informed me that his profession was that of a pigeon catcher that he contracted with certain parties in this city to furnish these birds for what he called their pigeonshoots and that in fulfilling this contract he often was obliged to go as far west as minnesota  the details he gavehis methods of entrapping the birds his study of their habits his evident belief that the city pigeon however well provided for by parties who fondly believed the bird to be their own was really ferae naturae and consequently game for the pigeoncatcherwere all so interesting that i listened to him with undisguised delight when he had finished however he said and now sir being a poor man with a large family and work bein rather slack this year if ye could oblige me with the loan of a dollar and your address until remittances what im expecting come in from chicago youll be doin me a great service etc etc he got the dollar of course his information was worth twice the money but i imagine he lost my address  yet it is only fair to say that some days after relating his experience to a prominent sporting man he corroborated all its details and satisfied me that my pigeoncatching friend although unfortunate was not an impostor  and this leads me to speak of the birds  of all early risers my most importunate aggressive and obtrusive companions are the english sparrows  between six and seven a m they seem to possess the avenue and resent my intrusion  i remember one chilly morning when i came upon a flurry of them chattering quarreling skimming and alighting just before me  i stopped at last fearful of stepping on the nearest to my great surprise instead of flying away he contested the ground inch by inch before my advancing foot with his wings outspread and open bill outstretched very much like that ridiculous burlesque of the american eagle which the common canarybird assumes when teased did you ever see em wash in the fountain in the square said roundsman 9999 early one summer morning  i had not  i guess theyre there yet  come and see em he said and complacently accompanied me two blocks  i dont know which was the finer sightthe thirty or forty winged sprites dashing in and out of the basin each the very impersonation of a lighthearted mischievous puck or this grave policeman with badge and club and shield looking on with delight perhaps my visible amusement or the spectacle of a brother policeman just then going past with a couple of drunk and disorderlies recalled his official responsibilities and duties  they say them foreign sparrows drive all the other birds away he added severely and then walked off with a certain reserved manner as if it were not impossible for him to be called upon some morning to take the entire feathered assembly into custody and if so called upon he should do it  next i think in procession among the early risers and surely next in fresh and innocent exterior were the workwomen or shopgirls  i have seen this fine avenue on gala afternoons bright with the beauty and elegance of an opulent city but i have see no more beautiful faces than i have seen among these humbler sisters  as the mere habits of dress in america except to a very acute critic give no suggestion of the rank of the wearer i can imagine an inexperienced foreigner utterly mystified and confounded by these girls who perhaps work a sewingmachine or walk the long floors of a fashionable drygoods shop i remember one face and figure faultless and completemodestly yet most becomingly dressedindeed a figure that comptecalix might have taken for one of his exquisite studies which between seven and eight a m passed through eleventh street between sixth avenue and broadway  so exceptionally fine was her carriage so chaste and virginal her presence and so refined and even spiritual her features that as a literary man i would have been justified in taking her for the heroine of a society novel  indeed i had already woven a little romance about her when one morning she overtook me accompanied by another girlpretty but of a different typewith whom she was earnestly conversing  as the two passed me there fell from her faultless lips the following astounding sentence and i told him if he didnt like it he might lump it and he traveled off on his left ear you bet  heaven knows what indiscretion this speech saved me from but the reader will understand what a sting the pain of rejection might have added to it by the above formula  the morningcocktail men come next in my experience of early rising i used to take my early cup of coffee in the cafe of a certain fashionable restaurant that had a bar attached  i could not help noticing that unlike the usual social libations of my countrymen the act of taking a morning cocktail was a solitary one  in the course of my experience i cannot recall the fact of two men taking an antebreakfast cocktail together  on the contrary i have observed the male animal rush savagely at the bar demand his drink of the barkeeper swallow it and hasten from the scene of his early debauchery or else take it in a languid perfunctory manner which i think must have been insulting to the barkeeper  i have observed two men whom i had seen drinking amicably together the preceding night standing gloomily at the opposite corners of the bar evidently trying not to see each other and making the matter a confidential one with the barkeeper  i have seen even a thin disguise of simplicity assumed  i remember an elderly gentleman of most respectable exterior who used to enter the cafe as if he had strayed there accidentally  after looking around carefully and yet unostentatiously he would walk to the bar and with an air of affected carelessness state that not feeling well this morning he guessed he would takewell he would leave it to the barkeeper  the barkeeper invariably gave him a stiff brandy cocktail  when the old gentleman had done this half a dozen times i think i lost faith in him  i tried afterwards to glean from the barkeeper some facts regarding those experiences but i am proud to say that he was honorably reticent indeed i think it may be said truthfully that there is no record of a barkeeper who has been interviewed  clergymen and doctors have but it is well for the weakness of humanity that the line should be drawn somewhere  and this reminds me that one distressing phase of early rising is the incongruous and unpleasant contact of the preceding night  the social yesterday is not fairly over before nine a m today and there is always a humorous sometimes a pathetic lapping over the edges  i remember one morning at six oclock to have been overtaken by a carriage that drew up beside me  i recognized the coachman who touched his hat apologetically as if he wished me to understand that he was not at all responsible for the condition of his master and i went to the door of the carriage  i was astonished to find two young friends of mine in correct evening dress reclining on each others shoulders and sleeping the sleep of the justly inebriated  i stated this fact to the coachman  not a muscle of his welltrained face answered to my smile  but he said you see sir weve been out all night and more than four blocks below they saw you and wanted me to hail you but you know you stopped to speak to a gentleman and so i sorter lingered and i drove round the block once or twice and i guess ive got em quiet again  i looked in the carriage door once more on these sons of belial  they were sleeping quite unconsciously  a bouttonniere in the lappel of the younger ones coat had shed its leaves which were scattered over him with a ridiculous suggestion of the babes in the wood and i closed the carriage door softly i suppose id better take em home sir queried the coachman gravely well yes john perhaps you had  there is another picture in my early rising experience that i wish was as simply and honestly ludicrous  it was at a time when the moral sentiment of the metropolis expressed through ordinance and special legislation had declared itself against a certain form of variety entertainment and had as usual proceeded against the performers and not the people who encouraged them  i remember one frosty morning to have encountered in washington park my honest friend sergeant x and roundsman 9999 conveying a party of these derelicts to the station one of the women evidently had not had time to change her apparel and had thinly disguised the flowing robe and loose cestus of venus under a ragged waterproof while the other who had doubtless posed for mercury hid her shapely tights in a plaid shawl and changed her winged sandals for a pair of arctics  their rouged faces were streaked and stained with tears  the man who was with them the male of their species had but hastily washed himself of his ethiopian presentment and was still black behind the ears while an exaggerated shirt collar and frilled shirt made his occasional indignant profanity irresistibly ludicrous  so they fared on over the glittering snow against the rosy sunlight of the square the gray front of the university building with a few twittering sparrows in the foreground beside the two policemen quiet and impassive as fate i could not help thinking of the distinguished a the most fashionable b the wealthy and respectable c the sentimental d and the man of the world e who were present at the performance whose distinguished patronage had called it into life and who were then resting quietly in their beds while these haggard servants of their pleasaunce were haled over the snow to punishment and ignominy  let me finish by recalling one brighter picture of that same season it was early so early that the cross of grace church had when i looked up just caught the morning sun and for a moment flamed like a crusaders symbol  and then the grace and glory of that exquisite spire became slowly visible  fret by fret the sunlight stole slowly down quivering and dropping from each until at last the whole church beamed in rosy radiance  up and down the long avenue the street lay in shadow by some strange trick of the atmosphere the sun seemed to have sought out only that graceful structure for its blessing  and then there was a dull rumble  it was the first omnibusthe first throb in the great artery of the reviving city  i looked up  the church was again in shadow    with the entrees  once when i was a pirate  the speaker was an elderly gentleman in correct evening dress the room a tasteful one the company of infinite respectability the locality at once fashionable and exclusive the occasion an unexceptionable dinner to this should be added that the speaker was also the host  with these conditions selfevident all that good breeding could do was to receive the statement with a vague smile that might pass for goodhumored incredulity or courteous acceptation of a simple fact indeed i think we all rather tried to convey the impression that our host when he was a pirateif he ever really was onewas all that a selfrespecting pirate should be and never violated the canons of good society  this idea was to some extent crystallized by the youngest miss jones in the exclamation oh how nice  it was of course many years ago when i was quite a lad  we all murmured certainly as if piracy were a natural expression of the exuberance of youth  i ought perhaps explain the circumstances that led me into this way of life  here legrande a courteous attache of the patagonian legation interposed in french and an excess of politeness that it was not of a necessity a statement to which his english neighbor hurriedly responded oui oui  there ess a boke he continued in a wellbred rapid whisper from captain canota frenchmanmost eenterestinghe wasoh a fine man of educationand what you call a slavair but here he was quietly nudged into respectful silence  i ran away from home continued our host  he paused and then added appealingly to the two distinguished foreigners present i do not know if i can make you understand that this is a peculiarly american predilection  the exodus of the younger males of an american family against the parents wishes does not with us necessarily carry any obloquy with it  to the average american the prospect of fortune and a better condition lies outside of his home with you the home means the estate the succession of honors or titles the surety that the conditions of life shall all be kept intact  with us the children who do not expect and generally succeed in improving the fortunes of the house are marked exceptions  do i make myself clear  the frenchpatagonian attache thought it was charming and progressif the baron von pretzel thought he had noticed a movement of that kind in germany which was expressed in a single word of seventeen syllables viscount piccadilly said to his neighbor that you know now the younger sons dont you see go to australia you know in some beastly tradestockraising or sheepyou know but by jove them fellahs  my father always treated me well continued our host  i shared equally with my brothers the privileges and limitations of our new england home  nevertheless i ran away and went to sea  to seewhat asked legrande  aller sur mer said his neighbor hastily  go on with your piracy said miss jones  the distinguished foreigners looked at each other and then at miss jones  each made a mental note of the average coldblooded ferocity of the young american female  i shipped on board of a liverpool liner continued our host  what ess a liner interrupted legrande sotto voce to his next neighbor who pretended not to hear him  i need not say that these were the days when we had not lost our carrying trade when american bottoms  que est ce bot toom said legrande imploringly to his other friend  when american bottoms still carried the bulk of freight and the supremacy of our flag  here legrande recognized a patriotic sentiment and responded to it with wild republican enthusiasm nodding his head violently piccadilly noticed it too and seeing an opening for some general discussion on free trade began half audibly to his neighbor most extraordinary thing you know your american statesmen  i deserted the ship at liverpool  but here two perfunctory listeners suddenly turned toward the other end of the table where another guest our nevada bonanza lion was evidently in the full flood of pioneer anecdote and narration calmly disregarding the defection he went on  i deserted the ship at liverpool in consequence of my illtreatment by the second matea man selected for his position by reason of his superior physical strength and recognized brutality i have been since told that he graduated from the state prison  on the second day out i saw him strike a man senseless with a belaying pin for some trifling breach of discipline  i saw him repeatedly beat and kick sick men  did you ever read danas two years before the mast asked lightbody our heavy literary man turning to his neighbor in a distinctly audible whisper  ah theres a book  got all this sort of thing in it  devlishly well written too  the patagonian alive for information what ess this dana eh  his left hand neighbor shortly oh that man  his right hand neighbor curtly the fellah who wrote the encyclopaedia and edits the sun that was put up in boston for the english mission and didnt get it  the patagonian making a mental diplomatic note of the fact that the severe discipline of the editor of the sun one of americas profoundest scholars while acting from patriotic motives as the second mate of an american bottom had unfitted him for diplomatic service abroad ah ciel  i wandered on the quays for a day or two until i was picked up by a portuguese sailor who interesting himself in my story offered to procure me a passage to fayal and lisbon where he assured me i could find more comfortable and profitable means of returning to my own land let me say here that this man although i knew him afterward as one of the most unscrupulous and heartless of piratesin fact the typical buccaneer of the bookswas to me always kind considerate and at times even tender  he was a capital seaman  i give this evidence in favor of a much ridiculed race who have been able seamen for centuries  did you ever read that portuguese guidebook asked lightbody of his neighbor its the most exquisitely ridiculous thing  will the great american pirate kindly go on or resume his original functions said miss jones over the table with a significant look in the direction of lightbody  but her anxiety was instantly misinterpreted by the polite and fairplay loving englishman i say now dont you know that the fact is these portuguese fellahs are always ahead of us in the discovery business  why you know  i shipped with him on a brig ostensibly bound to st kitts and a market  we had scarcely left port before i discovered the true character of the vessel  i will not terrify you with useless details enough that all that tradition and romance has given you of the pirates life was ours  happily through the kindness of my portuguese friend i was kept from being an active participant in scenes of which i was an unwilling witness  but i must always bear my testimony to one fact  our discipline our esprit de corps if i may so term it was perfect  no benevolent society no moral organization was ever so personally selfsacrificing so honestly loyal to one virtuous purpose as we were to our one vice  the individual was always merged in the purpose  when our captain blew out the brains of our quartermaster one day  that reminds medid you read of that georgia murder began lightbody it was in all the papers i think  oh i beg pardon  for simply interrupting him in a conversation with our second officer continued our host quietly  the act although harsh and perhaps unnecessarily final was i think indorsed by the crew james pass the champagne to mr lightbody  he paused a moment for the usual casual interruption but even the active legrande was silent  alas from the other end of the table came the voice of the bonanza man  the rope was around her neck  well gentlemen that mexican woman standing there with that crowd around her eager for her blood dern my skin if she didnt call out to the sheriff to hold on a minit  and what fer  ye cant guess  why one of them long braids she wore was under the noose and kinder in the way  i remember her raising her hand to her neck and givin a spiteful sort of jerk to the braid that fetched it outside the slipknot and then saying to the sheriff there dn ye go on  there was a sort o thoughtfulness in the act a kind o keerless easy way that jist fetched the boyseven them thet hed the rope in their hands and they suddenly recognizing the silence oh beg pardon old man didnt know id chipped into your yarnheave ahead dont mind me  what i am trying to tell you is this  one night in the caribbean sea we ran into one of the leeward islands that had been in olden time a rendezvous for our ship  we were piloted to our anchorage outside by my portuguese friend who knew the locality thoroughly and on whose dexterity and skill we placed the greatest reliance if anything more had been necessary to fix this circumstance in my mind it would have been the fact that two or three days before he had assured me that i should presently have the means of honorable discharge from the pirates crew and a return to my native land a launch was sent from the ship to communicate with our friends on the island who supplied us with stores provisions and general information  the launch was manned by eight men and officered by the first matea grim puritanical practical new englander if i may use such a term to describe a pirate of great courage experience and physical strength  my portuguese friend acting as pilot prevailed upon them to allow me to accompany the party as coxswain  i was naturally anxious you can readily comprehend to see  certainly of course why shouldnt you went round the table  two trustworthy men were sent ashore with instructions  we meanwhile lay off the low palmfringed beach our crew lying on their oars or giving way just enough to keep the boats head to the breakers  the mate and myself sat in the stern sheets looking shoreward for the signal  the night was intensely black  perhaps for this reason never before had i seen the phosphorescence of a tropical sea so strongly marked  from the great open beyond luminous crests and plumes of pale fire lifted themselves ghostlike at our bows sank swept by us with long shimmering undulating trails broke on the beach in silvery crescents or shattered their brightness on the black rocks of the promontory the whole vast sea shone and twinkled like another firmament against which the figures of our men sitting with their faces toward us were outlined darkly  the grim set features of our first mate sitting beside me were faintly illuminated  there was no sound but the whisper of passing waves against our lapstreak and the low murmuring conversation of the men i had my face toward the shore  as i looked over the glimmering expanse i suddenly heard the whispered name of our first mate  as suddenly by the phosphorescent light that surrounded it i saw the long trailing hair and gleaming shoulders of a woman floating beside us legrande you are positively drinking nothing  lightbody you are shirking the burgundyyou used to like it  he paused but no one spoke  ilet me see where was i  oh yes  well i saw the woman and when i turned to call the attention of the first mate to this fact i knew instantly by some strange instinct that he had seen and heard her too  so from that moment to the conclusion of our little drama we were silent but enforced spectators  she swam gracefullysilently  i remember noticing through that odd halfweird phosphorescent light which broke over her shoulders as she rose and fell with each quiet stroke of her splendidly rounded arms that she was a mature perfectlyformed woman  i remember also that when she reached the boat and supporting herself with one small hand on the gunwale she softly called the mate in a whisper by his christian name i had a boyish idea that she wastheererfemale of his specieshisernatural wife  im boring youam i not  two or three heads shook violently and negatively  the youngest and i regret to say the oldest miss jones uttered together sympathetically go onplease do  thewoman told him in a few rapid words that he had been betrayed that the two men sent ashore were now in the hands of the authorities that a force was being organized to capture the vessel that instant flight was necessary and that the betrayer and traitor wasmy friend the portuguese fernandez  the mate raised the dripping little brown hand to his lips and whispered some undistinguishable words in her ear  i remember seeing her turn a look of ineffable love and happiness upon his grim set face and then she was gone  she dove as a duck dives and i saw her shapely head after a moments suspense reappear a cables length away toward the shore  i ventured to raise my eyes to the mates face it was cold and impassive  i turned my face toward the crew they were conversing in whispers with each other with their faces toward us yet apparently utterly oblivious of the scene that had just taken place in the stern there was a moment of silence and then the mates voice came out quite impassively but distinctly  fernandez  aye aye sir  come aft andbring your oar with you  he did so stumbling over the men who engaged in their whispered yarns didnt seem to notice him  see if you can find soundings here  fernandez leaned over the stern and dropped his oar to its shaft in the phosphorescent water  but he touched no bottom the current brought the oar at right angles presently to the surface  send it down man said the mate imperatively down down reach over there  what are you afraid of  so steady there ill hold you  fernandez leaned over the stern and sent the oar and half of his bared brown arm into the water  in an instant the mate caught him with one tremendous potential grip at his elbows and forced him and his oar head downward in the waters  the act was so sudden yet so carefully premeditated that no outcry escaped the doomed man  even the launch scarcely dipped her stern to the act  in that awful moment i heard a light laugh from one of the men in response to a wanton yarn from his comradejames bring the vichy to mr lightbody  youll find that a dash of cognac will improve it wonderfully  wellto go ona few bubbles arose to the surface  fernandez seemed unreasonably passive until i saw that when the mate had gripped his elbows with his hands he had also firmly locked the traitors knees within his own  in a few momentsit seemed to me then a centurythe mates grasp relaxed the body of fernandez a mere limp leaden mass slipped noiselessly and heavily into the sea  there was no splash  the ocean took it calmly and quietly to its depths  the mate turned to the men without deigning to cast a glance on me  oars  the men raised their oars apeak  let fall  there was a splash in the water encircling the boat in concentric lines of molten silver  give way  well of course thats all  we got away in time  i knew i bored you awfully  eh  oh you want to know what became of the womanreally i dont know  and myselfoh i got away at havana  eh certainly james youll find some smelling salts in my bureau gentlemen i fear we have kept the ladies too long  but they had already risen and were slowly filing out of the room only one lingeredthe youngest miss jones  that was a capital story she said pausing beside our host with a special significance in her usual audacity  do you know you absolutely sent cold chills down my spine a moment ago  really now you ought to write for the magazines  our host looked up at the pretty audacious face  then he said sotto voce  i do
