told by the agent we class schools in four gradesleading school firstrate school good school and school sedleigh in mike and psmith would i suppose come into the lastnamed class though not quite as low in it as mr waughs llanabba it is one of those small english schools with aspirations one day to be able to put the word public before their name and to have their headmaster qualified to attend the annual headmasters conference all it needs is a few more adairs to get things going and there is this to be noted that even at a school one gets an excellent education its only drawback is that it does not play the leading schools or the firstrate schools or even the good schools at cricket but to mike fresh from wrykyn a firstrate school and psmith coming from eton a leading school sedleigh naturally seemed something of a comedown it took mike some time to adjust himself to it though psmith the philosopher accepted the change of conditions with his customary equanimity  this was the first appearance of psmith he came into two other books psmith in the city and psmith journalist before becoming happily married in leave it to psmith but i have always thought that he was most at home in this story of english school life to give full play to his bland clashings with authority he needs to have authority to clash with and there is none more absolute than that of the masters at an english school  psmith has the distinction of being the only one of my numerous characters to be drawn from a living model a cousin of mine was at eton with the son of doyly carte the man who produced the gilbert and sullivan operettas and one night he told me about this peculiar schoolboy who dressed fastidiously and wore a monocle and who when one of the masters inquired after his health replied sir i grow thinnah and thinnah it was all the information i required in order to start building him in a star part  if anyone is curious as to what became of mike and psmith in later life i can supply the facts mike always devoted to country life ran a prosperous farm psmith inevitably perhaps became an equally prosperous counselor at the bar like perry mason specializing like perry in appearing for the defense  i must apologize as i did in the preface to mike at wrykyn for all the cricket in this book it was unavoidable there is however not quite so much of it this time  pg wodehouse    1  mr jackson makes up his mind   if mike had been in time for breakfast that fatal easter morning he might have gathered from the expression on his fathers face as mr jackson opened the envelope containing his school report and read the contents that the document in question was not exactly a paean of praise from beginning to end but he was late as usual mike always was late for breakfast in the holidays  when he came down on this particular morning the meal was nearly over mr jackson had disappeared taking his correspondence with him mrs jackson had gone into the kitchen and when mike appeared the thing had resolved itself into a mere vulgar brawl between phyllis and ella for the jam while marjory recently affecting a grownup air looked on in a detached sort of way as if these juvenile gambols distressed her  hello mike she said jumping up as he entered here you areive been keeping everything hot for you  have you thanks awfully i say  his eye wandered in mild surprise round the table im a bit late  marjory was bustling about fetching and carrying for mike as she always did she had adopted him at an early age and did the thing thoroughly she was fond of her other brothers especially when they made centuries in firstclass cricket but mike was her favorite she would field out in the deep as a natural thing when mike was batting at the net in the paddock though for the others even for joe who had played in all five test matches in the previous summer she would do it only as a favor  phyllis and ella finished their dispute and went out marjory sat on the table and watched mike eat  your report came this morning mike she said  the kidneys failed to retain mikes undivided attention he looked up interested what did it say  i didnt seei only caught sight of the wrykyn crest on the envelope father didnt say anything  mike seemed concerned i say that looks rather rotten i wonder if it was awfully bad its the first ive had from appleby  it cant be any worse than the horrid ones mr blake used to write when you were in his form  no thats a comfort said mike philosophically think theres any more tea in that pot  i call it a shame said marjory they ought to be jolly glad to have you at wrykyn just for cricket instead of writing beastly reports that make father angry and dont do any good to anybody  last christmas he said hed take me away if i got another one  he didnt mean it really i know he didnt he couldnt youre the best bat wrykyns ever had  what ho interpolated mike  you are everybody says you are why you got your first the very first term you were thereeven joe didnt do anything nearly so good as that saunders says youre simply bound to play for england in another year or two  saunders is a jolly good chap he bowled me a half volley on the off the first ball i had in a school match by the way i wonder if hes out at the net now lets go and see  saunders the professional was setting up the net when they arrived mike put on his pads and went to the wicket while marjory and the dogs retired as usual to the far hedge to retrieve  she was kept busy saunders was a good sound bowler of the mcc minor match type and there had been a time when he had worried mike considerably but mike had been in the wrykyn team for three seasons now and each season he had advanced tremendously in his batting he had filled out in three years he had always had the style and now he had the strength as well saunders bowling on a true wicket seemed simple to him it was early in the easter holidays but already he was beginning to find his form saunders who looked on mike as his own special invention was delighted  if you dont be worried by being too anxious now that youre captain master mike he said youll make a century every match next term  i wish i wasnt its a beastly responsibility  henfrey the wrykyn cricket captain of the previous season was not returning next term and mike was to reign in his stead he liked the prospect but it certainly carried with it a rather aweinspiring responsibility at night sometimes he would lie awake appalled by the fear of losing his form or making a hash of things by choosing the wrong men to play for the school and leaving the right men out it is no light thing to captain a public school at cricket  as he was walking toward the house phyllis met him oh ive been hunting for you mike father wants you  what for  i dont know  where  hes in the study he seems  added phyllis throwing in the information by a way of a makeweight in a beastly temper  mikes jaw fell slightly i hope the dickens its nothing to do with that bally report was his muttered exclamation  mikes dealings with his father were as a rule of a most pleasant nature mr jackson was an understanding sort of man who treated his sons as companions from time to time however breezes were apt to ruffle the placid sea of good fellowship mikes endofterm report was an unfailing wind raiser indeed on the arrival of mr blakes sarcastic resume of mikes shortcomings at the end of the previous term there had been something not unlike a typhoon it was on this occasion that mr jackson had solemnly declared his intention of removing mike from wrykyn unless the critics became more flattering and mr jackson was a man of his word  it was with a certain amount of apprehension therefore that jackson entered the study  come in mike said his father kicking the wastepaper basket i want to speak to you  mike skilled in omens scented a row in the offing only in moments of emotion was mr jackson in the habit of booting the basket  there followed an awkward silence which mike broke by remarking that he had carted a half volley from saunders over the onside hedge that morning  it was just a bit short and off the leg stump so i stepped outmay i bag the paper knife for a jiffy ill just show  never mind about cricket now said mr jackson i want you to listen to this report  oh is that my report father said mike with a sort of sickly interest much as a dog about to be washed might evince in his tub  it is replied mr jackson in measured tones your report what is more it is without exception the worst report you have ever had  oh i say groaned the recordbreaker  his conduct quoted mr jackson has been unsatisfactory in the extreme both in and out of school  it wasnt anything really i only happened  remembering suddenly that what he had happened to do was to drop a cannonball the school weight on the formroom floor not once but on several occasions he paused  french bad conduct disgraceful  everybody rags in french  mathematics bad inattentive and idle  nobody does much work in math  latin poor greek very poor  we were doing thucydides book two last termall speeches and doubtful readings and cruxes and thingsbeastly hard everybody says so  here are mr applebys remarks the boy has genuine ability which he declines to use in the smallest degree  mike moaned a moan of righteous indignation  an abnormal proficiency at games has apparently destroyed all desire in him to realize the more serious issues of life there is more to the same effect  mr appleby was a master with very definite ideas as to what constituted a publicschool masters duties as a man he was distinctly promike he understood cricket and some of mikes strokes on the off gave him thrills of pure aesthetic joy but as a master he always made it his habit to regard the manners and customs of the boys in his form with an unbiased eye and to an unbiased eye mike in a form room was about as near the extreme edge as a boy could be and mr appleby said as much in a clear firm hand  you remember what i said to you about your report at christmas mike said mr jackson folding the lethal document and replacing it in its envelope  mike said nothing there was a sinking feeling in his interior  i shall abide by what i said  mikes heart thumped  you will not go back to wrykyn next term  somewhere in the world the sun was shining birds were twittering somewhere in the world lambkins frisked and peasants sang blithely at their toil flat perhaps but still blithely but to mike at that moment the sky was black and an icy wind blew over the face of the earth  the tragedy had happened and there was an end of it he made no attempt to appeal against the sentence he knew it would be useless his father when he made up his mind having all the unbending tenacity of the normally easygoing man  mr jackson was sorry for mike he understood him and for that reason he said very little now  i am sending you to sedleigh was his next remark  sedleigh mike sat up with a jerk he knew sedleigh by nameone of those schools with about a hundred boys which you never hear of except when they send up their gym team to aldershot or their eight to bisley mikes outlook on life was that of a cricketer pure and simple what had sedleigh ever done what were they ever likely to do whom did they play what old sedleighan had ever done anything at cricket perhaps they didnt even play cricket  but its an awful hole he said blankly  mr jackson could read mikes mind like a book mikes point of view was plain to him he did not approve of it but he knew that in mikes place and at mikes age he would have felt the same he spoke dryly to hide his sympathy  it is not a large school he said and i dont suppose it could play wrykyn at cricket but it has one meritboys work there young barlitt won a balliol scholarship from sedleigh last year barlitt was the vicars son a silent spectacled youth who did not enter very largely into mikes world they had met occasionally at tennis parties but not much conversation had ensued barlitts mind was massive but his topics of conversation were not mikes  mr barlitt speaks very highly of sedleigh added mr jackson  mike said nothing which was a good deal better than saying what he would have liked to have said    2  sedleigh   the train which had been stopping everywhere for the last half hour pulled up again and mike seeing the name of the station got up opened the door and hurled a bag out on to the platform in an emphatic and vindictive manner then he got out himself and looked about him  for the school sir inquired the solitary porter bustling up as if he hoped by sheer energy to deceive the traveler into thinking that sedleigh station was staffed by a great army of porters  mike nodded a somber nod the nod napoleon might have given if somebody had met him in 1812 and said so youre back from moscow eh mike was feeling thoroughly jaundiced the future seemed wholly gloomy and so far from attempting to make the best of things he had set himself deliberately to look on the dark side he thought for instance that he had never seen a more repulsive porter or one more obviously incompetent than the man who had attached himself with a firm grasp to the handle of the bag as he strode off in the direction of the luggage van he disliked his voice his appearance and the color of his hair also the boots he wore he hated the station and the man who took his ticket  young gents at the school sir said the porter perceiving from mikes distrait air that the boy was a stranger to the place goes up in the bus mostly its waiting here sir hi george  ill walk thanks said mike frigidly  its a goodish step sir  here you are  thank you sir ill send up your luggage by the bus sir which ouse was it you was going to  outwoods  right sir its straight on up this road to the school you cant miss it sir  worse luck said mike  he walked off up the road sorrier for himself than ever it was such absolutely rotten luck about now instead of being on his way to a place where they probably ran a halma team instead of a cricket eleven and played hunttheslipper in winter he would be on the point of arriving at wrykyn and as captain of cricket at that which was the bitter part of it he had never been in command for the last two seasons he had been the star man going in first and heading the averages easily at the end of the season and the three captains under whom he had played during his career as a wrykynian burgess enderby and henfrey had always been sportsmen to him but it was not the same thing he had meant to do such a lot for wrykyn cricket this term he had had an entirely new system of coaching in his mind now it might never be used he had handed it on in a letter to strachan who would be captain in his place but probably strachan would have some scheme of his own there is nobody who could not edit a paper in the ideal way and there is nobody who has not a theory of his own about cricket coaching at school  wrykyn too would be weak this year now that he was no longer there strachan was a good free bat on his day and if he survived a few overs might make a century in an hour but he was not to be depended upon there was no doubt that mikes sudden withdrawal meant that wrykyn would have a bad time that season and it had been such a wretched athletic year for the school the football fifteen had been hopeless and had lost both the ripton matches the return by over sixty points sheens victory in the light weights at aldershot had been their one success and now on top of all this the captain of cricket was removed during the easter holidays mikes heart bled for wrykyn and he found himself loathing sedleigh and all its works with a great loathing  the only thing he could find in its favor was the fact that it was set in a very pretty country of a different type from the wrykyn country but almost as good for three miles mike made his way through woods and past fields once he crossed a river it was soon after this that he caught sight from the top of a hill of a group of buildings that wore an unmistakably schoollike look  this must be sedleigh  ten minutes walk brought him to the school gates and a bakers boy directed him to mr outwoods  there were three houses in a row separated from the school buildings by a cricket field outwoods was the middle one of these  mike went to the front door and knocked at wrykyn he had always charged in at the beginning of term at the boys entrance but this formal reporting of himself at sedleigh suited his mood  he inquired for mr outwood and was shown into a room lined with books presently the door opened and the housemaster appeared  there was something pleasant and homely about mr outwood in appearance he reminded mike of smee in peter pan he had the same eyebrows and pincenez and the same motherly look  jackson he said mildly  yes sir  i am very glad to see you very glad indeed perhaps you would like a cup of tea after your journey i think you might like a cup of tea you come from crofton in shropshire i understand jackson near brindleford it is a part of the country which i have always wished to visit i dare say you have frequently seen the cluniac priory of st ambrose at brindleford  mike who would not have recognized a cluniac priory if you had handed him one on a tray said he had not  dear me you have missed an opportunity which i should have been glad to have i am preparing a book on ruined abbeys and priories of england and it has always been my wish to see the cluniac priory of st ambrose a deeply interesting relic of the sixteenth century bishop geoffrey 113340  shall i go across to the boys part sir  what yes oh yes quite so and perhaps you would like a cup of tea after your journey no quite so quite so you should make a point of visiting the remains of the cluniac priory in the summer holidays jackson you will find the matron in her room in many respects it is unique the northern altar is in a state of really wonderful preservation it consists of a solid block of masonry five feet long and two and a half wide with chamfered plinth standing quite free from the apse wall it will well repay a visit goodbye for the present jackson goodbye  mike wandered across to the other side of the house his gloom visibly deepened all alone in a strange school where they probably played hopscotch with a housemaster who offered one cups of tea after ones journey and talked about chamfered plinths and apses it was a little hard  he strayed about finding his bearings and finally came to a room which he took to be the equivalent of the senior day room at a wrykyn house everywhere else he had found nothing but emptiness evidently he had come by an earlier train than was usual but this room was occupied  a very long thin youth with a solemn face and immaculate clothes was leaning against the mantelpiece as mike entered he fumbled in his top left waistcoat pocket produced an eyeglass attached to a cord and fixed it in his right eye with the help of this aid to vision he inspected mike in silence for a while then having flicked an invisible speck of dust from the left sleeve of his coat he spoke  hello he said  he spoke in a tired voice  hello said mike  take a seat said the immaculate one if you dont mind dirtying your bags thats to say personally i dont see any prospect of ever sitting down in this place it looks to me as if they meant to use these chairs as mustardandcress beds a nursery garden in the home that sort of idea my name he added pensively is smith whats yours    3  psmith   jackson said mike  are you the bully the pride of the school or the boy who is led astray and takes to drink in chapter sixteen  the last for choice said mike but ive only just arrived so i dont know  the boywhat will he become are you new here too then  yes why are you new  do i look as if i belonged here im the latest import sit down on yonder settee and i will tell you the painful story of my life by the way before i start theres just one thing if you ever have occasion to write to me would you mind sticking a p at the beginning of my name psmith see there are too many smiths and i dont care for smythe my fathers content to worry along in the oldfashioned way but ive decided to strike out a fresh line i shall found a new dynasty the resolve came to me unexpectedly this morning i jotted it down on the back of an envelope in conversation you may address me as rupert though i hope you wont or simply smith the p not being sounded compare the name zbysco in which the z is given a similar missinbalk see  mike said he saw psmith thanked him with a certain stately old world courtesy  let us start at the beginning he resumed my infancy when i was but a babe my eldest sister was bribed with a shilling an hour by my nurse to keep an eye on me and see that i did not raise cain at the end of the first day she struck for oneandsix and got it we now pass to my boyhood at an early age i was sent to eton everybody predicting a bright career for me but said psmith solemnly fixing an owllike gaze on mike through the eyeglass it was not to be  no said mike  no i was superannuated last term  bad luck  for eton yes but what eton loses sedleigh gains  but why sedleigh of all places  this is the most painful part of my narrative it seems that a certain scug in the next village to ours happened last year to collar a balliol  not barlitt exclaimed mike  that was the man the son of the vicar the vicar told the curate who told our curate who told our vicar who told my father who sent me off here to get a balliol too do you know barlitt  his fathers vicar of our village it was because his son got a balliol that i was sent here  do you come from crofton  yes  ive lived at lower benford all my life we are practically longlost brothers cheer a little will you  mike felt as robinson crusoe felt when he met friday here was a fellow human being in this desert place he could almost have embraced psmith the very sound of the name lower benford was heartening his dislike for his new school was not diminished but now he felt that life there might at least be tolerable  where were you before you came here asked psmith you have heard my painful story now tell me yours  wrykyn my father took me away because i got such a lot of bad reports  my reports from eton were simply scurrilous theres a libel action in every sentence how do you like this place from what youve seen of it  rotten  i am with you comrade jackson you wont mind my calling you comrade will you ive just become a socialist its a great scheme you ought to be one you work for the equal distribution of property and start by collaring all you can and sitting on it we must stick together we are companions in misfortune lost lambs sheep that have gone astray divided we fall together we may worry through have you seen professor radium yet i should say mr outwood what do you think of him  he doesnt seem a bad sort of chap bit off his nut jawed about apses and things  and thereby said psmith hangs a tale ive been making inquiries of a stout sportsman in a sort of salvation army uniform whom i met in the groundshes the school sergeant or something quite a solid manand i hear that comrade outwoods an archaeological cove goes about the country beating up old ruins and fossils and things theres an archaeological society in the school run by him it goes out on halfholidays prowling about and is allowed to break bounds and generally steep itself to the eyebrows in reckless devilry and mark you laddie if you belong to the archaeological society you get off cricket to get off cricket said psmith dusting his right trouser leg was the dream of my youth and the aspiration of my riper years a noble game but a bit too thick for me at eton i used to have to field out at the nets till the soles of my boots wore through i suppose you are a blood at the game play for the school against loamshire and so on  im not going to play here at any rate said mike  he had made up his mind on this point in the train there is a certain fascination about making the very worst of a bad job achilles knew his business when he sat in his tent the determination not to play cricket for sedleigh as he could not play for wrykyn gave mike a sort of pleasure to stand by with folded arms and a somber frown as it were was one way of treating the situation and one not without its meed of comfort  psmith approved the resolve  stout fellow he said tis well you and i hand in hand will search the countryside for ruined abbeys we will snare the elusive fossil together above all we will go out of bounds we shall thus improve our minds and have a jolly good time as well i shouldnt wonder if one mightnt borrow a gun from some friendly native and do a bit of rabbit shooting here and there from what i saw of comrade outwood during our brief interview i shouldnt think he was one of the lynxeyed contingent with tact we ought to be able to slip away from the merry throng of fossil chasers and do a bit on our own account  good idea said mike we will a chap at wrykyn called wyatt used to break out at night and shoot at cats with an air pistol  it would take a lot to make me do that i am all against anything that interferes with my sleep but rabbits in the daytime is a scheme well nose about for a gun at the earliest opp meanwhile wed better go up to comrade outwood and get our names shoved down for the society  i vote we get some tea first somewhere  then lets beat up a study i suppose they have studies here lets go and look  they went upstairs on the first floor there was a passage with doors on either side psmith opened the first of these  thisll do us well he said  it was a biggish room looking out over the school grounds there were a couple of deal tables two empty bookcases and a looking glass hung on a nail  might have been made for us said psmith approvingly  i suppose it belongs to some rotter  not now  you arent going to collar it  that said psmith looking at himself earnestly in the mirror and straightening his tie is the exact program we must stake out our claims this is practical socialism  but the real owners bound to turn up some time or other  his misfortune not ours you cant expect two masterminds like us to pig it in that room downstairs there are moments when one wants to be alone it is imperative that we have a place to retire to after a fatiguing day and now if you want to be really useful come and help me fetch up my box from downstairs its got a gas ring and various things in it    4  staking out a claim   psmith in the matter of decorating a study and preparing tea in it was rather a critic than an executant he was full of ideas but he preferred to allow mike to carry them out it was he who suggested that the wooden bar which ran across the window was unnecessary but it was mike who wrenched it from its place similarly it was mike who abstracted the key from the door of the next study though the idea was psmiths  privacy said psmith as he watched mike light the gas ring is what we chiefly need in this age of publicity if you leave a study door unlocked in these strenuous times the first thing you know is somebody comes right in sits down and begins to talk about himself i think with a little care we ought to be able to make this room quite decently comfortable that putrid calendar must come down though do you think you could make a long arm and haul it off the parent tintack thanks we make progress we make progress  we shall jolly well make it out of the window said mike spooning up tea from a paperbag with a postcard if a sort of young hackenschmidt turns up and claims the study what are you going to do about it  dont let us worry about it i have a presentiment that he will be an insignificantlooking little weed how are you getting on with the evening meal  just ready what would you give to be at eton now id give something to be at wrykyn  these school reports said psmith sympathetically are the very dickens many a bright young lad has been soured by them hello whats this i wonder  a heavy body had plunged against the door evidently without a suspicion that there would be any resistance a rattling of the handle followed and a voice outside said dash the door  hackenschmidt said mike  the weed said psmith you couldnt make a long arm could you and turn the key we had better give this merchant audience remind me later to go on with my remarks on school reports i had several bright things to say on the subject  mike unlocked the door and flung it open framed in the entrance was a smallish freckled boy wearing a porkpie hat and carrying a bag on his face was an expression of mingled wrath and astonishment  psmith rose courteously from his chair and moved forward with slow stateliness to do the honors  what the dickens inquired the newcomer are you doing here  we were having a little tea said psmith to restore our tissues after our journey come in and join us we keep open house we psmiths let me introduce you to comrade jackson a stout fellow homely in appearance perhaps but one of us i am psmith your own name will doubtless come up in the course of general chitchat over the teacups  my names spiller and this is my study  psmith leaned against the mantelpiece put up his eyeglass and harangued spiller in a philosophical vein  of all sad words of tongue or pen said he the saddest are these it might have been too late that is the bitter cry if you had torn yourself from the bosom of the spiller family by an earlier train all might have been well but no your father held your hand and said huskily edwin dont leave us your mother clung to you weeping and said edwin stay your sisters  i want to know what  your sisters froze on to your knees like little octopuses or octopi and screamed dont go edwin and so said psmith deeply affected by his recital you stayed on till the later train and on arrival you find strange faces in the familiar room a people that know not spiller psmith went to the table and cheered himself with a sip of tea spillers sad case had moved him greatly  the victim of fate seemed in no way consoled  its beastly cheek thats what i call it are you new chaps  the very latest thing said psmith  well its beastly cheek  mikes outlook on life was of the solid practical order he went straight to the root of the matter  what are you going to do about it he asked  spiller evaded the question  its beastly cheek he repeated you cant go about the place bagging studies  but we do said psmith in this life comrade spiller we must be prepared for every emergency we must distinguish between the unusual and the impossible it is unusual for people to go about the place bagging studies so you have rashly ordered your life on the assumption that it is impossible error ah spiller spiller let this be a lesson to you  look here i tell you what it  i was in a car with a man once i said to him what would happen if you trod on that pedal thing instead of that other pedal thing he said i couldnt ones the foot brake and the others the accelerator but suppose you did i said i wouldnt he said now well let her rip so he stamped on the accelerator only it turned out to be the foot brake after all and we stopped dead and skidded into a ditch the advice i give to every young man starting life is never confuse the unusual and the impossible take the present case if you had only realized the possibility of somebody someday collaring your study you might have thought out dozens of sound schemes for dealing with the matter as it is you are unprepared the thing comes on you as a surprise the cry goes round spiller has been taken unawares he cannot cope with the situation  cant i ill  what are you going to do about it said mike  all i know is im going to have it it was simpsons last term and simpsons left and im next on the house list so of course its my study  but what steps said psmith are you going to take spiller the man of logic we know but what of spiller the man of action how do you intend to set about it force is useless i was saying to comrade jackson before you came in that i didnt mind betting you were an insignificantlooking little weed and you are an insignificantlooking little weed  well see what outwood says about it  not an unsound scheme by no means a scaly project comrade jackson and myself were about to interview him upon another point we may as well all go together  the trio made their way to the presence spiller pink and determined mike sullen psmith particularly debonair he hummed lightly as he walked and now and then pointed out to spiller objects of interest by the wayside  mr outwood received them with the motherly warmth which was evidently the leading characteristic of his normal manner  ah spiller he said and smith and jackson i am glad to see you have already made friends  spillers sir said psmith laying a hand patronizingly on the studyclaimers shouldera proceeding violently resented by spilleris a character one cannot help but respect his nature expands before one like some beautiful flower  mr outwood received this eulogy with rather a startled expression and gazed at the object of the tribute in a surprised way  erquite so smith quite so he said at last i like to see boys in my house friendly toward one another  there is no vice in spiller pursued psmith earnestly his heart is the heart of a little child  please sir burst out this paragon of all the virtues i  but it was not entirely with regard to spiller that i wished to speak to you sir if you were not too busy  not at all smith not at all is there anything   please sir began spiller  i understand sir said psmith that there is an archaeological society in the school  mr outwoods eyes sparkled behind their pincenez it was a disappointment to him that so few boys seemed to wish to belong to his chosen band cricket and football games that left him cold appeared to be the main interest in their lives it was but rarely that he could induce new boys to join his colleague mr downing who presided over the school fire brigade never had any difficulty in finding support boys came readily at his call mr outwood pondered wistfully on this at times not knowing that the fire brigade owed its support to the fact that it provided its lighthearted members with perfectly unparalleled opportunities for ragging while his own band though small was in the main earnest  yes smith he said yes we have a small archaeological society ierin a measure look after it perhaps you would care to become a member  please sir said spiller  one moment spiller do you want to join smith  intensely sir archaeology fascinates me a grand pursuit sir  undoubtedly smith i am very pleased very pleased indeed i will put down your name at once  and jacksons sir  jackson too mr outwood beamed i am delighted most delighted this is capital this enthusiasm is most capital  spiller sir said psmith sadly i have been unable to induce to join  oh he is one of our oldest members  ah said psmith tolerantly that accounts for it  please sir said spiller  one moment spiller we shall have the first outing of the term on saturday we intend to inspect the roman camp at embury hill two miles from the school  we shall be there sir  capital  please sir said spiller  one moment spiller said psmith there is just one other matter if you could spare the time sir  certainly smith what is that  would there be any objection to jackson and myself taking simpsons old study  by all means smith a very good idea  yes sir it would give us a place where we could work quietly in the evenings  quite so quite so  thank you very much sir we will move our things in  thank you very much sir said mike  please sir shouted spiller arent i to have it im next on the list sir i come next after simpson cant i have it  im afraid i have already promised it to smith spiller you should have spoken before  but sir  psmith eyed the speaker pityingly  this tendency to delay spiller he said is your besetting fault correct it edwin fight against it  he turned to mr outwood  we should of course sir always be glad to see spiller in our study he would always find a cheery welcome waiting there for him there is no formality between ourselves and spiller  quite so an excellent arrangement smith i like this spirit of comradeship in my house then you will be with us on saturday  on saturday sir  all this sort of thing spiller said psmith as they closed the door is very very trying for a man of culture look us up in our study one of these afternoons    5  guerrilla warfare   there are few pleasures said psmith as he resumed his favorite position against the mantelpiece and surveyed the commandeered study with the pride of a householder keener to the reflective mind than sitting under ones own rooftree this place would have been wasted on spiller he would not have appreciated it properly  mike was finishing his tea youre a jolly useful chap to have by you in a crisis smith he said with approval we ought to have known each other before  the loss was mine said psmith courteously we will now with your permission face the future for a while i suppose you realize that we are now to a certain extent up against it spillers hot spanish blood is not going to sit tight and do nothing under a blow like this  what can he do outwoods given us the study  what would you have done if somebody had bagged your study  made it jolly hot for them  so will comrade spiller i take it that he will collect a gang and make an offensive movement against us directly he can to all appearances we are in a fairly tight place it all depends on how big comrade spillers gang will be i dont like rows but im prepared to take on a reasonable number of assailants in defense of the home  mike intimated that he was with him on the point the difficulty is though he said about when we leave this room i mean were all right while we stick here but we cant stay all night  thats just what i was about to point out when you put it with such admirable clearness here we are in a stronghold they can only get at us through the door and we can lock that  and jam a chair against it  and as you rightly remark jam a chair against it but what of the nightfall what of the time when we retire to our dormitory  or dormitories i say if were in separate rooms we shall be in the cart  psmith eyed mike with approval he thinks of everything youre the man comrade jackson to conduct an affair of this kindsuch foresight such resource we must see to this at once if they put us in different rooms were donewe shall be destroyed singly in the watches of the night  wed better nip down to the matron right off  not the matroncomrade outwood is the man we are as sons to him there is nothing he can deny us im afraid we are quite spoiling his afternoon by these interruptions but we must rout him out once more  as they got up the door handle rattled again and this time there followed a knocking  this must be an emissary of comrade spillers said psmith let us parley with the man  mike unlocked the door a lighthaired youth with a cheerful rather vacant face and a receding chin strolled into the room and stood giggling with his hands in his pockets  i just came up to have a look at you he explained  if you move a little to the left said psmith you will catch the lightandshade effects on jacksons face better  the newcomer giggled with renewed vigor are you the chap with the eyeglass who jaws all the time  i do wear an eyeglass said psmith as to the rest of the description  my names jellicoe  mine is psmithpsmithone of the shropshire psmiths the object on the skyline is comrade jackson  old spiller giggled jellicoe is cursing you like anything downstairs you are chaps do you mean to say you simply bagged his study hes making no end of a row about it  spillers fiery nature is a byword said psmith  whats he going to do asked mike in his practical way  hes going to get the chaps to turn you out  as i suspected sighed psmith as one mourning over the frailty of human nature about how many hornyhanded assistants should you say that he would be likely to bring will you for instance join the glad throng  me no fear i think spillers an ass  theres nothing like a common thought for binding people together i think spillers an ass  how many will there be then asked mike  he might get about half a dozen not more because most of the chaps dont see why they should sweat themselves just because spillers study has been bagged  sturdy common sense said psmith approvingly seems to be the chief virtue of the sedleigh character  we shall be able to tackle a crowd like that said mike the only thing is we must get into the same dormitory  this is where comrade jellicoes knowledge of the local geography will come in useful do you happen to know of any snug little room with say about four beds in it how many dormitories are there  fivetheres one with three beds in it only it belongs to three chaps  i believe in the equal distribution of property we will go to comrade outwood and stake out another claim  mr outwood received them even more beamingly than before yes smith he said  we must apologize for disturbing you sir  not at all smith not at all i like the boys in my house to come to me when they wish for my advice or help  we were wondering sir if you would have any objection to jackson jellicoe and myself sharing the dormitory with the three beds in it a very warm friendship  explained psmith patting the gurgling jellicoe kindly on the shoulder has sprung up between jackson jellicoe and myself  you make friends easily smith i like to see iti like to see it  and we can have the room sir  certainlycertainly tell the matron as you go down  and now said psmith as they returned to the study we may say that we are in a fairly winning position a vote of thanks to comrade jellicoe for his valuable assistance  you are a chap said jellicoe  the handle began to revolve again  that door said psmith is getting a perfect incubus it cuts into ones leisure cruelly  this time it was a small boy they told me to come up and tell you to come down he said  psmith looked at him searchingly through his eyeglass  who  the senior day room chaps  spiller  spiller and robinson and stone and some other chaps  they want us to speak to them  they told me to come up and tell you to come down  go and give comrade spiller our compliments and say that we cant come down but shall be delighted to see him up here things he said as the messenger departed are beginning to move better leave the door open i think it will save trouble ah come in comrade spiller what can we do for you  spiller advanced into the study the others waited outside crowding in the doorway  look here said spiller are you going to clear out of here or not  after mr outwoods kindly thought in giving us the room you suggest a black and ungrateful action comrade spiller  youll get it hot if you dont  well risk it said mike  jellicoe giggled in the background the drama in the atmosphere appealed to him his was a simple and appreciative mind  come on you chaps cried spiller suddenly  there was an inward rush on the enemys part but mike had been watching he grabbed spiller by the shoulders and ran him back against the advancing crowd for a moment the doorway was blocked then the weight and impetus of mike and spiller prevailed the enemy gave back and mike stepping into the room again slammed the door and locked it  a neat piece of work said psmith approvingly adjusting his tie at the looking glass the preliminaries may now be considered over the first shot has been fired the dogs of war are now loose  a heavy body crashed against the door  theyll have it down said jellicoe  we must act comrade jackson might i trouble you just to turn that key quietly and the handle and then to stand by for the next attack  there was a scrambling of feet in the passage outside and then a repetition of the onslaught on the door this time however the door instead of resisting swung open and the human battering ram staggered through into the study mike turning after relocking the door was just in time to see psmith with a display of energy of which one would not have believed him capable grip the invader scientifically by an arm and a leg  mike jumped to help but it was needless the captive was already on the windowsill as mike arrived psmith dropped him onto the flowerbed below  psmith closed the window gently and turned to jellicoe who was our guest he asked dusting the knees of his trousers where they had pressed against the wall  robinson i say you are a chap  robinson was it well we are always glad to see comrade robinson always i wonder if anybody else is thinking of calling  apparently frontal attack had been abandoned whisperings could be heard in the corridor  somebody hammered on the door  yes called psmith patiently  youd better come out you know youll only get it hotter if you dont  leave us spiller we would be alone  a bell rang in the distance  tea said jellicoe we shall have to go now  they wont do anything till after tea i shouldnt think said mike theres no harm in going out  the passage was empty when they opened the door the call to food was evidently a thing not to be treated lightly by the enemy  in the dining room the beleaguered garrison were the object of general attention everybody turned to look at them as they came in it was plain that the study episode had been a topic of conversation spillers face was crimson and robinsons coat sleeve still bore traces of garden mold  mike felt rather conscious of the eyes but psmith was in his element his demeanor throughout the meal was that of some whimsical monarch condescending for a freak to revel with his humble subjects  toward the end of the meal psmith scribbled a note and passed it to mike it read directly this is over nip upstairs as quickly as you can  mike followed the advice they were first out of the room when they had been in the study a few moments jellicoe knocked at the door lucky you two cut away so quick he said they were going to try and get you into the senior day room and scrag you there  this said psmith leaning against the mantelpiece is exciting but it cant go on we have got for our sins to be in this place for a whole term and if we are going to do the hunted fawn business all the time life in the true sense of the word will become an impossibility my nerves are so delicately attuned that the strain would simply reduce them to hash we are not prepared to carry on a long campaignthe thing must be settled at once  shall we go down to the senior day room and have it out said mike  no we will play the fixture on our own ground i think we may take it as tolerably certain that comrade spiller and his hired ruffians will try to corner us in the dormitory tonight well of course we could fake up some sort of barricade for the door but then we should have all the trouble over again tomorrow and the day after that personally i dont propose to be chivied about indefinitely like this so i propose that we let them come into the dormitory and see what happens is this meeting with me  i think thats sound said mike we neednt drag jellicoe into it  as a matter of factif you dont mind  began that man of peace  quite right said psmith this is not comrade jellicoes scene at all he has got to spend the term in the senior day room whereas we have our little wooden châlet to retire to in times of stress comrade jellicoe must stand out of the game altogether we shall be glad of his moral support but otherwise ne pas and now as there wont be anything doing till bedtime i think ill collar this table and write home and tell my people that all is well with their rupert    6  unpleasantness in the small hours   jellicoe that human encyclopedia consulted on the probable movements of the enemy deposed that spiller retiring at ten would make for dormitory one in the same passage where robinson also had a bed the rest of the opposing forces were distributed among other and more distant rooms it was probable therefore that dormitory one would be the rendezvous as to the time when an attack might be expected it was unlikely that it would occur before half past eleven mr outwood went the round of the dormitories at eleven  and touching said psmith the matter of noise must this business be conducted in a subdued and sotto voce manner or may we let ourselves go a bit here and there  i shouldnt think old outwoods likely to hear youhe sleeps miles away on the other side of the house he never hears anything we often rag half the night and nothing happens  this appears to be a thoroughly nice wellconducted establishment what would my mother say if she could see her rupert in the midst of these reckless youths  all the better said mike we dont want anybody butting in and stopping the show before its half started  comrade jacksons berserk blood is upi can hear it sizzling i quite agree these things are all very disturbing and painful but its as well to do them thoroughly when ones once in for them is there nobody else who might interfere with our gambols  barnes might said jellicoe only he wont  who is barnes  head of the housea rotter hes in a funk of stone and robinson they rag him hell simply sit tight  then i think said psmith placidly we may look forward to a very pleasant evening shall we be moving  mr outwood paid his visit at eleven as predicted by jellicoe beaming vaguely into the darkness over a torch and disappeared again closing the door  how about that door said mike shall we leave it open for them  not so but far otherwise if its shut we shall hear them at it when they come subject to your approval comrade jackson i have evolved the following plan of action i always ask myself on these occasions what would napoleon have done i think napoleon would have sat in a chair by his washhand stand which is close to the door he would have posted you by your washhand stand and he would have instructed comrade jellicoe directly he heard the door handle turned to give his celebrated imitation of a dormitory breathing heavily in its sleep he would then  i tell you what said mike how about tying a string at the top of the steps  yes napoleon would have done that too hats off to comrade jackson the man with the big brain  the floor of the dormitory was below the level of the door there were three steps leading down to it psmith switched on his torch and they examined the ground the leg of a wardrobe and the leg of jellicoes bed made it possible for the string to be fastened in a satisfactory manner across the lower step psmith surveyed the result with approval  dashed neat he said practically the sunken road which dished the cuirassiers at waterloo i seem to see comrade spiller coming one of the finest purlers in the worlds history  if theyve got a torch  they wont have if they have stand by and grab it at once then theyll charge forward and all will be well if they have no light fire into the brown with a jug of water lest we forget ill collar comrade jellicoes jug now and keep it handy a couple of sheets would also not be amisswe will enmesh the enemy  right ho said mike  these humane preparations being concluded said psmith we will retire to our posts and wait comrade jellicoe dont forget to breathe like an asthmatic sheep when you hear the door opened they may wait at the top of the steps listening  you are a lad said jellicoe  waiting in the dark for something to happen is always a trying experience especially if as on this occasion silence is essential mike was tired after his journey and he had begun to doze when he was jerked back to wakefulness by the stealthy turning of the door handle the faintest rustle from psmiths direction followed and a slight giggle succeeded by a series of deep breaths showed that jellicoe too had heard the noise  there was a creaking sound  it was pitchdark in the dormitory but mike could follow the invaders movements as clearly as if it had been broad daylight they had opened the door and were listening jellicoes breathing grew more asthmatic he was flinging himself into his part with the wholeheartedness of the true artist  the creak was followed by a sound of whispering then another creak the enemy had advanced to the top step another creak the vanguard had reached the second step in another moment  crash  and at that point the proceedings may be said to have formally opened  a struggling mass bumped against mikes shins as he rose from his chair he emptied his jug onto this mass and a yell of anguish showed that the contents had got to the right address  then a hand grabbed his ankle and he went down a million sparks dancing before his eyes as a fist flying out at a venture caught him on the nose  mike had not been well disposed toward the invaders before but now he ran amok hitting out right and left at random his right missed but his left went home hard on some portion of somebodys anatomy a kick freed his ankle and he staggered to his feet at the same moment a sudden increase in the general volume of noise spoke eloquently of good work that was being put in by psmith  even at that crisis mike could not help feeling that if a row of this caliber did not draw mr outwood from his bed he must be an unusual kind of housemaster  he plunged forward again with outstretched arms and stumbled and fell over one of the onthefloor section of the opposing force they seized each other earnestly and rolled across the room till mike contriving to secure his adversarys head bumped it on the floor with such abandon that with a muffled yell the other let go and for the second time he rose as he did so he was conscious of a curious thudding sound that made itself heard through the other assorted noises of the battle  all this time the fight had gone on in the blackest darkness but now a light shone on the proceedings interested occupants of other dormitories roused from their slumbers had come to observe the sport they had switched on the light and were crowding in the doorway  by the light of this mike got a swift view of the theater of war the enemy appeared to number five the warrior whose head mike had bumped on the floor was robinson who was sitting up feeling his skull in a gingerly fashion to mikes right almost touching him was stone in the direction of the door psmith wielding in his right hand the cord of a dressing gown was engaging the remaining three with a patient smile  they were clad in pajamas and appeared to be feeling the dressinggown cord acutely  the sudden light dazed both sides momentarily the defense was the first to recover mike with a swing upsetting stone and psmith having seized and emptied jellicoes jug over spiller getting to work again with the cord in a manner that roused the utmost enthusiasm of the spectators  agility seemed to be the leading feature of psmiths tactics he was everywhereon mikes bed on his own on jellicoes drawing a passionate complaint from that noncombatant on whose face he inadvertently trod on the floorhe ranged the room sowing destruction  the enemy were disheartened they had started with the idea that this was to be a surprise attack and it was disconcerting to find the garrison armed at all points gradually they edged to the door and a final rush sent them through  hold the door for a second cried psmith and vanished mike was alone in the doorway  it was a situation which exactly suited his frame of mind he stood alone in direct opposition to the community into which fate had pitchforked him so abruptly he liked the feeling for the first time since his father had given him his views upon school reports that morning in the easter holidays he felt satisfied with life he hoped outnumbered as he was that the enemy would come on again and not give the thing up in disgust he wanted more  on an occasion like this there is rarely anything approaching concerted action on the part of the aggressors when the attack came it was not a combined attack stone who was nearest to the door made a sudden dash forward and mike hit him under the chin  stone drew back and there was another interval for rest and reflection  it was interrupted by the reappearance of psmith who strolled back along the passage swinging his dressinggown cord as if it were some clouded cane  sorry to keep you waiting comrade jackson he said politely duty called me elsewhere with the kindly aid of a guide who knows the lie of the land i have been making a short tour of the dormitories i have poured divers jugfuls of water over comrade spillers bed comrade robinsons bed comrade stonesspiller spiller these are harsh words where you pick them up i cant thinknot from me well well i suppose there must be an end to the pleasantest of functions good night good night  the door closed behind mike and himself for ten minutes shufflings and whisperings went on in the corridor but nobody touched the handle  then there was a sound of retreating footsteps and silence reigned  on the following morning there was a notice on the house board it ran    indoor games    dormitory raiders are informed that in future neither mr psmith   nor mr jackson will be at home to visitors this nuisance must now   cease    r psmith   m jackson    7  adair   on the same morning mike met adair for the first time  he was going across to school with psmith and jellicoe when a group of three came out of the gate of the house next door  thats adair said jellicoe in the middle  his voice had assumed a tone almost of awe  whos adair asked mike  captain of cricket and lots of other things  mike could only see the celebritys back he had broad shoulders and wiry light hair almost white he walked well as if he were used to running altogether a fitlooking sort of man even mikes jaundiced eye saw that  as a matter of fact adair deserved more than a casual glance he was that rare type the natural leader many boys and men if accident or the passage of time places them in a position where they are expected to lead can handle the job without disaster but that is a very different thing from being a born leader adair was of the sort that comes to the top by sheer force of character and determination he was not naturally clever at work but he had gone at it with a dogged resolution which had carried him up the school and landed him high in the sixth as a cricketer he was almost entirely selftaught nature had given him a good eye and left the thing at that adairs doggedness had triumphed over her failure to do her work thoroughly at the cost of more trouble than most people give to their life work he had made himself into a bowler he read the authorities and watched firstclass players and thought the thing out on his own account and he divided the art of bowling into three sections first and most importantpitch second on the listbreak thirdpace he set himself to acquire pitch he acquired it bowling at his own pace and without any attempt at break he could now drop the ball on an envelope seven times out of ten  break was a more uncertain quantity sometimes he could get it at the expense of pitch sometimes at the expense of pace some days he could get all three and then he was an uncommonly bad man to face on anything but a plumb wicket  running he had acquired in a similar manner he had nothing approaching style but he had twice won the mile and half mile at the sports off elegant runners who knew all about stride and the correct timing of the sprints and all the rest of it  briefly he was a worker he had heart  a boy of adairs type is always a force in a school in a big public school or six or seven hundred his influence is felt less but in a small school like sedleigh he is like a tidal wave sweeping all before him there were two hundred boys at sedleigh and there was not one of them in all probability who had not directly or indirectly been influenced by adair as a small boy his sphere was not large but the effects of his work began to be apparent even then it is human nature to want to get something which somebody else obviously values very much and when it was observed by members of his form that adair was going to great trouble and inconvenience to secure a place in the form eleven or fifteen they naturally began to think too that it was worth being in those teams the consequence was that his form always played hard this made other forms play hard and the net result was that when adair succeeded to the captaincy of rugger and cricket in the same year sedleigh as mr downing adairs housemaster and the nearest approach to a cricket master that sedleigh possessed had a fondness for saying was a keen school as a whole it both worked and played with energy  all it wanted now was opportunity  this adair was determined to give it he had that passionate fondness for his school which every boy is popularly supposed to have but which really is implanted in about one in every thousand the average publicschool boy likes his school he hopes it will lick bedford at rugger and malvern at cricket but he rather bets it wont he is sorry to leave and he likes going back at the end of the holidays but as for any passionate deepseated love of the place he would think it rather bad form than otherwise if anybody came up to him slapped him on the back and cried come along jenkins my boy play up for the old school jenkins the dear old school the old place you love so he would feel seriously ill  adair was the exception  to adair sedleigh was almost a religion both his parents were dead his guardian with whom he spent the holidays was a man with neuralgia at one end of him and gout at the other and the only really pleasant times adair had had as far back as he could remember he owed to sedleigh the place had grown on him absorbed him where mike violently transplanted from wrykyn saw only a wretched little hole not to be mentioned in the same breath with wrykyn adair dreaming of the future saw a colossal establishment a public school among public schools a lump of human radium shooting out blues and balliol scholars year after year without ceasing  it would not be so till long after he was gone and forgotten but he did not mind that his devotion to sedleigh was purely unselfish he did not want fame all he worked for was that the school should grow and grow keener and better at games and more prosperous year by year till it should take its rank among the schools and to be an old sedleighan should be a badge passing its owner everywhere  hes captain of cricket and rugger said jellicoe impressively hes in the shooting eight hes won the mile and half mile two years running he would have boxed at aldershot last term only he sprained his wrist and he plays fives jolly well  sort of little tin god said mike taking a violent dislike to adair from that moment  mikes actual acquaintance with this allround man dated from the dinner hour that day mike was walking to the house with psmith psmith was a little ruffled on account of a slight passageofarms he had had with his form master during morning school  theres a p before the smith i said to him ah p smith i see replied the goat not peasmith i replied exercising wonderful selfrestraint just psmith it took me ten minutes to drive the thing into the mans head and when i had driven it in he sent me out of the room for looking at him through my eyeglass comrade jackson i fear me we have fallen among bad men i suspect that we are going to be much persecuted by scoundrels  both you chaps play cricket i suppose  they turned it was adair seeing him face to face mike was aware of a pair of very bright blue eyes and a square jaw in any other place and mood he would have liked adair at sight his prejudice however against all things sedleighan was too much for him i dont he said shortly  havent you ever played  my little sister and i sometimes play with a soft ball at home  adair looked sharply at him a temper was evidently one of his numerous qualities  oh he said well perhaps you wouldnt mind turning out this afternoon and seeing what you can do with a hard ballif you can manage without your little sister  i should think the form at this place would be about on a level with hers but i dont happen to be playing cricket as i think i told you  adairs jaw grew squarer than ever mike was wearing a gloomy scowl  psmith joined suavely in the dialogue  my dear old comrades he said dont let us brawl over this matter this is a time for the honeyed word the kindly eye and the pleasant smile let me explain to comrade adair speaking for comrade jackson and myself we should both be delighted to join in the mimic warfare of our national game as you suggest only the fact is we happen to be the young archaeologists we gave in our names last night when you are being carried back to the pavilion after your century against loamshiredo you play loamshirewe shall be grubbing in the hard ground for ruined abbeys the old choice between pleasure and duty comrade adair a boys crossroads  then you wont play  no said mike  archaeology said psmith with a deprecatory wave of the hand will brook no divided allegiance from her devotees  adair turned and walked on  scarcely had he gone when another voice hailed them with precisely the same question  both you fellows are going to play cricket eh  it was a master a short wiry little man with a sharp nose and a general resemblance both in manner and appearance to an excitable bullfinch  i saw adair speaking to you i suppose you will both play i like every new boy to begin at once the more new blood we have the better we want keenness here we are above all a keen school i want every boy to be keen  we are sir said psmith with fervor  excellent  on archaeology  mr downingfor it was no less a celebritystarted as one who perceives a loathly caterpillar in his salad  archaeology  we gave in our names to mr outwood last night sir archaeology is a passion with us sir when we heard that there was a society here we went singing about the house  i call it an unnatural pursuit for boys said mr downing vehemently i dont like it i tell you i dont like it it is not for me to interfere with one of my colleagues on the staff but i tell you frankly that in my opinion it is an abominable waste of time for a boy it gets him into idle loafing habits  i never loaf sir said psmith  i was not alluding to you in particular i was referring to the principle of the thing a boy ought to be playing cricket with other boys not wandering at large about the country probably smoking and going into low public houses  a very wild lot sir i fear the archaeological society here sighed psmith shaking his head  if you choose to waste your time i suppose i cant hinder you but in my opinion it is foolery nothing else  he stumped off  now hes cross said psmith looking after him im afraid were getting ourselves disliked here  good job too  at any rate comrade outwood loves us lets go on and see what sort of a lunch that largehearted fossil fancier is going to give us    8  mike finds occupation   there was more than one moment during the first fortnight of term when mike found himself regretting the attitude he had imposed upon himself with regard to sedleighan cricket he began to realize the eternal truth of the proverb about half a loaf and no bread in the first flush of his resentment against his new surroundings he had refused to play cricket and now he positively ached for a game any sort of a game an innings for a kindergarten v the second eleven of a home of rest for centenarians would have soothed him there were times when the sun shone and he caught sight of white flannels on a green ground and heard the plonk of bat striking ball when he felt like rushing to adair and shouting i will be good i was in the wrykyn team three years and had an average of over fifty the last two seasons lead me to the nearest net and let me feel a bat in my hands again  but every time he shrank from such a climb down it couldnt be done  what made it worse was that he saw after watching behind the nets once or twice that sedleigh cricket was not the childish burlesque of the game which he had been rash enough to assume that it must be numbers do not make good cricket they only make the presence of good cricketers more likely by the law of averages  mike soon saw that cricket was by no means an unknown art at sedleigh adair to begin with was a very good bowler indeed he was not a burgess but burgess was the only wrykyn bowler whom in his three years experience of the school mike would have placed above him he was a long way better than nevillesmith and wyatt and milton and the others who had taken wickets for wrykyn  the batting was not so good but there were some quite capable men barnes the head of outwoods he who preferred not to interfere with stone and robinson was a mild rather timidlooking youthnot unlike what mr outwood must have been as a boybut he knew how to keep balls out of his wicket he was a good bat of the old plodding type  stone and robinson themselves that swashbuckling pair who now treated mike and psmith with cold but consistent politeness were both fair batsmen and stone was a good slow bowler  there were other exponents of the game mostly in downings house  altogether quite worthy colleagues even for a man who had been a star at wrykyn                                       one solitary overture mike made during that first fortnight he did not repeat the experiment  it was on a thursday afternoon after school the day was warm but freshened by an almost imperceptible breeze the air was full of the scent of the cut grass which lay in little heaps behind the nets this is the real cricket scent which calls to one like the very voice of the game  mike as he sat there watching could stand it no longer  he went up to adair  may i have an innings at this net he asked he was embarrassed and nervous and was trying not to show it the natural result was that his manner was offensively abrupt  adair was taking off his pads after his innings he looked up this net it may be observed was the first eleven net  what he said  mike repeated his request more abruptly this time from increased embarrassment  this is the first eleven net said adair coldly go in after lodge over there  over there was the end net where frenzied novices were bowling on a corrugated pitch to a redhaired youth with enormous feet who looked as if he were taking his first lesson at the game  mike walked away without a word                                       the archaeological society expeditions even though they carried with them the privilege of listening to psmiths views of life proved but a poor substitute for cricket psmith who had no counterattraction shouting to him that he ought to be elsewhere seemed to enjoy them hugely but mike almost cried sometimes from boredom it was not always possible to slip away from the throng for mr outwood evidently looked upon them as among the very faithful and kept them by his side  mike on these occasions was silent and jumpy his brow sicklied oer with the pale cast of care but psmith followed his leader with the pleased and indulgent air of a father whose infant son is showing him round the garden psmiths attitude toward archaeological research struck a new note in the history of that neglected science he was amiable but patronizing he patronized fossils and he patronized ruins if he had been confronted with the great pyramid he would have patronized that  he seemed to be consumed by a thirst for knowledge  that this was not altogether a genuine thirst was proved in the third expedition mr outwood and his band were pecking away at the site of an old roman camp psmith approached mike  having inspired confidence he said by the docility of our demeanor let us slip away and brood apart for awhile roman camps to be absolutely accurate give me the pip and i never want to see another putrid fossil in my life let us find some shady nook where a man may lie on his back for a bit  mike over whom the proceedings connected with the roman camp had long since begun to shed a blue depression offered no opposition and they strolled away down the hill  looking back they saw that the archaeologists were still hard at it their departure had passed unnoticed  a fatiguing pursuit this grubbing for mementos of the past said psmith and above all dashed bad for the knees of the trousers mine are like some furrowed field its a great grief to a man of refinement i can tell you comrade jackson ah this looks a likely spot  they had passed through a gate into the field beyond at the farther end there was a brook shaded by trees and running with a pleasant sound over pebbles  thus far said psmith hitching up the knees of his trousers and sitting down and no farther we will rest here awhile and listen to the music of the brook in fact unless you have anything important to say i rather think ill go to sleep in this busy life of ours these naps by the wayside are invaluable call me in about an hour and psmith heaving the comfortable sigh of the worker who by toil has earned rest lay down with his head against a mossy tree stump and closed his eyes  mike sat on for a few minutes listening to the water and making centuries in his mind and then finding this a little dull he got up jumped the brook and began to explore the wood on the other side  he had not gone many yards when a dog emerged suddenly from the undergrowth and began to bark vigorously at him  mike liked dogs and on acquaintance they always liked him but when you meet a dog in someone elses wood it is as well not to stop in order that you may get to understand each other mike began to thread his way back through the trees  he was too late  stop what the dickens are you doing here shouted a voice behind him  in the same situation a few years before mike would have carried on and trusted to speed to save him but now there seemed a lack of dignity in the action he came back to where the man was standing  im sorry if im trespassing he said i was just having a look round  the dickens youwhy youre jackson  mike looked at him he was a short broad young man with a fair moustache mike knew that he had seen him before somewhere but he could not place him  i played against you for the free foresters last summer in passing you seem to be a bit of a free forester yourself dancing in among my nesting pheasants  im frightfully sorry  thats all right where do you spring from  of coursei remember you now youre prendergast you made fiftyeight not out  thanks i was afraid the only thing you would remember about me was that you took a century mostly off my bowling  you ought to have had me second ball only cover dropped it  dont rake up forgotten tragedies how is it youre not at wrykyn what are you doing down here  ive left wrykyn  prendergast suddenly changed the conversation when a fellow tells you that he has left school unexpectedly it is not always tactful to inquire the reason he began to talk about himself  i hang out down here i do a little farming and a good deal of puttering about  get any cricket asked mike turning to the subject next his heart  only village very keen but no great shakes by the way how are you off for cricket now have you ever got a spare afternoon  mikes heart leaped  any wednesday or saturday look here ill tell you how it is  and he told how matters stood with him  so you see he concluded im supposed to be hunting for ruins and thingsmikes ideas on the subject of archaeology were vaguebut i could always slip away we all start out together but i could nip back get onto my bikeive got it down hereand meet you anywhere you liked by jove im simply dying for a game i can hardly keep my hands off a bat  ill give you all you want what youd better do is to ride straight to lower borlockthats the name of the placeand ill meet you on the ground anyone will tell you where lower borlock is its just off the london road theres a signpost where you turn off can you come next saturday  rather i suppose you can fix me up with a bat and pads i dont want to bring mine  ill lend you everything i say you know we cant give you a wrykyn wicket the lower borlock pitch isnt a shirt front  ill play on a rockery if you want me to said mike                                       youre going to what asked psmith sleepily on being awakened and told the news  im going to play cricket for a village near here i say dont tell a soul will you i dont want it to get about or i may get lugged in to play for the school  my lips are sealed i think ill come and watch you cricket i dislike but watching cricket is one of the finest of britains manly sports ill borrow jellicoes bicycle                                       that saturday lower borlock smote the men of chidford hip and thigh their victory was due to a hurricane innings of seventyfive by a newcomer to the team m jackson    9  the fire brigade meeting   cricket is the great safety valve if you like the game and are in a position to play it at least twice a week life can never be entirely gray as time went on and his average for lower borlock reached the fifties and stayed there mike began though he would not have admitted it to enjoy himself it was not wrykyn but it was a very decent substitute  the only really considerable element making for discomfort now was mr downing by bad luck it was in his form that mike had been placed on arrival and mr downing never an easy form master to get on with proved more than usually difficult in his dealings with mike  they had taken a dislike to each other at their first meeting and it grew with further acquaintance to mike mr downing was all that a master ought not to be fussy pompous and openly influenced in his official dealings with his form by his own private likes and dislikes to mr downing mike was simply an unamiable loafer who did nothing for the school and apparently had none of the healthy instincts which should be implanted in the healthy boy mr downing was rather strong on the healthy boy  the two lived in a state of simmering hostility punctuated at intervals by crises which usually resulted in lower borlock having to play some unskilled laborer in place of their star batsman employed doing overtime  one of the most acute of these crises and the most important in that it was the direct cause of mikes appearance in sedleigh cricket had to do with the third weekly meeting of the school fire brigade  it may be remembered that this wellsupported institution was under mr downings special care it was indeed his pet hobby and the apple of his eye  just as you had to join the archaeological society to secure the esteem of mr outwood so to become a member of the fire brigade was a safe passport to the regard of mr downing to show a keenness for cricket was good but to join the fire brigade was best of all  the brigade was carefully organized at its head was mr downing a sort of high priest under him was a captain and under the captain a vicecaptain these two officials were those sportive allies stone and robinson of outwoods house who having perceived at a very early date the gorgeous opportunities for ragging which the brigade offered to its members had joined young and worked their way up  under them were the rank and file about thirty in all of whom perhaps seven were earnest workers who looked on the brigade in the right or downing spirit the rest were entirely frivolous  the weekly meetings were always full of life and excitement  at this point it is as well to introduce sammy to the reader  sammy short for sampson was a young bull terrier belonging to mr downing if it is possible for a man to have two apples of his eye sammy was the other he was a large lighthearted dog with a white coat an engaging expression the tongue of an anteater and a manner which was a happy blend of hurricane and circular saw he had long legs a tenor voice and was apparently made of india rubber  sammy was a great favorite in the school and a particular friend of mikes the wrykynian being always a firm ally of every dog he met after two minutes acquaintance  in passing jellicoe owned a clockwork rat much in request during french lessons  we will now proceed to the painful details                                       the meetings of the fire brigade were held after school in mr downings form room the proceedings always began in the same way by the reading of the minutes of the last meeting after that the entertainment varied according to whether the members happened to be fertile or not in ideas for the disturbing of the peace  today they were in very fair form  as soon as mr downing had closed the minute book wilson of the school house held up his hand  well wilson  please sir couldnt we have a uniform for the brigade  a uniform mr downing pondered  red with green stripes sir  red with a thin green stripe was the sedleigh color  shall i put it to the vote sir asked stone  one moment stone  those in favor of the motion move to the left those against it to the right  a scuffling of feet a slamming of desk lids and an upset blackboard and the meeting had divided  mr downing rapped irritably on his desk  sit down he said sit down i wont have this noise and disturbance stone sit downwilson get back to your place  please sir the motion is carried by twentyfive votes to six  please sir may i go and get measured this evening  please sir  silence the idea of a uniform is of course out of the question  oooooooo sirrr  be quiet entirely out of the question we cannot plunge into needless expense stone listen to me i cannot have this noise and disturbance another time when a point arises it must be settled by a show of hands well wilson  please sir may we have helmets  very useful as a protection against falling timbers sir said robinson  i dont think my people would be pleased sir if they knew i was going out to fires without a helmet said stone  the whole strength of the company please sir may we have helmets  those in favor  began stone  mr downing banged on his desk silence silence silence helmets are of course perfectly preposterous  oooooooo sirrr  but sir the danger  please sir the falling timbers  the fire brigade had been in action once and once only in the memory of man and that time it was a haystack which had burned itself out just as the rescuers had succeeded in fastening the hose to the hydrant  silence  then please sir couldnt we have an honor cap it wouldnt be expensive and it would be just as good as a helmet for all the timbers that are likely to fall on our heads  mr downing smiled a wry smile  our wilson is facetious he remarked frostily  sir no sir i wasnt facetious or couldnt we have tasseled caps like the first fifteen have they  wilson leave the room  sir please sir  this moment wilson and as he reached the door do me one hundred lines  a pained oooooo sirrr was cut off by the closing door  mr downing proceeded to improve the occasion i deplore this growing spirit of flippancy he said i tell you i deplore it it is not right if this fire brigade is to be of solid use there must be less of this flippancy we must have keenness i want you boys above all to be keen i what is that noise  from the other side of the door proceeded a sound like water gurgling from a bottle mingled with cries half suppressed as if somebody were being prevented from uttering them by a hand laid over his mouth the sufferer appeared to have a high voice  there was a tap at the door and mike walked in he was not alone those near enough to see saw that he was accompanied by jellicoes clockwork rat which moved rapidly over the floor in the direction of the opposite wall  may i fetch a book from my desk sir asked mike  very wellbe quick jackson we are busy  being interrupted in one of his addresses to the brigade irritated mr downing  the muffled cries grew more distinct  what  is  that  noise shrilled mr downing  noise sir asked mike puzzled  i think its something outside the window sir said stone helpfully  a bird i think sir said robinson  dont be absurd snapped mr downing its outside the door wilson  yes sir said a voice off  are you making that whining noise  whining noise sir no sir im not making a whining noise  what sort of noise sir inquired mike as many wrykynians had asked before him it was a question invented by wrykyn for use in just such a case as this  i do not propose said mr downing acidly to imitate the noise you can all hear it perfectly plainly it is a curious whining noise  they are mowing the cricket field sir said the invisible wilson perhaps thats it  it may be one of the desks squeaking sir put in stone they do sometimes  or somebodys shoes sir added robinson  silence wilson  yes sir bellowed the unseen one  dont shout at me from the corridor like that come in  yes sir  as he spoke the muffled whining changed suddenly to a series of tenor shrieks and the indiarubber form of sammy bounded into the room like an excited kangaroo  willing hands had by this time deflected the clockwork rat from the wall to which it had been steering and pointed it up the alleyway between the two rows of desks mr downing rising from his place was just in time to see sammy with a last leap spring on his prey and begin worrying it  chaos reigned  a rat shouted robinson  the twentythree members of the brigade who were not earnest instantly dealt with the situation each in the manner that seemed proper to him some leaped onto forms others flung books all shouted it was a stirring bustling scene  sammy had by this time disposed of the clockwork rat and was now standing like marius among the ruins barking triumphantly  the banging on mr downings desk resembled thunder it rose above all the other noises till in time they gave up the competition and died away  mr downing shot out orders threats and penalties with the rapidity of a bren gun  stone sit down donovan if you do not sit down you will be severely punished henderson one hundred lines for gross disorder windham the same go to your seat vincent what are you doing broughtonknight i will not have this disgraceful noise and disorder the meeting is at an end go quietly from the room all of you jackson and wilson remain quietly i said durand dont shuffle your feet in that abominable way  crash  wolferstan i distinctly saw you upset that blackboard with a movement of your handone hundred lines go quietly from the room everybody  the meeting dispersed  jackson and wilson come here whats the meaning of this disgraceful conduct put that dog out of the room jackson  mike removed the yelling sammy and shut the door on him  well wilson  please sir i was playing with a clockwork rat  what business have you to be playing with clockwork rats  then i remembered said mike that i had left my horace in my desk so i came in  and by a fluke sir said wilson as one who tells of strange things the rat happened to be pointing in the same direction so he came in too  i met sammy on the gravel outside and he followed me  i tried to collar him but when you told me to come in sir i had to let him go and he came in after the rat  it was plain to mr downing that the burden of sin was shared equally by both culprits wilson had supplied the rat mike the dog but mr downing liked wilson and disliked mike wilson was in the fire brigade frivolous at times it was true but nevertheless a member also he kept wicket for the school mike was a member of the archaeological society and had refused to play cricket  mr downing allowed these facts to influence him in passing sentence  one hundred lines wilson he said you may go  wilson departed with the air of a man who has had a great deal of fun and paid very little for it  mr downing turned to mike you will stay in on saturday afternoon jackson it will interfere with your archaeological studies i fear but it may teach you that we have no room at sedleigh for boys who spend their time loafing about and making themselves a nuisance we are a keen school this is no place for boys who do nothing but waste their time that will do jackson  and mr downing walked out of the room in affairs of this kind a master has a habit of getting the last word    10  achilles leaves his tent   they say misfortunes never come singly as mike sat brooding over his wrongs in his study after the sammy incident jellicoe came into the room and without preamble asked for the loan of a pound  when one has been in the habit of confining ones lendings and borrowings to sixpences and shillings a request for a pound comes as something of a blow  what on earth for asked mike  i say do you mind if i dont tell you i dont want to tell anybody the fact is im in a beastly hole  oh sorry said mike as a matter of fact i do happen to have a quid you can freeze on to it if you like but its about all i have got so dont be shy about paying it back  jellicoe was profuse in his thanks and disappeared in a cloud of gratitude  mike felt that fate was treating him badly being kept in on saturday meant that he would be unable to turn out for little borlock against claythorpe the return match in the previous game he had scored ninetyeight and there was a lob bowler in the claythorpe ranks whom he was particularly anxious to meet again having to yield a sovereign to jellicoewhy on earth did the man want all thatmeant that unless a carefully worded letter to his brother bob at oxford had the desired effect he would be practically penniless for weeks  in a gloomy frame of mind he sat down to write to bob who was playing regularly for the varsity this season and only the previous week had made a century against sussex so might be expected to be in a sufficiently softened mood to advance the needful which it may be stated at once he did by return of post  mike was struggling with the opening sentences of this letterhe was never a very ready writerwhen stone and robinson burst into the room  mike put down his pen and got up he was in warlike mood and welcomed the intrusion if stone and robinson wanted battle they should have it  but the motives of the expedition were obviously friendly stone beamed robinson was laughing  youre a sportsman said robinson  what did he give you asked stone  they sat down robinson on the table stone in psmiths deck chair mikes heart warmed to them the little disturbance in the dormitory was a thing of the past done with forgotten contemporary with julius caesar he felt that he stone and robinson must learn to know and appreciate one another  there was as a matter of fact nothing much wrong with stone and robinson they were just ordinary raggers of the type found at every public school small and large they were absolutely free from brain they had a certain amount of muscle and a vast store of animal spirits they looked on school life purely as a vehicle for ragging the stones and robinsons are the swashbucklers of the school world they go about loud and boisterous with a wholehearted and cheerful indifference to other peoples feelings treading on the toes of their neighbor and shoving him off the pavement and always with an eye wide open for any adventure as to the kind of adventure they are not particular so long as it promises excitement sometimes they go through their whole school career without accident more often they run up against a snag in the shape of some seriousminded and muscular person who objects to having his toes trodden on and being shoved off the pavement and then they usually sober down to the mutual advantage of themselves and the rest of the community  ones opinion of this type of youth varies according to ones point of view small boys whom they had occasion to kick either from pure high spirits or as a punishment for some slip from the narrow path which the ideal small boy should tread regarded stone and robinson as bullies of the genuine eric and st winifreds brand masters were rather afraid of them adair had a smouldering dislike for them they were useful at cricket but apt not to take sedleigh as seriously as he could have wished  as for mike he now found them pleasant company and began to get out the tea things  those fire brigade meetings said stone are a rag you can do what you like and you never get more than a hundred lines  dont you said mike i got saturday afternoon  what  is wilson in too  no he got a hundred lines  stone and robinson were quite concerned  what a beastly swindle  thats because you dont play cricket old downing lets you do what you like if you join the fire brigade and play cricket  we are above all a keen school quoted stone dont you ever play  i have played a bit said mike  well why dont you have a shot we arent such flyers here if you know one end of a bat from the other you could get into some sort of a team were you at school anywhere before you came here  i was at wrykyn  why on earth did you leave asked stone were you sacked  no my father took me away  wrykyn said robinson are you any relation of the jacksons therejw and the others  brother  what  well didnt you play at all there  yes said mike i did i was in the team three years and i should have been captain this year if id stopped on  there was a profound and gratifying sensation stone gaped and robinson nearly dropped his teacup  stone broke the silence  but i mean to saylook here what i mean is why arent you playing why dont you play now  i do i play for a village near here place called lower borlock a man who played against wrykyn for the free foresters captains them he asked me if id like some games for them  but why not for the school  why should i its much better fun for the village you dont get ordered about by adair for a start  adair sticks on side said stone  enough for six agreed robinson  by jove said stone ive got an idea my word what a rag  whats wrong now inquired mike politely  why look here tomorrows midterm service day its nowhere near the middle of the term but they always have it in the fourth week theres chapel at half past nine till half past ten then the rest of the days a whole holiday there are always house matches were playing downings why dont you play and lets smash them  by jove yes said robinson why dont you theyre always sticking on side because theyve won the house cup three years running i say do you bat or bowl  bat why  robinson rocked on the table  why old downing fancies himself as a bowler you must play and knock the cover off him  masters dont play in house matches surely  this isnt a real house match only a friendly downing always turns out on midterm service day i say do play  think of the rag  but the teams full said mike  the list isnt up yet well nip across to barness study and make him alter it  they dashed out of the room from down the passage mike heard yells of barnes the closing of a door and a murmur of excited conversation then footsteps returning down the passage  barnes appeared on his face the look of one who has seen visions  i say he said is it true or is stone rotting about wrykyn i mean  yes i was in the team  barnes was an enthusiastic cricketer he studied his wisden and he had an immense respect for wrykyn cricket  are you the m jackson then who had an average of fiftyone point naught three last year  yes  barness manner became like that of a curate talking to a bishop  i say he said thenerwill you play against downings tomorrow  rather said mike thanks awfully have some tea    11  the match with downings   it is the curious instinct which prompts most people to rub a thing in that makes the lot of the average convert an unhappy one only the very selfcontrolled can refrain from improving the occasion and scoring off the convert most leap at the opportunity  it was so in mikes case mike was not a genuine convert but to mr downing he had the outward aspect of one when you have been impressing upon a noncricketing boy for nearly a month that a the school is above all a keen school b that all members of it should play cricket and c that by not playing cricket he is ruining his chances in this world and imperiling them in the next and when quite unexpectedly you come upon this boy dressed in cricket flannels wearing cricket boots and carrying a cricket bag it seems only natural to assume that you have converted him that the seeds of your eloquence have fallen on fruitful soil and sprouted  mr downing assumed it  he was walking to the field with adair and another member of his team when he came upon mike  what he cried our jackson clad in suit of mail and armed for the fray  this was mr downings no 2 mannerthe playful  this is indeed saul among the prophets why this sudden enthusiasm for a game which i understood that you despised are our opponents so reduced  psmith who was with mike took charge of the affair with a languid grace which had maddened hundreds in its time and which never failed to ruffle mr downing  we are above all sir he said a keen house drones are not welcomed by us we are essentially versatile jackson the archaeologist of yesterday becomes the cricketer of today it is the right spirit sir said psmith earnestly i like to see it  indeed smith you are not playing yourself i notice your enthusiasm has bounds  in our house sir competition is fierce and the selection committee unfortunately passed me over                                       there were a number of pitches dotted about over the field for there was always a touch of the london park about it on midterm service day adair as captain of cricket had naturally selected the best for his own match it was a good wicket mike saw as a matter of fact the wickets at sedleigh were nearly always good adair had infected the groundsman with some of his own keenness with the result that that onceleisurely official now found himself sometimes with a kind of mild surprise working really hard at the beginning of the previous season sedleigh had played a scratch team from a neighboring town on a wicket which except for the creases was absolutely undistinguishable from the surrounding turf and behind the pavilion after the match adair had spoken certain home truths to the groundsman the latters reformation had dated from that moment                                       barnes timidly jubilant came up to mike with the news that he had won the toss and the request that mike would go in first with him  in stories of the not really a duffer type where the nervous new boy who has been found crying in the changing room over the photograph of his sister contrives to get an innings in a game nobody suspects that he is really a prodigy till he hits the bullys first ball out of the ground for six  with mike it was different there was no pitying smile on adairs face as he started his run preparatory to sending down the first ball mike on the cricket field could not have looked anything but a cricketer if he had turned out in a tweed suit and hobnail boots cricketer was written all over himin his walk in the way he took guard in his stand at the wicket adair started to bowl with the feeling that this was somebody who had more than a little knowledge of how to deal with good bowling and punish bad  mike started cautiously he was more than usually anxious to make runs today and he meant to take no risks till he could afford to do so he had seen adair bowl at the nets and he knew that he was good  the first over was a maiden six dangerous balls beautifully played the fieldsmen changed over  the general interest had now settled on the match between outwoods and downings the facts in mikes case had gone around the field and as several of the other games had not yet begun quite a large crowd had collected near the pavilion to watch mikes masterly treatment of the opening over had impressed the spectators and there was a popular desire to see how he would deal with mr downings slows it was generally anticipated that he would do something special with them  off the first ball of the masters over a legbye was run  mike took guard  mr downing was a bowler with a style of his own he took two short steps two long steps gave a jump took three more short steps and ended with a combination of step and jump during which the ball emerged from behind his back and started on its slow career to the wicket the whole business had some of the dignity of the oldfashioned minuet subtly blended with the careless vigor of a cakewalk the ball when delivered was billed to break from leg but the program was subject to alterations  if the spectators had expected mike to begin any firework effects with the first ball they were disappointed he played the over through with a grace worthy of his brother joe the last ball he turned to leg for a single  his treatment of adairs next over was freer he had got a sight of the ball now halfway through the over a beautiful square cut forced a passage through the crowd by the pavilion and dashed up against the rails he drove the sixth ball past cover for three  the crowd was now reluctantly dispersing to its own games but it stopped as mr downing started his minuetcakewalk in the hope that it might see something more sensational  this time the hope was fulfilled  the ball was well up slow and off the wicket on the onside perhaps if it had been allowed to pitch it might have broken in and become quite dangerous mike went out at it and hit it a couple of feet from the ground the ball dropped with a thud and a spurting of dust in the road that ran along one side of the cricket field  it was returned on the installment system by helpers from other games and the bowler began his maneuvers again a half volley this time mike slammed it back and mid on whose heart was obviously not in the thing failed to stop it  get to them jenkins said mr downing irritably as the ball came back from the boundary get to them  sir please sir  dont talk in the field jenkins  having had a full pitch hit for six and a half volley for four there was a strong probability that mr downing would pitch his next ball short  the expected happened the third ball was a slow long hop and hit the road at about the same spot where the first had landed a howl of untuneful applause rose from the watchers in the pavilion and mike with the feeling that this sort of bowling was too good to be true waited in position for number four  there are moments when a sort of panic seizes a bowler this happened now with mr downing he suddenly abandoned science and ran amok his run lost its stateliness and increased its vigor he charged up to the wicket as a wounded buffalo sometimes charges a gun his whole idea now was to bowl fast  when a slow bowler starts to bowl fast it is usually as well to be batting if you can manage it  by the time the over was finished mikes score had been increased by sixteen and the total of his side in addition by three wides  and a shrill small voice from the neighborhood of the pavilion uttered with painful distinctness the words take him off  that was how the most sensational days cricket began that sedleigh had known  a description of the details of the mornings play would be monotonous it is enough to say that they ran on much the same lines as the third and fourth overs of the match mr downing bowled one more over off which mike helped himself to sixteen runs and then retired moodily to cover point where in adairs fifth over he missed barnesthe first occasion since the game began on which that mild batsman had attempted to score more than a single scared by this escape outwoods captain shrank back into his shell sat on the splice like a limpet and offering no more chances was not out at lunchtime with a score of eleven mike had then made a hundred and three                                       as mike was taking off his pads in the pavilion adair came up  why did you say you didnt play cricket he asked abruptly  when one has been bowling the whole morning and bowling well without the slightest success one is inclined to be abrupt  mike finished unfastening an obstinate strap then he looked up  i didnt say anything of the kind i said i wasnt going to play here theres a difference as a matter of fact i was in the wrykyn team before i came here three years  adair was silent for a moment  will you play for us against the old sedleighans tomorrow he said at length  mike tossed his pads into his bag and got up  no thanks  there was a silence  above it i suppose  not a bit not up to it i shall want a lot of coaching at that end net of yours before im fit to play for sedleigh  there was another pause  then you wont play asked adair  im not keeping you am i said mike politely  it was remarkable what a number of members of outwoods house appeared to cherish a personal grudge against mr downing it had been that masters somewhat injudicious practice for many years to treat his own house as a sort of chosen people of all masters the most unpopular is he who by the silent tribunal of a school is convicted of favoritism and the dislike deepens if it is a house which he favors and not merely individuals on occasions when boys in his own house and boys from other houses were accomplices and partners in wrongdoing mr downing distributed his thunderbolts unequally and the school noticed it the result was that not only he himself but alsowhich was rather unfairhis house too had acquired a good deal of unpopularity  the general consensus of opinion in outwoods during the luncheon interval was that having got downings up a tree they would be fools not to make the most of the situation  barness remark that he supposed unless anything happened and wickets began to fall a bit faster they had better think of declaring somewhere about half past three or four was met with a storm of opposition  declare said robinson great scot what on earth are you talking about  declare stones voice was almost a wail of indignation i never saw such a chump  theyll be rather sick if we dont wont they suggested barnes  sick i should think they would said stone thats just the gay idea cant you see that by a miracle weve got a chance of getting a jolly good bit of our own back against those downings ticks what weve got to do is to jolly well keep them in the field all day if we can and be jolly glad its so beastly hot if they lose about a dozen pounds each through sweating about in the sun after jacksons drives perhaps theyll stick on less side about things in general in future besides i want an innings against that bilge of old downings if i can get it  so do i said robinson  if you declare i swear i wont field nor will robinson  rather not  well i wont then said barnes unhappily only you know theyre rather sick already  dont you worry about that said stone with a wide grin theyll be a lot sicker before weve finished  and so it came about that that particular midterm serviceday match made history big scores had often been put up on midterm service day games had frequently been onesided but it had never happened before in the annals of the school that one side going in first early in the morning had neither completed its innings nor declared it closed when stumps were drawn at 630 in no previous sedleigh match after a full days play had the pathetic words did not bat been written against the whole of one of the contending teams  these are the things which mark epochs  play was resumed at 215 for a quarter of an hour mike was comparatively quiet adair fortified by food and rest was bowling really well and his first half dozen overs had to be watched carefully but the wicket was too good to give him a chance and mike playing himself in again proceeded to get to business once more bowlers came and went adair pounded away at one end with brief intervals between the attacks mr downing took a couple more overs in one of which a horse passing in the road nearly had its useful life cut suddenly short change bowlers of various actions and paces each weirder and more futile than the last tried their luck but still the firstwicket stand continued  the bowling of a house team is all head and no body the first pair probably have some idea of length and break the firstchange pair are poor and the rest the small change are simply the sort of things one sees in dreams after a heavy supper or when one is out without ones gun  time mercifully generally breaks up a big stand at cricket before the field has suffered too much and that is what happened now at four oclock when the score stood at two hundred and twenty for no wicket barnes greatly daring smote lustily at a rather wide half volley and was caught at short slip for thirtythree he retired blushfully to the pavilion amidst applause and stone came out  as mike had then made a hundred and eightyseven it was assumed by the field that directly he had topped his second century the closure would be applied and their ordeal finished there was almost a sigh of relief when frantic cheering from the crowd told that the feat had been accomplished the fieldsmen clapped in quite an indulgent sort of way as who should say capital capital and now lets start our innings some even began to edge toward the pavilion  but the next ball was bowled and the next over and the next after that and still barnes made no sign the conscience stricken captain of outwoods was as a matter of fact being practically held down by robinson and other ruffians by force  a gray dismay settled on the field  the bowling had now become almost unbelievably bad lobs were being tried and stone nearly weeping with pure joy was playing an innings of the howtobrightencricket type he had an unorthodox style but an excellent eye and the road at this period of the game became absolutely unsafe for pedestrians and traffic  mikes pace had become slower as was only natural but his score too was mounting steadily  this is foolery snapped mr downing as the three hundred and fifty went up on the board barnes he called  there was no reply a committee of three was at that moment engaged in sitting on barness head in the first eleven changing room in order to correct a more than usually feverish attack of conscience  barnes  please sir said stone some species of telepathy telling him what was detaining his captain i think barnes must have left the field he has probably gone over to the house to fetch something  this is absurd you must declare your innings closed the game has become a farce  declare sir we cant unless barnes does he might be awfully annoyed if we did anything like that without consulting him  absurd  hes very touchy sir  it is perfect foolery  i think jenkins is just going to bowl sir  mr downing walked moodily to his place  in a neat wooden frame in the senior day room at outwoods just above the mantlepiece there was on view a week later a slip of paper  the writing on it was as follows    outwoods v downings    outwoods first innings    jp barnes c hammond b hassall      33   m jackson not out                         277   wj stone not out                         124     extras                                     37         total for one wicket                471    downings did not bat    12  the singular behavior of jellicoe   outwoods rollicked considerably that night mike if he had cared to take the part could have been the petted hero but a cordial invitation from the senior day room to be the guest of the evening at about the biggest rag of the century had been refused on the plea of fatigue one does not make two hundred and seventyseven runs on a hot day without feeling the effects even if one has scored mainly by the medium of boundaries and mike as he lay back in psmiths deck chair felt that all he wanted was to go to bed and stay there for a week his hands and arms burned as if they were redhot and his eyes were so tired that he could not keep them open  psmith leaning against the mantlepiece discoursed in a desultory way on the days happeningsthe score off mr downing the undeniable annoyance of that battered bowler and the probability of his venting his annoyance on mike next day  in theory said he the manly whatdyoucallit of cricket and all that sort of thing ought to make him fall on your neck tomorrow and weep over you as a foeman worthy of his steel but i am prepared to bet a reasonable sum that he will give no jujitsu exhibition of this kind in fact from what i have seen of our bright little friend i should say that in a small way he will do his best to make it distinctly hot for you here and there  i dont care murmured mike shifting his aching limbs in the chair  in an ordinary way i suppose a man can put up with having his bowling hit a little but your performance was cruelty to animals twentyeight off one over not to mention three wides would have made job foam at the mouth you will probably get sacked on the other hand its worth it you have lit a candle this day which can never be blown out you have shown the lads of the village how comrade downings bowling ought to be treated i dont suppose hell ever take another wicket  he doesnt deserve to  psmith smoothed his hair at the glass and turned round again  the only blot on this day of mirth and goodwill is he said the singular conduct of our friend jellicoe when all the place was ringing with song and merriment comrade jellicoe crept to my side and slipping his little hand in mine touched me for three quid  this interested mike tired as he was  what three quid  three crisp crackling quid he wanted four  but the man must be living at the rate of i dont know what it was only yesterday that he borrowed a quid from me  he must be saving money fast there appear to be the makings of a financier about comrade jellicoe well i hope when hes collected enough for his needs hell pay me back a bit im pretty well cleaned out  i got some from my brother at oxford  perhaps hes saving up to get married we may be helping toward furnishing the home there was a siamese prince fellow at my dames at eton who had four wives when he arrived and gathered in a fifth during his first summer holidays it was done on the correspondence system his prime minister fixed it up at the other end and sent him the glad news on a picture post card i think an eye ought to be kept on comrade jellicoe                                       mike tumbled into bed that night like a log but he could not sleep he ached all over psmith chatted for a time on human affairs in general and then dropped gently off jellicoe who appeared to be wrapped in gloom contributed nothing to the conversation  after psmith had gone to sleep mike lay for some time running over in his mind as the best substitute for sleep the various points of his innings that day he felt very hot and uncomfortable  just as he was wondering whether it would not be a good idea to get up and have a cold bath a voice spoke from the darkness at his side  are you asleep jackson  whos that  mejellicoe i cant get to sleep  nor can i im stiff all over  ill come over and sit on your bed  there was a creaking and then a weight descended in the neighborhood of mikes toes  jellicoe was apparently not in conversational mood he uttered no word for quite three minutes at the end of which time he gave a sound midway between a snort and a sigh  i say jackson he said  yes  have youoh nothing  silence again  jackson  hello  i say what would your people say if you got sacked  all sorts of things especially my father why  oh i dont know so would mine  everybodys would i expect  yes  the bed creaked as jellicoe digested these great thoughts then he spoke again  it would be a jolly beastly thing to get sacked  mike was too tired to give his mind to the subject he was not really listening jellicoe droned on in a depressed sort of way  youd get home in the middle of the afternoon i suppose and youd drive up to the house and the servant would open the door and youd go in they might all be out and then youd have to hang about and wait and presently youd hear them come in and youd go out into the passage and theyd say hello  jellicoe in order to give verisimilitude as it were to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative flung so much agitated surprise into the last word that it woke mike from a troubled doze into which he had fallen  hello he said whats up  then youd say hello and then theyd say what are you doing here and youd say  what on earth are you talking about  about what would happen  happen when  when you got home after being sacked you know  whos been sacked mikes mind was still under a cloud  nobody but if you were i meant and then i suppose thered be an awful row and general sickness and all that and then youd be sent into a bank or to australia or something  mike dozed off again  my father would be frightfully sick my mater would be sick my sister would be jolly sick too have you got any sisters jackson i say jackson  hello whats the matter whos that  mejellicoe  whats up  i asked you if youd got any sisters  any what  sisters  whose sisters  yours i asked if youd got any  any what  sisters  what about them  the conversation was becoming too intricate for jellicoe he changed the subject  i say jackson  well  i say you dont know anyone who could lend me a pound do you  what cried mike sitting up in bed and staring through the darkness in the direction whence the numismatists voice was proceeding do what  i say look out youll wake psmith  did you say you wanted someone to lend you a quid  yes said jellicoe eagerly do you know anyone  mikes head throbbed this thing was too much the human brain could not be expected to cope with it here was a youth who had borrowed a pound from one friend the day before and three pounds from another friend that very afternoon already looking about him for further loans was it a hobby or was he saving up to buy an airplane  what on earth do you want a pound for  i dont want to tell anybody but its jolly serious i shall get sacked if i dont get it  mike pondered  those who have followed mikes career as set forth by the present historian will have realized by this time that he was a good long way from being perfect as the blueeyed hero he would have been a rank failure except on the cricket field where he was a natural genius he was just ordinary he resembled ninety percent of other members of english public schools he had some virtues and a good many defects he was as obstinate as a mule though people whom he liked could do as they pleased with him he was goodnatured as a general thing but on occasion his temper could be of the worst and had in his childhood been the subject of much adverse comment among his aunts he was rigidly truthful where the issue concerned only himself where it was a case of saving a friend he was prepared to act in a manner reminiscent of an american expert witness  he had in addition one good quality without any defect to balance it he was always ready to help people and when he set himself to do this he was never put off by discomfort or risk he went at the thing with a singleness of purpose that asked no questions  bobs postal order which had arrived that evening was reposing in the breast pocket of his coat  it was a wrench but if the situation was so serious with jellicoe it had to be done  two minutes later the night was being made hideous by jellicoes almost tearful protestations of gratitude and the postal order had moved from one side of the dormitory to the other    13  jellicoe goes on the sick list   mike woke next morning with a confused memory of having listened to a great deal of incoherent conversation from jellicoe and a painfully vivid recollection of handing over the bulk of his worldly wealth to him the thought depressed him though it seemed to please jellicoe for the latter caroled in a gay undertone as he dressed till psmith who had a sensitive ear asked as a favor that these farmyard imitations might cease until he was out of the room  there were other things to make mike lowspirited that morning to begin with he was in detention which in itself is enough to spoil a day it was a particularly fine day which made the matter worse in addition to this he had never felt stiffer in his life it seemed to him that the creaking of his joints as he walked must be audible to everyone within a radius of several yards finally there was the interview with mr downing to come that would probably be unpleasant as psmith had said mr downing was the sort of master who would be likely to make trouble the great match had not been an ordinary match mr downing was a curious man in many ways but he did not make a fuss on ordinary occasions when his bowling proved expensive yesterdays performance however stood in a class by itself it stood forth without disguise as a deliberate rag one side does not keep another in the field the whole day in a oneday match except as a grisly kind of practical joke and mr downing and his house realized this the houses way of signifying its comprehension of the fact was to be cold and distant as far as the seniors were concerned and abusive and pugnacious as regards the juniors young blood had been shed overnight and more flowed during the elevenoclock interval that morning to avenge the insult  mr downings methods of retaliation would have to be of necessity more elusive but mike did not doubt that in some way or other his form master would endeavor to get a bit of his own back  as events turned out he was perfectly right when a master has got his knife into a boy especially a master who allows himself to be influenced by his likes and dislikes he is inclined to single him out in times of stress and savage him as if he were the official representative of the evildoers just as at sea the skipper when he has trouble with the crew works it off on the boy  mr downing was in a sarcastic mood when he met mike that is to say he began in a sarcastic strain but this sort of thing is difficult to keep up by the time he had reached his peroration the rapier had given place to the bludgeon for sarcasm to be effective the user of it must be met halfway his hearer must appear to be conscious of the sarcasm and moved by it mike when masters waxed sarcastic toward him always assumed an air of stolid stupidity which was as a suit of mail against satire  so mr downing came down from the heights with a run and began to express himself with a simple strength which it did his form good to listen to veterans who had been in the form for terms said afterward that there had been nothing to touch it in their experience of the orator since the glorious day when dunster that prince of raggers who had left at christmas to go to a crammers had introduced three lively grass snakes into the room during a latin lesson  you are surrounded concluded mr downing snapping his pencil in two in his emotion by an impenetrable mass of conceit and vanity and selfishness it does not occur to you to admit your capabilities as a cricketer in an open straightforward way and place them at the disposal of the school no that would not be dramatic enough for you it would be too commonplace altogether far too commonplace mr downing laughed bitterly no you must conceal your capabilities you must act a lie you mustwho is that shuffling his feet i will not have it i will have silenceyou must hang back in order to make a more effective entrance like some wretched actor whoi will not have this shuffling i have spoken of this before macpherson are you shuffling your feet  sir no sir  please sir  well parsons  i think its the noise of the draft under the door sir  instant departure of parsons for the outer regions and in the excitement of this side issue the speaker lost his inspiration and abruptly concluded his remarks by putting mike on to translate in cicero which mike who happened to have prepared the first halfpage did with much success  the old boys match was timed to begin shortly after eleven oclock during the interval most of the school walked across the field to look at the pitch one or two of the old boys had already changed and were practicing in front of the pavilion  it was through one of these batsmen that an accident occurred which had a good deal of influence on mikes affairs  mike had strolled out by himself halfway across the field jellicoe joined him jellicoe was cheerful and rather embarrassingly grateful he was just in the middle of his harangue when the accident happened  to their left as they crossed the field a long youth with the faint beginnings of a moustache and a blazer that lit up the surrounding landscape like a glowing beacon was lashing out recklessly at a friends bowling already he had gone within an ace of slaying a small boy as mike and jellicoe proceeded on their way there was a shout of heads  the almost universal habit of batsmen of shouting heads at whatever height from the ground the ball may be is not a little confusing the average person on hearing the shout puts his hands over his skull crouches down and trusts to luck this is an excellent plan if the ball is falling but is not much protection against a skimming drive along the ground  when heads was called on the present occasion mike and jellicoe instantly assumed the crouching attitude  jellicoe was the first to abandon it he uttered a yell and sprang into the air after which he sat down and began to nurse his ankle  the brightblazered youth walked up  awfully sorry you know hurt  jellicoe was pressing the injured spot tenderly with his fingertips uttering sharp howls whenever zeal outrunning discretion he prodded himself too energetically  silly ass dunster he groaned slamming about like that  awfully sorry but i did yell  its swelling up rather said mike youd better get over to the house and have it looked at can you walk  jellicoe tried but sat down again with a loud ow at that moment the bell rang  i shall have to be going in said mike or id have helped you over  ill give you a hand said dunster  he helped the sufferer to his feet and they staggered off together jellicoe hopping dunster advancing with a sort of polka step mike watched them start and then turned to go in    14  mike receives a commission   there is only one thing to be said in favor of detention on a fine summers afternoon and that is that it is very pleasant to come out of the sun never seems so bright or the turf so green as during the first five minutes after one has come out of the detention room one feels as if one were entering a new and very delightful world there is also a touch of the rip van winkle feeling everything seems to have gone on and left one behind mike as he walked to the cricket field felt very much behind the times  arriving on the field he found the old boys batting he stopped and watched an over of adairs the fifth ball bowled a man mike made his way toward the pavilion  before he got there he heard his name called and turning found psmith seated under a tree with the brightblazered dunster  return of the exile said psmith a joyful occasion tinged with melancholy have a cherrytake one or two these little acts of unremembered kindness are what one needs after a couple of hours in extra pupil room restore your tissues comrade jackson and when you have finished those apply again  is your name jackson inquired dunster because jellicoe wants to see you  alas poor jellicoe said psmith he is now prone on his bed in the dormitorythere a sheer hulk lies poor tom jellicoe the darling of the crew faithful below he did his duty but comrade dunster has broached him to i have just been hearing the melancholy details  old smith and i said dunster were at prep school together id no idea i should find him here  it was a wonderfully stirring sight when we met said psmith not unlike the meeting of ulysses and the hound argos of whom you have doubtless read in the course of your dabblings in the classics i was ulysses dunster gave a lifelike representation of the faithful dawg  you still jaw as much as ever i notice said the animal delineator fondling the beginnings of his moustache  more sighed psmith more is anything irritating you he added eyeing the others maneuvers with interest  you neednt be a funny ass man said dunster pained heaps of people tell me i ought to have it waxed  what it really wants is topdressing with guano hello another man out adairs bowling better today than he did yesterday  i heard about yesterday said dunster it must have been a rag couldnt we work off some other rag on somebody before i go i shall be stopping here till monday in the village well hit siradairs bowling is perfectly simple if you go out to it  comrade dunster went out to it first ball said psmith to mike  oh chuck it man the sun was in my eyes i hear adairs got a match on with the mcc at last  has he said psmith i hadnt heard archaeology claims so much of my time that i have little leisure for listening to cricket chitchat  what was it jellicoe wanted asked mike was it anything important  he seemed to think sohe kept telling me to tell you to go and see him  i fear comrade jellicoe is a bit of a weakminded blitherer  did you ever hear of a rag we worked off on jellicoe once asked dunster the man has absolutely no sense of humorcant see when hes being rotted well it was like thishello were all outi shall have to be going out to field again i suppose dash it ill tell you when i see you again  i shall count the minutes said psmith  mike stretched himself the sun was very soothing after his two hours in the detention room he felt disinclined for exertion  i dont suppose its anything special about jellicoe do you he said i mean itll keep till teatime its no catch having to sweat across to the house now  dont dream of moving said psmith i have several rather profound observations on life to make and i cant make them without an audience soliloquy is a knack hamlet had got it but probably only after years of patient practice personally i need someone to listen when i talk i like to feel that i am doing good you stay where you aredont interrupt too much  mike tilted his hat over his eyes and abandoned jellicoe  it was not until the lockup bell rang that he remembered him he went over to the house and made his way to the dormitory where he found the injured one in a parlous state not so much physical as mental the doctor had seen his ankle and reported that it would be on the active list in a couple of days it was jellicoes mind that needed attention now  mike found him in a condition bordering on collapse i say you might have come before said jellicoe  whats up i didnt know there was such a hurry about itwhat did you want  its no good now said jellicoe gloomily its too late i shall get sacked  what on earth are you talking about whats the row  its about that money  what about it  i had to pay it to a man today or he said hed write to the headthen of course i should get sacked i was going to take the money to him this afternoon only i got crocked so i couldnt move i wanted to get hold of you to ask you to take it for meits too late now  mikes face fell oh hang it he said im awfully sorry id no idea it was anything like thatwhat a fool i was dunster did say he thought it was something important only like an ass i thought it would do if i came over at lockup  it doesnt matter said jellicoe miserably it cant be helped  yes it can said mike i know what ill doits all right ill get out of the house after lightsout  jellicoe sat up you cant youd get sacked if you were caught  who would catch me there was a chap at wrykyn i knew who used to break out every night nearly and go and pot at cats with an air pistol its as easy as anything  the toadundertheharrow expression began to fade from jellicoes face i say do you think you could really  of course i can itll be rather a rag  i say its frightfully decent of you  what absolute rot  but look here are you certain  i shall be all right where do you want me to go  its a place about a mile or two from here called lower borlock  lower borlock  yes do you know it  rather ive been playing cricket for them all the term  i say have you do you know a man called barley  barley ratherhe runs the white boar  hes the chap i owe the money to  old barley  mike knew the landlord of the white boar well he was the wag of the village team every village team for some mysterious reason has its comic man in the lower borlock eleven mr barley filled the post he was a large stout man with a red and cheerful face who looked exactly like the jovial innkeeper of melodrama he was the last man mike would have expected to do the money by mondayweek or i write to the headmaster business  but he reflected that he had only seen him in his leisure moments when he might naturally be expected to unbend and be full of the milk of human kindness probably in business hours he was quite different after all pleasure is one thing and business another  besides five pounds is a large sum of money and if jellicoe owed it there was nothing strange in mr barleys doing everything he could to recover it  he wondered a little what jellicoe could have been doing to run up a bill as big as that but it did not occur to him to ask which was unfortunate as it might have saved him a good deal of inconvenience it seemed to him that it was none of his business to inquire into jellicoes private affairs he took the envelope containing the money without question  i shall bike there i think he said if i can get into the shed  the schools bicycles were stored in a shed by the pavilion  you can manage that said jellicoe its locked up at night but i had a key made to fit it last summer because i used to get out in the early morning sometimes before it was opened  got it on you  smiths got it  ill get it from him  i say  well  dont tell smith why you want it will you i dont want anybody to knowif a thing once starts getting about its all over the place in no time  all right i wont tell him  i say thanks most awfully i dont know what i should have done i  oh chuck it said mike    15   and fulfills it   mike started on his ride to lower borlock with mixed feelings it is pleasant to be out on a fine night in summer but the pleasure is to a certain extent modified when one feels that to be detected will mean expulsion  mike did not want to be expelled for many reasons now that he had grown used to the place he was enjoying himself at sedleigh to a certain extent he still harbored a feeling of resentment against the school in general and adair in particular but it was pleasant in outwoods now that he had got to know some of the members of the house and he liked playing cricket for lower borlock also he was fairly certain that his father would not let him go to cambridge if he were expelled from sedleigh mr jackson was easygoing with his family but occasionally his foot came down like a steam hammer as witness the wrykyn schoolreport affair  so mike pedaled along rapidly being wishful to get the job done without delay  psmith had yielded up the key but his inquiries as to why it was needed had been embarrassing mikes statement that he wanted to get up early and have a ride had been received by psmith with whom early rising was not a hobby with honest amazement and a flood of advice and warning on the subject  one of the georges said psmith i forget which once said that a certain number of hours sleep a dayi cannot recall for the moment how manymade a man something which for the time being has slipped my memory however there you are ive given you the main idea of the thing and a german doctor says that early rising causes insanity still if youre bent on it after which he had handed over the key  mike wished he could have taken psmith into his confidence probably he would have volunteered to come too mike would have been glad of a companion  it did not take him long to reach lower borlock the white boar stood at the far end of the village by the cricket field he rode past the churchstanding out black and mysterious against the light skyand the rows of silent cottages until he came to the inn  the place was shut of course and all the lights were outit was sometime past eleven  the advantage an inn has over a private house from the point of view of the person who wants to get into it when it has been locked up is that a nocturnal visit is not so unexpected in the case of the former preparations have been made to meet such an emergency where with a private house you would probably have to wander around heaving rocks and end by climbing up a waterspout when you want to get into an inn you simply ring the night bell which communicating with the boots room has that hardworked menial up and doing in no time  after mike had waited for a few minutes there was a rattling of chains and a shooting of bolts and the door opened  yes sir said the boots appearing in his shirt sleeves why ello mr jackson sir  mike was well known to all dwellers in lower borlock his scores being the chief topic of conversation when the days labors were over  i want to see mr barley jack  hes bin in bed this half hour back mr jackson  i must see him can you get him down  the boots looked doubtful roust the guvnor outer bed he said  mike quite admitted the gravity of the task the landlord of the white boar was one of those men who need a beauty sleep  i wish you wouldits a thing that cant wait ive got some money to give to him  oh if its that  said the boots  five minutes later mine host appeared in person looking more than usually portly in a check dressing gown and red bedroom slippers  you can pop off jack  exit boots to his slumbers once more  well mr jackson whats it all about  jellicoe asked me to come and bring you the money  the money what money  what he owes you the five pounds of course  the five mr barley stared openmouthed at mike for a moment then he broke into a roar of laughter which shook the sporting prints on the wall and drew barks from dogs in some distant part of the house he staggered about laughing and coughing till mike began to expect a fit of some kind then he collapsed into a chair which creaked under him and wiped his eyes  oh dear he said oh dear the five pounds  mike was not always abreast of the rustic idea of humor and now he felt particularly fogged for the life of him he could not see what there was to amuse anyone so much in the fact that a person who owed five pounds was ready to pay it back it was an occasion for rejoicing perhaps but rather for a solemn thankful eyesraisedtoheaven kind of rejoicing  whats up he asked  five pounds  you might tell us the joke  mr barley opened the letter read it and had another attack when this was finished he handed the letter to mike who was waiting patiently by hoping for light and requested him to read it  dear dear chuckled mr barley five pounds they may teach you young gentlemen to talk latin and greek and whatnot at your school but it ud do a lot more good if theyd teach you how many beans make five it ud do a lot more good if theyd teach you to come in when it rained it ud do   mike was reading the letter  dear mr barley it ran  i send the £5 which i could not get before i hope it is in time because i dont want you to write to the headmaster i am sorry jane and john ate your wifes hat and the chicken and broke the vase  there was some more to the same effect it was signed tg jellicoe  what on earths it all about said mike finishing this curious document  mr barley slapped his leg why mr jellicoe keeps two dogs here i keep em for him till the young gentlemen go home for their holidays aberdeen terriers they are and as sharp as mustard mischief i believe you but love us they dont do no harm bite up an old shoe sometimes and such sort of things the other day last wednesday it were about ar parse five janeshes the worst of the two always up to it she isshe got hold of my old hat and had it in bits before you could say knife john upset a china vase in one of the bedrooms chasing a mouse and they got on the coffeeroom table and ate half a cold chicken what had been left there so i says to myself ill have a game with mr jellicoe over this and i sits down and writes off saying the little dogs have eaten a valuable hat and a chicken and what not and the damagell be five pounds and will he kindly remit same by saturday night at the latest or i write to his headmaster love us mr barley slapped his thigh he took it all in every wordand heres the five pounds in cash in this envelope here i havent had such a laugh since we got old tom raxley out of bed at twelve of a winters night by telling him his house was afire  it is not always easy to appreciate a joke of the practical order if one has been made even merely part victim of it mike as he reflected that he had been dragged out of his house in the middle of the night in contravention of all school rules and discipline simply in order to satisfy mr barleys sense of humor was more inclined to be abusive than mirthful running risks is all very well when they are necessary or if one chooses to run them for ones own amusement but to be placed in a dangerous position a position imperiling ones chance of going to the varsity is another matter altogether  but it is impossible to abuse the barley type of man barleys enjoyment of the whole thing was so honest and childlike probably it had given him the happiest quarter of an hour he had known for years since in fact the affair of old tom raxley it would have been cruel to damp the man  so mike laughed perfunctorily took back the envelope with the five pounds accepted a ginger beer and a plateful of biscuits and rode off on his return journey                                       mention has been made above of the difference which exists between getting into an inn after lockup and into a private house mike was to find this out for himself  his first act on arriving at sedleigh was to replace his bicycle in the shed this he accomplished with success it was pitchdark in the shed and as he wheeled his machine in his foot touched something on the floor without waiting to discover what this might be he leaned his bicycle against the wall went out and locked the door after which he ran across to outwoods  fortune had favored his undertaking by decreeing that a stout drainpipe should pass up the wall within a few inches of his and psmiths study on the first day of term it may be remembered he had wrenched away the wooden bar which bisected the window frame thus rendering exit and entrance almost as simple as they had been for wyatt during mikes first term at wrykyn  he proceeded to scale this water pipe  he had got about halfway up when a voice from somewhere below cried whos that    16  pursuit   these things are lifes little difficulties one can never tell precisely how one will act in a sudden emergency the right thing for mike to have done at this crisis was to have ignored the voice carried on up the water pipe and through the study window and gone to bed it was extremely unlikely that anybody could have recognized him at night against the dark background of the house the position then would have been that somebody in mr outwoods house had been seen breaking in after lightsout but it would have been very difficult for the authorities to have narrowed the search down any further than that there were thirtyfour boys in outwoods of whom about fourteen were much the same size and build as mike  the suddenness however of the call caused mike to lose his head he made the strategic error of sliding rapidly down the pipe and running  there were two gates to mr outwoods front garden the drive ran in a semicircle of which the house was the center it was from the righthand gate nearest to mr downings house that the voice had come and as mike came to the ground he saw a stout figure galloping toward him from that direction he bolted like a rabbit for the other gate as he did so his pursuer again gave tongue  oooooo yer was the exact remark  whereby mike recognized him as the school sergeant oooooo yer was that militant gentlemans habitual way of beginning a conversation  with this knowledge mike felt easier in his mind sergeant collard was a man of many fine qualities notably a talent for what he was wont to call spottn a mysterious gift which he exercised on the rifle range but he could not run there had been a time in his hot youth when he had sprinted like an untamed mustang in pursuit of volatile pathans in indian hill wars but time increasing his girth had taken from him the taste for such exercise when he moved now it was at a stately walk the fact that he ran tonight showed how the excitement of the chase had entered into his blood  oooooo yer he shouted again as mike passing through the gate turned into the road that led to the school mikes attentive ear noted that the bright speech was a shade more puffily delivered this time he began to feel that this was not such bad fun after all he would have liked to be in bed but if that was out of the question this was certainly the nextbest thing  he ran on taking things easily with the sergeant panting in his wake till he reached the entrance to the school grounds he dashed in and took cover behind a tree  presently the sergeant turned the corner going badly and evidently cured of a good deal of the fever of the chase mike heard him toil on for a few yards and then stop a sound of panting was borne to him  then the sound of footsteps returning this time at a walk they passed the gate and went on down the road  the pursuer had given the thing up  mike waited for several minutes behind his tree his program now was simple he would give sergeant collard about half an hour in case the latter took it into his head to guard home by waiting at the gate then he would trot softly back shoot up the water pipe once more and so to bed it had just struck a quarter to somethingtwelve he supposedon the school clock he would wait till a quarter past  meanwhile there was nothing to be gained from lurking behind a tree he left his cover and started to stroll in the direction of the pavilion having arrived there he sat on the steps looking out onto the cricket field  his thoughts were miles away at wrykyn when he was recalled to sedleigh by the sound of somebody running focusing his gaze he saw a dim figure moving rapidly across the cricket field straight for him  his first impression that he had been seen and followed disappeared as the runner instead of making for the pavilion turned aside and stopped at the door of the bicycle shed like mike he was evidently possessed of a key for mike heard it grate in the lock at this point he left the pavilion and hailed his fellow rambler by night in a cautious undertone  the other appeared startled  who the dickens is that he asked is that you jackson  mike recognized adairs voice the last person he would have expected to meet at midnight obviously on the point of going for a bicycle ride  what are you doing out here jackson  what are you if it comes to that  adair was adjusting his front light  im going for the doctor one of the chaps in our house is bad  oh  what are you doing out here  just been for a stroll  hadnt you better be getting back  plenty of time  i suppose you think youre doing something tremendously brave and dashing  hadnt you better be going to the doctor  if you want to know what i think  i dont so long  mike turned away whistling between his teeth after a moments pause adair rode off mike saw his light pass across the field and through the gate the school clock struck the quarter  it seemed to mike that sergeant collard even if he had started to wait for him at the house would not keep up the vigil for more than half an hour he would be safe now in trying for home again  he walked in that direction  now it happened that mr downing aroused from his first sleep by the news conveyed to him by adair that macphee one of the junior members of adairs dormitory was groaning and exhibiting other symptoms of acute illness was disturbed in his mind most housemasters feel uneasy in the event of illness in their houses and mr downing was apt to get jumpy beyond the ordinary on such occasions all that was wrong with macphee as a matter of fact was a very fair stomachache the direct and legitimate result of eating six buns half a coconut three doughnuts two ices an apple and a pound of cherries and washing the lot down with tea but mr downing saw in his attack the beginnings of some deadly scourge which would sweep through and decimate the house he had dispatched adair for the doctor and after spending a few minutes prowling restlessly about his room was now standing at his front gate waiting for adairs return  it came about therefore that mike sprinting lightly in the direction of home and safety had his already shaken nerves further maltreated by being hailed at a range of about two yards with a cry of is that you adair the next moment mr downing emerged from his gate  mike stood not upon the order of his going he was off like an arrowa flying figure of guilt mr downing after the first surprise seemed to grasp the situation ejaculating at intervals the words who is that stop who is that stop he dashed after the muchenduring wrykynian at an extremely creditable rate of speed mr downing was by way of being a sprinter he had won handicap events at college sports at oxford and if mike had not got such a good start the race might have been over in the first fifty yards as it was that victim of fate going well kept ahead at the entrance to the school grounds he led by a dozen yards the procession passed into the field mike heading as before for the pavilion  as they raced across the soft turf an idea occurred to mike which he was accustomed in after years to attribute to genius the one flash of it which had ever illumined his life  it was this  one of mr downings first acts on starting the fire brigade at sedleigh had been to institute an alarm bell it had been rubbed into the school officiallyin speeches from the daisby the headmaster and unofficiallyin earnest private conversationsby mr downing that at the sound of this bell at whatever hour of day or night every member of the school must leave his house in the quickest possible way and make for the open the bell might mean that the school was on fire or it might mean that one of the houses was on fire in any case the school had its ordersto get out into the open at once  nor must it be supposed that the school was without practice at this feat every now and then a notice would be found posted up on the board to the effect that there would be fire drill during the dinner hour that day sometimes the performance was bright and interesting as on the occasion when mr downing marshaling the brigade at his front gate had said my house is supposed to be on fire now lets do a record which the brigade headed by stone and robinson obligingly did they fastened the hose to the hydrant smashed a window on the ground floor mr downing having retired for a moment to talk with the headmaster and poured a stream of water into the room when mr downing was at liberty to turn his attention to the matter he found that the room selected was his private study most of the light furniture of which was floating in a miniature lake that episode had rather discouraged his passion for realism and fire drill since then had taken the form for the most part of practicing escaping this was done by means of canvas chutes kept in the dormitories at the sound of the bell the prefect of the dormitory would heave one end of the chute out of the window the other end being fastened to the sill he would then go down it himself using his elbows as a brake then the second man would follow his example and these two standing below would hold the end of the chute so that the rest of the dormitory could fly rapidly down it without injury except to their digestions  after the first novelty of the thing had worn off the school had taken a rooted dislike to fire drill it was a matter for selfcongratulation among them that mr downing had never been able to induce the headmaster to allow the alarm bell to be sounded for fire drill at night the headmaster a man who had his views on the amount of sleep necessary for the growing boy had drawn the line at night operations sufficient unto the day had been the gist of his reply if the alarm bell were to ring at night when there was no fire the school might mistake a genuine alarm of fire for a bogus one and refuse to hurry themselves  so mr downing had had to be content with day drill  the alarm bell hung in the archway leading into the school grounds the end of the rope when not in use was fastened to a hook halfway up the wall  mike as he raced over the cricket field made up his mind in a flash that his only chance of getting out of this tangle was to shake his pursuer off for a space of time long enough to enable him to get to the rope and tug it then the school would come out he would mix with them and in the subsequent confusion get back to bed unnoticed  the task was easier than it would have seemed at the beginning of the chase mr downing owing to the two facts that he was not in the strictest training and that it is only a bannister who can run for any length of time at top speed shouting who is that stop who is that stop was beginning to feel distressed there were bellows to mend in the downing camp mike perceived this and forced the pace he rounded the pavilion ten yards to the good then heading for the gate he put all he knew into one last sprint mr downing was not equal to the effort he worked gamely for a few strides then fell behind when mike reached the gate a good forty yards separated them  as far as mike could judgehe was not in a condition to make nice calculationshe had about four seconds in which to get busy with that bell rope  probably nobody has ever crammed more energetic work into four seconds than he did then  the night was as still as only an english summer night can be and the first clang of the clapper sounded like a million iron girders falling from a height onto a sheet of tin he tugged away furiously with an eye on the now rapidly advancing and loudly shouting figure of the housemaster  and from the darkened house beyond there came a gradually swelling hum as if a vast hive of bees had been disturbed  the school was awake    17  the decoration of sammy   psmith leaned against the mantelpiece in the senior day room at outwoodssince mikes innings against downings the lost lambs had been received as brothers by the center of disorder so that even spiller was compelled to look on the hatchet as buriedand gave his views on the events of the preceding night or rather of that morning for it was nearer one than twelve when peace had once more fallen on the school  nothing that happens in this loony bin said psmith has power to surprise me now there was a time when i might have thought it a little unusual to have to leave the house through a canvas chute at one oclock in the morning but i suppose its quite the regular thing here old school tradition etc men leave the school and find that theyve got so accustomed to jumping out of windows that they look on it as a sort of affectation to go out by the door i suppose none of you merchants can give me any idea when the next knockabout entertainment of this kind is likely to take place  i wonder who rang that bell said stone jolly sporting idea  i believe it was downing himself if it was i hope hes satisfied  jellicoe who was appearing in society supported by a stick looked meaningly at mike and giggled receiving in answer a stony stare mike had informed jellicoe of the details of his interview with mr barley at the white boar and jellicoe after a momentary splutter of wrath against the practical joker was now in a particular lighthearted mood he hobbled about giggling at nothing and at peace with all the world  it was a stirring scene said psmith the agility with which comrade jellicoe boosted himself down the chute was a triumph of mind over matter he seemed to forget his ankle it was the nearest thing to a boneless acrobatic wonder that i have ever seen  i was in a beastly funk i can tell you  stone gurgled  so was i he said for a bit then when i saw that it was all a rag i began to look about for ways of doing the thing really well i emptied about six jugs of water on a gang of kids under my window  i rushed into downings and ragged some of the beds said robinson  it was an invigorating time said psmith a sort of pageant i was particularly struck with the way some of the bright lads caught hold of the idea there was no skimping some of the kids to my certain knowledge went down the chute a dozen times theres nothing like doing a thing thoroughly i saw them come down rush upstairs and be saved again time after time the thing became chronic with them i should say comrade downing ought to be satisfied with the high state of efficiency to which he has brought us at any rate i hope  there was a sound of hurried footsteps outside the door and sharpe a member of the senior day room burst excitedly in he seemed amused  i say have you chaps seen sammy  seen who said stone sammy why  youll know in a second hes just outside here sammy sammy sammy sam sam  a bark and a patter of feet outside  come on sammy good dog  there was a moments silence then a great yell of laughter burst forth even psmiths massive calm was shattered as for jellicoe he sobbed in a corner  sammys beautiful white coat was almost entirely concealed by a thick covering of brightred paint his head with the exception of the ears was untouched and his serious friendly eyes seemed to emphasise the weirdness of his appearance he stood in the doorway barking and wagging his tail plainly puzzled at his reception he was a popular dog and was always well received when he visited any of the houses but he had never before met with enthusiasm like this  good old sammy  what on earths been happening to him  who did it  sharpe the introducer had no views on the matter  i found him outside downings with a crowd round him everybody seems to have seen him i wonder who on earth has gone and mucked him up like that  mike was the first to show any sympathy for the maltreated animal  poor old sammy he said kneeling on the floor beside the victim and scratching him under the ear what a beastly shame itll take hours to wash all that off him and hell hate it  it seems to me said psmith regarding sammy dispassionately through his eyeglass that its not a case for mere washing theyll either have to skin him bodily or leave the thing to time time the great healer in a year or two hell fade to a delicate pink i dont see why you shouldnt have a pink bull terrier it would lend a touch of distinction to the place crowds would come in excursion trains to see him by charging a small fee you might make him selfsupporting i think ill suggest it to comrade downing  therell be a row about this said stone  rows are rather sport when youre not mixed up in them said robinson philosophically therell be another if we dont start off for chapel soon its a quarter to  there was a general move mike was the last to leave the room as he was going jellicoe stopped him jellicoe was staying in that sunday owing to his ankle  i say said jellicoe i just wanted to thank you again about that  oh thats all right  no but it really was awfully decent of you you might have got into a frightful row were you nearly caught  jolly nearly  it was you who rang the bell wasnt it  yes it was but for goodness sake dont go gassing about it or somebody will get to hear who oughtnt to and i shall be sacked  all right but i say you are a chap  whats the matter now  i mean about sammy you know its a jolly good score off old downing hell be frightfully sick  sammy cried mike my good man you dont think i did that do you what absolute rot i never touched the poor brute  oh all right said jellicoe but i wasnt going to tell anyone of course  what do you mean  you are a chap giggled jellicoe  mike walked to chapel rather thoughtfully    18  mr downing on the scent   there was just one moment the moment in which on going down to the junior day room of his house to quell an unseemly disturbance he was boisterously greeted by a vermilion bull terrier when mr downing was seized with a hideous fear lest he had lost his senses glaring down at the crimson animal that was pawing at his knees he clutched at his reason for one second as a drowning man clutches at a life belt  then the happy laughter of the young onlookers reassured him  who he shouted who has done this  please sir we dont know shrilled the chorus  please sir he came in like that  please sir we were sitting here when he suddenly ran in all red  a voice from the crowd look at old sammy  the situation was impossible there was nothing to be done he could not find out by verbal inquiry who had painted the dog the possibility of sammy being painted red during the night had never occurred to mr downing and now that the thing had happened he had no scheme of action as psmith would have said he had confused the unusual with the impossible and the result was that he was taken by surprise  while he was pondering on this the situation was rendered still more difficult by sammy who taking advantage of the door being open escaped and rushed into the road thus publishing his condition to all and sundry you can hush up a painted dog while it confines itself to your own premises but once it has mixed with the great public this becomes out of the question sammys state advanced from a private trouble into a row mr downings next move was in the same direction that sammy had taken only instead of running about the road he went straight to the headmaster  the head who had had to leave his house in the small hours in his pajamas and a dressing gown was not in the best of tempers he had a cold in the head and also a rooted conviction that mr downing in spite of his strict orders had rung the bell himself on the previous night in order to test the efficiency of the school in saving themselves in the event of fire he received the housemaster frostily but thawed as the latter related the events which had led up to the ringing of the bell  dear me he said deeply interested one of the boys at the school you think  i am certain of it said mr downing  was he wearing a school cap  he was bareheaded a boy who breaks out of his house at night would hardly run the risk of wearing a distinguishing cap  no no i suppose not a big boy you say  very big  you did not see his face  it was dark and he never looked backhe was in front of me all the time  dear me  there is another matter   yes  this boy whoever he was had done something before he rang the bellhe had painted my dog sampson red  the headmasters eyes protruded from their sockets hehewhat mr downing  he painted my dog redbright red mr downing was too angry to see anything humorous in the incident since the previous night he had been wounded in his tenderest feelings his fire brigade system had been most shamefully abused by being turned into a mere instrument in the hands of a malefactor for escaping justice and his dog had been held up to ridicule to all the world he did not want to smile he wanted revenge  the headmaster on the other hand did want to smile it was not his dog he could look on the affair with an unbiased eye and to him there was something ludicrous in a white dog suddenly appearing as a red dog  it is a scandalous thing said mr downing  quite so quite so said the headmaster hastily i shall punish the boy who did it most severely i will speak to the school in the hall after chapel  which he did but without result a cordial invitation to the criminal to come forward and be executed was received in wooden silence by the school with the exception of johnson iii of outwoods who suddenly reminded of sammys appearance by the headmasters words broke into a wild screech of laughter and was instantly awarded two hundred lines  the school filed out of the hall to their various lunches and mr downing was left with the conviction that if he wanted the criminal discovered he would have to discover him for himself  the great thing in affairs of this kind is to get a good start and fate feeling perhaps that it had been a little hard upon mr downing gave him a most magnificent start instead of having to hunt for a needle in a haystack he found himself in a moment in the position of being set to find it in a mere truss of straw  it was mr outwood who helped him sergeant collard had waylaid the archaeological expert on his way to chapel and informed him that at close on twelve the night before he had observed a youth unidentified attempting to get into his house via the water pipe mr outwood whose thoughts were occupied with apses and plinths not to mention cromlechs at the time thanked the sergeant with absent minded politeness and passed on later he remembered the fact apropos of some reflections on the subject of burglars in medieval england and passed it on to mr downing as they walked back to lunch  then the boy was in your house exclaimed mr downing  not actually in as far as i understand i gather from the sergeant that he interrupted him before  i mean he must have been one of the boys in your house  but what was he doing out at that hour  he had broken out  impossible i think oh yes quite impossible i went around the dormitories as usual at eleven oclock last night and all the boys were asleepall of them  mr downing was not listening he was in a state of suppressed excitement and exultation which made it hard for him to attend to his colleagues slow utterances he had a clue now that the search had narrowed itself down to outwoods house the rest was comparatively easy perhaps sergeant collard had actually recognized the boy on reflection he dismissed this as unlikely for the sergeant would scarcely have kept a thing like that to himself but he might very well have seen more of him than he downing had seen it was only with an effort that he could keep himself from rushing to the sergeant then and there and leaving the house lunch to look after itself he resolved to go the moment that meal was at an end  sunday lunch at a publicschool house is probably one of the longest functions in existence it drags its slow length along like a languid snake but it finishes in time in due course mr downing after sitting still and eyeing with acute dislike everybody who asked for a second helping found himself at liberty  regardless of the claims of digestion he rushed forth on the trail  sergeant collard lived with his wife and a family of unknown dimensions in the lodge at the school front gate dinner was just over when mr downing arrived as a blind man could have told  the sergeant received his visitor with dignity ejecting the family who were torpid after roast beef and resented having to move in order to ensure privacy  having requested his host to smoke which the latter was about to do unasked mr downing stated his case  mr outwood he said tells me that last night sergeant you saw a boy endeavoring to enter his house  the sergeant blew a cloud of smoke oooooo yer he said i did sirspotted im i did feeflee good at spottin i am sir dook of connaught he used to say ere comes sergeant collard e used to say es feeflee good at spottin  what did you do  do oooooo i shouts oooooo yer yer young monkey what yer doin there  yes  but e was off in a flash and i doubles after im prompt  but you didnt catch him  no sir admitted the sergeant reluctantly  did you catch sight of his face sergeant  no sir e was doublin away in the opposite direction  did you notice anything at all about his appearance  e was a long young chap sir with a pair of legs on himfeeflee fast e run sir oooooo feeflee  you noticed nothing else  e wasnt wearing no cap of any sort sir  ah  bareeaded sir added the sergeant rubbing the point in  it was undoubtedly the same boy undoubtedly i wish you could have caught a glimpse of his face sergeant  so do i sir  you would not be able to recognize him again if you saw him you think  oooooo wouldnt go as far as to say that sir cos yer see im feeflee good at spottin but it was a dark night  mr downing rose to go  well he said the search is now considerably narrowed down considerably it is certain that the boy was one of the boys in mr outwoods house  young monkeys interjected the sergeant helpfully  good afternoon sergeant  good afternoon to you sir  pray do not move sergeant  the sergeant had not shown the slightest inclination of doing anything of the kind  i will find my way out very hot today is it not  feeflee warm sir weathers goin to break workin up for thunder  i hope not the school plays the mcc on wednesday and it would be a pity if rain were to spoil our first fixture with them good afternoon  and mr downing went out into the baking sunlight while sergeant collard having requested mrs collard to take the children out for a walk at once and furthermore to give young ernie a clip side of the ead if he persisted in making so much noise put a handkerchief over his face rested his feet on the table and slept the sleep of the just    19  the sleuthhound   for the doctor watsons of this world as opposed to the sherlock holmeses success in the province of detective work must be to a very large extent the result of luck sherlock holmes can extract a clue from a wisp of straw or a flake of cigar ash but doctor watson has got to have it taken out for him and dusted and exhibited clearly with a label attached  the average man is a doctor watson we are wont to scoff in a patronizing manner at that humbler follower of the great investigator but as a matter of fact we should have been just as dull ourselves we should not even have risen to the modest level of a scotland yard bungler we should simply have hung around saying my dear holmes how and all the rest of it just as the downtrodden medico did  it is not often that the ordinary person has any need to see what he can do in the way of detection he gets along very comfortably in the humdrum round of life without having to measure footprints and smile quiet tightlipped smiles but if ever the emergency does arise he thinks naturally of sherlock holmes and his methods  mr downing had read all the holmes stories with great attention and had thought many times what an incompetent ass doctor watson was but now that he had started to handle his own first case he was compelled to admit that there was a good deal to be said in extenuation of watsons inability to unravel tangles it certainly was uncommonly hard he thought as he paced the cricket field after leaving sergeant collard to detect anybody unless you knew who had really done the crime as he brooded over the case in hand his sympathy for doctor watson increased with every minute and he began to feel a certain resentment against sir arthur conan doyle it was all very well for sir arthur to be so shrewd and infallible about tracing a mystery to its source but he knew perfectly well who had done the thing before he started  now that he began really to look into this matter of the alarm bell and the painting of sammy the conviction was creeping over him that the problem was more difficult than a casual observer might imagine he had got as far as finding that his quarry of the previous night was a boy in mr outwoods house but how was he to get any further that was the thing there was of course only a limited number of boys in mr outwoods house as tall as the one he had pursued but even if there had been only one other it would have complicated matters if you go to a boy and say either you or jones were out of your house last night at twelve oclock the boy does not reply sir i cannot tell a liei was out of my house last night at twelve oclock he simply assumes the animated expression of a stuffed fish and leaves the next move to you it is practically stalemate  all these things passed through mr downings mind as he walked up and down the cricket field that afternoon  what he wanted was a clue but it is so hard for the novice to tell what is a clue and what isnt probably if he only knew there were clues lying all over the place shouting to him to pick them up  what with the oppressive heat of the day and the fatigue of hard thinking mr downing was working up for a brainstorm when fate once more intervened this time in the shape of riglett a junior member of his house  riglett slunk up in the shamefaced way peculiar to some boys even when they have done nothing wrong and having capped mr downing with the air of one who had been caught in the act of doing something particularly shady requested that he might be allowed to fetch his bicycle from the shed  your bicycle snapped mr downing much thinking had made him irritable what do you want with your bicycle  riglett shuffled stood first on his left foot then on his right blushed and finally remarked as if it were not so much a sound reason as a sort of feeble excuse for the low and blackguardly fact that he wanted his bicycle that he had got leave for tea that afternoon  then mr downing remembered riglett had an aunt resident about three miles from the school whom he was accustomed to visit occasionally on sunday afternoons during the term  he felt for his bunch of keys and made his way to the shed riglett shambling behind at an interval of two yards  mr downing unlocked the door and there on the floor was the clue  a clue that even doctor watson could not have overlooked  mr downing saw it but did not immediately recognize it for what it was what he saw at first was not a clue but just a mess he had a tidy soul and abhorred messes and this was a particularly messy mess the greater part of the flooring in the neighborhood of the door was a sea of red paint the tin from which it had flowed was lying on its side in the middle of the shed the air was full of the pungent scent  pah said mr downing  then suddenly beneath the disguise of the mess he saw the clue a footmark no less a crimson footmark on the gray concrete  riglett who had been waiting patiently two yards away now coughed plaintively the sound recalled mr downing to mundane matters  get your bicycle riglett he said and be careful where you tread somebody has upset a pot of paint on the floor  riglett walking delicately through dry places extracted his bicycle from the rack and presently departed to gladden the heart of his aunt leaving mr downing his brain fizzing with the enthusiasm of the detective to lock the door and resume his perambulation of the cricket field  give doctor watson a fair start and he is a demon at the game mr downings brain was now working with a rapidity and clearness which a professional sleuth might have envied  paint red paint obviously the same paint with which sammy had been decorated a footmark whose footmark plainly that of the criminal who had done the deed of decoration  yoicks  there were two things however to be considered your careful detective must consider everything in the first place the paint might have been upset by the groundsman it was the groundsmans paint he had been giving a fresh coating to the woodwork in front of the pavilion scoring box at the conclusion of yesterdays match a labor of love which was the direct outcome of the enthusiasm for work which adair had instilled into him in that case the footmark might be his  note one interview the groundsman on this point  in the second place adair might have upset the tin and trodden in its contents when he went to get his bicycle in order to fetch the doctor for the suffering macphee this was the more probable of the two contingencies for it would have been dark in the shed when adair went into it  note two interview adair as to whether he found on returning to the house that there was paint on his shoes  things were moving                                       he resolved to take adair first he could get the groundsmans address from him  passing by the trees under whose shade mike and psmith and dunster had watched the match on the previous day he came upon the head of his house in a deck chair reading a book a summer sunday afternoon is the time for reading in deck chairs  oh adair he said no dont get up i merely wished to ask you if you found any paint on your shoes when you returned to the house last night  paint sir adair was plainly puzzled his book had been interesting and had driven the sammy incident out of his head  i see somebody has spilled some paint on the floor of the bicycle shed you did not do that i suppose when you went to fetch your bicycle  no sir  it is spilled all over the floor i wondered whether you had happened to tread in it but you say you found no paint on your shoes this morning  no sir my bicycle is always quite near the door of the shed i didnt go into the shed at all  i see quite so thank you adair oh by the way adair where does markby live  i forget the name of his cottage sir but i could show you in a second its one of those cottages just past the school gates on the right as you turn out into the road there are three in a row his is the first you come to theres a barn just before you get to them  thank you i shall be able to find them i should like to speak to markby for a moment on a small matter  a sharp walk took him to the cottages adair had mentioned he rapped at the door of the first and the groundsman came out in his shirt sleeves blinking as if he had just waked up as was indeed the case  oh markby  sir  you remember that you were painting the scoring box in the pavilion last night after the match  yes sir it wanted a lick of paint bad the young gentlemen will scramble about and get through the window makes it look shabby sir so i thought id better give it a coating so as to look shipshape when the marylebone come down  just so an excellent idea tell me markby what did you do with the pot of paint when you had finished  put it in the bicycle shed sir  on the floor  on the floor sir no on the shelf at the far end with the can of whitening what i use for marking out the wickets sir  of course yes quite so just as i thought  do you want it sir  no thank you markby no thank you the fact is somebody who had no business to do so has moved the pot of paint from the shelf to the floor with the result that it has been kicked over and spilled you had better get some more tomorrow thank you markby that is all i wished to know  mr downing walked back to the school thoroughly excited he was hot on the scent now the only other possible theories had been tested and successfully exploded the thing had become simple to a degree all he had to do was to go to mr outwoods housethe idea of searching a fellow masters house did not appear to him at all a delicate task somehow one grew unconsciously to feel that mr outwood did not really exist as a man capable of resenting libertiesfind the paintsplashed shoe ascertain its owner and denounce him to the headmaster there could be no doubt that a paintsplashed shoe must be in mr outwoods house somewhere a boy cannot tread in a pool of paint without showing some signs of having done so it was sunday too so that the shoe would not yet have been cleaned yoicks also tallyho this really was beginning to be something like business  regardless of the heat the sleuthhound hurried across to outwoods as fast as he could walk    20  a check   the only two members of the house not out in the grounds when he arrived were mike and psmith they were standing on the gravel drive in front of the boys entrance mike had a deck chair in one hand and a book in the other psmithfor even the greatest minds will sometimes unbendwas wrestling with a yoyo that is to say he was trying without success to keep the spool spinning he smoothed a crease out of his waistcoat and tried again he had just succeeded in getting the thing to spin when mr downing arrived the sound of his footsteps disturbed psmith and brought the effort to nothing  enough of this spoolery said he flinging the spool through the open window of the senior day room i was an ass ever to try it the philosophical mind needs complete repose in its hours of leisure hello  he stared after the sleuthhound who had just entered the house  what the dickens said mike does he mean by barging in as if hed bought the place  comrade downing looks pleased with himself what brings him around in this direction i wonder still no matter the few articles which he may sneak from our study are of inconsiderable value he is welcome to them do you feel inclined to wait awhile till i have fetched a chair and book  ill be going on i shall be under the trees at the far end of the ground  tis well i will be with you in about two ticks  mike walked on toward the field and psmith strolling upstairs to fetch his novel found mr downing standing in the passage with the air of one who has lost his bearings  a warm afternoon sir murmured psmith courteously as he passed  ersmith  sir  ierwish to go round the dormitories  it was psmiths guiding rule in life never to be surprised at anything so he merely inclined his head gracefully and said nothing  i should be glad if you would fetch the keys and show me where the rooms are  with acute pleasure sir said psmith or shall i fetch mr outwood sir  do as i tell you smith snapped mr downing  psmith said no more but went down to the matrons room the matron being out he abstracted the bunch of keys from her table and rejoined the master  shall i lead the way sir he asked  mr downing nodded  here sir said psmith opening the door we have barness dormitory an airy room constructed on the soundest hygienic principles each boy i understand has quite a considerable number of cubic feet of air all to himself it is mr outwoods boast that no boy has ever asked for a cubic foot of air in vain he argues justly  he broke off abruptly and began to watch the others maneuvers in silence mr downing was peering rapidly beneath each bed in turn  are you looking for barnes sir inquired psmith politely i think hes out in the field  mr downing rose having examined the last bed crimson in the face with the exercise  show me the next dormitory smith he said panting slightly  this said psmith opening the next door and sinking his voice to an awed whisper is where i sleep  mr downing glanced swiftly beneath the three beds  excuse me sir said psmith but are we chasing anything  be good enough smith said mr downing with asperity to keep your remarks to yourself  i was only wondering sir shall i show you the next in order  certainly  they moved on up the passage  drawing blank at the last dormitory mr downing paused baffled psmith waited patiently by an idea struck the master  the studies smith he cried  aha said psmith i beg your pardon sir the observation escaped me unawares the frenzy of the chase is beginning to enter into my blood here we have  mr downing stopped short  is this impertinence studied smith  fergusons study sir no sir thats farther down the passage this is barness  mr downing looked at him closely psmiths face was wooden in its gravity the master snorted suspiciously then moved on  whose is this he asked rapping a door  this sir is mine and jacksons  what have you a study you are low down in the school for it  i think sir that mr outwood gave it us rather as a testimonial to our general worth than to our proficiency in schoolwork  mr downing raked the room with a keen eye the absence of bars from the window attracted his attention  have you no bars to your windows here such as there are in my house  there appears to be no bar sir said psmith putting up his eyeglass  mr downing was leaning out of the window  a lovely view is it not sir said psmith the trees the field the distant hills   mr downing suddenly started his eye had been caught by the water pipe at the side of the window the boy whom sergeant collard had seen climbing the pipe must have been making for this study  he spun around and met psmiths blandly inquiring gaze he looked at psmith carefully for a moment no the boy he had chased last night had not been psmith that exquisites figure and general appearance were unmistakable even in the dusk  whom did you say you shared this study with smith  jackson sir the cricketer  never mind about his cricket smith said mr downing with irritation  no sir  he is the only other occupant of the room  yes sir  nobody else comes into it  if they do they go out extremely quickly sir  ah thank you smith  not at all sir  mr downing pondered jackson the boy bore him a grudge the boy was precisely the sort of boy to revenge himself by painting the dog sammy and gadzooks the boy whom he had pursued last night had been just about jacksons size and build  mr downing was as firmly convinced at that moment that mikes had been the hand to wield the paintbrush as he had ever been of anything in his life  smith he said excitedly  on the spot sir said psmith affably  where are jacksons shoes  there are moments when the giddy excitement of being right on the trail causes the amateur or watsonian detective to be incautious such a moment came to mr downing then if he had been wise he would have achieved his object the getting a glimpse of mikes shoes by a devious and snaky route as it was he rushed straight on  his shoes sir he has them on i noticed them as he went out just now  where is the pair he wore yesterday  where are the shoes of yesteryear murmured psmith to himself i should say at a venture sir that they would be in the basket downstairs edmund our genial knifeandboot boy collects them i believe at early dawn  would they have been cleaned yet  if i know edmund sirno  smith said mr downing trembling with excitement go and bring that basket to me here  psmiths brain was working rapidly as he went downstairs what exactly was at the back of the sleuths mind prompting these maneuvers he did not know but that there was something and that that something was directed in a hostile manner against mike probably in connection with last nights wild happenings he was certain psmith had noticed on leaving his bed at the sound of the alarm bell that he and jellicoe were alone in the room that might mean that mike had gone out through the door when the bell sounded or it might mean that he had been out all the time it began to look as if the latter solution were the correct one  he staggered back with the basket painfully conscious all the while that it was creasing his waistcoat and dumped it down on the study floor mr downing stooped eagerly over it psmith leaned against the wall and straightened out the damaged garment  we have here sir he said a fair selection of our various bootings  mr downing looked up  you dropped none of the shoes on your way up smith  not one sir it was a fine performance  mr downing uttered a grunt of satisfaction and bent once more to his task shoes flew about the room mr downing knelt on the floor beside the basket and dug like a terrier at a rathole  at last he made a dive and with an exclamation of triumph rose to his feet in his hand he held a shoe  put those back again smith he said  the exetonian wearing an expression such as a martyr might have worn on being told off for the stake began to pick up the scattered footgear whistling softly the tune of i do all the dirty work as he did so  thats the lot sir he said rising  ah now come across with me to the headmasters house leave the basket here you can carry it back when you return  shall i put back that shoe sir  certainly not i shall take this with me of course  shall i carry it sir  mr downing reflected  yes smith he said i think it would be best  it occurred to him that the spectacle of a house master wandering abroad on the public highway carrying a dirty shoe might be a trifle undignified you never knew whom you might meet on sunday afternoon  psmith took the shoe and doing so understood what before had puzzled him  across the toe of the shoe was a broad splash of red paint  he knew nothing of course of the upset tin in the bicycle shed but when a housemasters dog has been painted red in the night and when on the following day the housemaster goes about in search of a paint splashed shoe one puts two and two together psmith looked at the name inside the shoe it was brown bootmaker bridgnorth bridgnorth was only a few miles from his own home and mikes undoubtedly it was mikes shoe  can you tell me whose shoe that is asked mr downing  psmith looked at it again  no sir i cant say the little chaps familiar to me  come with me then  mr downing left the room after a moment psmith followed him  the headmaster was in his garden thither mr downing made his way the shoebearing psmith in close attendance  the head listened to the amateur detectives statement with interest  indeed he said when mr downing had finished indeed dear me it certainly seems  it is a curiously wellconnected thread of evidence you are certain that there was red paint on this shoe you discovered in mr outwoods house  i have it with me i brought it on purpose to show to you smith  sir  you have the shoe  ah said the headmaster putting on a pair of pincenez now let me look atthis you say is the just so just so just  but er mr downing it may be that i have not examined this shoe with sufficient care butcan you point out to me exactly where this paint is that you speak of  mr downing stood staring at the shoe with a wild fixed stare of any suspicion of paint red or otherwise it was absolutely and entirely innocent    21  the destroyer of evidence   the shoe became the center of attention the cynosure of all eyes mr downing fixed it with the piercing stare of one who feels that his brain is tottering the headmaster looked at it with a mildly puzzled expression psmith putting up his eyeglass gazed at it with a sort of affectionate interest as if he were waiting for it to do a trick of some kind  mr downing was the first to break the silence  there was paint on this shoe he said vehemently i tell you there was a splash of red paint across the toe smith will bear me out in this smith you saw the paint on this shoe  paint sir  what do you mean to tell me that you did not see it  no sir there was no paint on this shoe  this is foolery i saw it with my own eyes it was a broad splash right across the toe  the headmaster interposed  you must have made a mistake mr downing there is certainly no trace of paint on this shoe these momentary optical delusions are i fancy not uncommon any doctor will tell you  i had an aunt sir said psmith chattily who was remarkably subject  it is absurd i cannot have been mistaken said mr downing i am positively certain the toe of this shoe was red when i found it  it is undoubtedly black now mr downing  a sort of chameleon shoe murmured psmith  the goaded housemaster turned on him  what did you say smith  did i speak sir said psmith with the start of one coming suddenly out of a trance  mr downing looked searchingly at him  you had better be careful smith  yes sir  i strongly suspect you of having something to do with this  really mr downing said the headmaster this is surely improbable smith could scarcely have cleaned the shoe on his way to my house on one occasion i inadvertently spilled some paint on a shoe of my own i can assure you that it does not brush off it needs a very systematic cleaning before all traces are removed  exactly sir said psmith my theory if i may  certainly smith  psmith bowed courteously and proceeded  my theory sir is that mr downing was deceived by the lightandshade effects on the toe of the shoe the afternoon sun streaming in through the window must have shone on the shoe in such a manner as to give it a momentary and fictitious aspect of redness if mr downing recollects he did not look long at the shoe the picture on the retina of the eye consequently had not time to fade i remember thinking myself at the moment that the shoe appeared to have a certain reddish tint the mistake  bag said mr downing shortly  well really said the headmaster it seems to me that that is the only explanation that will square with the facts a shoe that is really smeared with red paint does not become black of itself in the course of a few minutes  you are very right sir said psmith with benevolent approval may i go now sir i am in the middle of a singularly impressive passage of ciceros speech de senectute  i am sorry that you should leave your preparation till sunday smith it is a habit of which i altogether disapprove  i am reading it sir said psmith with simple dignity for pleasure shall i take the shoe with me sir  if mr downing does not want it  the housemaster passed the fraudulent piece of evidence to psmith without a word and the latter having included both masters in a kindly smile left the garden  pedestrians who had the good fortune to be passing along the road between the headmasters house and mr outwoods at that moment saw what if they had but known it was a most unusual sight the spectacle of psmith running psmiths usual mode of progression was a dignified walk he believed in the contemplative style rather than the hustling  on this occasion however reckless of possible injuries to the crease of his trousers he raced down the road and turning in at outwoods gate bounded upstairs like a highly trained professional athlete  on arriving at the study his first act was to remove a shoe from the top of the pile in the basket place it in the small cupboard under the bookshelf and lock the cupboard then he flung himself into a chair and panted  brain he said to himself approvingly is what one chiefly needs in matters of this kind without brain where are we in the soup every time the next development will be when comrade downing thinks it over and is struck with the brilliant idea that its just possible that the shoe he gave me to carry and the shoe i did carry were not one shoe but two shoes meanwhile   he dragged up another chair for his feet and picked up his novel  he had not been reading long when there was a footstep in the passage and mr downing appeared  the possibility in fact the probability of psmiths having substituted another shoe for the one with the incriminating splash of paint on it had occurred to him almost immediately on leaving the headmasters garden psmith and mike he reflected were friends psmiths impulse would be to do all that lay in his power to shield mike feeling aggrieved with himself that he had not thought of this before he too hurried over to outwoods  mr downing was brisk and peremptory  i wish to look at these shoes again he said psmith with a sigh laid down his novel and rose to assist him  sit down smith said the housemaster i can manage without your help  psmith sat down again carefully tucking up the knees of his trousers and watched him with silent interest through his eyeglass  the scrutiny irritated mr downing  put that thing away smith he said  that thing sir  yes that ridiculous glass put it away  why sir  why because i tell you to do so  i guessed that that was the reason sir sighed psmith replacing the eyeglass in his waistcoat pocket he rested his elbows on his knees and his chin on his hands and resumed his contemplative inspection of the shoe expert who after fidgeting for a few moments lodged another complaint  dont sit there staring at me smith  i was interested in what you were doing sir  never mind dont stare at me in that idiotic way  may i read sir asked psmith patiently  yes read if you like  thank you sir  psmith took up his book again and mr downing now thoroughly irritated pursued his investigations in the boot basket  he went through it twice but each time without success after the second search he stood up and looked wildly round the room he was as certain as he could be of anything that the missing piece of evidence was somewhere in the study it was no use asking psmith pointblank where it was for psmiths ability to parry dangerous questions with evasive answers was quite out of the common  his eye roamed about the room there was very little cover there even for so small a fugitive as a number nine shoe the floor could be acquitted on sight of harboring the quarry  then he caught sight of the cupboard and something seemed to tell him that there was the place to look  smith he said  psmith had been reading placidly all the while  yes sir  what is in this cupboard  that cupboard sir  yes this cupboard mr downing rapped the door irritably  just a few odd trifles sir we do not often use it a ball of string perhaps possibly an old notebook nothing of value or interest  open it  i think you will find that it is locked sir  unlock it  but where is the key sir  have you not got the key  if the key is not in the lock sir you may depend upon it that it will take a long search to find it  where did you see it last  it was in the lock yesterday morning jackson might have taken it  where is jackson  out in the field somewhere sir  mr downing thought for a moment  i dont believe a word of it he said shortly i have my reasons for thinking that you are deliberately keeping the contents of that cupboard from me i shall break open the door  psmith got up  im afraid you mustnt do that sir  mr downing stared amazed  are you aware whom you are talking to smith he inquired icily  yes sir and i know its not mr outwood to whom that cupboard happens to belong if you wish to break it open you must get his permission he is the sole lessee and proprietor of that cupboard i am only the acting manager  mr downing paused he also reflected mr outwood in the general rule did not count much in the scheme of things but possibly there were limits to the treating of him as if he did not exist to enter his house without his permission and search it to a certain extent was all very well but when it came to breaking up his furniture perhaps  on the other hand there was the maddening thought that if he left the study in search of mr outwood in order to obtain his sanction for the housebreaking work which he proposed to carry through smith would be alone in the room and he knew that if smith were left alone in the room he would instantly remove the shoe to some other hiding place he thoroughly disbelieved the story of the lost key he was perfectly convinced that the missing shoe was in the cupboard  he stood chewing these thoughts for a while psmith in the meantime standing in a graceful attitude in front of the cupboard staring into vacancy  then he was seized with a happy idea why should he leave the room at all if he sent smith then he himself could wait and make certain that the cupboard was not tampered with  smith he said go and find mr outwood and ask him to be good enough to come here for a moment    22  mainly about shoes   be quick smith he said as the latter stood looking at him without making any movement in the direction of the door  quick sir said psmith meditatively as if he had been asked a conundrum  go and find mr outwood at once  psmith still made no move  do you intend to disobey me smith mr downings voice was steely  yes sir  what  yes sir  there was one of those youcouldhaveheardapindrop silences psmith was staring reflectively at the ceiling mr downing was looking as if at any moment he might say thwarted to me face ha ha and by a very stripling  it was psmith however who resumed the conversation his manner was almost too respectful which made it all the more a pity that what he said did not keep up the standard of docility  i take my stand he said on a technical point i say to myself mr downing is a man i admire as a human being and respect as a master in  this impertinence is doing you no good smith  psmith waved a hand deprecatingly  if you will let me explain sir i was about to say that in any other place but mr outwoods house your word would be law i would fly to do your bidding if you pressed a button i would do the rest but in mr outwoods house i cannot do anything except what pleases me or what is ordered by mr outwood i ought to have remembered that before one cannot he continued as who should say let us be reasonable one cannot to take a parallel case imagine the colonel commanding the garrison at a naval station going on board a battleship and ordering the crew to splice the jibboom spanker it might be an admirable thing for the empire that the jibboom spanker should be spliced at that particular juncture but the crew would naturally decline to move in the matter until the order came from the commander of the ship so in my case if you will go to mr outwood explain to him how matters stand and come back and say to me psmith mr outwood wishes you to ask him to be good enough to come to this study then i shall be only too glad to go and find him you see my difficulty sir  go and fetch mr outwood smith i shall not tell you again  psmith flicked a speck of dust from his coat sleeve  very well smith  i can assure you sir at any rate that if there is a shoe in that cupboard now there will be a shoe there when you return  mr downing stalked out of the room  but added psmith pensively to himself as the footsteps died away i did not promise that it would be the same shoe  he took the key from his pocket unlocked the cupboard and took out the shoe then he selected from the basket a particularly battered specimen placing this in the cupboard he relocked the door  his next act was to take from the shelf a piece of string attaching one end of this to the shoe that he had taken from the cupboard he went to the window his first act was to fling the cupboard key out into the bushes then he turned to the shoe on a level with the sill the water pipe up which mike had started to climb the night before was fastened to the wall by an iron band he tied the other end of the string to this and let the shoe swing free he noticed with approval when it had stopped swinging that it was hidden from above by the windowsill  he returned to his place at the mantelpiece  as an afterthought he took another shoe from the basket and thrust it up the chimney a shower of soot fell into the grate blackening his hand  the bathroom was a few yards down the corridor he went there and washed off the soot  when he returned mr downing was in the study and with him mr outwood the latter looking dazed as if he were not quite equal to the intellectual pressure of the situation  where have you been smith asked mr downing sharply  i have been washing my hands sir  hm said mr downing suspiciously  yes i saw smith go into the bathroom said mr outwood smith i cannot quite understand what it is mr downing wishes me to do  my dear outwood snapped the sleuth i thought i had made it perfectly clear where is the difficulty  i cannot understand why you should suspect smith of keeping his shoes in a cupboard and added mr outwood with spirit catching sight of a goodgracioushasthemannosense look on the others face why he should not do so if he wishes it  exactly sir said psmith approvingly you have touched the spot  if i must explain again my dear outwood will you kindly give me your attention for a moment last night a boy broke out of your house and painted my dog sampson red  he painted said mr outwood roundeyed why  i dont know why at any rate he did during the escapade one of his shoes was splashed with the paint it is that shoe which i believe smith to be concealing in this cupboard now do you understand  mr outwood looked amazedly at psmith and psmith shook his head sorrowfully at mr outwood psmiths expression said as plainly as if he had spoken the words we must humor him  so with your permission as smith declares that he has lost the key i propose to break open the door of this cupboard have you any objection  mr outwood started  objection none at all my dear fellow none at all let me see what is it you wish to do  this said mr downing shortly  there was a pair of dumbbells on the floor belonging to mike he never used them but they always managed to get themselves packed with the rest of his belongings on the last day of the holidays mr downing seized one of these and delivered two rapid blows at the cupboard door the wood splintered a third blow smashed the flimsy lock the cupboard with any skeletons it might contain was open for all to view  mr downing uttered a cry of triumph and tore the shoe from its resting place  i told you he said i told you  i wondered where that shoe had got to said psmith ive been looking for it for days  mr downing was examining his find he looked up with an exclamation of surprise and wrath  this shoe has no paint on it he said glaring at psmith this is not the shoe  it certainly appears sir said psmith sympathetically to be free from paint theres a sort of reddish glow just there if you look at it sideways he added helpfully  did you place that shoe there smith  i must have done then when i lost the key  are you satisfied now downing interrupted mr outwood with asperity or is there any more furniture you wish to break  the excitement of seeing his household goods smashed with a dumbbell had made the archaeological student quite a swashbuckler for the moment a little more and one could imagine him giving mr downing a good hard knock  the sleuthhound stood still for a moment baffled but his brain was working with the rapidity of a buzz saw a chance remark of mr outwoods set him fizzing off on the trail once more mr outwood had caught sight of the little pile of soot in the grate he bent down to inspect it  dear me he said i must remember to have the chimneys swept it should have been done before  mr downings eye rolling in a fine frenzy from heaven to earth from earth to heaven also focused itself on the pile of soot and a thrill went through him soot in the fireplace smith washing his hands you know my methods my dear watson apply them  mr downings mind at that moment contained one single thought and that thought was what ho for the chimney  he dived forward with a rush nearly knocking mr outwood off his feet and thrust an arm up into the unknown an avalanche of soot fell upon his hand and wrist but he ignored it for at the same instant his fingers had closed upon what he was seeking  ah he said i thought as much you were not quite clever enough after all smith  no sir said psmith patiently we all make mistakes  you would have done better smith not to have given me all this trouble you have done yourself no good by it  its been great fun though sir argued psmith  fun mr downing laughed grimly you may have reason to change your opinion of what constitutes  his voice failed as his eye fell on the allblack toe of the shoe he looked up and caught psmiths benevolent gaze he straightened himself and brushed a bead of perspiration from his face with the back of his hand unfortunately he used the sooty hand and the result was that he looked like a chimney sweep at work  didyouputthatshoethere smith he asked slowly  yes sir  then what did you mean by putting it there roared mr downing  animal spirits sir said psmith  what  animal spirits sir  what mr downing would have replied to this one cannot tell though one can guess roughly for just as he was opening his mouth mr outwood catching sight of his sootcovered countenance intervened  my dear downing he said your face it is positively covered with soot positively you must come and wash it you are quite black really you present a most curious appearance most let me show you the way to my room  in all times of storm and tribulation there comes a breaking point a point where the spirit definitely refuses to battle any longer against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune mr downing could not bear up against this crowning blow he went down beneath it in the language of the ring he took the count it was the knockout  soot he murmured weakly soot  your face is covered my dear fellow quite covered  it certainly has a faintly sooty aspect sir said psmith  his voice roused the sufferer to one last flicker of spirit  you will hear more of this smith he said i say you will hear more of it  then he allowed mr outwood to lead him out to a place where there were towels soap and sponges                                       when they had gone psmith went to the window and hauled in the string he felt the calm afterglow which comes to the general after a successfully conducted battle it had been trying of course for a man of refinement and it had cut into his afternoon but on the whole it had been worth it  the problem now was what to do with the painted shoe it would take a lot of cleaning he saw even if he could get hold of the necessary implements for cleaning it and he rather doubted if he would be able to do so edmund the bootboy worked in some mysterious cell far from the madding crowd at the back of the house in the boot cupboard downstairs there would probably be nothing likely to be of any use  his fears were realized the boot cupboard was empty it seemed to him that for the time being the best thing he could do would be to place the shoe in safe hiding until he would have thought out a scheme  having restored the basket to its proper place accordingly he went up to the study again and placed the redtoed shoe in the chimney at about the same height where mr downing had found the other nobody would think of looking there a second time and it was improbable that mr outwood really would have the chimneys swept as he had said the odds were that he had forgotten about it already  psmith went to the bathroom to wash his hands again with the feeling that he had done a good days work    23  on the trail again   the most massive minds are apt to forget things at times the most adroit plotters make their little mistakes psmith was no exception to the rule he made the mistake of not telling mike of the afternoons happenings  it was not altogether forgetfulness psmith was one of those people who like to carry through their operations entirely by themselves where there is only one in a secret the secret is more liable to remain unrevealed there was nothing he thought to be gained from telling mike he forgot what the consequences might be if he did not  so psmith kept his own counsel with the result that mike went over to school on the monday morning in gym shoes  edmund summoned from the hinterland of the house to give his opinion why only one of mikes shoes was to be found had no views on the subject he seemed to look on it as one of these things which no fellow can understand  eres one of em mr jackson he said as if he hoped that mike might be satisfied with a compromise  one whats the good of that edmund you chump i cant go over to school in one shoe  edmund turned this over in his mind and then said no sir as much as to say i may have lost a shoe but thank goodness i can still understand sound reasoning  well what am i to do where is the other shoe  dont know mr jackson replied edmund to both questions  well i mean  oh dash it theres the bell and mike sprinted off in the gym shoes he stood in  it is only a deviation from those ordinary rules of school life which one observes naturally and without thinking that enables one to realize how strong publicschool prejudices really are at a school for instance where the regulations say that coats only of black or dark blue are to be worn a boy who appears one day in even the most respectable and unostentatious brown finds himself looked on with a mixture of awe and repulsion which would be excessive if he had sandbagged the headmaster so in the case of shoes school rules decree that a boy shall go to his form room in shoes there is no real reason why if the day is fine he should not wear gym shoes should he prefer them but if he does the thing creates a perfect sensation boys say great scott what have you got on masters say jones what are you wearing on your feet in the few minutes which elapse between the assembling of the form for callover and the arrival of the form master some wag is sure either to stamp on the gym shoes accompanying the act with some satirical remark or else to pull one of them off and inaugurate an impromptu game of football with it there was once a boy who went to school one morning in elasticsided boots  mike had always been coldly distant in his relations to the rest of his form looking on them with a few exceptions as worms and the form since his innings against downings on the friday had regarded mike with respect so that he escaped the ragging he would have had to undergo at wrykyn in similar circumstance it was only mr downing who gave trouble  there is a sort of instinct which enables some masters to tell when a boy in their form is wearing gym shoes instead of the more formal kind just as people who dislike cats always know when one is in a room with them they cannot see it but they feel it in their bones  mr downing was perhaps the most bigoted antigymshoeist in the whole list of english schoolmasters he waged war remorselessly against gym shoes satire abuse lines detentionevery weapon was employed by him in dealing with their wearers it had been the late dunsters practice always to go over to school in gym shoes when as he usually did he felt shaky in the mornings lesson mr downing always detected him in the first five minutes and that meant a lecture of anything from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour on untidy habits and boys who looked like loaferswhich broke the back of the mornings work nicely on one occasion when a particularly tricky bit of livy was on the bill of fare dunster had entered the form room in heelless turkish bath slippers of a vivid crimson and the subsequent proceedings including his journey over to the house to change the heelless atrocities had seen him through very nearly to the quartertoeleven interval  mike accordingly had not been in his place for three minutes when mr downing stiffening like a pointer called his name  yes sir said mike  what are you wearing on your feet jackson  gym shoes sir  you are wearing gym shoes are you not aware that gym shoes are not the proper things to come to school in why are you wearing gym shoes  the form leaning back against the next row of desks settled itself comfortably for the address from the throne  i have lost one of my shoes sir  a kind of gulp escaped from mr downings lips he stared at mike for a moment in silence then turning to stone he told him to start translating  stone who had been expecting at least ten minutes respite was taken unawares when he found the place in his book and began to construe he floundered hopelessly but to his growing surprise and satisfaction the form master appeared to notice nothing wrong he said yes yes mechanically and finally that will do whereupon stone resumed his seat with the feeling that the age of miracles had returned  mr downings mind was in a whirl his case was complete mikes appearance in gym shoes with the explanation that he had lost a shoe completed the chain as columbus must have felt when his ship ran into harbor and the first american interviewer jumping on board said wal sir and what are your impressions of our glorious country so did mr downing feel at that moment  when the bell rang at a quarter to eleven he gathered up his gown and sped to the headmaster    24  the adair method   it was during the interval that day that stone and robinson discussing the subject of cricket over a bun and ginger beer at the school shop came to a momentous decision to wit that they were fed up with the adair administration and meant to strike the immediate cause of revolt was earlymorning fielding practice that searching test of cricket keenness mike himself to whom cricket was the great and serious interest in life had shirked earlymorning fielding practice in his first term at wrykyn and stone and robinson had but a lukewarm attachment to the game compared with mikes  as a rule adair had contented himself with practice in the afternoon after school which nobody objects to and no strain consequently had been put upon stones and robinsons allegiance in view of the mcc match on the wednesday however he had now added to this an extra dose to be taken before breakfast stone and robinson had left their comfortable beds that day at six oclock yawning and heavyeyed and had caught catches and fielded drives which in the cool morning air had stung like adders and bitten like serpents until the sun has really got to work it is no joke taking a high catch stones dislike of the experiment was only equaled by robinsons they were neither of them of the type which likes to undergo hardships for the common good they played well enough when on the field but neither cared greatly whether the school had a good season or not they played the games entirely for their own sakes  the result was that they went back to the house for breakfast with a neveragain feeling and at the earliest possible moment met to debate as to what was to be done about it at all costs another experience like todays must be avoided  its all rot said stone what on earths the good of sweating about before breakfast it only makes you tired  i shouldnt wonder said robinson if it wasnt bad for the heart rushing about on an empty stomach i mean and all that sort of thing  personally said stone gnawing his bun i dont intend to stick it  nor do i  i mean its such absolute rot if we arent good enough to play for the team without having to get up overnight to catch catches hed better find somebody else  yes  at this moment adair came into the shop  fielding practice again tomorrow he said briskly at six  before breakfast said robinson  rather you two must buck up you know you were rotten today and he passed on leaving the two malcontents speechless  stone was the first to recover  im hanged if i turn out tomorrow he said as they left the shop he can do what he likes about it besides what can he do after all only kick us out of the team and i dont mind that  nor do i  i dont think he will kick us out either he cant play the mcc with a scratch team if he does well go and play for that village jackson plays for well get jackson to shove us into the team  all right said robinson lets  their position was a strong one a cricket captain may seem to be an autocrat of tremendous power but in reality he has only one weapon the keenness of those under him with the majority of course the fear of being excluded or ejected from a team is a spur that drives the majority consequently are easily handled but when a cricket captain runs up against a boy who does not much care whether he plays for the team or not then he finds himself in a difficult position and unless he is a man of action practically helpless  stone and robinson felt secure taking it all around they felt that they would just as soon play for lower borlock as for the school the bowling of the opposition would be weaker in the former case and the chance of making runs greater to a certain type of cricketer runs are runs wherever and however made  the result of all this was that adair turning out with the team next morning for fielding practice found himself two short barnes was among those present but of the other two representatives of outwoods house there were no signs  barnes questioned on the subject had no information to give beyond the fact that he had not seen them about anywhere which was not a great help adair proceeded with the fielding practice without further delay  at breakfast that morning he was silent and apparently rapt in thought mr downing who sat at the top of the table with adair on his right was accustomed at the morning meal to blend nourishment of the body with that of the mind as a rule he had ten minutes with the daily paper before the bell rang and it was his practice to hand on the results of his reading to adair and the other house prefects who not having seen the paper usually formed an interested and appreciative audience today however though the house prefects expressed varying degrees of excitement at the news that sheppard had made a century against gloucestershire and that a butter famine was expected in the united states these worldshaking news items seemed to leave adair cold he champed his bread and marmalade with an abstracted air  he was wondering what to do in the matter of stone and robinson  many captains might have passed the thing over to take it for granted that the missing pair had overslept themselves would have been a safe and convenient way out of the difficulty but adair was not the sort of person who seeks for safe and convenient ways out of difficulties he never shirked anything physical or moral  he resolved to interview the absentees  it was not until after school that an opportunity offered itself he went across to outwoods and found the two nonstarters in the senior day room engaged in the intellectual pursuit of kicking the wall and marking the height of each kick with chalk adairs entrance coincided with a record effort by stone which caused the kicker to overbalance and stagger backward against the captain  sorry said stone hello adair  dont mention it why werent you two at fielding practice this morning  robinson who left the lead to stone in all matters said nothing stone spoke  we didnt turn up he said  i know you didnt why not  stone had rehearsed this scene in his mind and he spoke with the coolness which comes from rehearsal  we decided not to  oh  yes we came to the conclusion that we hadnt any use for earlymorning fielding  adairs manner became ominously calm  you were rather fed up i suppose  thats just the word  sorry it bored you  it didnt we didnt give it the chance to  robinson laughed appreciatively  whats the joke robinson asked adair  theres no joke said robinson with some haste i was only thinking of something  ill give you something else to think about soon  stone intervened  its no good making a row about it adair you must see that you cant do anything of course you can kick us out of the team if you like but we dont care if you do jackson will get us a game any wednesday or saturday for the village he plays for so were all right and the school team arent such a lot of flyers that you can afford to go chucking people out of it whenever you want to see what i mean  you and jackson seem to have fixed it all up between you  what are you going to do kick us out  no  good i thought youd see it was no good making a beastly row well play for the school all right theres no earthly need for us to turn out for fielding practice before breakfast  you dont think there is you may be right all the same youre going to tomorrow morning  what  six sharp dont be late  dont be an ass adair weve told you we arent going to  thats only your opinion i think you are ill give you till five past six as you seem to like lying in bed  you can turn out if you feel like it you wont find me there  thatll be a disappointment nor robinson  no said the junior partner in the firm but he said it without any deep conviction the atmosphere was growing a great deal too tense for his comfort  youve quite made up your minds  yes said stone  right said adair quietly and knocked him down  he was up again in a moment adair had pushed the table back and was standing in the middle of the open space  you cad said stone i wasnt ready  well you are now shall we go on  stone dashed in without a word and for a few moments the two might have seemed evenly matched to a not too intelligent spectator but science tells even in a confined space adair was smaller and lighter than stone but he was cooler and quicker and he knew more about the game his blow was always home a fraction of a second sooner than his opponents at the end of a minute stone was on the floor again  he got up slowly and stood leaning with one hand on the table  suppose we say ten past six said adair im not particular to a minute or two  stone made no reply  will ten past six suit you for fielding practice tomorrow said adair  all right said stone  thanks how about you robinson  robinson had been a petrified spectator of the captainkettlelike maneuvers of the cricket captain and it did not take him long to make up his mind he was not altogether a coward in different circumstances he might have put up a respectable show but it takes a more than ordinarily courageous person to embark on a fight which he knows must end in his destruction robinson knew that he was nothing like a match even for stone and adair had disposed of stone in a little over one minute it seemed to robinson that neither pleasure nor profit was likely to come from an encounter with adair  all right he said hastily ill turn up  good said adair i wonder if either of you chaps could tell me which is jacksons study  stone was dabbing at his mouth with a handkerchief a task which precluded anything in the shape of conversation so robinson replied that mikes study was the first you came to on the right of the corridor at the top of the stairs  thanks said adair you dont happen to know if hes in i suppose  he went up with smith a quarter of an hour ago i dont know if hes still there  ill go and see said adair i should like a word with him if he isnt busy    25  adair has a word with mike   mike all unconscious of the stirring proceedings which had been going on below stairs was peacefully reading a letter he had received that morning from strachan at wrykyn in which the successor to the cricket captaincy which should have been mikes had a good deal to say in a lugubrious strain in mikes absence things had been going badly with wrykyn a broken arm contracted in the course of some rash experiments with a day boys motor bicycle had deprived the team of the services of dunstable the only man who had shown any signs of being able to bowl a side out since this calamity wrote strachan everything had gone wrong the mcc led by mikes brother reggie the least of the three firstclass cricketing jacksons had smashed them by a hundred and fifty runs geddington had wiped them off the face of the earth the incogs with a team recruited exclusively from the rabbit hutchnot a wellknown man on the side except stacey a veteran who had been playing for the club for nearly half a centuryhad got home by two wickets in fact it was strachans opinion that the wrykyn team that summer was about the most hopeless gang of deadbeats that had ever made exhibition of itself on the school grounds the ripton match fortunately was off owing to an outbreak of mumps at that shrine of learning and athleticsthe second outbreak of the malady in two terms which said strachan was hard lines on ripton but a bit of jolly good luck for wrykyn as it had saved them from what would probably have been a record hammering ripton having eight of their last years team left including dixon the fast bowler against whom mike alone of the wrykyn team had been able to make runs in the previous season altogether wrykyn had struck a bad patch  mike mourned over his suffering school if only he could have been there to help it might have made all the difference in school cricket one good batsman to go in first and knock the bowlers off their length may take a weak team triumphantly through a season in school cricket the importance of a good start for the first wicket is incalculable  as he put strachans letter away in his pocket all his old bitterness against sedleigh which had been ebbing during the past few days returned with a rush he was conscious once more of that feeling of personal injury which had made him hate his new school on the first day of term  and it was at this point when his resentment was at its height that adair the concrete representative of everything sedleighan entered the room  there are moments in lifes placid course when there has got to be the biggest kind of row this was one of them  psmith who was leaning against the mantelpiece reading the serial story in a daily paper which he had abstracted from the senior day room made the intruder free of the study with a dignified wave of the hand and went on reading mike remained in the deck chair in which he was sitting and contented himself with glaring at the newcomer  psmith was the first to speak  if you ask my candid opinion he said looking up from his paper i should say that young lord antony trefusis was in the soup already i seem to see the consommé splashing about his ankles hes had a note telling him to be under the oak tree in the park at midnight hes just off there at the end of this installment i bet long jack the poacher is waiting there with a sandbag care to see the paper comrade adair or dont you take any interest in contemporary literature  thanks said adair i just wanted to speak to jackson for a minute  fate said psmith has led your footsteps to the right place this is comrade jackson the pride of the school sitting before you  what do you want said mike  he suspected that adair had come to ask him once again to play for the school the fact that the mcc match was on the following day made this a probable solution of the reason for his visit he could think of no other errand that was likely to have set the head of downings paying afternoon calls  ill tell you in a minute it wont take long  that said psmith approvingly is right speed is the keynote of the present age promptitude dispatch this is no time for loitering we must be strenuous we must hustle we must do it now we  buck up said mike  certainly said adair ive just been talking to stone and robinson  an excellent way of passing an idle half hour said psmith  we werent exactly idle said adair grimly it didnt last long but it was pretty lively while it did stone chucked it after the first round  mike got up out of his chair he could not quite follow what all this was about but there was no mistaking the truculence of adairs manner for some reason which might possibly be made clear later adair was looking for trouble and mike in his present mood felt that it would be a privilege to see that he got it  psmith was regarding adair through his eyeglass with pain and surprise  surely he said you do not mean us to understand that you have been brawling with comrade stone this is bad hearing i thought that you and he were like brothers such a bad example for comrade robinson too leave us adair we would brood oh go thee knave ill none of thee shakespeare  psmith turned away and resting his elbows on the mantelpiece gazed at himself mournfully in the looking glass  im not the man i was he sighed after a prolonged inspection there are lines on my face dark circles beneath my eyes the fierce rush of life at sedleigh is wasting me away  stone and i had a discussion about earlymorning fielding practice said adair turning to mike  mike said nothing  i thought his fielding wanted working up a bit so i told him to turn out at six tomorrow morning he said he wouldnt so we argued it out hes going to all right so is robinson  mike remained silent  so are you said adair  i get thinner and thinner said psmith from the mantelpiece  mike looked at adair and adair looked at mike after the manner of two dogs before they fly at one another there was an electric silence in the study psmith peered with increased earnestness into the glass  oh said mike at last what makes you think that  i dont think i know  any special reason for my turning out  yes  whats that  youre going to play for the school against the mcc tomorrow and i want you to get some practice  i wonder how you got that idea  curious i should have done isnt it  very you arent building on it much are you said mike politely  i am rather replied adair with equal courtesy  im afraid youll be disappointed  i dont think so  my eyes said psmith regretfully are a bit close together however he added philosophically its too late to alter that now  mike drew a step closer to adair  what makes you think i shall play against the mcc he asked curiously  im going to make you  mike took another step forward adair moved to meet him  would you care to try now said mike  for just one second the two drew themselves together preparatory to beginning the serious business of the interview and in that second psmith turning from the glass stepped between them  get out of the light smith said mike  psmith waved him back with a deprecating gesture  my dear young friends he said placidly if you will let your angry passions rise against the direct advice of doctor watts i suppose you must but when you propose to claw each other in my study in the midst of a hundred fragile and priceless ornaments i lodge a protest if you really feel that you want to scrap for goodness sake do it where theres some room i dont want all the study furniture smashed i know a bank whereon the wild thyme grows only a few yards down the road where you can scrap all night if you want to how would it be to move on there any objections none then shift ho and lets get it over    26  clearing the air   psmith was one of those people who lend a dignity to everything they touch under his auspices the most unpromising ventures became somehow enveloped in an atmosphere of measured stateliness on the present occasion what would have been without his guiding hand a mere unscientific scramble took on something of the impressive formality of the national sporting club  the rounds he said producing a watch as they passed through a gate into a field a couple of hundred yards from the house gate will be of three minutes duration with a minute rest in between a man who is down will have ten seconds in which to rise are you ready comrades adair and jackson very well then time  after which it was a pity that the actual fight did not quite live up to its referees introduction dramatically there should have been cautious sparring for openings and a number of tensely contested rounds as if it had been the final of a boxing competition but school fights when they do occurwhich is only once in a decade nowadays unless you count junior school scufflesare the outcome of weeks of suppressed bad blood and are consequently brief and furious in a boxing competition however much one may want to win one does not dislike ones opponent up to the moment when time was called one was probably warmly attached to him and at the end of the last round one expects to resume that attitude of mind in a fight each party as a rule hates the other  so it happened that there was nothing formal or cautious about the present battle all adair wanted was to get at mike and all mike wanted was to get at adair directly psmith called time they rushed together as if they meant to end the thing in half a minute  it was this that saved mike in an ordinary contest with the gloves with his opponent cool and boxing in his true form he could not have lasted three rounds against adair the latter was a clever boxer while mike had never had a lesson in his life if adair had kept away and used his head nothing could have prevented his winning  as it was however he threw away his advantages much as tom brown did at the beginning of his fight with slogger williams and the result was the same as on that historic occasion mike had the greater strength and thirty seconds from the start knocked his man clean off his feet with an unscientific but powerful righthander  this finished adairs chances he rose full of fight but with all the science knocked out of him he went in at mike with both hands the irish blood in him which for the ordinary events of life made him merely energetic and dashing now rendered him reckless he abandoned all attempt at guarding it was the frontal attack in its most futile form and as unsuccessful as a frontal attack is apt to be there was a swift exchange of blows in the course of which mikes left elbow coming into contact with his opponents right fist got a shock which kept it tingling for the rest of the day and then adair went down in a heap  he got up slowly and with difficulty for a moment he stood blinking vaguely then he lurched forward at mike  in the excitement of a fightwhich is after all about the most exciting thing that ever happens to one in the course of ones lifeit is difficult for the fighters to see what the spectators see where the spectators see an assault on an already beaten man the fighter himself only sees a legitimate piece of selfdefense against an opponent whose chances are equal to his own psmith saw as anybody looking on would have seen that adair was done mikes blow had taken him within a fraction of an inch of the point of the jaw and he was all but knocked out mike could not see this all he understood was that his man was on his feet again and coming at him so he hit out with all his strength and this time adair went down and stayed down  brief said psmith coming forward but exciting we may take that i think to be the conclusion of the entertainment i will now have a dash at picking up the slain i shouldnt stop if i were you hell be sitting up and taking notice soon and if he sees you he may want to go on with the combat which would do him no earthly good if its going to be continued in our next there had better be a bit of an interval for alterations and repairs first  is he hurt much do you think asked mike he had seen knockouts before in the ring but this was the first time he had ever effected one on his own account and adair looked unpleasantly corpselike  hes all right said psmith in a minute or two hell be skipping about like a little lambkin ill look after him you go away and pick flowers  mike put on his coat and walked back to the house he was conscious of a perplexing whirl of new and strange emotions chief among which was a curious feeling that he rather liked adair he found himself thinking that adair was a good chap that there was something to be said for his point of view and that it was a pity he had knocked him about so much at the same time he felt an undeniable thrill of pride at having beaten him the feat presented that interesting person mike jackson to him in a fresh and pleasing light as one who had had a tough job to face and had carried it through jackson the cricketer he knew but jackson the deliverer of knockout blows was strange to him and he found this new acquaintance a man to be respected  the fight in fact had the result which most fights have if they are fought fairly and until one side has had enough it revolutionized mikes view of things it shook him up and drained the bad blood out of him where before he had seemed to himself to be acting with massive dignity he now saw that he had simply been sulking like some wretched kid there had appeared to him something rather fine in his policy of refusing to identify himself in any way with sedleigh a touch of the stonewallsdonotaprisonmake sort of thing he now saw that his attitude was to be summed up in the words shant play  it came upon mike with painful clearness that he had been making an ass of himself  he had come to this conclusion after much earnest thought when psmith entered the study  hows adair asked mike  sitting up and taking nourishment once more we have been chatting hes not a bad cove  hes all right said mike  there was a pause psmith straightened his tie  look here he said i seldom interfere in terrestrial strife but it seems to me that theres an opening here for a capable peacemaker not afraid of work and willing to give his services in exchange for a comfortable home comrade adairs rather a stoutish fellow in his way im not much on the play up for the old school jones game but everyone to his taste i shouldnt have thought anybody would get overwhelmingly attached to this abode of wrath but comrade adair seems to have done it hes all for giving sedleigh a muchneeded boostup its not a bad idea in its way i dont see why one shouldnt humor him apparently hes been sweating since early childhood to buck the school up and as hes leaving at the end of the term it mightnt be a scaly scheme to give him a bit of a sendoff if possible by making the cricket season a bit of a banger as a start why not drop him a line to say that youll play against the mcc tomorrow  mike did not reply at once he was feeling better disposed toward adair and sedleigh then he had felt but he was not sure that he was quite prepared to go as far as a complete climbdown  it wouldnt be a bad idea continued psmith theres nothing like giving in to a man a bit every now and then it broadens the soul and improves the action of the skin what seems to have fed up comrade adair to a certain extent is that stone apparently led him to understand that you had offered to give him and robinson places in your village team you didnt of course  of course not said mike indignantly  i told him he didnt know the old noblesse oblige spirit of the jacksons i said that you would scorn to tarnish the jackson escutcheon by not playing the game my eloquence convinced him however to return to the point under discussion why not  i dont  what i mean to say  began mike  if your trouble is said psmith that you fear that you may be in unworthy company  dont be an ass  dismiss it i am playing  mike stared  youre what you  i said psmith breathing on a coat button and polishing it with his handkerchief  can you play cricket  you have discovered said psmith my secret sorrow  youre rotting  you wrong me comrade jackson  then why havent you played  why havent you  why didnt you come and play for lower borlock i mean  the last time i played in a village cricket match i was caught at point by a man in braces it would have been madness to risk another such shock to my system my nerves are so exquisitely balanced that a thing of that sort takes years off my life  no but look here smith bar rotting are you really any good at cricket  competent judges at eton gave me to understand so i was told that this year i should be a certainty for lords but when the cricket season came where was i gone gone like some beautiful flower that withers in the night  but you told me you didnt like cricket you said you only liked watching it  quite right i do but at schools where cricket is compulsory you have to overcome your private prejudices and in time the thing becomes a habit imagine my feelings when i found that i was degenerating little by little into a slow lefthand bowler with a swerve i fought against it but it was useless and after a while i gave up the struggle and drifted with the stream last year in a house matchpsmiths voice took on a deeper tone of melancholyi took seven for thirteen in the second innings on a hard wicket i did think when i came here that i had found a haven of rest but it was not to be i turn out tomorrow what comrade outwood will say when he finds that his keenest archaeological disciple has deserted i hate to think however   mike felt as if a young and powerful earthquake had passed the whole face of his world had undergone a quick change here was he the recalcitrant wavering on the point of playing for the school and here was psmith the last person whom he would have expected to be a player stating calmly that he had been in the running for a place in the eton eleven  then in a flash mike understood he was not by nature intuitive but he read psmiths mind now since the term began he and psmith had been acting on precisely similar motives just as he had been disappointed of the captaincy of cricket at wrykyn so had psmith been disappointed of his place in the eton team at lords and they had both worked it off each in his own waymike sullenly psmith whimsically according to their respective natureson sedleigh  if psmith therefore did not consider it too much of a climbdown to renounce his resolution not to play for sedleigh there was nothing to stop mike doing so asat the bottom of his hearthe wanted to do  by jove he said if youre playing ill play ill write a note to adair now but i sayhe stoppedim hanged if im going to turn out and field before breakfast tomorrow  thats all right you wont have to adair wont be there himself hes not playing against the mcc hes sprained his wrist    27  in which peace is declared   sprained his wrist said mike how did he do that  during the brawl apparently one of his efforts got home on your elbow instead of your expressive countenance and whether it was that your elbow was particularly tough or his wrist particularly fragile i dont know anyhow it went its nothing bad but itll keep him out of the game tomorrow  i say what beastly rough luck id no idea ill go around  not a bad scheme close the door gently after you and if you see anybody downstairs who looks as if he were likely to be going over to the shop ask him to get me a small pot of some rare old jam and tell the man to chalk it up to me the jam comrade outwood supplies to us at tea is all right as a practical joke or as a food for those anxious to commit suicide but useless to anybody who values life  on arriving at mr downings and going to adairs study mike found that his late antagonist was out he left a note informing him of his willingness to play in the morrows match the lockup bell rang as he went out of the house  a spot of rain fell on his hand a moment later there was a continuous patter as the storm which had been gathering all day broke in earnest mike turned up his coat collar and ran back to outwoods at this rate he said to himself there wont be a match at all tomorrow                                       when the weather decides after behaving well for some weeks to show what it can do in another direction it does the thing thoroughly when mike woke the next morning the world was gray and dripping leadencolored clouds drifted over the sky till there was not a trace of blue to be seen and then the rain began again in the gentle determined way rain has when it means to make a day of it  it was one of those bad days when one sits in the pavilion damp and depressed while figures in mackintoshes with discolored buckskin boots crawl miserably about the field in couples  mike shuffling across to school in a burberry met adair at downings gate  these moments are always difficult mike stoppedhe could hardly walk on as if nothing had happenedand looked down at his feet  coming across he said awkwardly  right ho said adair  they walked on in silence  its only about ten to isnt it said mike  adair fished out his watch and examined it with an elaborate care born of nervousness  about nine to  good weve got plenty of time  yes  i hate having to hurry over to school  so do i  i often do cut it rather fine though  yes so do i  beastly nuisance when one does  beastly  its only about a couple of minutes from the houses to the school i should think shouldnt you  not much more might be three  yes three if one didnt hurry  another silence  beastly day said adair  rotten  silence again  i say said mike scowling at his toes awfully sorry about your wrist  oh thats all right it was my fault  does it hurt  oh no rather not thanks  id no idea youd crocked yourself  oh no thats all right it was only right at the end youd have smashed me anyhow  oh rot  i bet you anything you like you would  i bet you i shouldnt jolly hard luck just before the match  oh no i say thanks awfully for saying youd play  oh rot do you think we shall get a game  adair inspected the sky carefully  i dont know it looks pretty bad doesnt it  rotten i say how long will your wrist keep you out of cricket  be all right in a week less probably  good  now that you and smith are going to play we ought to have a jolly good season  rummy smith turning out to be a cricketer  yes i should think hed be a hot bowler with his height  he must be jolly good if he was only just out of the eton team last year  yes  whats the time asked mike  adair produced his watch once more  five to  weve heaps of time  yes heaps  lets stroll on a bit down the road shall we  right ho  mike cleared his throat  i say  hello  ive been talking to smith he was telling me that you thought id promised to give stone and robinson places in the  oh no thats all right it was only for a bit smith told me you couldnt have done and i saw that i was an ass to think you could have it was stone seeming so dead certain that he could play for lower borlock if i chucked him from the school team that gave me the idea  he never even asked me to get him a place  no i know  of course i wouldnt have done it even if he had  of course not  i didnt want to play myself but i wasnt going to do a rotten trick like getting other fellows away from the team  no i know  it was rotten enough really not playing myself  oh no beastly rough luck having to leave wrykyn just when you were going to be captain and come to a small school like this  the excitement of the past few days must have had a stimulating effect on mikes mindshaken it up as it were for now for the second time in two days he displayed quite a creditable amount of intuition he might have been misled by adairs apparently deprecatory attitude toward sedleigh and blundered into a denunciation of the place adair had said a small school like this in the sort of voice which might have led his hearer to think that he was expected to say yes rotten little hole isnt it or words to that effect mike fortunately perceived that the words were used purely from politeness on the chinese principle when a chinese man wishes to pay a compliment he does so by belittling himself and his belongings  he eluded the pitfall  what rot he said sedleighs one of the most sporting schools ive ever come across everybodys as keen as blazes so they ought to be after the way youve sweated  adair shuffled awkwardly  ive always been fairly keen on the place he said but i dont suppose ive done anything much  youve loosened one of my front teeth said mike with a grin if thats any comfort to you  i couldnt eat anything except porridge this morning my jaw still aches  for the first time during the conversation their eyes met and the humorous side of the thing struck them simultaneously they began to laugh  what fools we must have looked said adair  you were all right i must have looked rotten ive never had the gloves on in my life im jolly glad no one saw us except smith who doesnt count hello theres the bell wed better be moving on what about this match not much chance of it from the look of the sky at present  it might clear before eleven youd better get changed anyhow at the interval and hang about in case  all right its better than doing thucydides with downing weve got math till the interval so i dont see anything of him all day which wont hurt me  he isnt a bad sort of chap when you get to know him said adair  i cant have done then i dont know which id least soon be downing or a black beetle except that if one was downing one could tread on the black beetle dash this rain i got about half a pint down my neck just then we shant get a game today or anything like it as youre crocked im not sure that i care much youve been sweating for years to get the match on and it would be rather rot playing it without you  i dont know that so much i wish we could play because im certain with you and smith wed walk into them they probably arent sending down much of a team and really now that you and smith are turning out weve got a jolly hot lot theres quite decent batting all the way through and the bowling isnt so bad if only we could have given this mcc lot a really good hammering it might have been easier to get some good fixtures for next season you see its all right for a school like wrykyn but with a small place like this you simply cant get the best teams to give you a match till youve done something to show that you arent absolute rotters at the game as for the schools theyre worse theyd simply laugh at you you were cricket secretary at wrykyn last year what would you have done if youd had a challenge from sedleigh youd either have laughed till you were sick or else had a fit at the mere idea of the thing  mike stopped  by jove youve struck about the brightest scheme on record i never thought of it before lets get a match on with wrykyn  what they wouldnt play us  yes they would at least im pretty sure they would i had a letter from strachan the captain yesterday saying that the ripton match had had to be scratched owing to illness so theyve got a vacant date shall i try them ill write to strachan tonight if you like and they arent strong this year well smash them what do you say  adair was as one who has seen a vision  by jove he said at last if we only could    28  mr downing moves   the rain continued without a break all the morning the two teams after hanging about dismally and whiling the time away with stumpcricket in the changing rooms lunched in the pavilion at one oclock after which the mcc captain approaching adair moved that this merry meeting be considered off and he and his men permitted to catch the next train back to town to which adair seeing that it was out of the question that there should be any cricket that afternoon regretfully agreed and the first sedleigh v mcc match was accordingly scratched  mike and psmith wandering back to the house were met by a damp junior from downings with a message that mr downing wished to see mike as soon as he was changed  whats he want me for inquired mike  the messenger did not know mr downing it seemed had not confided in him all he knew was that the housemaster was in the house and would be glad if mike would step across  a nuisance said psmith this incessant demand for you thats the worst of being popular if he wants you to stop to tea edge away a meal on rather a sumptuous scale will be prepared in the study against your return  mike changed quickly and went off leaving psmith who was fond of simple pleasures in his spare time earnestly occupied with a puzzle which had been scattered through the land by a weekly paper the prize for a solution was one thousand pounds and psmith had already informed mike with some minuteness of his plans for the disposition of this sum meanwhile he worked at it both in and out of school generally with abusive comments on its inventor  he was still fiddling away at it when mike returned  mike though psmith was at first too absorbed to notice it was agitated  i dont wish to be in any way harsh said psmith without looking up but the man who invented this thing was a blighter of the worst type you come and have a shot for the moment i am baffled the whisper flies round the clubs psmith is baffled  the mans an absolute driveling ass said mike warmly  me do you mean  what on earth would be the point of my doing it  youd gather in a thousand of the best give you a nice start in life  im not talking about your rotten puzzle  what are you talking about  that ass downing i believe hes off his nut  then your chat with comrade downing was not of the oldcollegechumsmeetingunexpectedlyafteryearsseparation type what has he been doing to you  hes off his nut  i know but what did he do how did the brainstorm burst did he jump at you from behind a door and bite a piece out of your leg or did he say he was a teapot  mike sat down  you remember that paintingsammy business  as if it were yesterday said psmith which it was pretty nearly  he thinks i did it  why have you ever shown any talent in the painting line  the silly ass wanted me to confess that id done it he as good as asked me to jawed a lot of rot about my finding it to my advantage later on if i behaved sensibly  then what are you worrying about dont you know that when a master wants you to do the confessing act it simply means that he hasnt enough evidence to start in on you with youre all right the things a standoff  evidence said mike my dear man hes got enough evidence to sink a ship hes absolutely sweating evidence at every pore as far as i can see hes been crawling about doing the sherlock holmes business for all hes worth ever since the thing happened and now hes dead certain that i painted sammy  did you by the way said psmith  no said mike shortly i didnt but after listening to downing i almost began to wonder if i hadnt the mans got stacks of evidence to prove that i did  such as what  its mostly about my shoes but dash it you know all about that why you were with him when he came and looked for them  it is true said psmith that comrade downing and i spent a very pleasant half hour together inspecting shoes but how does he drag you into it  he swears one of the shoes was splashed with paint  yes he babbled to some extent on that point when i was entertaining him but what makes him think that the shoe if any was yours  hes certain that somebody in this house got one of his shoes splashed and is hiding it somewhere and im the only chap in the house who hasnt got a pair of shoes to show so he thinks its me i dont know where the dickens my other shoe has gone of course ive got two pairs but ones being soled so i had to go over to school yesterday in gym shoes thats how he spotted me  psmith sighed  comrade jackson he said mournfully all this very sad affair shows the folly of acting from the best motives in my simple zeal meaning to save you unpleasantness i have landed you with a dull sickening thud right in the cart are you particular about dirtying your hands if you arent just reach up that chimney a bit  mike stared  what the dickens are you talking about  go on get it over be a man and reach up the chimney  i dont know what the game is said mike kneeling beside the fender and groping buthello  ah ha said psmith moodily  mike dropped the sootcovered object in the fender and glared at it  its my shoe he said at last  it is said psmith your shoe and what is that red stain across the toe is it blood no tis not blood it is red paint  mike seemed unable to remove his eyes from the shoe  how on earth didby jove i remember now i kicked up against something in the dark when i was putting my bicycle back that night it must have been the paint pot  then you were out that night  rather thats what makes it so jolly awkward its too long to tell you now  your stories are never too long for me said psmith say on  well it was like this and mike related the events which had led up to his midnight excursion psmith listened attentively  this he said when mike had finished confirms my frequently stated opinion that comrade jellicoe is one of natures blitherers so thats why he touched us for our hardearned was it  yes of course there was no need for him to have the money at all  and the result is that you are in something of a tight place youre absolutely certain you didnt paint that dog didnt do it by any chance in a moment of absentmindedness and forgot all about it no no i suppose not i wonder who did  its beastly awkward you see downing chased me that night that was why i rang the alarm bell so you see hes certain to think that the chap he chased which was me and the chap who painted sammy are the same i shall get landed both ways  psmith pondered  it is a tightish place he admitted  i wonder if we could get this shoe clean said mike inspecting it with disfavor  not for a pretty considerable time  i suppose not i say i am in the cart if i cant produce this shoe theyre bound to guess why  what exactly asked psmith was the position of affairs between you and comrade downing when you left him had you definitely parted brass rags or did you simply sort of drift apart with mutual courtesies  oh he said i was ill advised to continue that attitude or some rot and i said i didnt care i hadnt painted his bally dog and he said very well then he must take steps andwell that was about all  sufficient too said psmith quite sufficient i take it then that he is now on the warpath collecting a gang so to speak  i suppose hes gone to the old man about it  probably a very worrying time our headmaster is having taking it all round in connection with this painful affair what do you think his move will be  i suppose hell send for me and try to get something out of me  hell want you to confess too masters are all whales on confession the worst of it is you cant prove an alibi because at about the time the foul act was perpetrated you were playing roundandroundthe mulberrybush with comrade downing this needs thought you had better put the case in my hands and go out and watch the dandelions growing i will think over the matter  well i hope youll be able to think of something i cant  possibly you never know  there was a tap at the door  see how we have trained them said psmith they now knock before entering there was a time when they would have tried to smash in a panel come in  a small boy carrying a straw hat adorned with the school house ribbon answered the invitation  oh i say jackson he said the headmaster sent me over to tell you he wants to see you  i told you so said mike to psmith  dont go suggested psmith tell him to write  mike got up  all this is very trying said psmith im seeing nothing of you today he turned to the small boy tell willie he added that mr jackson will be with him in a moment  the emissary departed  youre all right said psmith encouragingly just you keep on saying youre all right stout denial is the thing dont go in for any airy explanations simply stick to stout denial you cant beat it  with which expert advice he allowed mike to go on his way  he had not been gone two minutes when psmith who had leaned back in his chair rapt in thought heaved himself up again he stood for a moment straightening his tie at the looking glass then he picked up his hat and moved slowly out of the door and down the passage thence at the same dignified rate of progress out of the house and in at downings front gate  the postman was at the door when he got there apparently absorbed in conversation with the parlor maid psmith stood by politely till the postman who had just been told it was like his impudence caught sight of him and having handed over the letters in an ultraformal and professional manner passed away  is mr downing at home inquired psmith  he was it seemed psmith was shown into the dining room on the left of the hall and requested to wait he was examining a portrait of mr downing which hung on the wall when the housemaster came in  an excellent likeness sir said psmith with a gesture of the hand toward the painting  well smith said mr downing shortly what do you wish to see me about  it was in connection with the regrettable painting of your dog sir  ha said mr downing  i did it sir said psmith stopping and flicking a piece of fluff off his knee    29  the artist claims his work   the line of action which psmith had called stout denial is an excellent line to adopt especially if you really are innocent but it does not lead to anything in the shape of a bright and snappy dialogue between accuser and accused both mike and the headmaster were oppressed by a feeling that the situation was difficult the atmosphere was heavy and conversation showed a tendency to flag the headmaster had opened brightly enough with a summary of the evidence which mr downing had laid before him but after that a massive silence had been the order of the day there is nothing in this world quite so stolid and uncommunicative as a boy who has made up his mind to be stolid and uncommunicative and the headmaster as he sat and looked at mike who sat and looked past him at the bookshelves felt awkward it was a scene which needed either a dramatic interruption or a neat exit speech as it happened what it got was the dramatic interruption  the headmaster was just saying i do not think you fully realize jackson the extent to which appearances which was practically going back to the beginning and starting againwhen there was a knock at the door a voice without said mr downing to see you sir and the chief witness for the prosecution burst in  i would not have interrupted you said mr downing but  not at all mr downing is there anything i can   i have discovered  i have been informed  in short it was not jackson who committed thewho painted my dog  mike and the headmaster both looked at the speaker mike with a feeling of relieffor stout denial unsupported by any weighty evidence is a wearing game to playthe headmaster with astonishment  not jackson said the headmaster  no it was a boy in the same house smith  psmith mike was more than surprised he could not believe it there is nothing which affords so clear an index to a boys character as the type of rag which he considers humorous between what is a rag and what is merely a rotten trick there is a very definite line drawn masters as a rule do not realize this but boys nearly always do mike could not imagine psmith doing a rotten thing like covering a housemasters dog with red paint any more than he could imagine doing it himself they had both been amused at the sight of sammy after the operation but anybody except possibly the owner of the dog would have thought it funny at first after the first surprise their feeling had been that it was a rotten thing to have done and beastly rough luck on the poor brute it was a kids trick as for psmith having done it mike simply did not believe it  smith said the headmaster what makes you think that  simply this said mr downing with calm triumph that the boy himself came to me a few moments ago and confessed  mike was conscious of a feeling of acute depression it did not make him in the least degree jubilant or even thankful to know that he himself was cleared of the charge all he could think of was that psmith was done for this was bound to mean the sack if psmith had painted sammy it meant that psmith had broken out of his house at night and it was not likely that the rules about nocturnal wandering were less strict at sedleigh than at any other school in the kingdom mike felt if possible worse than he had felt when wyatt had been caught on a similar occasion it seemed as if fate had a special grudge against his best friends he did not make friends very quickly or easily though he had always had scores of acquaintancesand with wyatt and psmith he had found himself at home from the first moment he had met them  he sat there with a curious feeling of having swallowed a heavy weight hardly listening to what mr downing was saying mr downing was talking rapidly to the headmaster who was nodding from time to time  mike took advantage of a pause to get up may i go sir he said  certainly jackson certainly said the head oh and erif you are going back to your house tell smith that i should like to see him  yes sir  he had reached the door when again there was a knock  come in said the headmaster  it was adair  yes adair  adair was breathing rather heavily as if he had been running  it was about sammysampson sir he said looking at mr downing  ah we know  well adair what did you wish to say  it wasnt jackson who did it sir  no no adair so mr downing  it was dunster sir  terrific sensation the headmaster gave a sort of strangled yelp of astonishment mr downing leaped in his chair mikes eyes opened to their fullest extent  adair  there was almost a wail in the headmasters voice the situation had suddenly become too much for him his brain was swimming that mike despite the evidence against him should be innocent was curious perhaps but not particularly startling but that adair should inform him two minutes after mr downings announcement of psmiths confession that psmith too was guiltless and that the real criminal was dunsterit was this that made him feel that somebody in the words of an american author had played a mean trick on him and substituted for his brain a side order of cauliflower why dunster of all people dunster who he remembered dizzily had left the school at christmas and why if dunster had really painted the dog had psmith asserted that he himself was the culprit whywhy anything he concentrated his mind on adair as the only person who could save him from impending brain fever  adair  yes sir  whatwhat do you mean  it was dunster sir i got a letter from him only five minutes ago in which he said that he had painted sammysampson the dog sir for a ragfor a joke and that as he didnt want anyone here to get into a rowbe punished for it id better tell mr downing at once i tried to find mr downing but he wasnt in the house then i met smith outside the house and he told me that mr downing had gone over to see you sir  smith told you said mr downing  yes sir  did you say anything to him about your having received this letter from dunster  i gave him the letter to read sir  and what was his attitude when he had read it  he laughed sir  laughed mr downings voice was thunderous  yes sir he rolled about  mr downing snorted  but adair said the headmaster i do not understand how this thing could have been done by dunster he has left the school  he was down here for the old sedleighans match sir he stopped the night in the village  and that was the night theit happened  yes sir  i see well i am glad to find that the blame can not be attached to any boy in the school i am sorry that it is even an old boy it was a foolish discreditable thing to have done but it is not as bad as if any boy still at the school had broken out of his house at night to do it  the sergeant said mr downing told me that the boy he saw was attempting to enter mr outwoods house  another freak of dunsters i suppose said the headmaster i shall write to him  if it was really dunster who painted my dog said mr downing i cannot understand the part played by smith in this affair if he did not do it what possible motive could he have had for coming to me of his own accord and deliberately confessing  to be sure said the headmaster pressing a bell it is certainly a thing that calls for explanation barlow he said as the butler appeared kindly go across to mr outwoods house and inform smith that i should like to see him  if you please sir mr smith is waiting in the hall  in the hall  yes sir he arrived soon after mr adair sir saying that he would wait as you would probably wish to see him shortly  hm ask him to step up barlow  yes sir  there followed one of the tensest stage waits of mikes experience it was not long but while it lasted the silence was quite solid nobody seemed to have anything to say and there was not even a clock in the room to break the stillness with its ticking a very faint dripdrip of rain could be heard outside the window  presently there was a sound of footsteps on the stairs the door was opened  mr smith sir  the old etonian entered as would the guest of the evening who is a few moments late for dinner he was cheerful but slightly deprecating he gave the impression of one who though sure of his welcome feels that some slight apology is expected from him he advanced into the room with a gentle halfsmile which suggested good will to all men  it is still raining he observed you wished to see me sir  sit down smith  thank you sir  he dropped into a deep armchair which both adair and mike had avoided in favor of less luxurious seats with the confidential cosiness of a fashionable physician calling on a patient between whom and himself time has broken down the barriers of restraint and formality  mr downing burst out like a reservoir that has broken its banks  smith  psmith turned his gaze politely in the housemasters direction  smith you came to me a quarter of an hour ago and told me that it was you who had painted my dog sampson  yes sir  it was absolutely untrue  i am afraid so sir  but smith  began the headmaster  psmith bent forward encouragingly   this is a most extraordinary affair have you no explanation to offer what induced you to do such a thing  psmith sighed softly  the craze of notoriety sir he replied sadly the curse of the present age  what replied the headmaster  it is remarkable proceeded psmith placidly with the impersonal touch of one lecturing on generalities how frequently when a murder has been committed one finds men confessing that they have done it when it is out of the question that they should have committed it it is one of the most interesting problems with which anthropologists are confronted human nature  the headmaster interrupted  smith he said i should like to see you alone for a moment mr downing might i trouble adair jackson  he made a motion toward the door  when he and psmith were alone there was silence psmith leaned back comfortably in his chair the headmaster tapped nervously with his foot on the floor  er  smith  sir  the headmaster seemed to have some difficulty in proceeding he paused again then he went on  er  smith i do not for a moment wish to pain you but have you  er do you remember ever having had as a child let us say any  er  severe illness any  er  mental illness  no sir  there is noforgive me if i am touching on a sad subjectthere is no  none of your near relatives have ever suffered in the way i  er  have described  there isnt a lunatic on the list sir said psmith cheerfully  of course smith of course said the headmaster hurriedly i did not mean to suggestquite so quite so  you think then that you confessed to an act which you had not committed purely from some sudden impulse which you cannot explain  strictly between ourselves sir   privately the headmaster found psmiths mantoman attitude somewhat disconcerting but he said nothing  well smith  i should not like it to go any further sir  i will certainly respect any confidence   i dont want anybody to know sir this is strictly between ourselves  i think you are sometimes apt to forget smith the proper relations existing between boy andwell never mind that for the present we can return to it later for the moment let me hear what you wish to say i shall of course tell nobody if you do not wish it  well it was like this sir said psmith jackson happened to tell me that you and mr downing seemed to think he had painted mr downings dog and there seemed some danger of his being expelled so i thought it wouldnt be an unsound scheme if i were to go and say i had done it that was the whole thing of course dunster writing created a certain amount of confusion  there was a pause  it was a very wrong thing to do smith said the headmaster at last but you are a curious boy smith good night  he held out his hand  good night sir said psmith  not a bad old sort said psmith meditatively to himself as he walked downstairs by no means a bad old sort i must drop in from time to time and cultivate him  mike and adair were waiting for him outside the front door  well said mike  you are the limit said adair whats he done  nothing we had a very pleasant chat and then i tore myself away  do you mean to say hes not going to do a thing  not a thing  well youre a marvel said adair  psmith thanked him courteously they walked on toward the houses  by the way adair said mike as the latter started to turn in at downings ill write to strachan tonight about that match  whats that asked psmith  jacksons going to try and get wrykyn to give us a game said adair theyve got a vacant date i hope the dickens theyll do it  oh i should think theyre certain to said mike good night  and give comrade downing when you see him said psmith my very best love it is men like him who make this merrie england of ours what it is                                       i say psmith said mike suddenly what really made you tell downing youd done it  the craving for  oh chuck it you arent talking to the old man now i believe it was simply to get me out of a jolly tight corner  psmiths expression was one of pain  my dear comrade jackson said he you wrong me you make me writhe im surprised at you i never thought to hear those words from michael jackson  well i believe you did all the same said mike obstinately and it was jolly good of you too  psmith moaned    30  sedleigh v wrykyn   the wrykyn match was three parts over and things were going badly for sedleigh in a way one might have said that the game was over and that sedleigh had lost for it was a oneday match and wrykyn who had led on the first innings had only to play out time to make the game theirs  sedleigh were paying the penalty for allowing themselves to be influenced by nerves in the early part of the day nerves lose more school matches than good play ever won there is a certain type of school batsman who is a gift to any bowler when he once lets his imagination run away with him sedleigh with the exception of adair psmith and mike had entered upon this match in a state of the most azure funk ever since mike had received strachans answer and adair had announced on the notice board that on saturday july the twentieth sedleigh would play wrykyn the team had been all on the jump it was useless for adair to tell them as he did repeatedly on mikes authority that wrykyn were weak this season and that on their present form sedleigh ought to win easily the team listened but were not comforted wrykyn might be below their usual strength but then wrykyn cricket as a rule reached such a high standard that this probably meant little however weak wrykyn might befor themthere was a very firm impression among the members of the sedleigh first eleven that the other school was quite strong enough to knock the cover off them experience counts enormously in school matches sedleigh had never been proved the teams they played were the sort of sides which the wrykyn second eleven would play whereas wrykyn from time immemorial had been beating ripton teams and free foresters teams and mcc teams packed with county men and sending men to oxford and cambridge who got their blues as freshmen  sedleigh had gone onto the field that morning a depressed side  it was unfortunate that adair had won the toss he had had no choice but to take first innings the weather had been bad for the last week and the wicket was slow and treacherous it was likely to get worse during the day so adair had chosen to bat first  taking into consideration the state of nerves the team was in this in itself was a calamity a school eleven are always at their worst and nerviest before lunch even on their own ground they find the surroundings lonely and unfamiliar the subtlety of the bowlers becomes magnified unless the first pair make a really good start a collapse almost invariably ensues  today the start had been gruesome beyond words mike the bulwark of the side the man who had been brought up on wrykyn bowling and from whom whatever might happen to the others at least a fifty was expectedmike going in first with barnes and taking first over had played inside one from bruce the wrykyn slow bowler and had been caught at short slip off his second ball  that put the finishing touch on the panic stone robinson and the others all quite decent punishing batsmen when their nerves allowed them to play their own game crawled to the wickets declined to hit out at anything and were clean bowled several of them playing back to half volleys adair did not suffer from panic but his batting was not equal to his bowling and he had fallen after hitting one four seven wickets were down for thirty when psmith went in  psmith had always disclaimed any pretensions to batting skill but he was undoubtedly the right man for a crisis like this he had an enormous reach and he used it three consecutive balls from bruce he turned into full tosses and swept to the leg boundary and assisted by barnes who had been sitting on the splice in his usual manner he raised the total to seventyone before being yorked with his score at thirtyfive ten minutes later the innings was over with barnes not out sixteen for seventynine  wrykyn had then gone in lost strachan for twenty before lunch and finally completed their innings at a quarter to four for a hundred and thirtyone  this was better than sedleigh had expected at least eight of the team had looked forward dismally to an afternoons leather hunting but adair and psmith helped by the wicket had never been easy especially psmith who had taken six wickets his slows playing havoc with the tail  it would be too much to say that sedleigh had any hope of pulling the game out of the fire but it was a comfort they felt at any rate having another knock as is usual at this stage of a match their nervousness had vanished and they felt capable of better things than in the first innings  it was on mikes suggestion that psmith and he went in first mike knew the limitations of the wrykyn bowling and he was convinced that if they could knock bruce off it might be possible to rattle up a score sufficient to give them the game always provided wrykyn collapsed in the second innings and it seemed to mike that the wicket would be so bad then that they easily might  so he and psmith had gone in at four oclock to hit and they had hit the deficit had been wiped off all but a dozen runs when psmith was bowled and by that time mike was set and in his best vein he treated all the bowlers alike and when stone came in restored to his proper frame of mind and lashed out stoutly and after him robinson and the rest it looked as if sedleigh had a chance again the score was a hundred and twenty when mike who had just reached his fifty skied one to strachan at cover the time was twentyfive past five  as mike reached the pavilion adair declared the innings closed  wrykyn started batting at twentyfive minutes to six with sixtynine to make if they wished to make them and an hour and ten minutes during which to keep up their wickets if they preferred to take things easy and go for a win on the first innings  at first it looked as if they meant to knock off the runs for strachan forced the game from the first ball which was psmiths and which he hit into the pavilion but at fifteen adair bowled him and when two runs later psmith got the next man stumped and finished up his over with a candb wrykyn decided that it was not good enough seventeen for three with an hour all but five minutes to go was getting too dangerous so drummond and rigby the next pair proceeded to play with caution and the collapse ceased  this was the state of the game at the point at which this chapter opened seventeen for three had become twentyfour for three and the hands of the clock stood at ten minutes past six changes of bowling had been tried but there seemed no chance of getting past the batsmens defence they were playing all the good balls and refused to hit at the bad  a quarter past six struck and then psmith made a suggestion which altered the game completely  why dont you have a shot this end he said to adair as they were crossing over theres a spot on the off which might help you a lot you can break like blazes if only you land on it it doesnt help my leg breaks a bit because they wont hit at them  barnes was on the point of beginning to bowl when adair took the ball from him the captain of outwoods retired to short leg with an air that suggested that he was glad to be relieved of his prominent post the next moment drummonds off stump was lying at an angle of fortyfive adair was absolutely accurate as a bowler and he had dropped his first ball right on the worn patch  two minutes later drummonds successor was retiring to the pavilion while the wicket keeper straightened the stumps again  there is nothing like a couple of unexpected wickets for altering the atmosphere of a game five minutes before sedleigh had been lethargic and without hope now there was a stir and buzz all around the ground there were twentyfive minutes to go and five wickets were down sedleigh was on top again  the next man seemed to take an age coming out as a matter of fact he walked more rapidly than a batsman usually walks to the crease  adairs third ball dropped just short of the spot the batsman hitting out was a shade too soon the ball hummed through the air a couple of feet from the ground in the direction of mid off and mike diving to the right got to it as he was falling and chucked it up  after that the thing was a walk over psmith clean bowled a man in his next over and the tail demoralized by the sudden change in the game collapsed uncompromisingly sedleigh won by thirtyfive runs with eight minutes in hand                                       psmith and mike sat in their study after lockup discussing things in general and the game in particular i feel like a beastly renegade playing against wrykyn said mike still im glad we won adairs a jolly good sort and itll make him happy for weeks  when i last saw comrade adair said psmith he was going about in a sort of trance beaming vaguely and wanting to stand people things at the shop  he bowled awfully well  yes said psmith i say i dont wish to cast a gloom over this joyful occasion in any way but you say wrykyn are going to give sedleigh a fixture again next year  well  well have you thought of the massacre which will ensue you will have left adair will have left incidentally i shall have left wrykyn will swamp them  i suppose they will still the great thing you see is to get the thing started thats what adair was so keen on now sedleigh has beaten wrykyn hes satisfied they can get fixtures with decent clubs and work up to playing the big schools youve got to start somehow so its all right you see  and besides said psmith reflectively in an emergency they can always get comrade downing to bowl for them what let us now sally out and see if we cant promote a rag of some sort in this abode of wrath comrade outwood has gone over to dinner at the school house and it would be a pity to waste a somewhat golden opportunity shall we stagger  they staggered
