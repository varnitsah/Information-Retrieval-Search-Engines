78371543	george cruikshank   by william makepeace thackeray     reprinted from the westminster review for june 1840 no 66   accusations of ingratitude and just accusations no doubt are made against every inhabitant of this wicked world and the fact is that a man who is ceaselessly engaged in its trouble and turmoil borne hither and thither upon the fierce waves of the crowd bustling shifting struggling to keep himself somewhat above waterfighting for reputation or more likely for bread and ceaselessly occupied today with plans for appeasing the eternal appetite of inevitable hunger tomorrowa man in such straits has hardly time to think of anything but himself and as in a sinking ship must make his own rush for the boats and fight struggle and trample for safety in the midst of such a combat as this the ingenious arts which prevent the ferocity of the manners and act upon them as an emollient as the philosophic bard remarks in the latin grammar are likely to be jostled to death and then forgotten the world will allow no such compromises between it and that which does not belong to itno two gods must we serve but as one has seen in some old portraits the horrible glazed eyes of necessity are always fixed upon you fly away as you will black care sits behind you and with his ceaseless gloomy croaking drowns the voice of all more cheerful companions happy he whose fortune has placed him where there is calm and plenty and who has the wisdom not to give up his quiet in quest of visionary gain  here is no doubt the reason why a man after the period of his boyhood or first youth makes so few friends want and ambition new acquaintances which are introduced to him along with his beard thrust away all other society from him some old friends remain it is true but these are become as a habita part of your selfishness and for new ones they are selfish as you are neither member of the new partnership has the capital of affection and kindly feeling or can even afford the time that is requisite for the establishment of the new firm damp and chill the shades of the prisonhouse begin to close round us and that vision splendid which has accompanied our steps in our journey daily farther from the east fades away and dies into the light of common day  and what a common day what a foggy dull shivering apology for light is this kind of muddy twilight through which we are about to tramp and flounder for the rest of our existence wandering farther and farther from the beauty and freshness and from the kindly gushing springs of clear gladness that made all around us green in our youth one wanders and gropes in a slough of stockjobbing one sinks or rises in a storm of politics and in either case it is as good to fall as to riseto mount a bubble on the crest of the wave as to sink a stone to the bottom  the reader who has seen the name affixed to the head of this article scarcely expected to be entertained with a declamation upon ingratitude youth and the vanity of human pursuits which may seem at first sight to have little to do with the subject in hand but although we reserve the privilege of discoursing upon whatever subject shall suit us and by no means admit the public has any right to ask in our sentences for any meaning or any connection whatever it happens that in this particular instance there is an undoubted connection in susans case as recorded by wordsworth what connection had the corner of wood street with a mountain ascending a vision of trees and a nest by the dove why should the song of a thrush cause bright volumes of vapor to glide through lothbury and a river to flow on through the vale of cheapside as she stood at that corner of wood street a mop and a pail in her hand most likely she heard the bird singing and straightway began pining and yearning for the days of her youth forgetting the proper business of the pail and mop even so we are moved by the sight of some of mr cruikshanks worksthe busen fuhlt sich jugendlich erschuttert the schwankende gestalten of youth flit before one againcruikshanks thrush begins to pipe and carol as in the days of boyhood hence misty moralities reflections and sad and pleasant remembrances arise he is the friend of the young especially have we not read all the storybooks that his wonderful pencil has illustrated did we not forego tarts in order to buy his breakingup or his fashionable monstrosities of the year eighteen hundred and something have we not before us at this very moment a printone of the admirable illustrations of phrenologywhich entire work was purchased by a jointstock company of boys each drawing lots afterwards for the separate prints and taking his choice in rotation the writer of this too had the honor of drawing the first lot and seized immediately upon philoprogenitivenessa marvellous print our copy is not at all improved by being colored which operation we performed on it ourselvesa marvellous print indeedfull of ingenuity and fine jovial humor a father possessor of an enormous nose and family is surrounded by the latter who are some of them embracing the former the composition writhes and twists about like the kermes of rubens no less than seven little men and women in nightcaps in frocks in bibs in breeches are clambering about the head knees and arms of the man with the nose their noses too are preternaturally developedthe twins in the cradle have noses of the most considerable kind the second daughter who is watching them the youngest but two who sits squalling in a certain wicker chair the eldest son who is yawning the eldest daughter who is preparing with the gravy of two muttonchops a savory dish of yorkshire pudding for eighteen persons the youths who are examining her operations one a literary gentleman in a remarkably neat nightcap and pinafore who has just had his finger in the pudding the genius who is at work on the slate and the two honest lads who are hugging the goodhumored washerwoman their motherall all save this worthy woman have noses of the largest size not handsome certainly are they and yet everybody must be charmed with the picture it is full of grotesque beauty the artist has at the back of his own skull we are certain a huge bump of philoprogenitiveness he loves children in his heart every one of those he has drawn is perfectly happy and jovial and affectionate and innocent as possible he makes them with large noses but he loves them and you always find something kind in the midst of his humor and the ugliness redeemed by a sly touch of beauty the smiling mother reconciles one with all the hideous family they have all something of the mother in themsomething kind and generous and tender  knights in sweetings alley fairburns in a court off ludgate hill hones in fleet streetbright enchanted palaces which george cruikshank used to people with grinning fantastical imps and merry harmless spriteswhere are they fairburns shop knows him no more not only has knight disappeared from sweetings alley but as we are given to understand sweetings alley has disappeared from the face of the globe slop the atrocious castlereagh the sainted caroline in a tight pelisse with feathers in her head the dandy of sixty who used to glance at us from hones friendly windowswhere are they mr cruikshank may have drawn a thousand better things since the days when these were but they are to us a thousand times more pleasing than anything else he has done how we used to believe in them to stray miles out of the way on holidays in order to ponder for an hour before that delightful window in sweetings alley in walks through fleet street to vanish abruptly down fairburns passage and there make one at his charming gratis exhibition there used to be a crowd round the window in those days of grinning goodnatured mechanics who spelt the songs and spoke them out for the benefit of the company and who received the points of humor with a general sympathizing roar where are these people now you never hear any laughing at hb his pictures are a great deal too genteel for thatpolite points of wit which strike one as exceedingly clever and pretty and cause one to smile in a quiet gentlemanlike kind of way  there must be no smiling with cruikshank a man who does not laugh outright is a dullard and has no heart even the old dandy of sixty must have laughed at his own wondrous grotesque image as they say louis philippe did who saw all the caricatures that were made of himself and there are some of cruikshanks designs which have the blessed faculty of creating laughter as often as you see them as diggory says in the play who is bidden by his master not to laugh while waiting at tabledont tell the story of grouse in the gunroom master or i cant help laughing repeat that history ever so often and at the proper moment honest diggory is sure to explode every man no doubt who loves cruikshank has his grouse in the gunroom there is a fellow in the points of humor who is offering to eat up a certain little general that has made us happy any time these sixteen years his huge mouth is a perpetual well of laughterbuckets full of fun can be drawn from it we have formed no such friendships as that boyish one of the man with the mouth but though in our eyes mr cruikshank reached his apogee some eighteen years since it must not be imagined that such is really the case eighteen sets of children have since then learned to love and admire him and may many more of their successors be brought up in the same delightful faith it is not the artist who fails but the men who grow coldthe men from whom the illusions why illusions realities of youth disappear one by one who have no leisure to be happy no blessed holidays but only fresh cares at midsummer and christmas being the inevitable seasons which bring us bills instead of pleasures tom who comes bounding home from school has the doctors account in his trunk and his father goes to sleep at the pantomime to which he takes him pater infelix you too have laughed at clown and the magic wand of spangled harlequin what delightful enchantment did it wave around you in the golden days when george the third was king but our clown lies in his grave and our harlequin ellar prince of how many enchanted islands was he not at bow street the other day in his dirty tattered faded motleyseized as a lawbreaker for acting at a penny theatre after having wellnigh starved in the streets where nobody would listen to his old guitar no one gave a shilling to bless him not one of us who owe him so much        this was written in 1840  we know not if mr cruikshank will be very well pleased at finding his name in such company as that of clown and harlequin but he like them is certainly the childrens friend his drawings abound in feeling for these little ones and hideous as in the course of his duty he is from time to time compelled to design them he never sketches one without a certain pity for it and imparting to the figure a certain grotesque grace in happy schoolboys he revels plumpudding and holidays his needle has engraved over and over again there is a design in one of the comic almanacs of some young gentlemen who are employed in administering to a schoolfellow the correction of the pump which is as graceful and elegant as a drawing of stothard dull books about children george cruikshank makes bright with illustrationsthere is one published by the ingenious and opulent mr tegg it is entitled mirth and morality the mirth being for the most part on the side of the designerthe morality unexceptionable certainly the authors capital here are then to these moralities a smiling train of mirths supplied by george cruikshank see yonder little fellows butterflyhunting across a common such a light brisk airy gentlemanlike drawing was never made upon such a theme who cries the author           who has not chased the butterfly             and crushed its slender legs and wings           and heaved a moralizing sigh             alas how frail are human things  a very unexceptionable morality truly but it would have puzzled another than george cruikshank to make mirth out of it as he has done away surely not on the wings of these verses cruikshanks imagination begins to soar and he makes us three darling little men on a green common backed by old farmhouses somewhere about may a great mixture of blue and clouds in the air a strong fresh breeze stirring toms jacket flapping in the same in order to bring down the insect queen or king of spring that is fluttering above himhe renders all this with a few strokes on a little block of wood not two inches square upon which one may gaze for hours so merry and lifelike a scene does it present what a charming creative power is this what a privilegeto be a god and create little worlds upon paper and whole generations of smiling jovial men women and children half inch high whose portraits are carried abroad and have the faculty of making us monsters of six feet curious and happy in our turn now who would imagine that an artist could make anything of such a subject as this the writer begins by stating           i love to go back to the days of my youth             and to reckon my joys to the letter           and to count oer the friends that i have in the world             ay and those who are gone to a better  this brings him to the consideration of his uncle of all the men i have ever known says he my uncle united the greatest degree of cheerfulness with the sobriety of manhood though a man when i was a boy he was yet one of the most agreeable companions i ever possessed    he embarked for america and nearly twenty years passed by before he came back again    but oh how alteredhe was in every sense of the word an old man his body and mind were enfeebled and second childishness had come upon him how often have i bent over him vainly endeavoring to recall to his memory the scenes we had shared together and how frequently with an aching heart have i gazed on his vacant and lustreless eye while he has amused himself in clapping his hands and singing with a quavering voice a verse of a psalm alas such are the consequences of long residences in america and of old age even in uncles well the point of this morality is that the uncle one day in the morning of life vowed that he would catch his two nephews and tie them together ay and actually did so for all the efforts the rogues made to run away from him but he was so fatigued that he declared he never would make the attempt again whereupon the nephew remarksoften since then when engaged in enterprises beyond my strength have i called to mind the determination of my uncle  does it not seem impossible to make a picture out of this and yet george cruikshank has produced a charming design in which the uncles and nephews are so prettily portrayed that one is reconciled to their existence with all their moralities many more of the mirths in this little book are excellent especially a great figure of a parson entering church on horsebackan enormous parson truly calm unconscious unwieldy as zeuxis had a bevy of virgins in order to make his famous picturehis express virgina clerical host must have passed under cruikshanks eyes before he sketched this little enormous parson of parsons  being on the subject of childrens books how shall we enough praise the delightful german nurserytales and cruikshanks illustrations of them we coupled his name with pantomime awhile since and sure never pantomimes were more charming than these of all the artists that ever drew from michael angelo upwards and downwards cruikshank was the man to illustrate these tales and give them just the proper admixture of the grotesque the wonderful and the graceful may all mother bunchs collection be similarly indebted to him may jack the giant killer may tom thumb may puss in boots be one day revivified by his pencil is not whittington sitting yet on highgate hill and poor cinderella in that sweetest of all fairy stories still pining in her lonely chimneynook a man who has a true affection for these delightful companions of his youth is bound to be grateful to them if he can and we pray mr cruikshank to remember them  it is folly to say that this or that kind of humor is too good for the public that only a chosen few can relish it the best humor that we know of has been as eagerly received by the public as by the most delicate connoisseur there is hardly a man in england who can read but will laugh at falstaff and the humor of joseph andrews and honest mr pickwicks story can be felt and loved by any person above the age of six some may have a keener enjoyment of it than others but all the world can be merry over it and is always ready to welcome it the best criterion of good humor is success and what a share of this has mr cruikshank had how many millions of mortals has he made happy we have heard very profound persons talk philosophically of the marvellous and mysterious manner in which he has suited himself to the timefait vibrer la fibre populaire as napoleon boasted of himself supplied a peculiar want felt at a peculiar period the simple secret of which is as we take it that he living amongst the public has with them a general widehearted sympathy that he laughs at what they laugh at that he has a kindly spirit of enjoyment with not a morsel of mysticism in his composition that he pities and loves the poor and jokes at the follies of the great and that he addresses all in a perfectly sincere and manly way to be greatly successful as a professional humorist as in any other calling a man must be quite honest and show that his heart is in his work a bad preacher will get admiration and a hearing with this point in his favor where a man of three times his acquirements will only find indifference and coldness is any man more remarkable than our artist for telling the truth after his own manner hogarths honesty of purpose was as conspicuous in an earlier time and we fancy that gilray would have been far more successful and more powerful but for that unhappy bribe which turned the whole course of his humor into an unnatural channel cruikshank would not for any bribe say what he did not think or lend his aid to sneer down anything meritorious or to praise any thing or person that deserved censure when he levelled his wit against the regent and did his very prettiest for the princess he most certainly believed along with the great body of the people whom he represents that the princess was the most spotless puremannered darling of a princess that ever married a heartless debauchee of a prince royal did not millions believe with him and noble and learned lords take their oaths to her royal highnesss innocence cruikshank would not stand by and see a woman illused and so struck in for her rescue he and the people belaboring with all their might the party who were making the attack and determining from pure sympathy and indignation that the woman must be innocent because her husband treated her so foully  to be sure we have never heard so much from mr cruikshanks own lips but any man who will examine these odd drawings which first made him famous will see what an honest hearty hatred the champion of woman has for all who abuse her and will admire the energy with which he flings his woodblocks at all who side against her canning castlereagh bexley sidmouth he is at them one and all and as for the prince up to what a whippingpost of ridicule did he tie that unfortunate old man and do not let squeamish tories cry out about disloyalty if the crown does wrong the crown must be corrected by the nation out of respect of course for the crown in those days and by those people who so bitterly attacked the son no word was ever breathed against the father simply because he was a good husband and a sober thrifty pious orderly man  this attack upon the prince regent we believe to have been mr cruikshanks only effort as a party politician some early manifestoes against napoleon we find it is true done in the regular john bull style with the gilray model for the little upstart corsican but as soon as the emperor had yielded to stern fortune our artists heart relented as berangers did on the other side of the water and many of our readers will doubtless recollect a fine drawing of louis xviii trying on napoleons boots which did not certainly fit the gouty son of saint louis such satirical hits as these however must not be considered as political or as anything more than the expression of the artists national british idea of frenchmen  it must be confessed that for that great nation mr cruikshank entertains a considerable contempt let the reader examine the life in paris or the five hundred designs in which frenchmen are introduced and he will find them almost invariably thin with ludicrous spindleshanks pigtails outstretched hands shrugging shoulders and queer hair and mustachios he has the british idea of a frenchman and if he does not believe that the inhabitants of france are for the most part dancingmasters and barbers yet takes care to depict such in preference and would not speak too well of them it is curious how these traditions endure in france at the present moment the englishman on the stage is the caricatured englishman at the time of the war with a shock red head a long white coat and invariable gaiters those who wish to study this subject should peruse monsieur paul de kocks histories of lord boulingrog and lady crockmilove on the other hand the old emigre has taken his station amongst us and we doubt if a good british gallery would understand that such and such a character was a frenchman unless he appeared in the ancient traditional costume  a curious book called life in paris published in 1822 contains a number of the artists plates in the aquatint style and though we believe he had never been in that capital the designs have a great deal of life in them and pass muster very well a villanous race of shouldershrugging mortals are his frenchmen indeed and the heroes of the tale a certain mr dick wildfire squire jenkins and captain oshuffleton are made to show the true british superiority on every occasion when britons and french are brought together this book was one among the many that the designers genius has caused to be popular the plates are not carefully executed but being colored have a pleasant lively look the same style was adopted in the once famous book called tom and jerry or life in london which must have a word of notice here for although by no means mr cruikshanks best work his reputation was extraordinarily raised by it tom and jerry were as popular twenty years since as mr pickwick and sam weller now are and often have we wished while reading the biographies of the latter celebrated personages that they had been described as well by mr cruikshanks pencil as by mr dickenss pen  as for tom and jerry to show the mutability of human affairs and the evanescent nature of reputation we have been to the british museum and no less than five circulating libraries in quest of the book and life in london alas is not to be found at any one of them we can only therefore speak of the work from recollection but have still a very clear remembrance of the leather gaiters of jerry hawthorn the green spectacles of logic and the hooked nose of corinthian tom they were the schoolboys delight and in the days when the work appeared we firmly believed the three heroes above named to be types of the most elegant fashionable young fellows the town afforded and thought their occupations and amusements were those of all highbred english gentlemen tom knocking down the watchman at temple bar tom and jerry dancing at almacks or flirting in the saloon at the theatre at the nighthouses after the play at tom cribbs examining the silver cup then in the possession of that champion at the chambers of bob logic who seated at a cabinet piano plays a waltz to which corinthian tom and kate are dancing ambling gallantly in rotten row or examining the poor fellow at newgate who was having his chains knocked off before hanging all these scenes remain indelibly engraved upon the mind and so far we are independent of all the circulating libraries in london  as to the literary contents of the book they have passed sheer away it was most likely not particularly refined nay the chances are that it was absolutely vulgar but it must have had some merit of its own that is clear it must have given striking descriptions of life in some part or other of london for all london read it and went to see it in its dramatic shape the artist it is said wished to close the career of the three heroes by bringing them all to ruin but the writer or publishers would not allow any such melancholy subjects to dash the merriment of the public and we believe tom jerry and logic were married off at the end of the tale as if they had been the most moral personages in the world there is some goodness in this pity which authors and the public are disposed to show towards certain agreeable disreputable characters of romance who would mar the prospects of honest roderick random or charles surface or tom jones only a very stern moralist indeed and in regard of jerry hawthorn and that hero without a surname corinthian tom mr cruikshank we make little doubt was glad in his heart that he was not allowed to have his own way  soon after the tom and jerry and the life in paris mr cruikshank produced a much more elaborate set of prints in a work which was called points of humor these points were selected from various comic works and did not we believe extend beyond a couple of numbers containing about a score of copperplates the collector of humorous designs cannot fail to have them in his portfolio for they contain some of the very best efforts of mr cruikshanks genius and though not quite so highly labored as some of his later productions are none the worse in our opinion for their comparative want of finish all the effects are perfectly given and the expression is as good as it could be in the most delicate engraving upon steel the artists style too was then completely formed and for our parts we should say that we preferred his manner of 1825 to any other which he has adopted since the first picture which is called the point of honor illustrates the old story of the officer who on being accused of cowardice for refusing to fight a duel came among his brother officers and flung a lighted grenade down upon the floor before which his comrades fled ignominiously this design is capital and the outward rush of heroes walking trampling twisting scuffling at the door is in the best style of the grotesque you see but the back of most of these gentlemen into which nevertheless the artist has managed to throw an expression of ludicrous agony that one could scarcely have expected to find in such a part of the human figure the next plate is not less good it represents a couple who having been found one night tipsy and lying in the same gutter were by a charitable though misguided gentleman supposed to be man and wife and put comfortably to bed together the morning came fancy the surprise of this interesting pair when they awoke and discovered their situation fancy the manner too in which cruikshank has depicted them to which words cannot do justice it is needless to state that this fortuitous and temporary union was followed by one more lasting and sentimental and that these two worthy persons were married and lived happily ever after  we should like to go through every one of these prints there is the jolly miller who returning home at night calls upon his wife to get him a supper and falls to upon rashers of bacon and ale how he gormandizes that jolly miller rasher after rasher how they pass away frizzling and smoking from the gridiron down that immense grinning gulf of a mouth poor wife how she pines and frets at that untimely hour of midnight to be obliged to fry fry fry perpetually and minister to the monsters appetite and yonder in the clock what agonized face is that we see by heavens it is the squire of the parish what business has he there let us not ask suffice it to say that he has in the hurry of the moment left up stairs his br hispsha a part of his dress in short with a number of banknotes in the pockets look in the next page and you will see the ferocious bacondevouring ruffian of a miller is actually causing this garment to be carried through the village and cried by the towncrier and we blush to be obliged to say that the demoralized miller never offered to return the banknotes although he was so mighty scrupulous in endeavoring to find an owner for the corduroy portfolio in which he had found them  passing from this painful subject we come we regret to state to a series of prints representing personages not a whit more moral burnss famous jolly beggars have all had their portraits drawn by cruikshank there is the lovely hempen widow quite as interesting and romantic as the famous mrs sheppard who has at the lamented demise of her husband adopted the very same consolation       my curse upon them every one      theyve hanged my braw john highlandman                               and now a widow i must mourn      departed joys that neer return      no comfort but a hearty can      when i think on john highlandman  sweet raucle carlin she has none of the sentimentality of the english highwaymans lady but being wooed by a tinker and       a pigmy scraper wi his fiddle      wha usd to trystes and fairs to driddle  prefers the practical to the merely musical man the tinker sings with a noble candor worthy of a fellow of his strength of body and station in life           my bonnie lass i work in brass             a tinker is my station           ive travelld round all christian ground             in this my occupation           ive taen the gold ive been enrolld             in many a noble squadron           but vain they searchd when off i marchd             to go an clout the caudron  it was his ruling passion what was military glory to him forsooth he had the greatest contempt for it and loved freedom and his copper kettle a thousand times bettera kind of hardware diogenes of fiddling he has no better opinion the picture represents the sturdy caird taking poor gutscraper by the bearddrawing his roosty rapier and swearing to speet him like a pliver unless he would relinquish the bonnie lassie for ever           wi ghastly ee poor tweedledee             upon his hunkers bended           an prayd for grace wi ruefu face             an so the quarrel ended  hark how the tinker apostrophizes the violinist stating to the widow at the same time the advantages which she might expect from an alliance with himself           despise that shrimp that withered imp             wi a his noise and caperin           and take a share with those that bear             the budget and the apron           and by that stowp my faith an houpe             an by that dear kilbaigie           if eer ye want or meet wi scant             may i neer weet my craigie  cruikshanks caird is a noble creature his face and figure show him to be fully capable of doing and saying all that is above written of him  in the second part the old tale of the three hunchbacked fiddlers is illustrated with equal felicity the famous classical dinners and duel in peregrine pickle are also excellent in their way and the connoisseur of prints and etchings may see in the latter plate and in another in this volume how great the artists mechanical skill is as an etcher the distant view of the city in the duel and of a marketplace in the quack doctor are delightful specimens of the artists skill in depicting buildings and backgrounds they are touched with a grace truth and dexterity of workmanship that leave nothing to desire we have before mentioned the man with the mouth which appears in this number emblematical of gout and indigestion in which the artist has shown all the fancy of callot little demons with long saws for noses are making dreadful incisions into the toes of the unhappy sufferer some are bringing pans of hot coals to keep the wounded member warm a huge solemn nightmare sits on the invalids chest staring solemnly into his eyes a monster with a pair of drumsticks is banging a devils tattoo on his forehead and a pair of imps are nailing great tenpenny nails into his hands to make his happiness complete  the late mr clarks excellent work three courses and a dessert was published at a time when the rage for comic stories was not so great as it since has been and messrs clark and cruikshank only sold their hundreds where messrs dickens and phiz dispose of their thousands but if our recommendation can in any way influence the reader we would enjoin him to have a copy of the three courses that contains some of the best designs of our artist and some of the most amusing tales in our language the invention of the pictures for which mr clark takes credit to himself says a great deal for his wit and fancy can we for instance praise too highly the man who invented that wonderful oyster  examine him well his beard his pearl his little round stomach and his sweet smile only oysters know how to smile in this way cool gentle waggish and yet inexpressibly innocent and winning dando himself must have allowed such an artless native to go free and consigned him to the glassy cool translucent wave again  in writing upon such subjects as these with which we have been furnished it can hardly be expected that we should follow any fixed plan and orderwe must therefore take such advantage as we may and seize upon our subject when and wherever we can lay hold of him  for jews sailors irishmen hessian boots little boys beadles policemen tall lifeguardsmen charity children pumps dustmen very short pantaloons dandies in spectacles and ladies with aquiline noses remarkably taper waists and wonderfully long ringlets mr cruikshank has a special predilection the tribe of israelites he has studied with amazing gusto witness the jew in mr ainsworths jack sheppard and the immortal fagin of oliver twist whereabouts lies the comic vis in these persons and things why should a beadle be comic and his opposite a charity boy why should a tall lifeguardsman have something in him essentially absurd why are short breeches more ridiculous than long what is there particularly jocose about a pump and wherefore does a long nose always provoke the beholder to laughter these points may be metaphysically elucidated by those who list it is probable that mr cruikshank could not give an accurate definition of that which is ridiculous in these objects but his instinct has told him that fun lurks in them and cold must be the heart that can pass by the pantaloons of his charity boys the hessian boots of his dandies and the fantail hats of his dustmen without respectful wonder  he has made a complete little gallery of dustmen there is in the first place the professional dustman who having in the enthusiastic exercise of his delightful trade laid hands upon property not strictly his own is pursued we presume by the right owner from whom he flies as fast as his crooked shanks will carry him  what a curious picture it isthe horrid rickety houses in some dingy suburb of london the grinning cobbler the smothered butcher the very trees which are covered with dustit is fine to look at the different expressions of the two interesting fugitives the fiery charioteer who belabors the poor donkey has still a glance for his brother on foot on whom punishment is about to descend and not a little curious is it to think of the creative power of the man who has arranged this little tale of low life how logically it is conducted how cleverly each one of the accessories is made to contribute to the effect of the whole what a deal of thought and humor has the artist expended on this little block of wood a large picture might have been painted out of the very same materials which mr cruikshank out of his wondrous fund of merriment and observation can afford to throw away upon a drawing not two inches long from the practical dustmen we pass to those purely poetical there are three of them who rise on clouds of their own raising the very genii of the sack and shovel  is there no one to write a sonnet to theseand yet a whole poem was written about peter bell the wagoner a character by no means so poetic  and lastly we have the dustman in love the honest fellow having seen a young beauty stepping out of a ginshop on a sunday morning is pressing eagerly his suit  gin has furnished many subjects to mr cruikshank who labors in his own sound and hearty way to teach his countrymen the dangers of that drink in the sketchbook is a plate upon the subject remarkable for fancy and beauty of design it is called the gin juggernaut and represents a hideous moving palace with a reeking still at the roof and vast ginbarrels for wheels under which unhappy millions are crushed to death an immense black cloud of desolation covers over the country through which the gin monster has passed dimly looming through the darkness whereof you see an agreeable prospect of gibbets with men dangling burnt houses c the vast cloud comes sweeping on in the wake of this horrible bodycrusher and you see by way of contrast a distant smiling sunshiny tract of old english country where gin as yet is not known the allegory is as good as earnest and as fanciful as one of john bunyans and we have often fancied there was a similarity between the men  the render will examine the work called my sketchbook with not a little amusement and may gather from it as we fancy a good deal of information regarding the character of the individual man george cruikshank what points strike his eye as a painter what move his anger or admiration as a moralist what classes he seems most especially disposed to observe and what to ridicule there are quacks of all kinds to whom he has a mortal hatred quack dandies who assume under his pencil perhaps in his eye the most grotesque appearance possibletheir hats grow larger their legs infinitely more crooked and lean the tassels of their canes swell out to a most preposterous size the tails of their coats dwindle away and finish where coattails generally begin let us lay a wager that cruikshank a man of the people if ever there was one heartily hates and despises these supercilious swaggering young gentlemen and his contempt is not a whit the less laudable because there may be tant soit peu of prejudice in it it is right and wholesome to scorn dandies as nelson said it was to hate frenchmen in which sentiment as we have before said george cruikshank undoubtedly shares in the sunday in london monsieur the chef is instructing a kitchenmaid how to compound some rascally french kickshaw or the othera pretty scoundrel truly with what an air he wears that nightcap of his and shrugs his lank shoulders and chatters and ogles and grins they are all the same these mounseers there are other two fellowsmorbleu one is putting his dirty fingers into the saucepan there are frogs cooking in it no doubt and just over some other dish of abomination another dirty rascal is taking snuff never mind the sauce wont be hurt by a few ingredients more or less three such fellows as these are not worth one englishman thats clear there is one in the very midst of them the great burly fellow with the beef he could beat all three in five minutes we cannot be certain that such was the process going on in mr cruikshanks mind when he made the design but some feelings of the sort were no doubt entertained by him        the following linesever freshby the author of      headlong hall published years ago in the globe and      traveller are an excellent comment on several of the cuts      from the sunday in london                          i           the poor mans sins are glaring           in the face of ghostly warning             he is caught in the fact             of an overt act           buying greens on sunday morning                         ii           the rich mans sins are hidden           in the pomp of wealth and station             and escape the sight             of the children of light           who are wise in their generation                        iii           the rich man has a kitchen           and cooks to dress his dinner             the poor who would roast             to the bakers must post           and thus becomes a sinner                         iv           the rich mans painted windows           hide the concerts of the quality             the poor can but share             a crackd fiddle in the air           which offends all sound morality                          v           the rich man has a cellar           and a ready butler by him             the poor must steer             for his pint of beer           where the saint cant choose but spy him                         vi           this rich man is invisible           in the crowd of his gay society             but the poor mans delight             is a sore in the sight           and a stench in the nose of piety  against dandy footmen he is particularly severe he hates idlers pretenders boasters and punishes these fellows as best he may who does not recollect the famous picture what is taxes thomas what is taxes indeed well may that vast overfed lounging flunky ask the question of his associate thomas and yet not well for all that thomas says in reply is i dont know o beati plushicolae what a charming state of ignorance is yours in the sketchbook many footmen make their appearance one is a huge fat hercules of a portman square porter who calmly surveys another poor fellow a porter likewise but out of livery who comes staggering forward with a box that hercules might lift with his little finger will hercules do so not he the giant can carry nothing heavier than a cockedhat note on a silver tray and his labors are to walk from his sentrybox to the door and from the door back to his sentrybox and to read the sunday paper and to poke the hall fire twice or thrice and to make five meals a day such a fellow does cruikshank hate and scorn worse even than a frenchman  the mans master too comes in for no small share of our artists wrath there is a company of them at church who humbly designate themselves miserable sinners miserable sinners indeed oh what floods of turtlesoup what tons of turbot and lobstersauce must have been sacrificed to make those sinners properly miserable my lady with the ermine tippet and draggling feather can we not see that she lives in portland place and is the wife of an east india director she has been to the opera overnight indeed her husband on her right with his fat hand dangling over the pewdoor is at this minute thinking of mademoiselle leocadie whom he saw behind the scenesshe has been at the opera overnight which with a trifle of supper afterwardsa whiteandbrown soup a lobstersalad some woodcocks and a little champagnesent her to bed quite comfortable at halfpast eight her maid brings her chocolate in bed at ten she has fresh eggs and muffins with perhaps a halfhundred of prawns for breakfast and so can get over the day and the sermon till lunchtime pretty well what an odor of musk and bergamot exhales from the pewhow it is wadded and stuffed and spangled over with brass nails what hassocks are there for those who are not too fat to kneel what a flustering and flapping of gilt prayerbooks and what a pious whirring of bible leaves one hears all over the church as the doctor blandly gives out the text to be miserable at this rate you must at the very least have four thousand a year and many persons are there so enamored of grief and sin that they would willingly take the risk of the misery to have a lifeinterest in the consols that accompany it quite careless about consequences and sceptical as to the notion that a day is at hand when you must fulfil your share of the bargain  our artist loves to joke at a soldier in whose livery there appears to him to be something almost as ridiculous as in the uniform of the gentleman of the shoulderknot tall lifeguardsmen and fierce grenadiers figure in many of his designs and almost always in a ridiculous way here again we have the honest popular english feeling which jeers at pomp or pretension of all kinds and is especially jealous of all display of military authority raw recruit ditto dressed ditto served up as we see them in the sketchbook are so many satires upon the army hodge with his ribbons flaunting in his hat or with red coat and musket drilled stiff and pompous or at last minus leg and arm tottering about on crutches does not fill our english artist with the enthusiasm that follows the soldier in every other part of europe jeanjean the conscript in france is laughed at to be sure but then it is because he is a bad soldier when he comes to have a huge pair of mustachios and the croixdhonneur to briller on his poitrine cicatrisee jeanjean becomes a member of a class that is more respected than any other in the french nation the veteran soldier inspires our people with no such awewe hold that democratic weapon the fist in much more honor than the sabre and bayonet and laugh at a man tricked out in scarlet and pipeclay  that regiment of heroes is marching to divine service to the tune of the british grenadiers there they march in state and a pretty contempt our artist shows for all their gimcracks and trumpery he has drawn a perfectly english scenethe little blackguard boys are playing pranks round about the men and shouting heads up soldier eyes right lobster as little british urchins will do did one ever hear the like sentiments expressed in france shade of napoleon we insult you by asking the question in england however see how different the case is and designedly or undesignedly the artist has opened to us a piece of his mind in the crowd the only person who admires the soldiers is the poor idiot whose pocket a rogue is picking there is another picture in which the sentiment is much the same only as in the former drawing we see englishmen laughing at the troops of the line here are irishmen giggling at the militia  we have said that our artist has a great love for the drolleries of the green island would any one doubt what was the country of the merry fellows depicted in his group of paddies           place me amid orourkes otooles             the ragged royal race of tara           or place me where dick martin rules             the pathless wilds of connemara  we know not if mr cruikshank has ever had any such good luck as to see the irish in ireland itself but he certainly has obtained a knowledge of their looks as if the country had been all his life familiar to him could mr oconnell himself desire anything more national than the scene of a drunken row or could father mathew have a better text to preach upon there is not a broken nose in the room that is not thoroughly irish  we have then a couple of compositions treated in a graver manner as characteristic too as the other we call attention to the comical look of poor teague who has been pursued and beaten by the witchs stick in order to point out also the singular neatness of the workmanship and the pretty fanciful little glimpse of landscape that the artist has introduced in the background mr cruikshank has a fine eye for such homely landscapes and renders them with great delicacy and taste old villages farmyards groups of stacks queer chimneys churches gableended cottages elizabethan mansionhouses and other old english scenes he depicts with evident enthusiasm  famous books in their day were cruikshanks john gilpin and epping hunt for though our artist does not draw horses very scientificallyto use a phrase of the atelierhe feels them very keenly and his queer animals after one is used to them answer quite as well as better neither is he very happy in trees and such rustical produce or rather we should say he is very original his trees being decidedly of his own make and composition not imitated from any master  but what then can a man be supposed to imitate everything we know what the noblest study of mankind is and to this mr cruikshank has confined himself that postilion with the people in the brokendown chaise roaring after him is as deaf as the post by which he passes suppose all the accessories were away could not one swear that the man was stonedeaf beyond the reach of trumpet what is the peculiar character in a deaf mans physiognomycan any person define it satisfactorily in wordsnot in pages and mr cruikshank has expressed it on a piece of paper not so big as the tenth part of your thumbnail the horses of john gilpin are much more of the equestrian order and as here the artist has only his favorite suburban buildings to draw not a word is to be said against his design the inn and old buildings are charmingly designed and nothing can be more prettily or playfully touched           at edmonton his loving wife             from the balcony spied           her tender husband wondring much             to see how he did ride           stop stop john gilpin  heres the house             they all at once did cry           the dinner waits and we are tired             said gilpinso am i           six gentlemen upon the road             thus seeing gilpin fly           with postboy scampring in the rear             they raised the hue and cry           stop thief stop thiefa highwayman             not one of them was mute           and all and each that passed that way             did join in the pursuit           and now the turnpike gates again             flew open in short space           the tollmen thinking as before             that gilpin rode a race  the rush and shouting and clatter are excellently depicted by the artist and we who have been scoffing at his manner of designing animals must here make a special exception in favor of the hens and chickens each has a different action and is curiously natural  happy are children of all ages who have such a ballad and such pictures as this in store for them it is a comfort to think that woodcuts never wear out and that the book still may be had for a shilling for those who can command that sum of money  in the epping hunt which we owe to the facetious pen of mr hood our artist has not been so successful there is here too much horsemanship and not enough incident for him but the portrait of roundings the huntsman is an excellent sketch and a couple of the designs contain great humor the first represents the cockney hero who like a bird was singing out while sitting on a tree  and in the second the natural order is reversed the stag having taken heart is hunting the huntsman and the cheapside nimrod is most ignominiously running away  the easter hunt we are told is no more and as the quarterly review recommends the british public to purchase mr catlins pictures as they form the only record of an interesting race now rapidly passing away in like manner we should exhort all our friends to purchase mr cruikshanks designs of another interesting race that is run already and for the last time  besides these we must mention in the line of our duty the notable tragedies of tom thumb and bombastes furioso both of which have appeared with many illustrations by mr cruikshank the brave army of bombastes exhibits a terrific display of brutal force which must shock the sensibilities of an english radical and we can well understand the caution of the general who bids this soldatesque effrenee to begone and not to kick up a row  such a troop of lawless ruffians let loose upon a populous city would play sad havoc in it and we fancy the massacres of birmingham renewed or at least of badajoz which though not quite so dreadful if we may believe his grace the duke of wellington as the former scenes of slaughter were nevertheless severe enough but we must not venture upon any illtimed pleasantries in presence of the disturbed king arthur and the awful ghost of gaffer thumb  we are thus carried at once into the supernatural and here we find cruikshank reigning supreme he has invented in his time a little comic pandemonium peopled with the most droll goodnatured fiends possible we have before us chamissos peter schlemihl with cruikshanks designs translated into german and gaining nothing by the change the kinder und hansmaerchen of grimm are likewise ornamented with a frontispiece copied from that one which appeared to the amusing version of the english work the books on phrenology and time have been imitated by the same nation and even in france whither reputation travels slower than to any country except china we have seen copies of the works of george cruikshank  he in return has complimented the french by illustrating a couple of lives of napoleon and the life in paris before mentioned he has also made designs for victor hugos hans of iceland strange wild etchings were those on a strange mad subject not so good in our notion as the designs for the german books the peculiar humor of which latter seemed to suit the artist exactly there is a mixture of the awful and the ridiculous in these which perpetually excites and keeps awake the readers attention the german writer and the english artist seem to have an entire faith in their subject the reader no doubt remembers the awful passage in peter schlemihl where the little gentleman purchases the shadow of that herohave the kindness noble sir to examine and try this bag he put his hand into his pocket and drew thence a tolerably large bag of cordovan leather to which a couple of thongs were fixed i took it from him and immediately counted out ten gold pieces and ten more and ten more and still other ten whereupon i held out my hand to him done said i it is a bargain you shall have my shadow for your bag the bargain was concluded he knelt down before me and i saw him with a wonderful neatness take my shadow from head to foot lightly lift it up from the grass roll and fold it up neatly and at last pocket it he then rose up bowed to me once more and walked away again disappearing behind the rose bushes i dont know but i thought i heard him laughing a little i however kept fast hold of the bag everything around me was bright in the sun and as yet i gave no thought to what i had done  this marvellous event narrated by peter with such a faithful circumstantial detail is painted by cruikshank in the most wonderful poetic way with that happy mixture of the real and supernatural that makes the narrative so curious and like truth the sun is shining with the utmost brilliancy in a great quiet park or garden there is a palace in the background and a statue basking in the sun quite lonely and melancholy there is a sundial on which is a deep shadow and in the front stands peter schlemihl bag in hand the old gentleman is down on his knees to him and has just lifted off the ground the shadow of one leg he is going to fold it back neatly as one does the tails of a coat and will stow it without any creases or crumples along with the other black garments that lie in that immense pocket of his cruikshank has designed all this as if he had a very serious belief in the story he laughs to be sure but one fancies that he is a little frightened in his heart in spite of all his fun and joking  the german tales we have mentioned before the prince riding on the fox hans in luck the fiddler and his goose heads off are all drawings which albeit not before us now nor seen for ten years remain indelibly fixed on the memory heisst du etwa rumpelstilzchen there sits the queen on her throne surrounded by grinning beefeaters and little rumpelstiltskin stamps his foot through the floor in the excess of his tremendous despair in one of these german tales if we remember rightly there is an account of a little orphan who is carried away by a pitying fairy for a term of seven years and passing that period of sweet apprenticeship among the imps and sprites of fairyland has our artist been among the same company and brought back their portraits in his sketchbook he is the only designer fairyland has had callots imps for all their strangeness are only of the earth earthy fuselis fairies belong to the infernal regions they are monstrous lurid and hideously melancholy mr cruikshank alone has had a true insight into the character of the little people they are something like men and women and yet not flesh and blood they are laughing and mischievous but why we know not mr cruikshank however has had some dream or the other or else a natural mysterious instinct as the seherinn of prevorst had for beholding ghosts or else some preternatural fairy revelation which has made him acquainted with the looks and ways of the fantastical subjects of oberon and titania  we have unfortunately no fairy portraits but on the other hand can descend lower than fairyland and have seen some fine specimens of devils one has already been raised and the reader has seen him tempting a fat dutch burgomaster in an ancient gloomy marketplace such as george cruikshank can draw as well as mr prout mr nash or any man living there is our friend once more our friend the burgomaster in a highly excited state and running as hard as his great legs will carry him with our mutual enemy at his tail  what are the bets will that longlegged bondholder of a devil come up with the honest dutchman it serves him right why did he put his name to stamped paper and yet we should not wonder if some lucky chance should turn up in the burgomasters favor and his infernal creditor lose his labor for one so proverbially cunning as yonder tall individual with the saucer eyes it must be confessed that he has been very often outwitted  there is for instance the case of the gentleman in black which has been illustrated by our artist a young french gentleman by name m desonge who having expended his patrimony in a variety of taverns and gaminghouses was one day pondering upon the exhausted state of his finances and utterly at a loss to think how he should provide means for future support exclaimed very naturally what the devil shall i do he had no sooner spoken than a gentleman in black made his appearance whose authentic portrait mr cruikshank has had the honor to paint this gentleman produced a blackedged book out of a black bag some blackedged papers tied up with black crape and sitting down familiarly opposite m desonge began conversing with him on the state of his affairs  it is needless to state what was the result of the interview m desonge was induced by the gentleman to sign his name to one of the blackedged papers and found himself at the close of the conversation to be possessed of an unlimited command of capital this arrangement completed the gentleman in black posted in an extraordinarily rapid manner from paris to london there found a young english merchant in exactly the same situation in which m desonge had been and concluded a bargain with the briton of exactly the same nature  the book goes on to relate how these young men spent the money so miraculously handed over to them and how both when the period drew near that was to witness the performance of their part of the bargain grew melancholy wretched nay so absolutely dishonorable as to seek for every means of breaking through their agreement the englishman living in a country where the lawyers are more astute than any other lawyers in the world took the advice of a mr bagsby of lyons inn whose name as we cannot find it in the law list we presume to be fictitious who could it be that was a match for the devil lord  very likely we shall not give his name but let every reader of this review fill up the blank according to his own fancy and on comparing it with the copy purchased by his neighbors he will find that fifteen out of twenty have written down the same honored name  well the gentleman in black was anxious for the fulfilment of his bond the parties met at mr bagsbys chambers to consult the black gentleman foolishly thinking that he could act as his own counsel and fearing no attorney alive but mark the superiority of british law and see how the black pettifogger was defeated  mr bagsby simply stated that he would take the case into chancery and his antagonist utterly humiliated and defeated refused to move a step farther in the matter  and now the french gentleman m desonge hearing of his friends escape became anxious to be free from his own rash engagements he employed the same counsel who had been successful in the former instance but the gentleman in black was a great deal wiser by this time and whether m desonge escaped or whether he is now in that extensive place which is paved with good intentions we shall not say those who are anxious to know had better purchase the book wherein all these interesting matters are duly set down there is one more diabolical picture in our budget engraved by mr thompson the same dexterous artist who has rendered the former diableries so well  we may mention mr thompsons name as among the first of the engravers to whom cruikshanks designs have been entrusted and next to him if we may be allowed to make such arbitrary distinctions we may place mr williams and the reader is not possibly aware of the immense difficulties to be overcome in the rendering of these little sketches which traced by the designer in a few hours require weeks labor from the engraver mr cruikshank has not been educated in the regular schools of drawing very luckily for him as we think and consequently has had to make a manner for himself which is quite unlike that of any other draftsman there is nothing in the least mechanical about it to produce his particular effects he uses his own particular lines which are queer free fantastical and must be followed in all their infinite twists and vagaries by the careful tool of the engraver those three lovely heads for instance imagined out of the rinds of lemons are worth examining not so much for the jovial humor and wonderful variety of feature exhibited in these darling countenances as for the engravers part of the work see the infinite delicate crosslines and hatchings which he is obliged to render let him go not a hairs breadth but the hundredth part of a hairs breadth beyond the given line and the feeling of it is ruined he receives these little dots and specks and fantastical quirks of the pencil and cuts away with a little knife round each not too much nor too little antonios pound of flesh did not puzzle the jew so much and so well does the engraver succeed at last that we never remember to have met with a single artist who did not vow that the woodcutter had utterly ruined his design  of messrs thompson and williams we have spoken as the first engravers in point of rank however the regulations of professional precedence are certainly very difficult and the rest of their brethren we shall not endeavor to class why should the artists who executed the cuts of the admirable three courses yield the pas to any one  there for instance is an engraving by mr landells nearly as good in our opinion as the very best woodcut that ever was made after cruikshank and curiously happy in rendering the artists peculiar manner this cut does not come from the facetious publications which we have consulted but is a contribution by mr cruikshank to an elaborate and splendid botanical work upon the orchidaceae of mexico by mr bateman mr bateman despatched some extremely choice roots of this valuable plant to a friend in england who on the arrival of the case consigned it to his gardener to unpack a great deal of anxiety with regard to the contents was manifested by all concerned but on the lid of the box being removed there issued from it three or four fine specimens of the enormous blatta beetle that had been preying upon the plants during the voyage against these the gardeners the grooms the porters and the porters children issued forth in arms and this scene the artist has immortalized  we have spoken of the admirable way in which mr cruikshank has depicted irish character and cockney character english country character is quite as faithfully delineated in the person of the stout porteress and her children and of the chawbacon with the shovel on whose face is written zummerzetsheer chawbacon appears in another plate or else chawbacons brother he has come up to lunnan and is looking about him at raaces  how distinct are these rustics from those whom we have just been examining they hang about the purlieus of the metropolis brook green epsom greenwich ascot goodwood are their haunts they visit london professionally once a year and that is at the time of bartholomew fair how one may speculate upon the different degrees of rascality as exhibited in each face of the thimblerigging trio and form little histories for these worthies charming newgate romances such as have been of late the fashion is any man so blind that he cannot see the exact face that is writhing under the thhnblerigged heros hat like timanthes of old our artist expresses great passions without the aid of the human countenance there is another specimena street row of inebriated bottles is there any need of having a face after this come on says claretbottle a dashing genteel fellow with his hat on one earcome on has any man a mind to tap me claretbottle is a little screwed as one may see by his legs but full of gayety and courage not so that stout apoplectic bottleofrum who has staggered against the wall and has his hand upon his liver the fellow hurts himself with smoking that is clear and is as sick as sick can be see port is making away from the storm and double x is as flat as ditchwater against these awful in their white robes the sober watchmen come  our artist then can cover up faces and yet show them quite clearly as in the thimblerig group or he can do without faces altogether or he can at a pinch provide a countenance for a gentleman out of any given objecta beautiful irish physiognomy being moulded upon a keg of whiskey and a jolly english countenance frothing out of a pot of ale the spirit of brave toby philpot come back to reanimate his clay while in a fungus may be recognized the physiognomy of a mushroom peer finally if he is at a loss he can make a living head body and legs out of steel or tortoiseshell as in the case of the vivacious pair of spectacles that are jockeying the nose of caddy cuddle  of late years mr cruikshank has busied himself very much with steel engraving and the consequences of that lucky invention have been that his plates are now sold by thousands where they could only be produced by hundreds before he has made many a booksellers and authors fortune we trust that in so doing he may not have neglected his own twelve admirable plates furnished yearly to that facetious little publication the comic almanac have gained for it a sale as we hear of nearly twenty thousand copies the idea of the work was novel there was in the first number especially a great deal of comic power and cruikshanks designs were so admirable that the almanac at once became a vast favorite with the public and has so remained ever since  besides the twelve plates this almanac contains a prophetic woodcut accompanying an awful blarneyhum astrologicum that appears in this and other almanacs there is one that hints in pretty clear terms that with the reform of municipal corporations the ruin of the great lord mayor of london is at hand his lordship is meekly going to dine at an eightpenny ordinary his giants in pawn his men in armor dwindled to one poor knight his carriage to be sold his stalwart aldermen vanished his sheriffs alas and alas in gaol another design shows that rigdum if a true is also a moral and instructive prophet john bull is asleep or rather in a vision the cunning demon speculation blowing a thousand bright bubbles about him meanwhile the rooks are busy at his fob a knave has cut a cruel hole in his pocket a rattlesnake has coiled safe round his feet and will in a trice swallow bull chair money and all the rats are at his cornbags as if poor devil he had corn to spare his faithful dog is bolting his legofmuttonnay a thief has gotten hold of his very candle and there by way of moral is his alepot which looks and winks in his face and seems to say o bull all this is froth and a cruel satirical picture of a certain rustic who had a goose that laid certain golden eggs which goose the rustic slew in expectation of finding all the eggs at once this is goose and sage too to borrow the pun of learned doctor gill but we shrewdly suspect that mr cruikshank is becoming a little conservative in his notions  we love these pictures so that it is hard to part us and we still fondly endeavor to hold on but this wild word farewell must be spoken by the best friends at last and so goodby brave woodcuts we feel quite a sadness in coming to the last of our collection  in the earlier numbers of the comic almanac all the manners and customs of londoners that would afford food for fun were noted down and if during the last two years the mysterious personage who under the title of rigdum funnidos compiles this ephemeris has been compelled to resort to romantic tales we must suppose that he did so because the great metropolis was exhausted and it was necessary to discover new worlds in the cloudland of fancy the character of mr stubbs who made his appearance in the almanac for 1839 had we think great merit although his adventures were somewhat of too tragical a description to provoke pure laughter  we should be glad to devote a few pages to the illustrations of time the scraps and sketches and the illustrations of phrenology which are among the most famous of our artists publications but it is very difficult to find new terms of praise as find them one must when reviewing mr cruikshanks publications and more difficult still as the reader of this notice will no doubt have perceived for himself long since to translate his design into words and go to the printers box for a description of all that fun and humor which the artist can produce by a few skilful turns of his needle a famous article upon the illustrations of time appeared some dozen years since in blackwoods magazine of which the conductors have always been great admirers of our artist as became men of honor and genius to these grand qualities do not let it be supposed that we are laying claim but thank heaven cruikshanks humor is so good and benevolent that any man must love it and on this score we may speak as well as another  then there are the greenwich hospital designs which must not be passed over greenwich hospital is a hearty goodnatured book in the tom dibdin school treating of the virtues of british tars in approved nautical language they maul frenchmen and spaniards they go out in brigs and take frigates they relieve women in distress and are yardarm and yardarming athwarthawsing marlinspiking binnacling and helmsaleeing as honest seamen invariably do in novels on the stage and doubtless on board ship this we cannot take upon us to say but the artist like a true englishman as he is loves dearly these brave guardians of old england and chronicles their rare or fanciful exploits with the greatest goodwill let any one look at the noble head of nelson in the family library and they will we are sure think with us that the designer must have felt and loved what he drew there are to this abridgment of southeys admirable book many more cuts after cruikshank and about a dozen pieces by the same hand will be found in a work equally popular lockharts excellent life of napoleon among these the retreat from moscow is very fine the mamlouks most vigorous furious and barbarous as they should be at the end of these three volumes mr cruikshanks contributions to the family library seem suddenly to have ceased  we are not at all disposed to undervalue the works and genius of mr dickens and we are sure that he would admit as readily as any man the wonderful assistance that he has derived from the artist who has given us the portraits of his ideal personages and made them familiar to all the world once seen these figures remain impressed on the memory which otherwise would have had no hold upon them and the heroes and heroines of boz become personal acquaintances with each of us oh that hogarth could have illustrated fielding in the same way and fixed down on paper those grand figures of parson adams and squire allworthy and the great jonathan wild  with regard to the modern romance of jack sheppard in which the latter personage makes a second appearance it seems to us that mr cruikshank really created the tale and that mr ainsworth as it were only put words to it let any reader of the novel think over it for a while now that it is some months since he has perused and laid it downlet him think and tell us what he remembers of the tale george cruikshanks picturesalways george cruikshanks pictures the storm in the thames for instance all the authors labored description of that event has passed clean awaywe have only before the minds eye the fine plates of cruikshank the poor wretch cowering under the bridge arch as the waves come rushing in and the boats are whirling away in the drift of the great swollen black waters and let any man look at that second plate of the murder on the thames and he must acknowledge how much more brilliant the artists description is than the writers and what a real genius for the terrible as well as for the ridiculous the former has how awful is the gloom of the old bridge a few lights glimmering from the houses here and there but not so as to be reflected on the water at all which is too turbid and raging a great heavy rack of clouds goes sweeping over the bridge and men with flaring torches the murderers are borne away with the stream  the author requires many pages to describe the fury of the storm which mr cruikshank has represented in one first he has to prepare you with the something inexpressibly melancholy in sailing on a dark night upon the thames the ripple of the water the darkling current the indistinctively seen craft the solemn shadows and other phenomena visible on rivers at night are detailed with not unskilful rhetoric in order to bring the reader into a proper frame of mind for the deeper gloom and horror which is to ensue then follow pages of description as rowland sprang to the helm and gave the signal for pursuit a war like a volley of ordnance was heard aloft and the wind again burst its bondage a moment before the surface of the stream was as black as ink it was now whitening hissing and seething like an enormous caldron the blast once more swept over the agitated river whirled off the sheets of foam scattered them far and wide in raindrops and left the raging torrent blacker than before destruction everywhere marked the course of the gale steeples toppled and towers reeled beneath its fury all was darkness horror confusion ruin men fled from their tottering habitations and returned to them scared by greater danger the end of the world seemed at hand    the hurricane had now reached its climax the blast shrieked as if exulting in its wrathful mission stunning and continuous the din seemed almost to take away the power of hearing he who had faced the gale would have been instantly stifled c c see with what a tremendous war of words and good loud words too mr ainsworths description is a good and spirited one the author is obliged to pour in upon the reader before he can effect his purpose upon the latter and inspire him with a proper terror the painter does it at a glance and old woods dilemma in the midst of that tremendous storm with the little infant at his bosom is remembered afterwards not from the words but from the visible image of them that the artist has left us  it would not perhaps be out of place to glance through the whole of the jack sheppard plates which are among the most finished and the most successful of mr cruikshanks performances and say a word or two concerning them let us begin with finding fault with no 1 mr wood offers to adopt little jack sheppard a poor print on a poor subject the figure of the woman not as carefully designed as it might be and the expression of the eyes not an uncommon fault with our artist much caricatured the print is cut up to use the artists phrase by the number of accessories which the engraver has thought proper after the authors elaborate description elaborately to reproduce the plate of wild discovering darrell in the loft is admirableghastly terrible and the treatment of it extraordinarily skilful minute and bold the intricacies of the tilework and the mysterious twinkling of light among the beams are excellently felt and rendered and one sees here as in the two next plates of the storm and murder what a fine eye the artist has what a skilful hand and what a sympathy for the wild and dreadful as a mere imitation of nature the clouds and the bridge in the murder picture may be examined by painters who make far higher pretensions than mr cruikshank in point of workmanship they are equally good the manner quite unaffected the effect produced without any violent contrast the whole scene evidently well and philosophically arranged in the artists brain before he began to put it upon copper  the famous drawing of jack carving the name on the beam which has been transferred to half the playbills in town is overloaded with accessories as the first plate but they are much better arranged than in the lastnamed engraving and do not injure the effect of the principal figure remark too the conscientiousness of the artist and that shrewd pervading idea of form which is one of his principal characteristics jack is surrounded by all sorts of implements of his profession he stands on a regular carpenters table away in the shadow under it lie shavings and a couple of carpenters hampers the gluepot the mallet the chiselhandle the planes the saws the hone with its cover and the other paraphernalia are all represented with extraordinary accuracy and forethought the mans mind has retained the exact drawing of all these minute objects unconsciously perhaps to himself but we can see with what keen eyes he must go through the world and what a fund of facts as such a knowledge of the shape of objects is in his profession this keen student of nature has stored away in his brain in the next plate where jack is escaping from his mistress the figure of that lady one of the deepest of the greek text omitted strikes us as disagreeable and unrefined that of winifred is on the contrary very pretty and graceful and jacks puzzled slinking look must not be forgotten all the accessories are good and the apartment has a snug cosy air which is not remarkable except that it shows how faithfully the designer has performed his work and how curiously he has entered into all the particulars of the subject  master thames darrell the handsome young man of the book is in mr cruikshanks portraits of him no favorite of ours the lad seems to wish to make up for the natural insignificance of his face by frowning on all occasions most portentously this figure borrowed from the compositors desk will give a notion of what we mean wilds face is too violent for the great man of history if we may call fielding history but this is in consonance with the ranting frowning braggadocio character that mr ainsworth has given him  the interior of willesden church is excellent as a composition and a piece of artistical workmanship the groups are well arranged and the figure of mrs sheppard looking round alarmed as her son is robbing the dandy kneebone is charming simple and unaffected not so mrs sheppard ill in bed whose face is screwed up to an expression vastly too tragic the little glimpse of the church seen through the open door of the room is very beautiful and poetical it is in such small hints that an artist especially excels they are the morals which he loves to append to his stories and are always appropriate and welcome the boozing ken is not to our liking mrs sheppard is there with her horrified eyebrows again why this exaggerationis it necessary for the public we think not or if they require such excitement let our artist like a true painter as he is teach them better things        a gentleman whose wit is so celebrated that one should be      very cautious in repeating his stories gave the writer a      good illustration of the philosophy of exaggeration  mr        was once behind the scenes at the opera when the scene      shifters were preparing for the ballet  flora was to sleep      under a bush whereon were growing a number of roses and      amidst which was fluttering a gay covey of butterflies  in      size the roses exceeded the most expansive sunflowers and      the butterflies were as large as cocked hatsthe scene      shifter explained to mr  who asked the reason why      everything was so magnified that the galleries could never      see the objects unless they were enormously exaggerated      how many of our writers and designers work for the      galleries       the escape from willesden cage is excellent the burglary      in woods house has not less merit mrs sheppard in      bedlam a ghastly picture indeed is finely conceived but      not as we fancy so carefully executed it would be better      for a little more careful drawing in the female figure       jack sitting for his picture is a very pleasing group and      savors of the manner of hogarth who is introduced in the      company  the murder of trenchard must be noticed too as      remarkable for the effect and terrible vigor which the      artist has given to the scene the willesden churchyard      has great merit too but the gems of the book are the little      vignettes illustrating the escape from newgate here too      much anatomical care of drawing is not required the figures      are so small that the outline and attitude need only to be      indicated and the designer has produced a series of figures      quite remarkable for reality and poetry too  there are no      less than ten of jacks feats so described by mr      cruikshank  let us say a word here in praise of the      excellent manner in which the author has carried us through      the adventure  here is jack clattering up the chimney now      peering into the lonely red room now opening the door      between the red room and the chapel  what a wild fierce      scared look he has the young ruffian as cautiously he      steps in holding light his bar of iron  you can see by his      face how his heart is beating  if any one were there but      no  and this is a very fine characteristic of the prints      the extreme loneliness of them all not a soul is there to      disturb himwoe to him who shouldand jack drives in the      chapel gate and shatters down the passage door and there      you have him on the leads  up he goes it is but a spring      of a few feet from the blanket and he is goneabiit      evasit erupit mr wild must catch him again if he can       we must not forget to mention oliver twist and mr      cruikshanks famous designs to that work  the sausage      scene at fagins nancy seizing the boy that capital piece      of humor mr bumbles courtship which is even better in      cruikshanks version than in bozs exquisite account of the      interview sykess farewell to the dog and the jewthe      dreadful jewthat cruikshank drew  what a fine touching      picture of melancholy desolation is that of sykes and the      dog  the poor cur is not too well drawn the landscape is      stiff and formal but in this case the faults if faults      they be of execution rather add to than diminish the effect      of the picture it has a strange wild dreary broken      hearted look we fancy we see the landscape as it must have      appeared to sykes when ghastly and with bloodshot eyes he      looked at it  as for the jew in the dungeon let us say      nothing of itwhat can we say to describe it  what a fine      homely poet is the man who can produce this little world of      mirth or woe for us  does he elaborate his effects by slow      process of thought or do they come to him by instinct      does the painter ever arrange in his brain an image so      complete that he afterwards can copy it exactly on the      canvas or does the hand work in spite of him                 or his new work the tower of london which promises              even to surpass mr cruikshanks former productions  a great deal of this random work of course every artist has done in his time many men produce effects of which they never dreamed and strike off excellences haphazard which gain for them reputation but a fine quality in mr cruikshank the quality of his success as we have said before is the extraordinary earnestness and good faith with which he executes all he attemptsthe ludicrous the polite the low the terrible in the second of these he often in our fancy fails his figures lacking elegance and descending to caricature but there is something fine in this too it is good that he should fail that he should have these honest naive notions regarding the beau monde the characteristics of which a nambypamby teaparty painter could hit off far better than he he is a great deal too downright and manly to appreciate the flimsy delicacies of small societyyou cannot expect a lion to roar you like any sucking dove or frisk about a drawingroom like a ladys little spaniel  if then in the course of his life and business he has been occasionally obliged to imitate the ways of such small animals he has done so let us say it at once clumsily and like as a lion should many artists we hear hold his works rather cheap they prate about bad drawing want of scientific knowledgethey would have something vastly more neat regular anatomical  not one of the whole band most likely but can paint an academy figure better than himself nay or a portrait of an aldermans lady and family of children but look down the list of the painters and tell us who are they how many among these men are poets makers possessing the faculty to create the greatest among the gifts with which providence has endowed the mind of man say how many there are count up what they have done and see what in the course of some nineandtwenty years has been done by this indefatigable man  what amazing energetic fecundity do we find in him as a boy he began to fight for bread has been hungry twice a day we trust ever since and has been obliged to sell his wit for his bread week by week and his wit sterling gold as it is will find no such purchasers as the fashionable painters thin pinchbeck who can live comfortably for six weeks when paid for and painting a portrait and fancies his mind prodigiously occupied all the while there was an artist in paris an artist hairdresser who used to be fatigued and take restoratives after inventing a new coiffure by no such gentle operation of headdressing has cruikshank lived time was we are told so in print when for a picture with thirty heads in it he was paid three guineasa poor weeks pittance truly and a dire weeks labor we make no doubt that the same labor would at present bring him twenty times the sum but whether it be ill paid or well what labor has mr cruikshanks been week by week for thirty years to produce something new some smiling offspring of painful labor quite independent and distinct from its ten thousand jovial brethren in what hours of sorrow and illhealth to be told by the world make us laugh or you starvegive us fresh fun we have eaten up the old and are hungry and all this has he been obliged to doto wring laughter day by day sometimes perhaps out of want often certainly from illhealth or depressionto keep the fire of his brain perpetually alight for the greedy public will give it no leisure to cool this he has done and done well he has told a thousand truths in as many strange and fascinating ways he has given a thousand new and pleasant thoughts to millions of people he has never used his wit dishonestly he has never in all the exuberance of his frolicsome humor caused a single painful or guilty blush how little do we think of the extraordinary power of this man and how ungrateful we are to him  here as we are come round to the charge of ingratitude the startingpost from which we set out perhaps we had better conclude the reader will perhaps wonder at the highflown tone in which we speak of the services and merits of an individual whom he considers a humble scraper on steel that is wonderfully popular already but none of us remember all the benefits we owe him they have come one by one one driving out the memory of the other it is only when we come to examine them all together as the writer has done who has a pile of books on the table before hima heap of personal kindnesses from george cruikshank not presents if you please for we bought borrowed or stole every one of themthat we feel what we owe him look at one of mr cruikshanks works and we pronounce him an excellent humorist look at all his reputation is increased by a kind of geometrical progression as a whole diamond is a hundred times more valuable than the hundred splinters into which it might be broken would be a fine rough english diamond is this about which we have been writing
