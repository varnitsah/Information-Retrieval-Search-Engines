burden bore    till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore          of nevernever more  this stanza from the raven was recommended by james russell lowell as an inscription upon the baltimore monument which marks the resting place of edgar allan poe the most interesting and original figure in american letters and to signify that peculiar musical quality of poes genius which inthralls every reader mr lowell suggested this additional verse from the haunted palace     and all with pearl and ruby glowing     was the fair palace door    through which came flowing flowing flowing     and sparkling ever more    a troop of echoes whose sweet duty     was but to sing    in voices of surpassing beauty     the wit and wisdom of their king   born in poverty at boston january 19 1809 dying under painful circumstances at baltimore october 7 1849 his whole literary career of scarcely fifteen years a pitiful struggle for mere subsistence his memory malignantly misrepresented by his earliest biographer griswold how completely has truth at last routed falsehood and how magnificently has poe come into his own for the raven first published in 1845 and within a few months read recited and parodied wherever the english language was spoken the halfstarved poet received 10 less than a year later his brother poet n p willis issued this touching appeal to the admirers of genius on behalf of the neglected author his dying wife and her devoted mother then living under very straitened circumstances in a little cottage at fordham n y  here is one of the finest scholars one of the most original men of genius and one of the most industrious of the literary profession of our country whose temporary suspension of labor from bodily illness drops him immediately to a level with the common objects of public charity there is no intermediate stoppingplace no respectful shelter where with the delicacy due to genius and culture he might secure aid till with returning health he would resume his labors and his unmortified sense of independence  and this was the tribute paid by the american public to the master who had given to it such tales of conjuring charm of witchery and mystery as the fall of the house of usher and ligeia such fascinating hoaxes as the unparalleled adventure of hans pfaall mss found in a bottle a descent into a maelstrom and the balloon hoax such tales of conscience as william wilson the black cat and the telltale heart wherein the retributions of remorse are portrayed with an awful fidelity such tales of natural beauty as the island of the fay and the domain of arnheim such marvellous studies in ratiocination as the goldbug the murders in the rue morgue the purloined letter and the mystery of marie roget the latter a recital of fact demonstrating the authors wonderful capability of correctly analyzing the mysteries of the human mind such tales of illusion and banter as the premature burial and the system of dr tarr and professor fether such bits of extravaganza as the devil in the belfry and the angel of the odd such tales of adventure as the narrative of arthur gordon pym such papers of keen criticism and review as won for poe the enthusiastic admiration of charles dickens although they made him many enemies among the overpuffed minor american writers so mercilessly exposed by him such poems of beauty and melody as the bells the haunted palace tamerlane the city in the sea and the raven what delight for the jaded senses of the reader is this enchanted domain of wonderpieces what an atmosphere of beauty music color what resources of imagination construction analysis and absolute art one might almost sympathize with sarah helen whitman who confessing to a half faith in the old superstition of the significance of anagrams found in the transposed letters of edgar poes name the words a godpeer his mind she says was indeed a haunted palace echoing to the footfalls of angels and demons  no man poe himself wrote has recorded no man has dared to record the wonders of his inner life  in these twentieth century daysof lavish recognitionartistic popular and materialof genius what rewards might not a poe claim  edgars father a son of general david poe the american revolutionary patriot and friend of lafayette had married mrs hopkins an english actress and the match meeting with parental disapproval had himself taken to the stage as a profession notwithstanding mrs poes beauty and talent the young couple had a sorry struggle for existence when edgar at the age of two years was orphaned the family was in the utmost destitution apparently the future poet was to be cast upon the world homeless and friendless but fate decreed that a few glimmers of sunshine were to illumine his life for the little fellow was adopted by john allan a wealthy merchant of richmond va a brother and sister the remaining children were cared for by others  in his new home edgar found all the luxury and advantages money could provide he was petted spoiled and shown off to strangers in mrs allan he found all the affection a childless wife could bestow mr allan took much pride in the captivating precocious lad at the age of five the boy recited with fine effect passages of english poetry to the visitors at the allan house  from his eighth to his thirteenth year he attended the manor house school at stokenewington a suburb of london it was the rev dr bransby head of the school whom poe so quaintly portrayed in william wilson returning to richmond in 1820 edgar was sent to the school of professor joseph h clarke he proved an apt pupil years afterward professor clarke thus wrote  while the other boys wrote mere mechanical verses poe wrote genuine poetry the boy was a born poet as a scholar he was ambitious to excel he was remarkable for selfrespect without haughtiness he had a sensitive and tender heart and would do anything for a friend his nature was entirely free from selfishness  at the age of seventeen poe entered the university of virginia at charlottesville he left that institution after one session official records prove that he was not expelled on the contrary he gained a creditable record as a student although it is admitted that he contracted debts and had an ungovernable passion for cardplaying these debts may have led to his quarrel with mr allan which eventually compelled him to make his own way in the world  early in 1827 poe made his first literary venture he induced calvin thomas a poor and youthful printer to publish a small volume of his verses under the title tamerlane and other poems in 1829 we find poe in baltimore with another manuscript volume of verses which was soon published its title was al aaraaf tamerlane and other poems neither of these ventures seems to have attracted much attention  soon after mrs allans death which occurred in 1829 poe through the aid of mr allan secured admission to the united states military academy at west point any glamour which may have attached to cadet life in poes eyes was speedily lost for discipline at west point was never so severe nor were the accommodations ever so poor poes bent was more and more toward literature life at the academy daily became increasingly distasteful soon he began to purposely neglect his studies and to disregard his duties his aim being to secure his dismissal from the united states service in this he succeeded on march 7 1831 poe found himself free mr allans second marriage had thrown the lad on his own resources his literary career was to begin  poes first genuine victory was won in 1833 when he was the successful competitor for a prize of 100 offered by a baltimore periodical for the best prose story a mss found in a bottle was the winning tale poe had submitted six stories in a volume our only difficulty says mr latrobe one of the judges was in selecting from the rich contents of the volume  during the fifteen years of his literary life poe was connected with various newspapers and magazines in richmond philadelphia and new york he was faithful punctual industrious thorough n p willis who for some time employed poe as critic and subeditor on the evening mirror wrote thus  with the highest admiration for poes genius and a willingness to let it alone for more than ordinary irregularity we were led by common report to expect a very capricious attention to his duties and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty time went on however and he was invariably punctual and industrious we saw but one presentiment of the mana quiet patient industrious and most gentlemanly person  we heard from one who knew him well what should be stated in all mention of his lamentable irregularities that with a single glass of wine his whole nature was reversed the demon became uppermost and though none of the usual signs of intoxication were visible his will was palpably insane in this reversed character we repeat it was never our chance to meet him  on september 22 1835 poe married his cousin virginia clemm in baltimore she had barely turned thirteen years poe himself was but twentysix he then was a resident of richmond and a regular contributor to the southern literary messenger it was not until a year later that the bride and her widowed mother followed him thither  poes devotion to his childwife was one of the most beautiful features of his life many of his famous poetic productions were inspired by her beauty and charm consumption had marked her for its victim and the constant efforts of husband and mother were to secure for her all the comfort and happiness their slender means permitted virginia died january 30 1847 when but twentyfive years of age a friend of the family pictures the deathbed scenemother and husband trying to impart warmth to her by chafing her hands and her feet while her pet cat was suffered to nestle upon her bosom for the sake of added warmth  these verses from annabel lee written by poe in 1849 the last year of his life tell of his sorrow at the loss of his childwife       i was a child and she was a child       in a kingdom by the sea       but we loved with a love that was more than love        i and my annabel lee       with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven       coveted her and me      and this was the reason that long ago       in this kingdom by the sea      a wind blew out of a cloud chilling       my beautiful annabel lee       so that her highborn kinsmen came       and bore her away from me      to shut her up in a sepulchre       in this kingdom by the sea   poe was connected at various times and in various capacities with the southern literary messenger in richmond va grahams magazine and the gentlemans magazine in philadelphia the evening mirror the broadway journal and godeys ladys book in new york everywhere poes life was one of unremitting toil no tales and poems were ever produced at a greater cost of brain and spirit  poes initial salary with the southern literary messenger to which he contributed the first drafts of a number of his bestknown tales was 10 a week two years later his salary was but 600 a year even in 1844 when his literary reputation was established securely he wrote to a friend expressing his pleasure because a magazine to which he was to contribute had agreed to pay him 20 monthly for two pages of criticism  those were discouraging times in american literature but poe never lost faith he was finally to triumph wherever preeminent talents win admirers his genius has had no better description than in this stanza from william winters poem read at the dedication exercises of the actors monument to poe may 4 1885 in new york       he was the voice of beauty and of woe      passion and mystery and the dread unknown      pure as the mountains of perpetual snow      cold as the icy winds that round them moan      dark as the eaves wherein earths thunders groan      wild as the tempests of the upper sky      sweet as the faint faroff celestial tone of angel          whispers fluttering from on high      and tender as loves tear when youth and beauty die   in the two and a half score years that have elapsed since poes death he has come fully into his own for a while griswolds malignant misrepresentations colored the public estimate of poe as man and as writer but thanks to j h ingram w f gill eugene didier sarah helen whitman and others these scandals have been dispelled and poe is seen as he actually wasnot as a man without failings it is true but as the finest and most original genius in american letters as the years go on his fame increases his works have been translated into many foreign languages his is a household name in france and englandin fact the latter nation has often uttered the reproach that poes own country has been slow to appreciate him but that reproach if it ever was warranted certainly is untrue                                       w h r     edgar allan poe  by james russell lowell   the situation of american literature is anomalous it has no centre or if it have it is like that of the sphere of hermes it is divided into many systems each revolving round its several suns and often presenting to the rest only the faint glimmer of a milkandwater way our capital city unlike london or paris is not a great central heart from which life and vigor radiate to the extremities but resembles more an isolated umbilicus stuck down as near as may be to the centre of the land and seeming rather to tell a legend of former usefulness than to serve any present need boston new york philadelphia each has its literature almost more distinct than those of the different dialects of germany and the young queen of the west has also one of her own of which some articulate rumor barely has reached us dwellers by the atlantic  perhaps there is no task more difficult than the just criticism of contemporary literature it is even more grateful to give praise where it is needed than where it is deserved and friendship so often seduces the iron stylus of justice into a vague flourish that she writes what seems rather like an epitaph than a criticism yet if praise be given as an alms we could not drop so poisonous a one into any mans hat the critics ink may suffer equally from too large an infusion of nutgalls or of sugar but it is easier to be generous than to be just and we might readily put faith in that fabulous direction to the hiding place of truth did we judge from the amount of water which we usually find mixed with it  remarkable experiences are usually confined to the inner life of imaginative men but mr poes biography displays a vicissitude and peculiarity of interest such as is rarely met with the offspring of a romantic marriage and left an orphan at an early age he was adopted by mr allan a wealthy virginian whose barren marriagebed seemed the warranty of a large estate to the young poet  having received a classical education in england he returned home and entered the university of virginia where after an extravagant course followed by reformation at the last extremity he was graduated with the highest honors of his class then came a boyish attempt to join the fortunes of the insurgent greeks which ended at st petersburg where he got into difficulties through want of a passport from which he was rescued by the american consul and sent home he now entered the military academy at west point from which he obtained a dismissal on hearing of the birth of a son to his adopted father by a second marriage an event which cut off his expectations as an heir the death of mr allan in whose will his name was not mentioned soon after relieved him of all doubt in this regard and he committed himself at once to authorship for a support previously to this however he had published in 1827 a small volume of poems which soon ran through three editions and excited high expectations of its authors future distinction in the minds of many competent judges  that no certain augury can be drawn from a poets earliest lispings there are instances enough to prove shakespeares first poems though brimful of vigor and youth and picturesqueness give but a very faint promise of the directness condensation and overflowing moral of his maturer works perhaps however shakespeare is hardly a case in point his venus and adonis having been published we believe in his twentysixth year miltons latin verses show tenderness a fine eye for nature and a delicate appreciation of classic models but give no hint of the author of a new style in poetry popes youthful pieces have all the singsong wholly unrelieved by the glittering malignity and eloquent irreligion of his later productions collins callow nambypamby died and gave no sign of the vigorous and original genius which he afterward displayed we have never thought that the world lost more in the marvellous boy chatterton than a very ingenious imitator of obscure and antiquated dulness where he becomes original as it is called the interest of ingenuity ceases and he becomes stupid kirke whites promises were indorsed by the respectable name of mr southey but surely with no authority from apollo they have the merit of a traditional piety which to our mind if uttered at all had been less objectionable in the retired closet of a diary and in the sober raiment of prose they do not clutch hold of the memory with the drowning pertinacity of watts neither have they the interest of his occasional simple lucky beauty burns having fortunately been rescued by his humble station from the contaminating society of the best models wrote well and naturally from the first had he been unfortunate enough to have had an educated taste we should have had a series of poems from which as from his letters we could sift here and there a kernel from the mass of chaff coleridges youthful efforts give no promise whatever of that poetical genius which produced at once the wildest tenderest most original and most purely imaginative poems of modern times byrons hours of idleness would never find a reader except from an intrepid and indefatigable curiosity in wordsworths first preludings there is but a dim foreboding of the creator of an era from southeys early poems a safer augury might have been drawn they show the patient investigator the close student of history and the unwearied explorer of the beauties of predecessors but they give no assurances of a man who should add aught to stock of household words or to the rarer and more sacred delights of the fireside or the arbor the earliest specimens of shelleys poetic mind already also give tokens of that ethereal sublimation in which the spirit seems to soar above the regions of words but leaves its body the verse to be entombed without hope of resurrection in a mass of them cowley is generally instanced as a wonder of precocity but his early insipidities show only a capacity for rhyming and for the metrical arrangement of certain conventional combinations of words a capacity wholly dependent on a delicate physical organization and an unhappy memory an early poem is only remarkable when it displays an effort of reason and the rudest verses in which we can trace some conception of the ends of poetry are worth all the miracles of smooth juvenile versification a schoolboy one would say might acquire the regular seesaw of pope merely by an association with the motion of the playground tilt  mr poes early productions show that he could see through the verse to the spirit beneath and that he already had a feeling that all the life and grace of the one must depend on and be modulated by the will of the other we call them the most remarkable boyish poems that we have ever read we know of none that can compare with them for maturity of purpose and a nice understanding of the effects of language and metre such pieces are only valuable when they display what we can only express by the contradictory phrase of innate experience we copy one of the shorter poems written when the author was only fourteen there is a little dimness in the filling up but the grace and symmetry of the outline are such as few poets ever attain there is a smack of ambrosia about it       to helen       helen thy beauty is to me        like those nicean barks of yore      that gently oer a perfumed sea        the weary wayworn wanderer bore      to his own native shore       on desperate seas long wont to roam        thy hyacinth hair thy classic face      thy naiad airs have brought me home        to the glory that was greece      and the grandeur that was rome       lo in yon brilliant windowniche        how statuelike i see thee stand      the agate lamp within thy hand        ah psyche from the regions which      are holy land   it is the tendency of the young poet that impresses us here is no withering scorn no heart blighted ere it has safely got into its teens none of the drawingroom sansculottism which byron had brought into vogue all is limpid and serene with a pleasant dash of the greek helicon in it the melody of the whole too is remarkable it is not of that kind which can be demonstrated arithmetically upon the tips of the fingers it is of that finer sort which the inner ear alone can estimate it seems simple like a greek column because of its perfection in a poem named ligeia under which title he intended to personify the music of nature our boypoet gives us the following exquisite picture         ligeia ligeia      my beautiful one        whose harshest idea      will to melody run        say is it thy will      on the breezes to toss        or capriciously still      like the lone albatross        incumbent on night      as she on the air        to keep watch with delight      on the harmony there  john neal himself a man of genius and whose lyre has been too long capriciously silent appreciated the high merit of these and similar passages and drew a proud horoscope for their author  mr poe had that indescribable something which men have agreed to call genius no man could ever tell us precisely what it is and yet there is none who is not inevitably aware of its presence and its power let talent writhe and contort itself as it may it has no such magnetism larger of bone and sinew it may be but the wings are wanting talent sticks fast to earth and its most perfect works have still one foot of clay genius claims kindred with the very workings of nature herself so that a sunset shall seem like a quotation from dante and if shakespeare be read in the very presence of the sea itself his verses shall but seem nobler for the sublime criticism of ocean talent may make friends for itself but only genius can give to its creations the divine power of winning love and veneration enthusiasm cannot cling to what itself is unenthusiastic nor will he ever have disciples who has not himself impulsive zeal enough to be a disciple great wits are allied to madness only inasmuch as they are possessed and carried away by their demon while talent keeps him as paracelsus did securely prisoned in the pommel of his sword to the eye of genius the veil of the spiritual world is ever rent asunder that it may perceive the ministers of good and evil who throng continually around it no man of mere talent ever flung his inkstand at the devil  when we say that mr poe had genius we do not mean to say that he has produced evidence of the highest but to say that he possesses it at all is to say that he needs only zeal industry and a reverence for the trust reposed in him to achieve the proudest triumphs and the greenest laurels if we may believe the longinuses and aristotles of our newspapers we have quite too many geniuses of the loftiest order to render a place among them at all desirable whether for its hardness of attainment or its seclusion the highest peak of our parnassus is according to these gentlemen by far the most thickly settled portion of the country a circumstance which must make it an uncomfortable residence for individuals of a poetical temperament if love of solitude be as immemorial tradition asserts a necessary part of their idiosyncrasy  mr poe has two of the prime qualities of genius a faculty of vigorous yet minute analysis and a wonderful fecundity of imagination the first of these faculties is as needful to the artist in words as a knowledge of anatomy is to the artist in colors or in stone this enables him to conceive truly to maintain a proper relation of parts and to draw a correct outline while the second groups fills up and colors both of these mr poe has displayed with singular distinctness in his prose works the last predominating in his earlier tales and the first in his later ones in judging of the merit of an author and assigning him his niche among our household gods we have a right to regard him from our own point of view and to measure him by our own standard but in estimating the amount of power displayed in his works we must be governed by his own design and placing them by the side of his own ideal find how much is wanting we differ from mr poe in his opinions of the objects of art he esteems that object to be the creation of beauty and perhaps it is only in the definition of that word that we disagree with him but in what we shall say of his writings we shall take his own standard as our guide the temple of the god of song is equally accessible from every side and there is room enough in it for all who bring offerings or seek in oracle  in his tales mr poe has chosen to exhibit his power chiefly in that dim region which stretches from the very utmost limits of the probable into the weird confines of superstition and unreality he combines in a very remarkable manner two faculties which are seldom found united a power of influencing the mind of the reader by the impalpable shadows of mystery and a minuteness of detail which does not leave a pin or a button unnoticed both are in truth the natural results of the predominating quality of his mind to which we have before alluded analysis it is this which distinguishes the artist his mind at once reaches forward to the effect to be produced having resolved to bring about certain emotions in the reader he makes all subordinate parts tend strictly to the common centre even his mystery is mathematical to his own mind to him x is a known quantity all along in any picture that he paints he understands the chemical properties of all his colors however vague some of his figures may seem however formless the shadows to him the outline is as clear and distinct as that of a geometrical diagram for this reason mr poe has no sympathy with mysticism the mystic dwells in the mystery is enveloped with it it colors all his thoughts it affects his optic nerve especially and the commonest things get a rainbow edging from it mr poe on the other hand is a spectator ab extra he analyzes he dissects he watches          with an eye serene      the very pulse of the machine   for such it practically is to him with wheels and cogs and pistonrods all working to produce a certain end  this analyzing tendency of his mind balances the poetical and by giving him the patience to be minute enables him to throw a wonderful reality into his most unreal fancies a monomania he paints with great power he loves to dissect one of these cancers of the mind and to trace all the subtle ramifications of its roots in raising images of horror also he has strange success conveying to us sometimes by a dusky hint some terrible doubt which is the secret of all horror he leaves to imagination the task of finishing the picture a task to which only she is competent       for much imaginary work was there      conceit deceitful so compact so kind      that for achilles image stood his spear      grasped in an armed hand himself behind      was left unseen save to the eye of mind  besides the merit of conception mr poes writings have also that of form  his style is highly finished graceful and truly classical it would be hard to find a living author who had displayed such varied powers as an example of his style we would refer to one of his tales the house of usher in the first volume of his tales of the grotesque and arabesque it has a singular charm for us and we think that no one could read it without being strongly moved by its serene and sombre beauty had its author written nothing else it would alone have been enough to stamp him as a man of genius and the master of a classic style in this tale occurs perhaps the most beautiful of his poems  the great masters of imagination have seldom resorted to the vague and the unreal as sources of effect they have not used dread and horror alone but only in combination with other qualities as means of subjugating the fancies of their readers the loftiest muse has ever a household and fireside charm about her mr poes secret lies mainly in the skill with which he has employed the strange fascination of mystery and terror in this his success is so great and striking as to deserve the name of art not artifice we cannot call his materials the noblest or purest but we must concede to him the highest merit of construction  as a critic mr poe was aesthetically deficient unerring in his analysis of dictions metres and plots he seemed wanting in the faculty of perceiving the profounder ethics of art his criticisms are however distinguished for scientific precision and coherence of logic they have the exactness and at the same time the coldness of mathematical demonstrations yet they stand in strikingly refreshing contrast with the vague generalisms and sharp personalities of the day if deficient in warmth they are also without the heat of partisanship they are especially valuable as illustrating the great truth too generally overlooked that analytic power is a subordinate quality of the critic  on the whole it may be considered certain that mr poe has attained an individual eminence in our literature which he will keep he has given proof of power and originality he has done that which could only be done once with success or safety and the imitation or repetition of which would produce weariness     death of edgar a poe  by n p willis   the ancient fable of two antagonistic spirits imprisoned in one body equally powerful and having the complete mastery by turnsof one man that is to say inhabited by both a devil and an angel seems to have been realized if all we hear is true in the character of the extraordinary man whose name we have written above our own impression of the nature of edgar a poe differs in some important degree however from that which has been generally conveyed in the notices of his death let us before telling what we personally know of him copy a graphic and highly finished portraiture from the pen of dr rufus w griswold which appeared in a recent number of the tribune  edgar allen poe is dead he died in baltimore on sunday october 7th this announcement will startle many but few will be grieved by it the poet was known personally or by reputation in all this country he had readers in england and in several of the states of continental europe but he had few or no friends and the regrets for his death will be suggested principally by the consideration that in him literary art has lost one of its most brilliant but erratic stars  his conversation was at times almost supramortal in its eloquence his voice was modulated with astonishing skill and his large and variably expressive eyes looked repose or shot fiery tumult into theirs who listened while his own face glowed or was changeless in pallor as his imagination quickened his blood or drew it back frozen to his heart his imagery was from the worlds which no mortals can see but with the vision of genius suddenly starting from a proposition exactly and sharply defined in terms of utmost simplicity and clearness he rejected the forms of customary logic and by a crystalline process of accretion built up his ocular demonstrations in forms of gloomiest and ghastliest grandeur or in those of the most airy and delicious beauty so minutely and distinctly yet so rapidly that the attention which was yielded to him was chained till it stood among his wonderful creations till he himself dissolved the spell and brought his hearers back to common and base existence by vulgar fancies or exhibitions of the ignoblest passion  he was at all times a dreamerdwelling in ideal realmsin heaven or hellpeopled with the creatures and the accidents of his brain he walkedthe streets in madness or melancholy with lips moving in indistinct curses or with eyes upturned in passionate prayer never for himself for he felt or professed to feel that he was already damned but for their happiness who at the moment were objects of his idolatry or with his glances introverted to a heart gnawed with anguish and with a face shrouded in gloom he would brave the wildest storms and all night with drenched garments and arms beating the winds and rains would speak as if the spirits that at such times only could be evoked by him from the aidenn close by whose portals his disturbed soul sought to forget the ills to which his constitution subjected himclose by the aidenn where were those he lovedthe aidenn which he might never see but in fitful glimpses as its gates opened to receive the less fiery and more happy natures whose destiny to sin did not involve the doom of death  he seemed except when some fitful pursuit subjugated his will and engrossed his faculties always to bear the memory of some controlling sorrow the remarkable poem of the raven was probably much more nearly than has been supposed even by those who were very intimate with him a reflection and an echo of his own history he was that birds       unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster      followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore      till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore           of nevernever more   every genuine author in a greater or less degree leaves in his works whatever their design traces of his personal character elements of his immortal being in which the individual survives the person while we read the pages of the fall of the house of usher or of mesmeric revelations we see in the solemn and stately gloom which invests one and in the subtle metaphysical analysis of both indications of the idiosyncrasies of what was most remarkable and peculiar in the authors intellectual nature but we see here only the better phases of his nature only the symbols of his juster action for his harsh experience had deprived him of all faith in man or woman he had made up his mind upon the numberless complexities of the social world and the whole system with him was an imposture this conviction gave a direction to his shrewd and naturally unamiable character still though he regarded society as composed altogether of villains the sharpness of his intellect was not of that kind which enabled him to cope with villany while it continually caused him by overshots to fail of the success of honesty he was in many respects like francis vivian in bulwers novel of the caxtons passion in him comprehendedmany of the worst emotions which militate against human happiness you could not contradict him but you raised quick choler you could not speak of wealth but his cheek paled with gnawing envy the astonishing natural advantages of this poor boyhis beauty his readiness the daring spirit that breathed around him like a fiery atmospherehad raised his constitutional selfconfidence into an arrogance that turned his very claims to admiration into prejudices against him irascible enviousbad enough but not the worst for these salient angles were all varnished over with a cold repellant cynicism his passions vented themselves in sneers there seemed to him no moral susceptibility and what was more remarkable in a proud nature little or nothing of the true point of honor he had to a morbid excess that desire to rise which is vulgarly called ambition but no wish for the esteem or the love of his species only the hard wish to succeednot shine not servesucceed that he might have the right to despise a world which galled his selfconceit  we have suggested the influence of his aims and vicissitudes upon his literature it was more conspicuous in his later than in his earlier writings nearly all that he wrote in the last two or three yearsincluding much of his best poetrywas in some sense biographical in draperies of his imagination those who had taken the trouble to trace his steps could perceive but slightly concealed the figure of himself  apropos of the disparaging portion of the above wellwritten sketch let us truthfully say  some four or five years since when editing a daily paper in this city mr poe was employed by us for several months as critic and subeditor this was our first personal acquaintance with him he resided with his wife and mother at fordham a few miles out of town but was at his desk in the office from nine in the morning till the evening paper went to press with the highest admiration for his genius and a willingness to let it atone for more than ordinary irregularity we were led by common report to expect a very capricious attention to his duties and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty time went on however and he was invariably punctual and industrious with his pale beautiful and intellectual face as a reminder of what genius was in him it was impossible of course not to treat him always with deferential courtesy and to our occasional request that he would not probe too deep in a criticism or that he would erase a passage colored too highly with his resentments against society and mankind he readily and courteously assentedfar more yielding than most men we thought on points so excusably sensitive with a prospect of taking the lead in another periodical he at last voluntarily gave up his employment with us and through all this considerable period we had seen but one presentment of the mana quiet patient industrious and most gentlemanly person commanding the utmost respect and good feeling by his unvarying deportment and ability  residing as he did in the country we never met mr poe in hours of leisure but he frequently called on us afterward at our place of business and we met him often in the streetinvariably the same sad mannered winning and refined gentleman such as we had always known him it was by rumor only up to the day of his death that we knew of any other development of manner or character we heard from one who knew him well what should be stated in all mention of his lamentable irregularities that with a single glass of wine his whole nature was reversed the demon became uppermost and though none of the usual signs of intoxication were visible his will was palpably insane possessing his reasoning faculties in excited activity at such times and seeking his acquaintances with his wonted look and memory he easily seemed personating only another phase of his natural character and was accused accordingly of insulting arrogance and badheartedness in this reversed character we repeat it was never our chance to see him we know it from hearsay and we mention it in connection with this sad infirmity of physical constitution which puts it upon very nearly the ground of a temporary and almost irresponsible insanity  the arrogance vanity and depravity of heart of which mr poe was generally accused seem to us referable altogether to this reversed phase of his character under that degree of intoxication which only acted upon him by demonizing his sense of truth and right he doubtless said and did much that was wholly irreconcilable with his better nature but when himself and as we knew him only his modesty and unaffected humility as to his own deservings were a constant charm to his character his letters of which the constant application for autographs has taken from us we are sorry to confess the greater portion exhibited this quality very strongly in one of the carelessly written notes of which we chance still to retain possession for instance he speaks of the raventhat extraordinary poem which electrified the world of imaginative readers and has become the type of a school of poetry of its ownand in evident earnest attributes its success to the few words of commendation with which we had prefaced it in this paperit will throw light on his sane character to give a literal copy of the note                                    fordham april 20 1849   my dear willisthe poem which i inclose and which i am so vain as to hope you will like in some respects has been just published in a paper for which sheer necessity compels me to write now and then it pays well as times gobut unquestionably it ought to pay ten prices for whatever i send it i feel i am consigning to the tomb of the capulets the verses accompanying this may i beg you to take out of the tomb and bring them to light in the home journal if you can oblige me so far as to copy them i do not think it will be necessary to say from the  that would be too bad and perhaps from a late  paper would do  i have not forgotten how a good word in season from you made the raven and made ulalume which bytheway people have done me the honor of attributing to you therefore i would ask you if i dared to say something of these lines if they please you                        truly yours ever                          edgar a poe   in double proof of his earnest disposition to do the best for himself and of the trustful and grateful nature which has been denied him we give another of the only three of his notes which we chance to retain                            fordham january 22 1848   my dear mr willisi am about to make an effort at reestablishing myself in the literary world and feel that i may depend upon your aid  my general aim is to start a magazine to be called the stylus but it would be useless to me even when established if not entirely out of the control of a publisher i mean therefore to get up a journal which shall be my own at all points with this end in view i must get a list of at least five hundred subscribers to begin with nearly two hundred i have already i propose however to go south and west among my personal and literary friendsold college and west point acquaintancesand see what i can do in order to get the means of taking the first step i propose to lecture at the society library on thursday the 3d of february and that there may be no cause of squabbling my subject shall not be literary at all i have chosen a broad text the universe  having thus given you the facts of the case i leave all the rest to the suggestions of your own tact and generosity gratefully most gratefully                           your friend always                               edgar a poe   brief and chancetaken as these letters are we think they sufficiently prove the existence of the very qualities denied to mr poehumility willingness to persevere belief in anothers friendship and capability of cordial and grateful friendship such he assuredly was when sane such only he has invariably seemed to us in all we have happened personally to know of him through a friendship of five or six years and so much easier is it to believe what we have seen and known than what we hear of only that we remember him but with admiration and respect these descriptions of him when morally insane seeming to us like portraits painted in sickness of a man we have only known in health  but there is another more touching and far more forcible evidence that there was goodness in edgar a poe to reveal it we are obliged to venture upon the lifting of the veil which sacredly covers grief and refinement in poverty but we think it may be excused if so we can brighten the memory of the poet even were there not a more needed and immediate service which it may render to the nearest link broken by his death  our first knowledge of mr poes removal to this city was by a call which we received from a lady who introduced herself to us as the mother of his wife she was in search of employment for him and she excused her errand by mentioning that he was ill that her daughter was a confirmed invalid and that their circumstances were such as compelled her taking it upon herself the countenance of this lady made beautiful and saintly with an evidently complete giving up of her life to privation and sorrowful tenderness her gentle and mournful voice urging its plea her longforgotten but habitually and unconsciously refined manners and her appealing and yet appreciative mention of the claims and abilities of her son disclosed at once the presence of one of those angels upon earth that women in adversity can be it was a hard fate that she was watching over mr poe wrote with fastidious difficulty and in a style too much above the popular level to be well paid he was always in pecuniary difficulty and with his sick wife frequently in want of the merest necessaries of life winter after winter for years the most touching sight to us in this whole city has been that tireless minister to genius thinly and insufficiently clad going from office to office with a poem or an article on some literary subject to sell sometimes simply pleading in a broken voice that he was ill and begging for him mentioning nothing but that he was ill whatever might be the reason for his writing nothing and never amid all her tears and recitals of distress suffering one syllable to escape her lips that could convey a doubt of him or a complaint or a lessening of pride in his genius and good intentions her daughter died a year and a half since but she did not desert him she continued his ministering angelliving with him caring for him guarding him against exposure and when he was carried away by temptation amid grief and the loneliness of feelings unreplied to and awoke from his self abandonment prostrated in destitution and suffering begging for him still if womans devotion born with a first love and fed with human passion hallow its object as it is allowed to do what does not a devotion like thispure disinterested and holy as the watch of an invisible spiritsay for him who inspired it  we have a letter before us written by this lady mrs clemm on the morning in which she heard of the death of this object of her untiring care it is merely a request that we would call upon her but we will copy a few of its wordssacred as its privacy isto warrant the truth of the picture we have drawn above and add force to the appeal we wish to make for her  i have this morning heard of the death of my darling eddie can you give me any circumstances or particulars oh do not desert your poor friend in his bitter affliction ask mr  to come as i must deliver a message to him from my poor eddie i need not ask you to notice his death and to speak well of him i know you will but say what an affectionate son he was to me his poor desolate mother  to hedge round a grave with respect what choice is there between the relinquished wealth and honors of the world and the story of such a womans unrewarded devotion risking what we do in delicacy by making it public we feelother reasons asidethat it betters the world to make known that there are such ministrations to its erring and gifted what we have said will speak to some hearts there are those who will be glad to know how the lamp whose light of poetry has beamed on their faraway recognition was watched over with care and pain that they may send to her who is more darkened than they by its extinction some token of their sympathy she is destitute and alone if any far or near will send to us what may aid and cheer her through the remainder of her life we will joyfully place it in her hands      the unparalleled adventures of one hans pfaal 1  by late accounts from rotterdam that city seems to be in a high state of philosophical excitement indeed phenomena have there occurred of a nature so completely unexpectedso entirely novelso utterly at variance with preconceived opinionsas to leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all europe is in an uproar all physics in a ferment all reason and astronomy together by the ears  it appears that on the day of i am not positive about the date a vast crowd of people for purposes not specifically mentioned were assembled in the great square of the exchange in the wellconditioned city of rotterdam the day was warmunusually so for the seasonthere was hardly a breath of air stirring and the multitude were in no bad humor at being now and then besprinkled with friendly showers of momentary duration that fell from large white masses of cloud which chequered in a fitful manner the blue vault of the firmament nevertheless about noon a slight but remarkable agitation became apparent in the assembly the clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded and in an instant afterward ten thousand faces were upturned toward the heavens ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously from the corners of ten thousand mouths and a shout which could be compared to nothing but the roaring of niagara resounded long loudly and furiously through all the environs of rotterdam  the origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident from behind the huge bulk of one of those sharplydefined masses of cloud already mentioned was seen slowly to emerge into an open area of blue space a queer heterogeneous but apparently solid substance so oddly shaped so whimsically put together as not to be in any manner comprehended and never to be sufficiently admired by the host of sturdy burghers who stood openmouthed below what could it be in the name of all the vrows and devils in rotterdam what could it possibly portend no one knew no one could imagine no onenot even the burgomaster mynheer superbus von underdukhad the slightest clew by which to unravel the mystery so as nothing more reasonable could be done every one to a man replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth and cocking up his right eye towards the phenomenon puffed paused waddled about and grunted significantlythen waddled back grunted paused and finallypuffed again  in the meantime however lower and still lower toward the goodly city came the object of so much curiosity and the cause of so much smoke in a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be accurately discerned it appeared to beyes it was undoubtedly a species of balloon but surely no such balloon had ever been seen in rotterdam before for who let me ask ever heard of a balloon manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers no man in holland certainly yet here under the very noses of the people or rather at some distance above their noses was the identical thing in question and composed i have it on the best authority of the precise material which no one had ever before known to be used for a similar purpose it was an egregious insult to the good sense of the burghers of rotterdam as to the shape of the phenomenon it was even still more reprehensible being little or nothing better than a huge foolscap turned upside down and this similitude was regarded as by no means lessened when upon nearer inspection there was perceived a large tassel depending from its apex and around the upper rim or base of the cone a circle of little instruments resembling sheepbells which kept up a continual tinkling to the tune of betty martin but still worse suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine there hung by way of car an enormous drab beaver hat with a brim superlatively broad and a hemispherical crown with a black band and a silver buckle it is however somewhat remarkable that many citizens of rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before and indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard it with eyes of familiarity while the vrow grettel pfaall upon sight of it uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise and declared it to be the identical hat of her good man himself now this was a circumstance the more to be observed as pfaall with three companions had actually disappeared from rotterdam about five years before in a very sudden and unaccountable manner and up to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of obtaining any intelligence concerning them whatsoever to be sure some bones which were thought to be human mixed up with a quantity of oddlooking rubbish had been lately discovered in a retired situation to the east of rotterdam and some people went so far as to imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been committed and that the sufferers were in all probability hans pfaall and his associates but to return  the balloon for such no doubt it was had now descended to within a hundred feet of the earth allowing the crowd below a sufficiently distinct view of the person of its occupant this was in truth a very droll little somebody he could not have been more than two feet in height but this altitude little as it was would have been sufficient to destroy his equilibrium and tilt him over the edge of his tiny car but for the intervention of a circular rim reaching as high as the breast and rigged on to the cords of the balloon the body of the little man was more than proportionately broad giving to his entire figure a rotundity highly absurd his feet of course could not be seen at all although a horny substance of suspicious nature was occasionally protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car or to speak more properly in the top of the hat his hands were enormously large his hair was extremely gray and collected in a cue behind his nose was prodigiously long crooked and inflammatory his eyes full brilliant and acute his chin and cheeks although wrinkled with age were broad puffy and double but of ears of any kind or character there was not a semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head this odd little gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of skyblue satin with tight breeches to match fastened with silver buckles at the knees his vest was of some bright yellow material a white taffety cap was set jauntily on one side of his head and to complete his equipment a bloodred silk handkerchief enveloped his throat and fell down in a dainty manner upon his bosom in a fantastic bowknot of supereminent dimensions  having descended as i said before to about one hundred feet from the surface of the earth the little old gentleman was suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation and appeared disinclined to make any nearer approach to terra firma throwing out therefore a quantity of sand from a canvas bag which he lifted with great difficulty he became stationary in an instant he then proceeded in a hurried and agitated manner to extract from a sidepocket in his surtout a large morocco pocketbook this he poised suspiciously in his hand then eyed it with an air of extreme surprise and was evidently astonished at its weight he at length opened it and drawing there from a huge letter sealed with red sealingwax and tied carefully with red tape let it fall precisely at the feet of the burgomaster superbus von underduk his excellency stooped to take it up but the aeronaut still greatly discomposed and having apparently no farther business to detain him in rotterdam began at this moment to make busy preparations for departure and it being necessary to discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to reascend the half dozen bags which he threw out one after another without taking the trouble to empty their contents tumbled every one of them most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster and rolled him over and over no less than oneandtwenty times in the face of every man in rotterdam it is not to be supposed however that the great underduk suffered this impertinence on the part of the little old man to pass off with impunity it is said on the contrary that during each and every one of his oneand twenty circumvolutions he emitted no less than oneandtwenty distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe to which he held fast the whole time with all his might and to which he intends holding fast until the day of his death  in the meantime the balloon arose like a lark and soaring far away above the city at length drifted quietly behind a cloud similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged and was thus lost forever to the wondering eyes of the good citizens of rotterdam all attention was now directed to the letter the descent of which and the consequences attending thereupon had proved so fatally subversive of both person and personal dignity to his excellency the illustrious burgomaster mynheer superbus von underduk that functionary however had not failed during his circumgyratory movements to bestow a thought upon the important subject of securing the packet in question which was seen upon inspection to have fallen into the most proper hands being actually addressed to himself and professor rubadub in their official capacities of president and vicepresident of the rotterdam college of astronomy it was accordingly opened by those dignitaries upon the spot and found to contain the following extraordinary and indeed very serious communications  to their excellencies von underduk and rubadub president and vicepresident of the states college of astronomers in the city of rotterdam  your excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble artizan by name hans pfaall and by occupation a mender of bellows who with three others disappeared from rotterdam about five years ago in a manner which must have been considered by all parties at once sudden and extremely unaccountable if however it so please your excellencies i the writer of this communication am the identical hans pfaall himself it is well known to most of my fellow citizens that for the period of forty years i continued to occupy the little square brick building at the head of the alley called sauerkraut in which i resided at the time of my disappearance my ancestors have also resided therein time out of mindthey as well as myself steadily following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of mending of bellows for to speak the truth until of late years that the heads of all the people have been set agog with politics no better business than my own could an honest citizen of rotterdam either desire or deserve credit was good employment was never wanting and on all hands there was no lack of either money or goodwill but as i was saying we soon began to feel the effects of liberty and long speeches and radicalism and all that sort of thing people who were formerly the very best customers in the world had now not a moment of time to think of us at all they had so they said as much as they could do to read about the revolutions and keep up with the march of intellect and the spirit of the age if a fire wanted fanning it could readily be fanned with a newspaper and as the government grew weaker i have no doubt that leather and iron acquired durability in proportion for in a very short time there was not a pair of bellows in all rotterdam that ever stood in need of a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer this was a state of things not to be endured i soon grew as poor as a rat and having a wife and children to provide for my burdens at length became intolerable and i spent hour after hour in reflecting upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my life duns in the meantime left me little leisure for contemplation my house was literally besieged from morning till night so that i began to rave and foam and fret like a caged tiger against the bars of his enclosure there were three fellows in particular who worried me beyond endurance keeping watch continually about my door and threatening me with the law upon these three i internally vowed the bitterest revenge if ever i should be so happy as to get them within my clutches and i believe nothing in the world but the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from putting my plan of suicide into immediate execution by blowing my brains out with a blunderbuss i thought it best however to dissemble my wrath and to treat them with promises and fair words until by some good turn of fate an opportunity of vengeance should be afforded me  one day having given my creditors the slip and feeling more than usually dejected i continued for a long time to wander about the most obscure streets without object whatever until at length i chanced to stumble against the corner of a booksellers stall seeing a chair close at hand for the use of customers i threw myself doggedly into it and hardly knowing why opened the pages of the first volume which came within my reach it proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on speculative astronomy written either by professor encke of berlin or by a frenchman of somewhat similar name i had some little tincture of information on matters of this nature and soon became more and more absorbed in the contents of the book reading it actually through twice before i awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me by this time it began to grow dark and i directed my steps toward home but the treatise had made an indelible impression on my mind and as i sauntered along the dusky streets i revolved carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the writer there are some particular passages which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary manner the longer i meditated upon these the more intense grew the interest which had been excited within me the limited nature of my education in general and more especially my ignorance on subjects connected with natural philosophy so far from rendering me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what i had read or inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen in consequence merely served as a farther stimulus to imagination and i was vain enough or perhaps reasonable enough to doubt whether those crude ideas which arising in illregulated minds have all the appearance may not often in effect possess all the force the reality and other inherent properties of instinct or intuition whether to proceed a step farther profundity itself might not in matters of a purely speculative nature be detected as a legitimate source of falsity and error in other words i believed and still do believe that truth is frequently of its own essence superficial and that in many cases the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her than in the actual situations wherein she may be found nature herself seemed to afford me corroboration of these ideas in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly that i could not distinguish a star with nearly as much precision when i gazed on it with earnest direct and undeviating attention as when i suffered my eye only to glance in its vicinity alone i was not of course at that time aware that this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the visual area being less susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the exterior portions of the retina this knowledge and some of another kind came afterwards in the course of an eventful five years during which i have dropped the prejudices of my former humble situation in life and forgotten the bellowsmender in far different occupations but at the epoch of which i speak the analogy which a casual observation of a star offered to the conclusions i had already drawn struck me with the force of positive conformation and i then finally made up my mind to the course which i afterwards pursued  it was late when i reached home and i went immediately to bed my mind however was too much occupied to sleep and i lay the whole night buried in meditation arising early in the morning and contriving again to escape the vigilance of my creditors i repaired eagerly to the booksellers stall and laid out what little ready money i possessed in the purchase of some volumes of mechanics and practical astronomy having arrived at home safely with these i devoted every spare moment to their perusal and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as i thought sufficient for the execution of my plan in the intervals of this period i made every endeavor to conciliate the three creditors who had given me so much annoyance in this i finally succeededpartly by selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy a moiety of their claim and partly by a promise of paying the balance upon completion of a little project which i told them i had in view and for assistance in which i solicited their services by these meansfor they were ignorant meni found little difficulty in gaining them over to my purpose  matters being thus arranged i contrived by the aid of my wife and with the greatest secrecy and caution to dispose of what property i had remaining and to borrow in small sums under various pretences and without paying any attention to my future means of repayment no inconsiderable quantity of ready money with the means thus accruing i proceeded to procure at intervals cambric muslin very fine in pieces of twelve yards each twine a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc a large and deep basket of wickerwork made to order and several other articles necessary in the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary dimensions this i directed my wife to make up as soon as possible and gave her all requisite information as to the particular method of proceeding in the meantime i worked up the twine into a network of sufficient dimensions rigged it with a hoop and the necessary cords bought a quadrant a compass a spyglass a common barometer with some important modifications and two astronomical instruments not so generally known i then took opportunities of conveying by night to a retired situation east of rotterdam five ironbound casks to contain about fifty gallons each and one of a larger size six tinned ware tubes three inches in diameter properly shaped and ten feet in length a quantity of a particular metallic substance or semimetal which i shall not name and a dozen demijohns of a very common acid the gas to be formed from these latter materials is a gas never yet generated by any other person than myselfor at least never applied to any similar purpose the secret i would make no difficulty in disclosing but that it of right belongs to a citizen of nantz in france by whom it was conditionally communicated to myself the same individual submitted to me without being at all aware of my intentions a method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a certain animal through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an impossibility i found it however altogether too expensive and was not sure upon the whole whether cambric muslin with a coating of gum caoutchouc was not equally as good i mention this circumstance because i think it probable that hereafter the individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas and material i have spoken of and i do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very singular invention  on the spot which i intended each of the smaller casks to occupy respectively during the inflation of the balloon i privately dug a hole two feet deep the holes forming in this manner a circle twentyfive feet in diameter in the centre of this circle being the station designed for the large cask i also dug a hole three feet in depth in each of the five smaller holes i deposited a canister containing fifty pounds and in the larger one a keg holding one hundred and fifty pounds of cannon powder thesethe keg and canistersi connected in a proper manner with covered trains and having let into one of the canisters the end of about four feet of slow match i covered up the hole and placed the cask over it leaving the other end of the match protruding about an inch and barely visible beyond the cask i then filled up the remaining holes and placed the barrels over them in their destined situation  besides the articles above enumerated i conveyed to the depot and there secreted one of m grimms improvements upon the apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air i found this machine however to require considerable alteration before it could be adapted to the purposes to which i intended making it applicable but with severe labor and unremitting perseverance i at length met with entire success in all my preparations my balloon was soon completed it would contain more than forty thousand cubic feet of gas would take me up easily i calculated with all my implements and if i managed rightly with one hundred and seventyfive pounds of ballast into the bargain it had received three coats of varnish and i found the cambric muslin to answer all the purposes of silk itself quite as strong and a good deal less expensive  everything being now ready i exacted from my wife an oath of secrecy in relation to all my actions from the day of my first visit to the booksellers stall and promising on my part to return as soon as circumstances would permit i gave her what little money i had left and bade her farewell indeed i had no fear on her account she was what people call a notable woman and could manage matters in the world without my assistance i believe to tell the truth she always looked upon me as an idle boy a mere makeweight good for nothing but building castles in the air and was rather glad to get rid of me it was a dark night when i bade her goodbye and taking with me as aidesdecamp the three creditors who had given me so much trouble we carried the balloon with the car and accoutrements by a roundabout way to the station where the other articles were deposited we there found them all unmolested and i proceeded immediately to business  it was the first of april the night as i said before was dark there was not a star to be seen and a drizzling rain falling at intervals rendered us very uncomfortable but my chief anxiety was concerning the balloon which in spite of the varnish with which it was defended began to grow rather heavy with the moisture the powder also was liable to damage i therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence pounding down ice around the central cask and stirring the acid in the others they did not cease however importuning me with questions as to what i intended to do with all this apparatus and expressed much dissatisfaction at the terrible labor i made them undergo they could not perceive so they said what good was likely to result from their getting wet to the skin merely to take a part in such horrible incantations i began to get uneasy and worked away with all my might for i verily believe the idiots supposed that i had entered into a compact with the devil and that in short what i was now doing was nothing better than it should be i was therefore in great fear of their leaving me altogether i contrived however to pacify them by promises of payment of all scores in full as soon as i could bring the present business to a termination to these speeches they gave of course their own interpretation fancying no doubt that at all events i should come into possession of vast quantities of ready money and provided i paid them all i owed and a trifle more in consideration of their services i dare say they cared very little what became of either my soul or my carcass  in about four hours and a half i found the balloon sufficiently inflated i attached the car therefore and put all my implements in itnot forgetting the condensing apparatus a copious supply of water and a large quantity of provisions such as pemmican in which much nutriment is contained in comparatively little bulk i also secured in the car a pair of pigeons and a cat it was now nearly daybreak and i thought it high time to take my departure dropping a lighted cigar on the ground as if by accident i took the opportunity in stooping to pick it up of igniting privately the piece of slow match whose end as i said before protruded a very little beyond the lower rim of one of the smaller casks this manoeuvre was totally unperceived on the part of the three duns and jumping into the car i immediately cut the single cord which held me to the earth and was pleased to find that i shot upward carrying with all ease one hundred and seventyfive pounds of leaden ballast and able to have carried up as many more  scarcely however had i attained the height of fifty yards when roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and tumultuous manner came so dense a hurricane of fire and smoke and sulphur and legs and arms and gravel and burning wood and blazing metal that my very heart sunk within me and i fell down in the bottom of the car trembling with unmitigated terror indeed i now perceived that i had entirely overdone the business and that the main consequences of the shock were yet to be experienced accordingly in less than a second i felt all the blood in my body rushing to my temples and immediately thereupon a concussion which i shall never forget burst abruptly through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament asunder when i afterward had time for reflection i did not fail to attribute the extreme violence of the explosion as regarded myself to its proper causemy situation directly above it and in the line of its greatest power but at the time i thought only of preserving my life the balloon at first collapsed then furiously expanded then whirled round and round with horrible velocity and finally reeling and staggering like a drunken man hurled me with great force over the rim of the car and left me dangling at a terrific height with my head downward and my face outwards by a piece of slender cord about three feet in length which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom of the wickerwork and in which as i fell my left foot became most providentially entangled it is impossibleutterly impossibleto form any adequate idea of the horror of my situation i gasped convulsively for breatha shudder resembling a fit of the ague agitated every nerve and muscle of my framei felt my eyes starting from their socketsa horrible nausea overwhelmed meand at length i fainted away  how long i remained in this state it is impossible to say it must however have been no inconsiderable time for when i partially recovered the sense of existence i found the day breaking the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean and not a trace of land to be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast horizon my sensations however upon thus recovering were by no means so rife with agony as might have been anticipated indeed there was much of incipient madness in the calm survey which i began to take of my situation i drew up to my eyes each of my hands one after the other and wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of the veins and the horrible blackness of the fingernails i afterward carefully examined my head shaking it repeatedly and feeling it with minute attention until i succeeded in satisfying myself that it was not as i had more than half suspected larger than my balloon then in a knowing manner i felt in both my breeches pockets and missing therefrom a set of tablets and a toothpick case endeavored to account for their disappearance and not being able to do so felt inexpressibly chagrined it now occurred to me that i suffered great uneasiness in the joint of my left ankle and a dim consciousness of my situation began to glimmer through my mind but strange to say i was neither astonished nor horrorstricken if i felt any emotion at all it was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness i was about to display in extricating myself from this dilemma and i never for a moment looked upon my ultimate safety as a question susceptible of doubt for a few minutes i remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation i have a distinct recollection of frequently compressing my lips putting my forefinger to the side of my nose and making use of other gesticulations and grimaces common to men who at ease in their armchairs meditate upon matters of intricacy or importance having as i thought sufficiently collected my ideas i now with great caution and deliberation put my hands behind my back and unfastened the large iron buckle which belonged to the waistband of my inexpressibles this buckle had three teeth which being somewhat rusty turned with great difficulty on their axis i brought them however after some trouble at right angles to the body of the buckle and was glad to find them remain firm in that position holding the instrument thus obtained within my teeth i now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat i had to rest several times before i could accomplish this manoeuvre but it was at length accomplished to one end of the cravat i then made fast the buckle and the other end i tied for greater security tightly around my wrist drawing now my body upwards with a prodigious exertion of muscular force i succeeded at the very first trial in throwing the buckle over the car and entangling it as i had anticipated in the circular rim of the wickerwork  my body was now inclined towards the side of the car at an angle of about fortyfive degrees but it must not be understood that i was therefore only fortyfive degrees below the perpendicular so far from it i still lay nearly level with the plane of the horizon for the change of situation which i had acquired had forced the bottom of the car considerably outwards from my position which was accordingly one of the most imminent and deadly peril it should be remembered however that when i fell in the first instance from the car if i had fallen with my face turned toward the balloon instead of turned outwardly from it as it actually was or if in the second place the cord by which i was suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge instead of through a crevice near the bottom of the cari say it may be readily conceived that in either of these supposed cases i should have been unable to accomplish even as much as i had now accomplished and the wonderful adventures of hans pfaall would have been utterly lost to posterity i had therefore every reason to be grateful although in point of fact i was still too stupid to be anything at all and hung for perhaps a quarter of an hour in that extraordinary manner without making the slightest farther exertion whatsoever and in a singularly tranquil state of idiotic enjoyment but this feeling did not fail to die rapidly away and thereunto succeeded horror and dismay and a chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin in fact the blood so long accumulating in the vessels of my head and throat and which had hitherto buoyed up my spirits with madness and delirium had now begun to retire within their proper channels and the distinctness which was thus added to my perception of the danger merely served to deprive me of the selfpossession and courage to encounter it but this weakness was luckily for me of no very long duration in good time came to my rescue the spirit of despair and with frantic cries and struggles i jerked my way bodily upwards till at length clutching with a viselike grip the longdesired rim i writhed my person over it and fell headlong and shuddering within the car  it was not until some time afterward that i recovered myself sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon i then however examined it with attention and found it to my great relief uninjured my implements were all safe and fortunately i had lost neither ballast nor provisions indeed i had so well secured them in their places that such an accident was entirely out of the question looking at my watch i found it six oclock i was still rapidly ascending and my barometer gave a present altitude of three and threequarter miles immediately beneath me in the ocean lay a small black object slightly oblong in shape seemingly about the size and in every way bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish toys called a domino bringing my telescope to bear upon it i plainly discerned it to be a british ninety fourgun ship closehauled and pitching heavily in the sea with her head to the wsw besides this ship i saw nothing but the ocean and the sky and the sun which had long arisen  it is now high time that i should explain to your excellencies the object of my perilous voyage your excellencies will bear in mind that distressed circumstances in rotterdam had at length driven me to the resolution of committing suicide it was not however that to life itself i had any positive disgust but that i was harassed beyond endurance by the adventitious miseries attending my situation in this state of mind wishing to live yet wearied with life the treatise at the stall of the bookseller opened a resource to my imagination i then finally made up my mind i determined to depart yet liveto leave the world yet continue to existin short to drop enigmas i resolved let what would ensue to force a passage if i could to the moon now lest i should be supposed more of a madman than i actually am i will detail as well as i am able the considerations which led me to believe that an achievement of this nature although without doubt difficult and incontestably full of danger was not absolutely to a bold spirit beyond the confines of the possible  the moons actual distance from the earth was the first thing to be attended to now the mean or average interval between the centres of the two planets is 599643 of the earths equatorial radii or only about 237000 miles i say the mean or average interval but it must be borne in mind that the form of the moons orbit being an ellipse of eccentricity amounting to no less than 005484 of the major semiaxis of the ellipse itself and the earths centre being situated in its focus if i could in any manner contrive to meet the moon as it were in its perigee the above mentioned distance would be materially diminished but to say nothing at present of this possibility it was very certain that at all events from the 237000 miles i would have to deduct the radius of the earth say 4000 and the radius of the moon say 1080 in all 5080 leaving an actual interval to be traversed under average circumstances of 231920 miles now this i reflected was no very extraordinary distance travelling on land has been repeatedly accomplished at the rate of thirty miles per hour and indeed a much greater speed may be anticipated but even at this velocity it would take me no more than 322 days to reach the surface of the moon there were however many particulars inducing me to believe that my average rate of travelling might possibly very much exceed that of thirty miles per hour and as these considerations did not fail to make a deep impression upon my mind i will mention them more fully hereafter  the next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater importance from indications afforded by the barometer we find that in ascensions from the surface of the earth we have at the height of 1000 feet left below us about onethirtieth of the entire mass of atmospheric air that at 10600 we have ascended through nearly onethird and that at 18000 which is not far from the elevation of cotopaxi we have surmounted onehalf the material or at all events onehalf the ponderable body of air incumbent upon our globe it is also calculated that at an altitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the earths diameterthat is not exceeding eighty milesthe rarefaction would be so excessive that animal life could in no manner be sustained and moreover that the most delicate means we possess of ascertaining the presence of the atmosphere would be inadequate to assure us of its existence but i did not fail to perceive that these latter calculations are founded altogether on our experimental knowledge of the properties of air and the mechanical laws regulating its dilation and compression in what may be called comparatively speaking the immediate vicinity of the earth itself and at the same time it is taken for granted that animal life is and must be essentially incapable of modification at any given unattainable distance from the surface now all such reasoning and from such data must of course be simply analogical the greatest height ever reached by man was that of 25000 feet attained in the aeronautic expedition of messieurs gaylussac and biot this is a moderate altitude even when compared with the eighty miles in question and i could not help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and great latitude for speculation  but in point of fact an ascension being made to any given altitude the ponderable quantity of air surmounted in any farther ascension is by no means in proportion to the additional height ascended as may be plainly seen from what has been stated before but in a ratio constantly decreasing it is therefore evident that ascend as high as we may we cannot literally speaking arrive at a limit beyond which no atmosphere is to be found it must exist i argued although it may exist in a state of infinite rarefaction  on the other hand i was aware that arguments have not been wanting to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to the atmosphere beyond which there is absolutely no air whatsoever but a circumstance which has been left out of view by those who contend for such a limit seemed to me although no positive refutation of their creed still a point worthy very serious investigation on comparing the intervals between the successive arrivals of enckes comet at its perihelion after giving credit in the most exact manner for all the disturbances due to the attractions of the planets it appears that the periods are gradually diminishing that is to say the major axis of the comets ellipse is growing shorter in a slow but perfectly regular decrease now this is precisely what ought to be the case if we suppose a resistance experienced from the comet from an extremely rare ethereal medium pervading the regions of its orbit for it is evident that such a medium must in retarding the comets velocity increase its centripetal by weakening its centrifugal force in other words the suns attraction would be constantly attaining greater power and the comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution indeed there is no other way of accounting for the variation in question but again the real diameter of the same comets nebulosity is observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun and dilate with equal rapidity in its departure towards its aphelion was i not justifiable in supposing with m valz that this apparent condensation of volume has its origin in the compression of the same ethereal medium i have spoken of before and which is only denser in proportion to its solar vicinity the lenticularshaped phenomenon also called the zodiacal light was a matter worthy of attention this radiance so apparent in the tropics and which cannot be mistaken for any meteoric lustre extends from the horizon obliquely upward and follows generally the direction of the suns equator it appeared to me evidently in the nature of a rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward beyond the orbit of venus at least and i believed indefinitely farther2 indeed this medium i could not suppose confined to the path of the comets ellipse or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun it was easy on the contrary to imagine it pervading the entire regions of our planetary system condensed into what we call atmosphere at the planets themselves and perhaps at some of them modified by considerations so to speak purely geological  having adopted this view of the subject i had little further hesitation granting that on my passage i should meet with atmosphere essentially the same as at the surface of the earth i conceived that by means of the very ingenious apparatus of m grimm i should readily be enabled to condense it in sufficient quantity for the purposes of respiration this would remove the chief obstacle in a journey to the moon i had indeed spent some money and great labor in adapting the apparatus to the object intended and confidently looked forward to its successful application if i could manage to complete the voyage within any reasonable period this brings me back to the rate at which it might be possible to travel  it is true that balloons in the first stage of their ascensions from the earth are known to rise with a velocity comparatively moderate now the power of elevation lies altogether in the superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with the atmospheric air and at first sight it does not appear probable that as the balloon acquires altitude and consequently arrives successively in atmospheric strata of densities rapidly diminishingi say it does not appear at all reasonable that in this its progress upwards the original velocity should be accelerated on the other hand i was not aware that in any recorded ascension a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate of ascent although such should have been the case if on account of nothing else on account of the escape of gas through balloons illconstructed and varnished with no better material than the ordinary varnish it seemed therefore that the effect of such escape was only sufficient to counterbalance the effect of some accelerating power i now considered that provided in my passage i found the medium i had imagined and provided that it should prove to be actually and essentially what we denominate atmospheric air it could make comparatively little difference at what extreme state of rarefaction i should discover itthat is to say in regard to my power of ascendingfor the gas in the balloon would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially similar in proportion to the occurrence of which i could suffer an escape of so much as would be requisite to prevent explosion but being what it was would at all events continue specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere nitrogen and oxygen in the meantime the force of gravitation would be constantly diminishing in proportion to the squares of the distances and thus with a velocity prodigiously accelerating i should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force of the earths attraction would be superseded by that of the moon in accordance with these ideas i did not think it worth while to encumber myself with more provisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days  there was still however another difficulty which occasioned me some little disquietude it has been observed that in balloon ascensions to any considerable height besides the pain attending respiration great uneasiness is experienced about the head and body often accompanied with bleeding at the nose and other symptoms of an alarming kind and growing more and more inconvenient in proportion to the altitude attained3 this was a reflection of a nature somewhat startling was it not probable that these symptoms would increase indefinitely or at least until terminated by death itself i finally thought not their origin was to be looked for in the progressive removal of the customary atmospheric pressure upon the surface of the body and consequent distention of the superficial bloodvesselsnot in any positive disorganization of the animal system as in the case of difficulty in breathing where the atmospheric density is chemically insufficient for the due renovation of blood in a ventricle of the heart unless for default of this renovation i could see no reason therefore why life could not be sustained even in a vacuum for the expansion and compression of chest commonly called breathing is action purely muscular and the cause not the effect of respiration in a word i conceived that as the body should become habituated to the want of atmospheric pressure the sensations of pain would gradually diminishand to endure them while they continued i relied with confidence upon the iron hardihood of my constitution  thus may it please your excellencies i have detailed some though by no means all the considerations which led me to form the project of a lunar voyage i shall now proceed to lay before you the result of an attempt so apparently audacious in conception and at all events so utterly unparalleled in the annals of mankind  having attained the altitude before mentioned that is to say three miles and threequarters i threw out from the car a quantity of feathers and found that i still ascended with sufficient rapidity there was therefore no necessity for discharging any ballast i was glad of this for i wished to retain with me as much weight as i could carry for reasons which will be explained in the sequel i as yet suffered no bodily inconvenience breathing with great freedom and feeling no pain whatever in the head the cat was lying very demurely upon my coat which i had taken off and eyeing the pigeons with an air of nonchalance these latter being tied by the leg to prevent their escape were busily employed in picking up some grains of rice scattered for them in the bottom of the car  at twenty minutes past six oclock the barometer showed an elevation of 26400 feet or five miles to a fraction the prospect seemed unbounded indeed it is very easily calculated by means of spherical geometry what a great extent of the earths area i beheld the convex surface of any segment of a sphere is to the entire surface of the sphere itself as the versed sine of the segment to the diameter of the sphere now in my case the versed sinethat is to say the thickness of the segment beneath mewas about equal to my elevation or the elevation of the point of sight above the surface as five miles then to eight thousand would express the proportion of the earths area seen by me in other words i beheld as much as a sixteenhundredth part of the whole surface of the globe the sea appeared unruffled as a mirror although by means of the spyglass i could perceive it to be in a state of violent agitation the ship was no longer visible having drifted away apparently to the eastward i now began to experience at intervals severe pain in the head especially about the earsstill however breathing with tolerable freedom the cat and pigeons seemed to suffer no inconvenience whatsoever  at twenty minutes before seven the balloon entered a long series of dense cloud which put me to great trouble by damaging my condensing apparatus and wetting me to the skin this was to be sure a singular recontre for i had not believed it possible that a cloud of this nature could be sustained at so great an elevation i thought it best however to throw out two fivepound pieces of ballast reserving still a weight of one hundred and sixtyfive pounds upon so doing i soon rose above the difficulty and perceived immediately that i had obtained a great increase in my rate of ascent in a few seconds after my leaving the cloud a flash of vivid lightning shot from one end of it to the other and caused it to kindle up throughout its vast extent like a mass of ignited and glowing charcoal this it must be remembered was in the broad light of day no fancy may picture the sublimity which might have been exhibited by a similar phenomenon taking place amid the darkness of the night hell itself might have been found a fitting image even as it was my hair stood on end while i gazed afar down within the yawning abysses letting imagination descend as it were and stalk about in the strange vaulted halls and ruddy gulfs and red ghastly chasms of the hideous and unfathomable fire i had indeed made a narrow escape had the balloon remained a very short while longer within the cloudthat is to sayhad not the inconvenience of getting wet determined me to discharge the ballast inevitable ruin would have been the consequence such perils although little considered are perhaps the greatest which must be encountered in balloons i had by this time however attained too great an elevation to be any longer uneasy on this head  i was now rising rapidly and by seven oclock the barometer indicated an altitude of no less than nine miles and a half i began to find great difficulty in drawing my breath my head too was excessively painful and having felt for some time a moisture about my cheeks i at length discovered it to be blood which was oozing quite fast from the drums of my ears my eyes also gave me great uneasiness upon passing the hand over them they seemed to have protruded from their sockets in no inconsiderable degree and all objects in the car and even the balloon itself appeared distorted to my vision these symptoms were more than i had expected and occasioned me some alarm at this juncture very imprudently and without consideration i threw out from the car three fivepound pieces of ballast the accelerated rate of ascent thus obtained carried me too rapidly and without sufficient gradation into a highly rarefied stratum of the atmosphere and the result had nearly proved fatal to my expedition and to myself i was suddenly seized with a spasm which lasted for more than five minutes and even when this in a measure ceased i could catch my breath only at long intervals and in a gasping mannerbleeding all the while copiously at the nose and ears and even slightly at the eyes the pigeons appeared distressed in the extreme and struggled to escape while the cat mewed piteously and with her tongue hanging out of her mouth staggered to and fro in the car as if under the influence of poison i now too late discovered the great rashness of which i had been guilty in discharging the ballast and my agitation was excessive i anticipated nothing less than death and death in a few minutes the physical suffering i underwent contributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any exertion for the preservation of my life i had indeed little power of reflection left and the violence of the pain in my head seemed to be greatly on the increase thus i found that my senses would shortly give way altogether and i had already clutched one of the valve ropes with the view of attempting a descent when the recollection of the trick i had played the three creditors and the possible consequences to myself should i return operated to deter me for the moment i lay down in the bottom of the car and endeavored to collect my faculties in this i so far succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood having no lancet however i was constrained to perform the operation in the best manner i was able and finally succeeded in opening a vein in my right arm with the blade of my penknife the blood had hardly commenced flowing when i experienced a sensible relief and by the time i had lost about half a moderate basin full most of the worst symptoms had abandoned me entirely i nevertheless did not think it expedient to attempt getting on my feet immediately but having tied up my arm as well as i could i lay still for about a quarter of an hour at the end of this time i arose and found myself freer from absolute pain of any kind than i had been during the last hour and a quarter of my ascension the difficulty of breathing however was diminished in a very slight degree and i found that it would soon be positively necessary to make use of my condenser in the meantime looking toward the cat who was again snugly stowed away upon my coat i discovered to my infinite surprise that she had taken the opportunity of my indisposition to bring into light a litter of three little kittens this was an addition to the number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected but i was pleased at the occurrence it would afford me a chance of bringing to a kind of test the truth of a surmise which more than anything else had influenced me in attempting this ascension i had imagined that the habitual endurance of the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the earth was the cause or nearly so of the pain attending animal existence at a distance above the surface should the kittens be found to suffer uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother i must consider my theory in fault but a failure to do so i should look upon as a strong confirmation of my idea  by eight oclock i had actually attained an elevation of seventeen miles above the surface of the earth thus it seemed to me evident that my rate of ascent was not only on the increase but that the progression would have been apparent in a slight degree even had i not discharged the ballast which i did the pains in my head and ears returned at intervals with violence and i still continued to bleed occasionally at the nose but upon the whole i suffered much less than might have been expected i breathed however at every moment with more and more difficulty and each inhalation was attended with a troublesome spasmodic action of the chest i now unpacked the condensing apparatus and got it ready for immediate use  the view of the earth at this period of my ascension was beautiful indeed to the westward the northward and the southward as far as i could see lay a boundless sheet of apparently unruffled ocean which every moment gained a deeper and a deeper tint of blue and began already to assume a slight appearance of convexity at a vast distance to the eastward although perfectly discernible extended the islands of great britain the entire atlantic coasts of france and spain with a small portion of the northern part of the continent of africa of individual edifices not a trace could be discovered and the proudest cities of mankind had utterly faded away from the face of the earth from the rock of gibraltar now dwindled into a dim speck the dark mediterranean sea dotted with shining islands as the heaven is dotted with stars spread itself out to the eastward as far as my vision extended until its entire mass of waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss of the horizon and i found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes of the mighty cataract overhead the sky was of a jetty black and the stars were brilliantly visible  the pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering i determined upon giving them their liberty i first untied one of them a beautiful graymottled pigeon and placed him upon the rim of the wickerwork he appeared extremely uneasy looking anxiously around him fluttering his wings and making a loud cooing noise but could not be persuaded to trust himself from off the car i took him up at last and threw him to about half a dozen yards from the balloon he made however no attempt to descend as i had expected but struggled with great vehemence to get back uttering at the same time very shrill and piercing cries he at length succeeded in regaining his former station on the rim but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his breast and he fell dead within the car the other one did not prove so unfortunate to prevent his following the example of his companion and accomplishing a return i threw him downward with all my force and was pleased to find him continue his descent with great velocity making use of his wings with ease and in a perfectly natural manner in a very short time he was out of sight and i have no doubt he reached home in safety puss who seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness now made a hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much apparent satisfaction her kittens were quite lively and so far evinced not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever  at a quarterpast eight being no longer able to draw breath without the most intolerable pain i proceeded forthwith to adjust around the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser this apparatus will require some little explanation and your excellencies will please to bear in mind that my object in the first place was to surround myself and cat entirely with a barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in which i was existing with the intention of introducing within this barricade by means of my condenser a quantity of this same atmosphere sufficiently condensed for the purposes of respiration with this object in view i had prepared a very strong perfectly airtight but flexible gumelastic bag in this bag which was of sufficient dimensions the entire car was in a manner placed that is to say it the bag was drawn over the whole bottom of the car up its sides and so on along the outside of the ropes to the upper rim or hoop where the network is attached having pulled the bag up in this way and formed a complete enclosure on all sides and at bottom it was now necessary to fasten up its top or mouth by passing its material over the hoop of the networkin other words between the network and the hoop but if the network were separated from the hoop to admit this passage what was to sustain the car in the meantime now the network was not permanently fastened to the hoop but attached by a series of running loops or nooses i therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time leaving the car suspended by the remainder having thus inserted a portion of the cloth forming the upper part of the bag i refastened the loopsnot to the hoop for that would have been impossible since the cloth now intervenedbut to a series of large buttons affixed to the cloth itself about three feet below the mouth of the bag the intervals between the buttons having been made to correspond to the intervals between the loops this done a few more of the loops were unfastened from the rim a farther portion of the cloth introduced and the disengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons in this way it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the bag between the network and the hoop it is evident that the hoop would now drop down within the car while the whole weight of the car itself with all its contents would be held up merely by the strength of the buttons this at first sight would seem an inadequate dependence but it was by no means so for the buttons were not only very strong in themselves but so close together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was supported by any one of them indeed had the car and contents been three times heavier than they were i should not have been at all uneasy i now raised up the hoop again within the covering of gumelastic and propped it at nearly its former height by means of three light poles prepared for the occasion this was done of course to keep the bag distended at the top and to preserve the lower part of the network in its proper situation all that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of the enclosure and this was readily accomplished by gathering the folds of the material together and twisting them up very tightly on the inside by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet  in the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car had been inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass through which i could see without difficulty around me in every horizontal direction in that portion of the cloth forming the bottom was likewise a fourth window of the same kind and corresponding with a small aperture in the floor of the car itself this enabled me to see perpendicularly down but having found it impossible to place any similar contrivance overhead on account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening there and the consequent wrinkles in the cloth i could expect to see no objects situated directly in my zenith this of course was a matter of little consequence for had i even been able to place a window at top the balloon itself would have prevented my making any use of it  about a foot below one of the side windows was a circular opening eight inches in diameter and fitted with a brass rim adapted in its inner edge to the windings of a screw in this rim was screwed the large tube of the condenser the body of the machine being of course within the chamber of gumelastic through this tube a quantity of the rare atmosphere circumjacent being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the body of the machine was thence discharged in a state of condensation to mingle with the thin air already in the chamber this operation being repeated several times at length filled the chamber with atmosphere proper for all the purposes of respiration but in so confined a space it would in a short time necessarily become foul and unfit for use from frequent contact with the lungs it was then ejected by a small valve at the bottom of the carthe dense air readily sinking into the thinner atmosphere below to avoid the inconvenience of making a total vacuum at any moment within the chamber this purification was never accomplished all at once but in a gradual mannerthe valve being opened only for a few seconds then closed again until one or two strokes from the pump of the condenser had supplied the place of the atmosphere ejected for the sake of experiment i had put the cat and kittens in a small basket and suspended it outside the car to a button at the bottom close by the valve through which i could feed them at any moment when necessary i did this at some little risk and before closing the mouth of the chamber by reaching under the car with one of the poles before mentioned to which a hook had been attached  by the time i had fully completed these arrangements and filled the chamber as explained it wanted only ten minutes of nine oclock during the whole period of my being thus employed i endured the most terrible distress from difficulty of respiration and bitterly did i repent the negligence or rather foolhardiness of which i had been guilty of putting off to the last moment a matter of so much importance but having at length accomplished it i soon began to reap the benefit of my invention once again i breathed with perfect freedom and easeand indeed why should i not i was also agreeably surprised to find myself in a great measure relieved from the violent pains which had hitherto tormented me a slight headache accompanied with a sensation of fulness or distention about the wrists the ankles and the throat was nearly all of which i had now to complain thus it seemed evident that a greater part of the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric pressure had actually worn off as i had expected and that much of the pain endured for the last two hours should have been attributed altogether to the effects of a deficient respiration  at twenty minutes before nine oclockthat is to say a short time prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber the mercury attained its limit or ran down in the barometer which as i mentioned before was one of an extended construction it then indicated an altitude on my part of 132000 feet or fiveandtwenty miles and i consequently surveyed at that time an extent of the earths area amounting to no less than the three hundredandtwentieth part of its entire superficies at nine oclock i had again lost sight of land to the eastward but not before i became aware that the balloon was drifting rapidly to the n n w the convexity of the ocean beneath me was very evident indeed although my view was often interrupted by the masses of cloud which floated to and fro i observed now that even the lightest vapors never rose to more than ten miles above the level of the sea  at half past nine i tried the experiment of throwing out a handful of feathers through the valve they did not float as i had expected but dropped down perpendicularly like a bullet en masse and with the greatest velocitybeing out of sight in a very few seconds i did not at first know what to make of this extraordinary phenomenon not being able to believe that my rate of ascent had of a sudden met with so prodigious an acceleration but it soon occurred to me that the atmosphere was now far too rare to sustain even the feathers that they actually fell as they appeared to do with great rapidity and that i had been surprised by the united velocities of their descent and my own elevation  by ten oclock i found that i had very little to occupy my immediate attention affairs went swimmingly and i believed the balloon to be going upward with a speed increasing momently although i had no longer any means of ascertaining the progression of the increase i suffered no pain or uneasiness of any kind and enjoyed better spirits than i had at any period since my departure from rotterdam busying myself now in examining the state of my various apparatus and now in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber this latter point i determined to attend to at regular intervals of forty minutes more on account of the preservation of my health than from so frequent a renovation being absolutely necessary in the meanwhile i could not help making anticipations fancy revelled in the wild and dreamy regions of the moon imagination feeling herself for once unshackled roamed at will among the everchanging wonders of a shadowy and unstable land now there were hoary and timehonored forests and craggy precipices and waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without a bottom then i came suddenly into still noonday solitudes where no wind of heaven ever intruded and where vast meadows of poppies and slender lilylooking flowers spread themselves out a weary distance all silent and motionless forever then again i journeyed far down away into another country where it was all one dim and vague lake with a boundary line of clouds and out of this melancholy water arose a forest of tall eastern trees like a wilderness of dreams and i have in mind that the shadows of the trees which fell upon the lake remained not on the surface where they fell but sunk slowly and steadily down and commingled with the waves while from the trunks of the trees other shadows were continually coming out and taking the place of their brothers thus entombed this then i said thoughtfully is the very reason why the waters of this lake grow blacker with age and more melancholy as the hours run on but fancies such as these were not the sole possessors of my brain horrors of a nature most stern and most appalling would too frequently obtrude themselves upon my mind and shake the innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of their possibility yet i would not suffer my thoughts for any length of time to dwell upon these latter speculations rightly judging the real and palpable dangers of the voyage sufficient for my undivided attention  at five oclock pm being engaged in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber i took that opportunity of observing the cat and kittens through the valve the cat herself appeared to suffer again very much and i had no hesitation in attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a difficulty in breathing but my experiment with the kittens had resulted very strangely i had expected of course to see them betray a sense of pain although in a less degree than their mother and this would have been sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual endurance of atmospheric pressure but i was not prepared to find them upon close examination evidently enjoying a high degree of health breathing with the greatest ease and perfect regularity and evincing not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever i could only account for all this by extending my theory and supposing that the highly rarefied atmosphere around might perhaps not be as i had taken for granted chemically insufficient for the purposes of life and that a person born in such a medium might possibly be unaware of any inconvenience attending its inhalation while upon removal to the denser strata near the earth he might endure tortures of a similar nature to those i had so lately experienced it has since been to me a matter of deep regret that an awkward accident at this time occasioned me the loss of my little family of cats and deprived me of the insight into this matter which a continued experiment might have afforded in passing my hand through the valve with a cup of water for the old puss the sleeves of my shirt became entangled in the loop which sustained the basket and thus in a moment loosened it from the bottom had the whole actually vanished into air it could not have shot from my sight in a more abrupt and instantaneous manner positively there could not have intervened the tenth part of a second between the disengagement of the basket and its absolute and total disappearance with all that it contained my good wishes followed it to the earth but of course i had no hope that either cat or kittens would ever live to tell the tale of their misfortune  at six oclock i perceived a great portion of the earths visible area to the eastward involved in thick shadow which continued to advance with great rapidity until at five minutes before seven the whole surface in view was enveloped in the darkness of night it was not however until long after this time that the rays of the setting sun ceased to illumine the balloon and this circumstance although of course fully anticipated did not fail to give me an infinite deal of pleasure it was evident that in the morning i should behold the rising luminary many hours at least before the citizens of rotterdam in spite of their situation so much farther to the eastward and thus day after day in proportion to the height ascended would i enjoy the light of the sun for a longer and a longer period i now determined to keep a journal of my passage reckoning the days from one to twentyfour hours continuously without taking into consideration the intervals of darkness  at ten oclock feeling sleepy i determined to lie down for the rest of the night but here a difficulty presented itself which obvious as it may appear had escaped my attention up to the very moment of which i am now speaking if i went to sleep as i proposed how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim to breathe it for more than an hour at the farthest would be a matter of impossibility or if even this term could be extended to an hour and a quarter the most ruinous consequences might ensue the consideration of this dilemma gave me no little disquietude and it will hardly be believed that after the dangers i had undergone i should look upon this business in so serious a light as to give up all hope of accomplishing my ultimate design and finally make up my mind to the necessity of a descent but this hesitation was only momentary i reflected that man is the veriest slave of custom and that many points in the routine of his existence are deemed essentially important which are only so at all by his having rendered them habitual it was very certain that i could not do without sleep but i might easily bring myself to feel no inconvenience from being awakened at intervals of an hour during the whole period of my repose it would require but five minutes at most to regenerate the atmosphere in the fullest manner and the only real difficulty was to contrive a method of arousing myself at the proper moment for so doing but this was a question which i am willing to confess occasioned me no little trouble in its solution to be sure i had heard of the student who to prevent his falling asleep over his books held in one hand a ball of copper the din of whose descent into a basin of the same metal on the floor beside his chair served effectually to startle him up if at any moment he should be overcome with drowsiness my own case however was very different indeed and left me no room for any similar idea for i did not wish to keep awake but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time i at length hit upon the following expedient which simple as it may seem was hailed by me at the moment of discovery as an invention fully equal to that of the telescope the steamengine or the art of printing itself  it is necessary to premise that the balloon at the elevation now attained continued its course upward with an even and undeviating ascent and the car consequently followed with a steadiness so perfect that it would have been impossible to detect in it the slightest vacillation whatever this circumstance favored me greatly in the project i now determined to adopt my supply of water had been put on board in kegs containing five gallons each and ranged very securely around the interior of the car i unfastened one of these and taking two ropes tied them tightly across the rim of the wickerwork from one side to the other placing them about a foot apart and parallel so as to form a kind of shelf upon which i placed the keg and steadied it in a horizontal position about eight inches immediately below these ropes and four feet from the bottom of the car i fastened another shelfbut made of thin plank being the only similar piece of wood i had upon this latter shelf and exactly beneath one of the rims of the keg a small earthern pitcher was deposited i now bored a hole in the end of the keg over the pitcher and fitted in a plug of soft wood cut in a tapering or conical shape this plug i pushed in or pulled out as might happen until after a few experiments it arrived at that exact degree of tightness at which the water oozing from the hole and falling into the pitcher below would fill the latter to the brim in the period of sixty minutes this of course was a matter briefly and easily ascertained by noticing the proportion of the pitcher filled in any given time having arranged all this the rest of the plan is obvious my bed was so contrived upon the floor of the car as to bring my head in lying down immediately below the mouth of the pitcher it was evident that at the expiration of an hour the pitcher getting full would be forced to run over and to run over at the mouth which was somewhat lower than the rim it was also evident that the water thus falling from a height of more than four feet could not do otherwise than fall upon my face and that the sure consequences would be to waken me up instantaneously even from the soundest slumber in the world  it was fully eleven by the time i had completed these arrangements and i immediately betook myself to bed with full confidence in the efficiency of my invention nor in this matter was i disappointed punctually every sixty minutes was i aroused by my trusty chronometer when having emptied the pitcher into the bunghole of the keg and performed the duties of the condenser i retired again to bed these regular interruptions to my slumber caused me even less discomfort than i had anticipated and when i finally arose for the day it was seven oclock and the sun had attained many degrees above the line of my horizon  april 3d i found the balloon at an immense height indeed and the earths apparent convexity increased in a material degree below me in the ocean lay a cluster of black specks which undoubtedly were islands far away to the northward i perceived a thin white and exceedingly brilliant line or streak on the edge of the horizon and i had no hesitation in supposing it to be the southern disk of the ices of the polar sea my curiosity was greatly excited for i had hopes of passing on much farther to the north and might possibly at some period find myself placed directly above the pole itself i now lamented that my great elevation would in this case prevent my taking as accurate a survey as i could wish much however might be ascertained nothing else of an extraordinary nature occurred during the day my apparatus all continued in good order and the balloon still ascended without any perceptible vacillation the cold was intense and obliged me to wrap up closely in an overcoat when darkness came over the earth i betook myself to bed although it was for many hours afterward broad daylight all around my immediate situation the waterclock was punctual in its duty and i slept until next morning soundly with the exception of the periodical interruption  april 4th arose in good health and spirits and was astonished at the singular change which had taken place in the appearance of the sea it had lost in a great measure the deep tint of blue it had hitherto worn being now of a grayishwhite and of a lustre dazzling to the eye the islands were no longer visible whether they had passed down the horizon to the southeast or whether my increasing elevation had left them out of sight it is impossible to say i was inclined however to the latter opinion the rim of ice to the northward was growing more and more apparent cold by no means so intense nothing of importance occurred and i passed the day in reading having taken care to supply myself with books  april 5th beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising while nearly the whole visible surface of the earth continued to be involved in darkness in time however the light spread itself over all and i again saw the line of ice to the northward it was now very distinct and appeared of a much darker hue than the waters of the ocean i was evidently approaching it and with great rapidity fancied i could again distinguish a strip of land to the eastward and one also to the westward but could not be certain weather moderate nothing of any consequence happened during the day went early to bed  april 6th was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very moderate distance and an immense field of the same material stretching away off to the horizon in the north it was evident that if the balloon held its present course it would soon arrive above the frozen ocean and i had now little doubt of ultimately seeing the pole during the whole of the day i continued to near the ice toward night the limits of my horizon very suddenly and materially increased owing undoubtedly to the earths form being that of an oblate spheroid and my arriving above the flattened regions in the vicinity of the arctic circle when darkness at length overtook me i went to bed in great anxiety fearing to pass over the object of so much curiosity when i should have no opportunity of observing it  april 7th arose early and to my great joy at length beheld what there could be no hesitation in supposing the northern pole itself it was there beyond a doubt and immediately beneath my feet but alas i had now ascended to so vast a distance that nothing could with accuracy be discerned indeed to judge from the progression of the numbers indicating my various altitudes respectively at different periods between six am on the second of april and twenty minutes before nine am of the same day at which time the barometer ran down it might be fairly inferred that the balloon had now at four oclock in the morning of april the seventh reached a height of not less certainly than 7254 miles above the surface of the sea this elevation may appear immense but the estimate upon which it is calculated gave a result in all probability far inferior to the truth at all events i undoubtedly beheld the whole of the earths major diameter the entire northern hemisphere lay beneath me like a chart orthographically projected and the great circle of the equator itself formed the boundary line of my horizon your excellencies may however readily imagine that the confined regions hitherto unexplored within the limits of the arctic circle although situated directly beneath me and therefore seen without any appearance of being foreshortened were still in themselves comparatively too diminutive and at too great a distance from the point of sight to admit of any very accurate examination nevertheless what could be seen was of a nature singular and exciting northwardly from that huge rim before mentioned and which with slight qualification may be called the limit of human discovery in these regions one unbroken or nearly unbroken sheet of ice continues to extend in the first few degrees of this its progress its surface is very sensibly flattened farther on depressed into a plane and finally becoming not a little concave it terminates at the pole itself in a circular centre sharply defined whose apparent diameter subtended at the balloon an angle of about sixtyfive seconds and whose dusky hue varying in intensity was at all times darker than any other spot upon the visible hemisphere and occasionally deepened into the most absolute and impenetrable blackness farther than this little could be ascertained by twelve oclock the circular centre had materially decreased in circumference and by seven pm i lost sight of it entirely the balloon passing over the western limb of the ice and floating away rapidly in the direction of the equator  april 8th found a sensible diminution in the earths apparent diameter besides a material alteration in its general color and appearance the whole visible area partook in different degrees of a tint of pale yellow and in some portions had acquired a brilliancy even painful to the eye my view downward was also considerably impeded by the dense atmosphere in the vicinity of the surface being loaded with clouds between whose masses i could only now and then obtain a glimpse of the earth itself this difficulty of direct vision had troubled me more or less for the last fortyeight hours but my present enormous elevation brought closer together as it were the floating bodies of vapor and the inconvenience became of course more and more palpable in proportion to my ascent nevertheless i could easily perceive that the balloon now hovered above the range of great lakes in the continent of north america and was holding a course due south which would bring me to the tropics this circumstance did not fail to give me the most heartful satisfaction and i hailed it as a happy omen of ultimate success indeed the direction i had hitherto taken had filled me with uneasiness for it was evident that had i continued it much longer there would have been no possibility of my arriving at the moon at all whose orbit is inclined to the ecliptic at only the small angle of 5 degrees 8 48  april 9th today the earths diameter was greatly diminished and the color of the surface assumed hourly a deeper tint of yellow the balloon kept steadily on her course to the southward and arrived at nine pm over the northern edge of the mexican gulf  april 10th i was suddenly aroused from slumber about five oclock this morning by a loud crackling and terrific sound for which i could in no manner account it was of very brief duration but while it lasted resembled nothing in the world of which i had any previous experience it is needless to say that i became excessively alarmed having in the first instance attributed the noise to the bursting of the balloon i examined all my apparatus however with great attention and could discover nothing out of order spent a great part of the day in meditating upon an occurrence so extraordinary but could find no means whatever of accounting for it went to bed dissatisfied and in a state of great anxiety and agitation  april 11th found a startling diminution in the apparent diameter of the earth and a considerable increase now observable for the first time in that of the moon itself which wanted only a few days of being full it now required long and excessive labor to condense within the chamber sufficient atmospheric air for the sustenance of life  april 12th a singular alteration took place in regard to the direction of the balloon and although fully anticipated afforded me the most unequivocal delight having reached in its former course about the twentieth parallel of southern latitude it turned off suddenly at an acute angle to the eastward and thus proceeded throughout the day keeping nearly if not altogether in the exact plane of the lunar elipse what was worthy of remark a very perceptible vacillation in the car was a consequence of this change of routea vacillation which prevailed in a more or less degree for a period of many hours  april 13th was again very much alarmed by a repetition of the loud crackling noise which terrified me on the tenth thought long upon the subject but was unable to form any satisfactory conclusion great decrease in the earths apparent diameter which now subtended from the balloon an angle of very little more than twentyfive degrees the moon could not be seen at all being nearly in my zenith i still continued in the plane of the elipse but made little progress to the eastward  april 14th extremely rapid decrease in the diameter of the earth today i became strongly impressed with the idea that the balloon was now actually running up the line of apsides to the point of perigeein other words holding the direct course which would bring it immediately to the moon in that part of its orbit the nearest to the earth the moon itself was directly overhead and consequently hidden from my view great and longcontinued labor necessary for the condensation of the atmosphere  april 15th not even the outlines of continents and seas could now be traced upon the earth with anything approaching distinctness about twelve oclock i became aware for the third time of that appalling sound which had so astonished me before it now however continued for some moments and gathered intensity as it continued at length while stupefied and terrorstricken i stood in expectation of i knew not what hideous destruction the car vibrated with excessive violence and a gigantic and flaming mass of some material which i could not distinguish came with a voice of a thousand thunders roaring and booming by the balloon when my fears and astonishment had in some degree subsided i had little difficulty in supposing it to be some mighty volcanic fragment ejected from that world to which i was so rapidly approaching and in all probability one of that singular class of substances occasionally picked up on the earth and termed meteoric stones for want of a better appellation  april 16th today looking upward as well as i could through each of the side windows alternately i beheld to my great delight a very small portion of the moons disk protruding as it were on all sides beyond the huge circumference of the balloon my agitation was extreme for i had now little doubt of soon reaching the end of my perilous voyage indeed the labor now required by the condenser had increased to a most oppressive degree and allowed me scarcely any respite from exertion sleep was a matter nearly out of the question i became quite ill and my frame trembled with exhaustion it was impossible that human nature could endure this state of intense suffering much longer during the now brief interval of darkness a meteoric stone again passed in my vicinity and the frequency of these phenomena began to occasion me much apprehension  april 17th this morning proved an epoch in my voyage it will be remembered that on the thirteenth the earth subtended an angular breadth of twentyfive degrees on the fourteenth this had greatly diminished on the fifteenth a still more remarkable decrease was observable and on retiring on the night of the sixteenth i had noticed an angle of no more than about seven degrees and fifteen minutes what therefore must have been my amazement on awakening from a brief and disturbed slumber on the morning of this day the seventeenth at finding the surface beneath me so suddenly and wonderfully augmented in volume as to subtend no less than thirtynine degrees in apparent angular diameter i was thunderstruck no words can give any adequate idea of the extreme the absolute horror and astonishment with which i was seized possessed and altogether overwhelmed my knees tottered beneath memy teeth chatteredmy hair started up on end the balloon then had actually burst these were the first tumultuous ideas that hurried through my mind the balloon had positively bursti was fallingfalling with the most impetuous the most unparalleled velocity to judge by the immense distance already so quickly passed over it could not be more than ten minutes at the farthest before i should meet the surface of the earth and be hurled into annihilation but at length reflection came to my relief i paused i considered and i began to doubt the matter was impossible i could not in any reason have so rapidly come down besides although i was evidently approaching the surface below me it was with a speed by no means commensurate with the velocity i had at first so horribly conceived this consideration served to calm the perturbation of my mind and i finally succeeded in regarding the phenomenon in its proper point of view in fact amazement must have fairly deprived me of my senses when i could not see the vast difference in appearance between the surface below me and the surface of my mother earth the latter was indeed over my head and completely hidden by the balloon while the moonthe moon itself in all its glorylay beneath me and at my feet  the stupor and surprise produced in my mind by this extraordinary change in the posture of affairs was perhaps after all that part of the adventure least susceptible of explanation for the bouleversement in itself was not only natural and inevitable but had been long actually anticipated as a circumstance to be expected whenever i should arrive at that exact point of my voyage where the attraction of the planet should be superseded by the attraction of the satelliteor more precisely where the gravitation of the balloon toward the earth should be less powerful than its gravitation toward the moon to be sure i arose from a sound slumber with all my senses in confusion to the contemplation of a very startling phenomenon and one which although expected was not expected at the moment the revolution itself must of course have taken place in an easy and gradual manner and it is by no means clear that had i even been awake at the time of the occurrence i should have been made aware of it by any internal evidence of an inversionthat is to say by any inconvenience or disarrangement either about my person or about my apparatus  it is almost needless to say that upon coming to a due sense of my situation and emerging from the terror which had absorbed every faculty of my soul my attention was in the first place wholly directed to the contemplation of the general physical appearance of the moon it lay beneath me like a chartand although i judged it to be still at no inconsiderable distance the indentures of its surface were defined to my vision with a most striking and altogether unaccountable distinctness the entire absence of ocean or sea and indeed of any lake or river or body of water whatsoever struck me at first glance as the most extraordinary feature in its geological condition yet strange to say i beheld vast level regions of a character decidedly alluvial although by far the greater portion of the hemisphere in sight was covered with innumerable volcanic mountains conical in shape and having more the appearance of artificial than of natural protuberance the highest among them does not exceed three and threequarter miles in perpendicular elevation but a map of the volcanic districts of the campi phlegraei would afford to your excellencies a better idea of their general surface than any unworthy description i might think proper to attempt the greater part of them were in a state of evident eruption and gave me fearfully to understand their fury and their power by the repeated thunders of the miscalled meteoric stones which now rushed upward by the balloon with a frequency more and more appalling  april 18th today i found an enormous increase in the moons apparent bulkand the evidently accelerated velocity of my descent began to fill me with alarm it will be remembered that in the earliest stage of my speculations upon the possibility of a passage to the moon the existence in its vicinity of an atmosphere dense in proportion to the bulk of the planet had entered largely into my calculations this too in spite of many theories to the contrary and it may be added in spite of a general disbelief in the existence of any lunar atmosphere at all but in addition to what i have already urged in regard to enckes comet and the zodiacal light i had been strengthened in my opinion by certain observations of mr schroeter of lilienthal he observed the moon when two days and a half old in the evening soon after sunset before the dark part was visible and continued to watch it until it became visible the two cusps appeared tapering in a very sharp faint prolongation each exhibiting its farthest extremity faintly illuminated by the solar rays before any part of the dark hemisphere was visible soon afterward the whole dark limb became illuminated this prolongation of the cusps beyond the semicircle i thought must have arisen from the refraction of the suns rays by the moons atmosphere i computed also the height of the atmosphere which could refract light enough into its dark hemisphere to produce a twilight more luminous than the light reflected from the earth when the moon is about 32 degrees from the new to be 1356 paris feet in this view i supposed the greatest height capable of refracting the solar ray to be 5376 feet my ideas on this topic had also received confirmation by a passage in the eightysecond volume of the philosophical transactions in which it is stated that at an occultation of jupiters satellites the third disappeared after having been about 1 or 2 of time indistinct and the fourth became indiscernible near the limb4  cassini frequently observed saturn jupiter and the fixed stars when approaching the moon to occultation to have their circular figure changed into an oval one and in other occultations he found no alteration of figure at all hence it might be supposed that at some times and not at others there is a dense matter encompassing the moon wherein the rays of the stars are refracted  upon the resistance or more properly upon the support of an atmosphere existing in the state of density imagined i had of course entirely depended for the safety of my ultimate descent should i then after all prove to have been mistaken i had in consequence nothing better to expect as a finale to my adventure than being dashed into atoms against the rugged surface of the satellite and indeed i had now every reason to be terrified my distance from the moon was comparatively trifling while the labor required by the condenser was diminished not at all and i could discover no indication whatever of a decreasing rarity in the air  april 19th this morning to my great joy about nine oclock the surface of the moon being frightfully near and my apprehensions excited to the utmost the pump of my condenser at length gave evident tokens of an alteration in the atmosphere by ten i had reason to believe its density considerably increased by eleven very little labor was necessary at the apparatus and at twelve oclock with some hesitation i ventured to unscrew the tourniquet when finding no inconvenience from having done so i finally threw open the gumelastic chamber and unrigged it from around the car as might have been expected spasms and violent headache were the immediate consequences of an experiment so precipitate and full of danger but these and other difficulties attending respiration as they were by no means so great as to put me in peril of my life i determined to endure as i best could in consideration of my leaving them behind me momently in my approach to the denser strata near the moon this approach however was still impetuous in the extreme and it soon became alarmingly certain that although i had probably not been deceived in the expectation of an atmosphere dense in proportion to the mass of the satellite still i had been wrong in supposing this density even at the surface at all adequate to the support of the great weight contained in the car of my balloon yet this should have been the case and in an equal degree as at the surface of the earth the actual gravity of bodies at either planet supposed in the ratio of the atmospheric condensation that it was not the case however my precipitous downfall gave testimony enough why it was not so can only be explained by a reference to those possible geological disturbances to which i have formerly alluded at all events i was now close upon the planet and coming down with the most terrible impetuosity i lost not a moment accordingly in throwing overboard first my ballast then my waterkegs then my condensing apparatus and gumelastic chamber and finally every article within the car but it was all to no purpose i still fell with horrible rapidity and was now not more than half a mile from the surface as a last resource therefore having got rid of my coat hat and boots i cut loose from the balloon the car itself which was of no inconsiderable weight and thus clinging with both hands to the network i had barely time to observe that the whole country as far as the eye could reach was thickly interspersed with diminutive habitations ere i tumbled headlong into the very heart of a fantasticallooking city and into the middle of a vast crowd of ugly little people who none of them uttered a single syllable or gave themselves the least trouble to render me assistance but stood like a parcel of idiots grinning in a ludicrous manner and eyeing me and my balloon askant with their arms set akimbo i turned from them in contempt and gazing upward at the earth so lately left and left perhaps for ever beheld it like a huge dull copper shield about two degrees in diameter fixed immovably in the heavens overhead and tipped on one of its edges with a crescent border of the most brilliant gold no traces of land or water could be discovered and the whole was clouded with variable spots and belted with tropical and equatorial zones  thus may it please your excellencies after a series of great anxieties unheard of dangers and unparalleled escapes i had at length on the nineteenth day of my departure from rotterdam arrived in safety at the conclusion of a voyage undoubtedly the most extraordinary and the most momentous ever accomplished undertaken or conceived by any denizen of earth but my adventures yet remain to be related and indeed your excellencies may well imagine that after a residence of five years upon a planet not only deeply interesting in its own peculiar character but rendered doubly so by its intimate connection in capacity of satellite with the world inhabited by man i may have intelligence for the private ear of the states college of astronomers of far more importance than the details however wonderful of the mere voyage which so happily concluded this is in fact the case i have muchvery much which it would give me the greatest pleasure to communicate i have much to say of the climate of the planet of its wonderful alternations of heat and cold of unmitigated and burning sunshine for one fortnight and more than polar frigidity for the next of a constant transfer of moisture by distillation like that in vacuo from the point beneath the sun to the point the farthest from it of a variable zone of running water of the people themselves of their manners customs and political institutions of their peculiar physical construction of their ugliness of their want of ears those useless appendages in an atmosphere so peculiarly modified of their consequent ignorance of the use and properties of speech of their substitute for speech in a singular method of intercommunication of the incomprehensible connection between each particular individual in the moon with some particular individual on the eartha connection analogous with and depending upon that of the orbs of the planet and the satellites and by means of which the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the one are interwoven with the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the other and above all if it so please your excellenciesabove all of those dark and hideous mysteries which lie in the outer regions of the moonregions which owing to the almost miraculous accordance of the satellites rotation on its own axis with its sidereal revolution about the earth have never yet been turned and by gods mercy never shall be turned to the scrutiny of the telescopes of man all this and moremuch morewould i most willingly detail but to be brief i must have my reward i am pining for a return to my family and to my home and as the price of any farther communication on my partin consideration of the light which i have it in my power to throw upon many very important branches of physical and metaphysical sciencei must solicit through the influence of your honorable body a pardon for the crime of which i have been guilty in the death of the creditors upon my departure from rotterdam this then is the object of the present paper its bearer an inhabitant of the moon whom i have prevailed upon and properly instructed to be my messenger to the earth will await your excellencies pleasure and return to me with the pardon in question if it can in any manner be obtained  i have the honor to be etc your excellencies very humble servant  hans pfaall  upon finishing the perusal of this very extraordinary document professor rubadub it is said dropped his pipe upon the ground in the extremity of his surprise and mynheer superbus von underduk having taken off his spectacles wiped them and deposited them in his pocket so far forgot both himself and his dignity as to turn round three times upon his heel in the quintessence of astonishment and admiration there was no doubt about the matterthe pardon should be obtained so at least swore with a round oath professor rubadub and so finally thought the illustrious von underduk as he took the arm of his brother in science and without saying a word began to make the best of his way home to deliberate upon the measures to be adopted having reached the door however of the burgomasters dwelling the professor ventured to suggest that as the messenger had thought proper to disappearno doubt frightened to death by the savage appearance of the burghers of rotterdamthe pardon would be of little use as no one but a man of the moon would undertake a voyage to so vast a distance to the truth of this observation the burgomaster assented and the matter was therefore at an end not so however rumors and speculations the letter having been published gave rise to a variety of gossip and opinion some of the overwise even made themselves ridiculous by decrying the whole business as nothing better than a hoax but hoax with these sort of people is i believe a general term for all matters above their comprehension for my part i cannot conceive upon what data they have founded such an accusation let us see what they say  imprimus that certain wags in rotterdam have certain especial antipathies to certain burgomasters and astronomers  dont understand at all  secondly that an odd little dwarf and bottle conjurer both of whose ears for some misdemeanor have been cut off close to his head has been missing for several days from the neighboring city of bruges  wellwhat of that  thirdly that the newspapers which were stuck all over the little balloon were newspapers of holland and therefore could not have been made in the moon they were dirty papersvery dirtyand gluck the printer would take his bible oath to their having been printed in rotterdam  he was mistakenundoubtedlymistaken  fourthly that hans pfaall himself the drunken villain and the three very idle gentlemen styled his creditors were all seen no longer than two or three days ago in a tippling house in the suburbs having just returned with money in their pockets from a trip beyond the sea  dont believe itdont believe a word of it  lastly that it is an opinion very generally received or which ought to be generally received that the college of astronomers in the city of rotterdam as well as other colleges in all other parts of the worldnot to mention colleges and astronomers in generalare to say the least of the matter not a whit better nor greater nor wiser than they ought to be   end of text   notes to hans pfaal  1 notestrictly speaking there is but little similarity between the above sketchy trifle and the celebrated moonstory of mr locke but as both have the character of hoaxes although the one is in a tone of banter the other of downright earnest and as both hoaxes are on the same subject the moonmoreover as both attempt to give plausibility by scientific detailthe author of hans pfaall thinks it necessary to say in selfdefence that his own jeu desprit was published in the southern literary messenger about three weeks before the commencement of mr ls in the new york sun fancying a likeness which perhaps does not exist some of the new york papers copied hans pfaall and collated it with the moonhoax by way of detecting the writer of the one in the writer of the other  as many more persons were actually gulled by the moonhoax than would be willing to acknowledge the fact it may here afford some little amusement to show why no one should have been deceivedto point out those particulars of the story which should have been sufficient to establish its real character indeed however rich the imagination displayed in this ingenious fiction it wanted much of the force which might have been given it by a more scrupulous attention to facts and to general analogy that the public were misled even for an instant merely proves the gross ignorance which is so generally prevalent upon subjects of an astronomical nature  the moons distance from the earth is in round numbers 240000 miles if we desire to ascertain how near apparently a lens would bring the satellite or any distant object we of course have but to divide the distance by the magnifying or more strictly by the spacepenetrating power of the glass mr l makes his lens have a power of 42000 times by this divide 240000 the moons real distance and we have five miles and five sevenths as the apparent distance no animal at all could be seen so far much less the minute points particularized in the story mr l speaks about sir john herschels perceiving flowers the papaver rheas etc and even detecting the color and the shape of the eyes of small birds shortly before too he has himself observed that the lens would not render perceptible objects of less than eighteen inches in diameter but even this as i have said is giving the glass by far too great power it may be observed in passing that this prodigious glass is said to have been molded at the glasshouse of messrs hartley and grant in dumbarton but messrs h and gs establishment had ceased operations for many years previous to the publication of the hoax  on page 13 pamphlet edition speaking of a hairy veil over the eyes of a species of bison the author says it immediately occurred to the acute mind of dr herschel that this was a providential contrivance to protect the eyes of the animal from the great extremes of light and darkness to which all the inhabitants of our side of the moon are periodically subjected but this cannot be thought a very acute observation of the doctors the inhabitants of our side of the moon have evidently no darkness at all so there can be nothing of the extremes mentioned in the absence of the sun they have a light from the earth equal to that of thirteen full unclouded moons  the topography throughout even when professing to accord with blunts lunar chart is entirely at variance with that or any other lunar chart and even grossly at variance with itself the points of the compass too are in inextricable confusion the writer appearing to be ignorant that on a lunar map these are not in accordance with terrestrial points the east being to the left etc  deceived perhaps by the vague titles mare nubium mare tranquillitatis mare faecunditatis etc given to the dark spots by former astronomers mr l has entered into details regarding oceans and other large bodies of water in the moon whereas there is no astronomical point more positively ascertained than that no such bodies exist there in examining the boundary between light and darkness in the crescent or gibbous moon where this boundary crosses any of the dark places the line of division is found to be rough and jagged but were these dark places liquid it would evidently be even  the description of the wings of the manbat on page 21 is but a literal copy of peter wilkins account of the wings of his flying islanders this simple fact should have induced suspicion at least it might be thought  on page 23 we have the following what a prodigious influence must our thirteen times larger globe have exercised upon this satellite when an embryo in the womb of time the passive subject of chemical affinity this is very fine but it should be observed that no astronomer would have made such remark especially to any journal of science for the earth in the sense intended is not only thirteen but fortynine times larger than the moon a similar objection applies to the whole of the concluding pages where by way of introduction to some discoveries in saturn the philosophical correspondent enters into a minute schoolboy account of that planetthis to the edinburgh journal of science  but there is one point in particular which should have betrayed the fiction let us imagine the power actually possessed of seeing animals upon the moons surfacewhat would first arrest the attention of an observer from the earth certainly neither their shape size nor any other such peculiarity so soon as their remarkable situation they would appear to be walking with heels up and head down in the manner of flies on a ceiling the real observer would have uttered an instant ejaculation of surprise however prepared by previous knowledge at the singularity of their position the fictitious observer has not even mentioned the subject but speaks of seeing the entire bodies of such creatures when it is demonstrable that he could have seen only the diameter of their heads  it might as well be remarked in conclusion that the size and particularly the powers of the manbats for example their ability to fly in so rare an atmosphereif indeed the moon have any with most of the other fancies in regard to animal and vegetable existence are at variance generally with all analogical reasoning on these themes and that analogy here will often amount to conclusive demonstration it is perhaps scarcely necessary to add that all the suggestions attributed to brewster and herschel in the beginning of the article about a transfusion of artificial light through the focal object of vision etc etc belong to that species of figurative writing which comes most properly under the denomination of rigmarole  there is a real and very definite limit to optical discovery among the starsa limit whose nature need only be stated to be understood if indeed the casting of large lenses were all that is required mans ingenuity would ultimately prove equal to the task and we might have them of any size demanded but unhappily in proportion to the increase of size in the lens and consequently of spacepenetrating power is the diminution of light from the object by diffusion of its rays and for this evil there is no remedy within human ability for an object is seen by means of that light alone which proceeds from itself whether direct or reflected thus the only artificial light which could avail mr locke would be some artificial light which he should be able to thrownot upon the focal object of vision but upon the real object to be viewedto wit upon the moon it has been easily calculated that when the light proceeding from a star becomes so diffused as to be as weak as the natural light proceeding from the whole of the stars in a clear and moonless night then the star is no longer visible for any practical purpose  the earl of rosss telescope lately constructed in england has a speculum with a reflecting surface of 4071 square inches the herschel telescope having one of only 1811 the metal of the earl of rosss is 6 feet diameter it is 5 12 inches thick at the edges and 5 at the centre the weight is 3 tons the focal length is 50 feet  i have lately read a singular and somewhat ingenious

seulement mis en main cc livre en anglois mais encore le manuscrit du sieur thomas danan gentilhomme eccossois recommandable pour sa vertu sur la version duquel j advoue que j ay tirÃ© le plan de la mienne  after some irrelevant adventures much in the manner of gil blas and which occupy the first thirty pages the author relates that being ill during a sea voyage the crew abandoned him together with a negro servant on the island of st helena to increase the chances of obtaining food the two separate and live as far apart as possible this brings about a training of birds to serve the purpose of carrierpigeons between them by and by these are taught to carry parcels of some weightand this weight is gradually increased at length the idea is entertained of uniting the force of a great number of the birds with a view to raising the author himself a machine is contrived for the purpose and we have a minute description of it which is materially helped out by a steel engraving here we perceive the signor gonzales with point ruffles and a huge periwig seated astride something which resembles very closely a broomstick and borne aloft by a multitude of wild swans ganzas who had strings reaching from their tails to the machine  the main event detailed in the signors narrative depends upon a very important fact of which the reader is kept in ignorance until near the end of the book the ganzas with whom he had become so familiar were not really denizens of st helena but of the moon thence it had been their custom time out of mind to migrate annually to some portion of the earth in proper season of course they would return home and the author happening one day to require their services for a short voyage is unexpectedly carried straight tip and in a very brief period arrives at the satellite here he finds among other odd things that the people enjoy extreme happiness that they have no law that they die without pain that they are from ten to thirty feet in height that they live five thousand years that they have an emperor called irdonozur and that they can jump sixty feet high when being out of the gravitating influence they fly about with fans  i cannot forbear giving a specimen of the general philosophy of the volume  i must not forget here that the stars appeared only on that side of the globe turned toward the moon and that the closer they were to it the larger they seemed i have also me and the earth as to the stars since there was no night where i was they always had the same appearance not brilliant as usual but pale and very nearly like the moon of a morning but few of them were visible and these ten times larger as well as i could judge than they seem to the inhabitants of the earth the moon which wanted two days of being full was of a terrible bigness   i must not forget here that the stars appeared only on that side of the globe turned toward the moon and that the closer they were to it the larger they seemed i have also to inform you that whether it was calm weather or stormy i found myself always immediately between the moon and the earth i was convinced of this for two reasonsbecause my birds always flew in a straight line and because whenever we attempted to rest we were carried insensibly around the globe of the earth for i admit the opinion of copernicus who maintains that it never ceases to revolve from the east to the west not upon the poles of the equinoctial commonly called the poles of the world but upon those of the zodiac a question of which i propose to speak more at length hereafter when i shall have leisure to refresh my memory in regard to the astrology which i learned at salamanca when young and have since forgotten  notwithstanding the blunders italicized the book is not without some claim to attention as affording a naive specimen of the current astronomical notions of the time one of these assumed that the gravitating power extended but a short distance from the earths surface and accordingly we find our voyager carried insensibly around the globe etc  there have been other voyages to the moon but none of higher merit than the one just mentioned that of bergerac is utterly meaningless in the third volume of the american quarterly review will be found quite an elaborate criticism upon a certain journey of the kind in questiona criticism in which it is difficult to say whether the critic most exposes the stupidity of the book or his own absurd ignorance of astronomy i forget the title of the work but the means of the voyage are more deplorably ill conceived than are even the ganzas of our friend the signor gonzales the adventurer in digging the earth happens to discover a peculiar metal for which the moon has a strong attraction and straightway constructs of it a box which when cast loose from its terrestrial fastenings flies with him forthwith to the satellite the flight of thomas orourke is a jeu d esprit not altogether contemptible and has been translated into german thomas the hero was in fact the gamekeeper of an irish peer whose eccentricities gave rise to the tale the flight is made on an eagles back from hungry hill a lofty mountain at the end of bantry bay  in these various brochures the aim is always satirical the theme being a description of lunarian customs as compared with ours in none is there any effort at plausibility in the details of the voyage itself the writers seem in each instance to be utterly uninformed in respect to astronomy in hans pfaall the design is original inasmuch as regards an attempt at verisimilitude in the application of scientific principles so far as the whimsical nature of the subject would permit to the actual passage between the earth and the moon  2 the zodiacal light is probably what the ancients called trabes emicant trabes quos docos vocantpliny lib 2 p 26  3 since the original publication of hans pfaall i find that mr green of nassau balloon notoriety and other late aeronauts deny the assertions of humboldt in this respect and speak of a decreasing inconvenienceprecisely in accordance with the theory here urged in a mere spirit of banter  4 havelius writes that he has several times found in skies perfectly clear when even stars of the sixth and seventh magnitude were conspicuous that at the same altitude of the moon at the same elongation from the earth and with one and the same excellent telescope the moon and its maculae did not appear equally lucid at all times from the circumstances of the observation it is evident that the cause of this phenomenon is not either in our air in the tube in the moon or in the eye of the spectator but must be looked for in something an atmosphere existing about the moon     the goldbug            what ho what ho this fellow is dancing mad                 he hath been bitten by the tarantula                      all in the wrong  many years ago i contracted an intimacy with a mr william legrand he was of an ancient huguenot family and had once been wealthy but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want to avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters he left new orleans the city of his forefathers and took up his residence at sullivans island near charleston south carolina this island is a very singular one it consists of little else than the sea sand and is about three miles long its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile it is separated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible creek oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds and slime a favorite resort of the marsh hen the vegetation as might be supposed is scant or at least dwarfish no trees of any magnitude are to be seen near the western extremity where fort moultrie stands and where are some miserable frame buildings tenanted during summer by the fugitives from charleston dust and fever may be found indeed the bristly palmetto but the whole island with the exception of this western point and a line of hard white beach on the seacoast is covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet myrtle so much prized by the horticulturists of england the shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet and forms an almost impenetrable coppice burthening the air with its fragrance  in the inmost recesses of this coppice not far from the eastern or more remote end of the island legrand had built himself a small hut which he occupied when i first by mere accident made his acquaintance this soon ripened into friendshipfor there was much in the recluse to excite interest and esteem i found him well educated with unusual powers of mind but infected with misanthropy and subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy he had with him many books but rarely employed them his chief amusements were gunning and fishing or sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles in quest of shells or entomological specimenshis collection of the latter might have been envied by a swammerdamm in these excursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro called jupiter who had been manumitted before the reverses of the family but who could be induced neither by threats nor by promises to abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps of his young massa will it is not improbable that the relatives of legrand conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in intellect had contrived to instil this obstinacy into jupiter with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer  the winters in the latitude of sullivans island are seldom very severe and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is considered necessary about the middle of october 18 there occurred however a day of remarkable chilliness just before sunset i scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend whom i had not visited for several weeksmy residence being at that time in charleston a distance of nine miles from the island while the facilities of passage and repassage were very far behind those of the present day upon reaching the hut i rapped as was my custom and getting no reply sought for the key where i knew it was secreted unlocked the door and went in a fine fire was blazing upon the hearth it was a novelty and by no means an ungrateful one i threw off an overcoat took an armchair by the crackling logs and awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts  soon after dark they arrived and gave me a most cordial welcome jupiter grinning from ear to ear bustled about to prepare some marshhens for supper legrand was in one of his fitshow else shall i term themof enthusiasm he had found an unknown bivalve forming a new genus and more than this he had hunted down and secured with jupiters assistance a scarabÃ¦us which he believed to be totally new but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on the morrow  and why not tonight i asked rubbing my hands over the blaze and wishing the whole tribe of scarabÃ¦i at the devil  ah if i had only known you were here said legrand but its so long since i saw you and how could i foresee that you would pay me a visit this very night of all others as i was coming home i met lieutenant g from the fort and very foolishly i lent him the bug so it will be impossible for you to see it until the morning stay here tonight and i will send jup down for it at sunrise it is the loveliest thing in creation  whatsunrise  nonsense nothe bug it is of a brilliant gold colorabout the size of a large hickorynutwith two jet black spots near one extremity of the back and another somewhat longer at the other the antennÃ¦ are  dey aint no tin in him massa will i keep a tellin on you here interrupted jupiter de bug is a goole bug solid ebery bit of him inside and all sep him wingneber feel half so hebby a bug in my life  well suppose it is jup replied legrand somewhat more earnestly it seemed to me than the case demanded is that any reason for your letting the birds burn the colorhere he turned to meis really almost enough to warrant jupiters idea you never saw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales emitbut of this you cannot judge till tomorrow in the mean time i can give you some idea of the shape saying this he seated himself at a small table on which were a pen and ink but no paper he looked for some in a drawer but found none  never mind said he at length this will answer and he drew from his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what i took to be very dirty foolscap and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen while he did this i retained my seat by the fire for i was still chilly when the design was complete he handed it to me without rising as i received it a loud growl was heard succeeded by a scratching at the door jupiter opened it and a large newfoundland belonging to legrand rushed in leaped upon my shoulders and loaded me with caresses for i had shown him much attention during previous visits when his gambols were over i looked at the paper and to speak the truth found myself not a little puzzled at what my friend had depicted  well i said after contemplating it for some minutes this is a strange scarabÃ¦us i must confess new to me never saw anything like it beforeunless it was a skull or a deathsheadwhich it more nearly resembles than anything else that has come under my observation  a deathshead echoed legrandohyeswell it has something of that appearance upon paper no doubt the two upper black spots look like eyes eh and the longer one at the bottom like a mouthand then the shape of the whole is oval  perhaps so said i but legrand i fear you are no artist i must wait until i see the beetle itself if i am to form any idea of its personal appearance  well i dont know said he a little nettled i draw tolerablyshould do it at leasthave had good masters and flatter myself that i am not quite a blockhead  but my dear fellow you are joking then said i this is a very passable skullindeed i may say that it is a very excellent skull according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiologyand your scarabÃ¦us must be the queerest scarabÃ¦us in the world if it resembles it why we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint i presume you will call the bug scarabÃ¦us caput hominis or something of that kindthere are many similar titles in the natural histories but where are the antennÃ¦ you spoke of  the antennÃ¦ said legrand who seemed to be getting unaccountably warm upon the subject i am sure you must see the antennÃ¦ i made them as distinct as they are in the original insect and i presume that is sufficient  well well i said perhaps you havestill i dont see them and i handed him the paper without additional remark not wishing to ruffle his temper but i was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken his ill humor puzzled meand as for the drawing of the beetle there were positively no antennÃ¦ visible and the whole did bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a deathshead  he received the paper very peevishly and was about to crumple it apparently to throw it in the fire when a casual glance at the design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention in an instant his face grew violently redin another as excessively pale for some minutes he continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat at length he arose took a candle from the table and proceeded to seat himself upon a seachest in the farthest corner of the room here again he made an anxious examination of the paper turning it in all directions he said nothing however and his conduct greatly astonished me yet i thought it prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by any comment presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet placed the paper carefully in it and deposited both in a writingdesk which he locked he now grew more composed in his demeanor but his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted as the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in reverie from which no sallies of mine could arouse him it had been my intention to pass the night at the hut as i had frequently done before but seeing my host in this mood i deemed it proper to take leave he did not press me to remain but as i departed he shook my hand with even more than his usual cordiality  it was about a month after this and during the interval i had seen nothing of legrand when i received a visit at charleston from his man jupiter i had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited and i feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend  well jup said i what is the matter nowhow is your master  why to speak de troof massa him not so berry well as mought be  not well i am truly sorry to hear it what does he complain of  dar dats ithim neber plain of notinbut him berry sick for all dat  very sick jupiterwhy didnt you say so at once is he confined to bed  no dat he ainthe aint find nowhardats just whar de shoe pinchmy mind is got to be berry hebby bout poor massa will  jupiter i should like to understand what it is you are talking about you say your master is sick hasnt he told you what ails him  why massa taint worf while for to git mad about de mattermassa will say noffin at all aint de matter wid himbut den what make him go about looking dis here way wid he head down and he soldiers up

well stand itbut can you form no idea of what has occasioned this illness or rather this change of conduct has anything unpleasant happened since i saw you  no massa dey aint bin noffin unpleasant since dentwas fore den im fearedtwas de berry day you was dare  how what do you mean  why massa i mean de bugdare now  the what  de bugim berry sartain dat massa will bin bit somewhere bout de head by

and that the bite made him sick  i do nt tink noffin about iti nose it what make him dream bout de goole so much if taint cause he bit by de goolebug ise heerd bout dem goolebugs fore dis  but how do you know he dreams about gold  how i know why cause he talk about it in he sleepdats how i nose  well jup perhaps you are right but to what fortunate circumstance am i to attribute the honor of a visit from you today  what de matter massa  did you bring any message from mr legrand  no massa i bring dis here pissel and here jupiter handed me a note which ran thus      my dear   why have i not seen you for so long a time i hope you have not been so foolish as to take offence at any little brusquerie of mine but no that is improbable since i saw you i have had great cause for anxiety i have something to tell you yet scarcely know how to tell it or whether i should tell it at all  i have not been quite well for some days past and poor old jup annoys me almost beyond endurance by his wellmeant attentions would you believe ithe had prepared a huge stick the other day with which to chastise me for giving him the slip and spending the day solus among the hills on the main land i verily believe that my ill looks alone saved me a flogging  i have made no addition to my cabinet since we met  if you can in any way make it convenient come over with jupiter do come i wish to see you tonight upon business of importance i assure you that it is of the highest importance          ever yours                     william legrand  there was something in the tone of this note which gave me great uneasiness its whole style differed materially from that of legrand what could he be dreaming of what new crotchet possessed his excitable brain what business of the highest importance could he possibly have to transact jupiters account of him boded no good i dreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had at length fairly unsettled the reason of my friend without a moments hesitation therefore i prepared to accompany the negro  upon reaching the wharf i noticed a scythe and three spades all apparently new lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to embark  what is the meaning of all this jup i inquired  him syfe massa and spade  very true but what are they doing here  him de syfe and de spade what massa will sis pon my buying for him in de town and de debbils own lot of money i had to gib for em  but what in the name of all that is mysterious is your massa will going to do with scythes and spades  dats more dan i know and debbil take me if i dont blieve tis more dan he know too but its all cum ob do bug  finding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of jupiter whose whole intellect seemed to be absorbed by de bug i now stepped into the boat and made sail with a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into the little cove to the northward of fort moultrie and a walk of some two miles brought us to the hut it was about three in the afternoon when we arrived legrand had been awaiting us in eager expectation he grasped my hand with a nervous empressement which alarmed me and strengthened the suspicions already entertained his countenance was pale even to ghastliness and his deepset eyes glared with unnatural lustre after some inquiries respecting his health i asked him not knowing what better to say if he had yet obtained the scarabÃ¦us from lieutenant g   oh yes he replied coloring violently i got it from him the next morning nothing should tempt me to part with that scarabÃ¦us do you know that jupiter is quite right about it  in what way i asked with a sad foreboding at heart  in supposing it to be a bug of real gold he said this with an air of profound seriousness and i felt inexpressibly shocked  this bug is to make my fortune he continued with a triumphant smile to reinstate me in my family possessions is it any wonder then that i prize it since fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon me i have only to use it properly and i shall arrive at the gold of which it is the index jupiter bring me that scarabÃ¦us  what de bug massa id rudder not go fer trubble dat bugyou mus git him for your own self hereupon legrand arose with a grave and stately air and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was enclosed it was a beautiful scarabÃ¦us and at that time unknown to naturalistsof course a great prize in a scientific point of view there were two round black spots near one extremity of the back and a long one near the other the scales were exceedingly hard and glossy with all the appearance of burnished gold the weight of the insect was very remarkable and taking all things into consideration i could hardly blame jupiter for his opinion respecting it but what to make of legrands concordance with that opinion i could not for the life of me tell  i sent for you said he in a grandiloquent tone when i had completed my examination of the beetle i sent for you that i might have your counsel and assistance in furthering the views of fate and of the bug  my dear legrand i cried interrupting him you are certainly unwell and had better use some little precautions you shall go to bed and i will remain with you a few days until you get over this you are feverish and  feel my pulse said he  i felt it and to say the truth found not the slightest indication of fever  but you may be ill and yet have no fever allow me this once to prescribe for you in the first place go to bed in the next  you are mistaken he interposed i am as well as i can expect to be under the excitement which i suffer if you really wish me well you will relieve this excitement  and how is this to be done  very easily jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the hills upon the main land and in this expedition we shall need the aid of some person in whom we can confide you are the only one we can trust whether we succeed or fail the excitement which you now perceive in me will be equally allayed  i am anxious to oblige you in any way i replied but do you mean to say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your expedition into the hills  it has  then legrand i can become a party to no such absurd proceeding  i am sorryvery sorryfor we shall have to try it by ourselves  try it by yourselves the man is surely madbut stayhow long do you propose to be absent  probably all night we shall start immediately and be back at all events by sunrise  and will you promise me upon your honor that when this freak of yours is over and the bug business good god settled to your satisfaction you will then return home and follow my advice implicitly as that of your physician  yes i promise and now let us be off for we have no time to lose  with a heavy heart i accompanied my friend we started about four oclocklegrand jupiter the dog and myself jupiter had with him the scythe and spadesthe whole of which he insisted upon carryingmore through fear it seemed to me of trusting either of the implements within reach of his master than from any excess of industry or complaisance his demeanor was dogged in the extreme and dat deuced bug were the sole words which escaped his lips during the journey for my own part i had charge of a couple of dark lanterns while legrand contented himself with the scarabÃ¦us which he carried attached to the end of a bit of whipcord twirling it to and fro with the air of a conjuror as he went when i observed this last plain evidence of my friends aberration of mind i could scarcely refrain from tears i thought it best however to humor his fancy at least for the present or until i could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of success in the mean time i endeavored but all in vain to sound him in regard to the object of the expedition having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor importance and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than we shall see  we crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff and ascending the high grounds on the shore of the main land proceeded in a northwesterly direction through a tract of country excessively wild and desolate where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen legrand led the way with decision pausing only for an instant here and there to consult what appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion  in this manner we journeyed for about two hours and the sun was just setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen it was a species of table land near the summit of an almost inaccessible hill densely wooded from base to pinnacle and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil and in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves into the valleys below merely by the support of the trees against which they reclined deep ravines in various directions gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the scene  the natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown with brambles through which we soon discovered that it would have been impossible to force our way but for the scythe and jupiter by direction of his master proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of an enormously tall tuliptree which stood with some eight or ten oaks upon the level and far surpassed them all and all other trees which i had then ever seen in the beauty of its foliage and form in the wide spread of its branches and in the general majesty of its appearance when we reached this tree legrand turned to jupiter and asked him if he thought he could climb it the old man seemed a little staggered by the question and for some moments made no reply at length he approached the huge trunk walked slowly around it and examined it with minute attention when he had completed his scrutiny he merely said  yes massa jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life  then up with you as soon as possible for it will soon be too dark to see what we are about  how far mus go up massa inquired jupiter  get up the main trunk first and then i will tell you which way to goand herestop take this beetle with you  de bug massa willde goole bug cried the negro drawing back in dismaywhat for mus tote de bug way up de treedn if i do  if you are afraid jup a great big negro like you to take hold of a harmless little dead beetle why you can carry it up by this stringbut if you do not take it up with you in some way i shall be under the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel  what de matter now massa said jup evidently shamed into compliance always want for to raise fuss wid old nigger was only funnin any how me feered de bug what i keer for de bug here he took cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string and maintaining the insect as far from his person as circumstances would permit prepared to ascend the tree  in youth the tuliptree or liriodendron tulipferum the most magnificent of american foresters has a trunk peculiarly smooth and often rises to a great height without lateral branches but in its riper age the bark becomes gnarled and uneven while many short limbs make their appearance on the stem thus the difficulty of ascension in the present case lay more in semblance than in reality embracing the huge cylinder as closely as possible with his arms and knees seizing with his hands some projections and resting his naked toes upon others jupiter after one or two narrow escapes from falling at length wriggled himself into the first great fork and seemed to consider the whole business as virtually accomplished the risk of the achievement was in fact now over although the climber was some sixty or seventy feet from the ground  which way mus go now massa will he asked  keep up the largest branchthe one on this side said legrand the negro obeyed him promptly and apparently with but little trouble ascending higher and higher until no glimpse of his squat figure could be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it presently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo  how much fudder is got for go  how high up are you asked legrand  ebber so fur replied the negro can see de sky fru de top ob de tree  never mind the sky but attend to what i say look down the trunk and count the limbs below you on this side how many limbs have you passed  one two tree four fibei done pass fibe big limb massa pon dis side  then go one limb higher  in a few minutes the voice was heard again announcing that the seventh limb was attained  now jup cried legrand evidently much excited i want you to work your way out upon that limb as far as you can if you see anything strange let me know by this time what little doubt i might have entertained of my poor friends insanity was put finally at rest i had no alternative but to conclude him stricken with lunacy and i became seriously anxious about getting him home while i was pondering upon what was best to be done jupiters voice was again heard  mos feerd for to ventur pon dis limb berry fartis dead limb putty much all de way  did you say it was a dead limb jupiter cried legrand in a quavering voice  yes massa him dead as de doornaildone up for sartaindone departed dis here life  what in the name heaven shall i do asked legrand seemingly in the greatest distress do said i glad of an opportunity to interpose a word why come home and go to bed come nowthats a fine fellow its getting late and besides you remember your promise  jupiter cried he without heeding me in the least do you hear me  yes massa will hear you ebber so plain  try the wood well then with your knife and see if you think it very rotten  him rotten massa sure nuff replied the negro in a few moments but not so berry rotten as mought be mought ventur out leetle way pon de limb by myself dats true  by yourselfwhat do you mean  why i mean de bug tis berry hebby bug spose i drop him down fuss and den de limb wont break wid just de weight ob one nigger  you infernal scoundrel cried legrand apparently much relieved what do you mean by telling me such nonsense as that as sure as you drop that beetle ill break your neck look here jupiter do you hear me  yes massa neednt hollo at poor nigger dat style  well now listenif you will venture out on the limb as far as you think safe and not let go the beetle ill make you a present of a silver dollar as soon as you get down  im gwine massa willdeed i is replied the negro very promptlymos out to the eend now  out to the end here fairly screamed legrand do you say you are out to the end of that limb  soon be to de eend massaoooooh lorgolamarcy what is dis here pon de tree  well cried legrand highly delighted what is it  why taint noffin but a skullsomebody bin lef him head up de tree and de crows done gobble ebery bit ob de meat off  a skull you sayvery wellhow is it fastened to the limbwhat holds it on  sure nuff massa mus look why dis berry curous sarcumstance pon my worddares a great big nail in de skull what fastens ob it on to de tree  well now jupiter do exactly as i tell youdo you hear  yes massa  pay attention thenfind the left eye of the skull  hum hoo dats good why dare aint no eye lef at all  curse your stupidity do you know your right hand from your left  yes i nose datnose all bout dattis my lef hand what i chops de wood wid  to be sure you are lefthanded and your left eye is on the same side as your left hand now i suppose you can find the left eye of the skull or the place where the left eye has been have you found it  here was a long pause at length the negro asked  is de lef eye of de skull pon de same side as de lef hand of de skull toocause de skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at allnebber mind i got de lef eye nowhere de lef eye what mus do wid it  let the beetle drop through it as far as the string will reachbut be careful and not let go your hold of the string  all dat done massa will mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru de holelook out for him dare below  during this colloquy no portion of jupiters person could be seen but the beetle which he had suffered to descend was now visible at the end of the string and glistened like a globe of burnished gold in the last rays of the setting sun some of which still faintly illumined the eminence upon which we stood the scarabÃ¦us hung quite clear of any branches and if allowed to fall would have fallen at our feet legrand immediately took the scythe and cleared with it a circular space three or four yards in diameter just beneath the insect and having accomplished this ordered jupiter to let go the string and come down from the tree  driving a peg with great nicety into the ground at the precise spot where the beetle fell my friend now produced from his pocket a tape measure fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk of the tree which was nearest the peg he unrolled it till it reached the peg and thence farther unrolled it in the direction already established by the two points of the tree and the peg for the distance of fifty feetjupiter clearing away the brambles with the scythe at the spot thus attained a second peg was driven and about this as a centre a rude circle about four feet in diameter described taking now a spade himself and giving one to jupiter and one to me legrand begged us to set about digging as quickly as possible  to speak the truth i had no especial relish for such amusement at any time and at that particular moment would most willingly have declined it for the night was coming on and i felt much fatigued with the exercise already taken but i saw no mode of escape and was fearful of disturbing my poor friends equanimity by a refusal could i have depended indeed upon jupiters aid i would have had no hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home by force but i was too well assured of the old negros disposition to hope that he would assist me under any circumstances in a personal contest with his master i made no doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable southern superstitions about money buried and that his phantasy had received confirmation by the finding of the scarabÃ¦us or perhaps by jupiters obstinacy in maintaining it to be a bug of real gold a mind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such suggestionsespecially if chiming in with favorite preconceived ideasand then i called to mind the poor fellows speech about the beetles being the index of his fortune upon the whole i was sadly vexed and puzzled but at length i concluded to make a virtue of necessityto dig with a good will and thus the sooner to convince the visionary by ocular demonstration of the fallacy of the opinions he entertained  the lanterns having been lit we all fell to work with a zeal worthy a more rational cause and as the glare fell upon our persons and implements i could not help thinking how picturesque a group we composed and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared to any interloper who by chance might have stumbled upon our whereabouts  we dug very steadily for two hours little was said and our chief embarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog who took exceeding interest in our proceedings he at length became so obstreperous that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in the vicinityor rather this was the apprehension of legrandfor myself i should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have enabled me to get the wanderer home the noise was at length very effectually silenced by jupiter who getting out of the hole with a dogged air of deliberation tied the brutes mouth up with one of his suspenders and then returned with a grave chuckle to his task  when the time mentioned had expired we had reached a depth of five feet and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest a general pause ensued and i began to hope that the farce was at an end legrand however although evidently much disconcerted wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced we had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter and now we slightly enlarged the limit and went to the farther depth of two feet still nothing appeared the goldseeker whom i sincerely pitied at length clambered from the pit with the bitterest disappointment imprinted upon every feature and proceeded slowly and reluctantly to put on his coat which he had thrown off at the beginning of his labor in the mean time i made no remark jupiter at a signal from his master began to gather up his tools this done and the dog having been unmuzzled we turned in profound silence towards home  we had taken perhaps a dozen steps in this direction when with a loud oath legrand strode up to jupiter and seized him by the collar the astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent let fall the spades and fell upon his knees  you scoundrel said legrand hissing out the syllables from between his clenched teethyou infernal black villainspeak i tell youanswer me this instant without prevaricationwhichwhich is your left eye  oh my golly massa will aint dis here my lef eye for sartain roared the terrified jupiter placing his hand upon his right organ of vision and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity as if in immediate dread of his masters attempt at a gouge  i thought soi knew it hurrah vociferated legrand letting the negro go and executing a series of curvets and caracols much to the astonishment of his valet who arising from his knees looked mutely from his master to myself and then from myself to his master  come we must go back said the latter the games not up yet and he again led the way to the tuliptree  jupiter said he when we reached its foot come here was the skull nailed to the limb with the face outwards or with the face to the limb  de face was out massa so dat de crows could get at de eyes good widout any trouble  well then was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetlehere legrand touched each of jupiters eyes  twas dis eye massade lef eyejis as you tell me and here it was his right eye that the negro indicated  that will domust try it again  here my friend about whose madness i now saw or fancied that i saw certain indications of method removed the peg which marked the spot where the beetle fell to a spot about three inches to the westward of its former position taking now the tape measure from the nearest point of the trunk to the peg as before and continuing the extension in a straight line to the distance of fifty feet a spot was indicated removed by several yards from the point at which we had been digging  around the new position a circle somewhat larger than in the former instance was now described and we again set to work with the spades i was dreadfully weary but scarcely understanding what had occasioned the change in my thoughts i felt no longer any great aversion from the labor imposed i had become most unaccountably interestednay even excited perhaps there was something amid all the extravagant demeanor of legrandsome air of forethought or of deliberation which impressed me i dug eagerly and now and then caught myself actually looking with something that very much resembled expectation for the fancied treasure the vision of which had demented my unfortunate companion at a period when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me and when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half we were again interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog his uneasiness in the first instance had been evidently but the result of playfulness or caprice but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone upon jupiters again attempting to muzzle him he made furious resistance and leaping into the hole tore up the mould frantically with his claws in a few seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones forming two complete skeletons intermingled with several buttons of metal and what appeared to be the dust of decayed woollen one or two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large spanish knife and as we dug farther three or four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light  at sight of these the joy of jupiter could scarcely be restrained but the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment he urged us however to continue our exertions and the words were hardly uttered when i stumbled and fell forward having caught the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose earth  we now worked in earnest and never did i pass ten minutes of more intense excitement during this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong chest of wood which from its perfect preservation and wonderful hardness had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing processperhaps that of the bichloride of mercury this box was three feet and a half long three feet broad and two and a half feet deep it was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron riveted and forming a kind of open trelliswork over the whole on each side of the chest near the top were three rings of ironsix in allby means of which a firm hold could be obtained by six persons our utmost united endeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed we at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight luckily the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts these we drew backtrembling and panting with anxiety in an instant a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us as the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit there flashed upwards a glow and a glare from a confused heap of gold and of jewels that absolutely dazzled our eyes  i shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which i gazed amazement was of course predominant legrand appeared exhausted with excitement and spoke very few words jupiters countenance wore for some minutes as deadly a pallor as it is possible in nature of things for any negros visage to assume he seemed stupifiedthunderstricken presently he fell upon his knees in the pit and burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold let them there remain as if enjoying the luxury of a bath at length with a deep sigh he exclaimed as if in a soliloquy  and dis all cum ob de goolebug de putty goole bug de poor little goolebug what i boosed in dat sabage kind ob style aint you shamed ob yourself niggeranswer me dat  it became necessary at last that i should arouse both master and valet to the expediency of removing the treasure it was growing late and it behooved us to make exertion that we might get every thing housed before daylight it was difficult to say what should be done and much time was spent in deliberationso confused were the ideas of all we finally lightened the box by removing two thirds of its contents when we were enabled with some trouble to raise it from the hole the articles taken out were deposited among the brambles and the dog left to guard them with strict orders from jupiter neither upon any pretence to stir from the spot nor to open his mouth until our return we then hurriedly made for home with the chest reaching the hut in safety but after excessive toil at one oclock in the morning worn out as we were it was not in human nature to do more immediately we rested until two and had supper starting for the hills immediately afterwards armed with three stout sacks which by good luck were upon the premises a little before four we arrived at the pit divided the remainder of the booty as equally as might be among us and leaving the holes unfilled again set out for the hut at which for the second time we deposited our golden burthens just as the first faint streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the treetops in the east  we were now thoroughly broken down but the intense excitement of the time denied us repose after an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours duration we arose as if by preconcert to make examination of our treasure  the chest had been full to the brim and we spent the whole day and the greater part of the next night in a scrutiny of its contents there had been nothing like order or arrangement every thing had been heaped in promiscuously having assorted all with care we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed in coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollarsestimating the value of the pieces as accurately as we could by the tables of the period there was not a particle of silver all was gold of antique date and of great varietyfrench spanish and german money with a few english guineas and some counters of which we had never seen specimens before there were several very large and heavy coins so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions there was no american money the value of the jewels we found more difficulty in estimating there were diamondssome of them exceedingly large and finea hundred and ten in all and not one of them small eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancythree hundred and ten emeralds all very beautiful and twentyone sapphires with an opal these stones had all been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest the settings themselves which we picked out from among the other gold appeared to have been beaten up with hammers as if to prevent identification besides all this there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornamentsnearly two hundred massive finger and earringsrich chainsthirty of these if i remembereightythree very large and heavy crucifixesfive gold censers of great valuea prodigious golden punch bowl ornamented with richly chased vineleaves and bacchanalian figures with two swordhandles exquisitely embossed and many other smaller articles which i cannot recollect the weight of these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois and in this estimate i have not included one hundred and ninetyseven superb gold watches three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars if one many of them were very old and as time keepers valueless the works having suffered more or less from corrosionbut all were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth we estimated the entire contents of the chest that night at a million and a half of dollars and upon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels a few being retained for our own use it was found that we had greatly undervalued the treasure when at length we had concluded our examination and the intense excitement of the time had in some measure subsided legrand who saw that i was dying with impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary riddle entered into a full detail of all the circumstances connected with it  you remember said he the night when i handed you the rough sketch i had made of the scarabÃ¦us you recollect also that i became quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a deathshead when you first made this assertion i thought you were jesting but afterwards i called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect and admitted to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact still the sneer at my graphic powers irritated mefor i am considered a good artistand therefore when you handed me the scrap of parchment i was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire  the scrap of paper you mean said i  no it had much of the appearance of paper and at first i supposed it to be such but when i came to draw upon it i discovered it at once to be a piece of very thin parchment it was quite dirty you remember well as i was in the very act of crumpling it up my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had been looking and you may imagine my astonishment when i perceived in fact the figure of a deathshead just where it seemed to me i had made the drawing of the beetle for a moment i was too much amazed to think with accuracy i knew that my design was very different in detail from thisalthough there was a certain similarity in general outline presently i took a candle and seating myself at the other end of the room proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely upon turning it over i saw my own sketch upon the reverse just as i had made it my first idea now was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outlineat the singular coincidence involved in the fact that unknown to me there should have been a skull upon the other side of the parchment immediately beneath my figure of the scarabÃ¦us and that this skull not only in outline but in size should so closely resemble my drawing i say the singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupified me for a time this is the usual effect of such coincidences the mind struggles to establish a connexiona sequence of cause and effectand being unable to do so suffers a species of temporary paralysis but when i recovered from this stupor there dawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more than the coincidence i began distinctly positively to remember that there had been no drawing upon the parchment when i made my sketch of the scarabÃ¦us i became perfectly certain of this for i recollected turning up first one side and then the other in search of the cleanest spot had the skull been then there of course i could not have failed to notice it here was indeed a mystery which i felt it impossible to explain but even at that early moment there seemed to glimmer faintly within the most remote and secret chambers of my intellect a glowwormlike conception of that truth which last nights adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration i arose at once and putting the parchment securely away dismissed all farther reflection until i should be alone  when you had gone and when jupiter was fast asleep i betook myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair in the first place i considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my possession the spot where we discovered the scarabaeus was on the coast of the main land about a mile eastward of the island and but a short distance above high water mark upon my taking hold of it it gave me a sharp bite which caused me to let it drop jupiter with his accustomed caution before seizing the insect which had flown towards him looked about him for a leaf or something of that nature by which to take hold of it it was at this moment that his eyes and mine also fell upon the scrap of parchment which i then supposed to be paper it was lying half buried in the sand a corner sticking up near the spot where we found it i observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a ships long boat the wreck seemed to have been there for a very great while for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced  well jupiter picked up the parchment wrapped the beetle in it and gave it to me soon afterwards we turned to go home and on the way met lieutenant g i showed him the insect and he begged me to let him take it to the fort upon my consenting he thrust it forthwith into his waistcoat pocket without the parchment in which it had been wrapped and which i had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind and thought it best to make sure of the prize at onceyou know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with natural history at the same time without being conscious of it i must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket  you remember that when i went to the table for the purpose of making a sketch of the beetle i found no paper where it was usually kept i looked in the drawer and found none there i searched my pockets hoping to find an old letter when my hand fell upon the parchment i thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my possession for the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force  no doubt you will think me fancifulbut i had already established a kind of connexion i had put together two links of a great chain there was a boat lying upon a seacoast and not far from the boat was a parchmentnot a paperwith a skull depicted upon it you will of course ask where is the connexion i reply that the skull or deathshead is the wellknown emblem of the pirate the flag of the deaths head is hoisted in all engagements  i have said that the scrap was parchment and not paper parchment is durablealmost imperishable matters of little moment are rarely consigned to parchment since for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing or writing it is not nearly so well adapted as paper this reflection suggested some meaningsome relevancyin the deathshead i did not fail to observe also the form of the parchment although one of its corners had been by some accident destroyed it could be seen that the original form was oblong it was just such a slip indeed as might have been chosen for a memorandumfor a record of something to be long remembered and carefully preserved  but i interposed you say that the skull was not upon the parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle how then do you trace any connexion between the boat and the skullsince this latter according to your own admission must have been designed god only knows how or by whom at some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabÃ¦us  ah hereupon turns the whole mystery although the secret at this point i had comparatively little difficulty in solving my steps were sure and could afford but a single result i reasoned for example thus when i drew the scarabÃ¦us there was no skull apparent upon the parchment when i had completed the drawing i gave it to you and observed you narrowly until you returned it you therefore did not design the skull and no one else was present to do it then it was not done by human agency and nevertheless it was done  at this stage of my reflections i endeavored to remember and did remember with entire distinctness every incident which occurred about the period in question the weather was chilly oh rare and happy accident and a fire was blazing upon the hearth i was heated with exercise and sat near the table you however had drawn a chair close to the chimney just as i placed the parchment in your hand and as you were in the act of inspecting it wolf the newfoundland entered and leaped upon your shoulders with your left hand you caressed him and kept him off while your right holding the parchment was permitted to fall listlessly between your knees and in close proximity to the fire at one moment i thought the blaze had caught it and was about to caution you but before i could speak you had withdrawn it and were engaged in its examination when i considered all these particulars i doubted not for a moment that heat had been the agent in bringing to light upon the parchment the skull which i saw designed upon it you are well aware that chemical preparations exist and have existed time out of mind by means of which it is possible to write upon either paper or vellum so that the characters shall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire zaffre digested in aqua regia and diluted with four times its weight of water is sometimes employed a green tint results the regulus of cobalt dissolved in spirit of nitre gives a red these colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after the material written upon cools but again become apparent upon the reapplication of heat  i now scrutinized the deathshead with care its outer edgesthe edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellumwere far more distinct than the others it was clear that the action of the caloric had been imperfect or unequal i immediately kindled a fire and subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat at first the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull but upon persevering in the experiment there became visible at the corner of the slip diagonally opposite to the spot in which the deathshead was delineated the figure of what i at first supposed to be a goat a closer scrutiny however satisfied me that it was intended for a kid  ha ha said i to be sure i have no right to laugh at youa million and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirthbut you are not about to establish a third link in your chainyou will not find any especial connexion between your pirates and a goatpirates you know have nothing to do with goats they appertain to the farming interest  but i have just said that the figure was not that of a goat  well a kid thenpretty much the same thing  pretty much but not altogether said legrand you may have heard of one captain kidd i at once looked upon the figure of the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature i say signature because its position upon the vellum suggested this idea the deathshead at the corner diagonally opposite had in the same manner the air of a stamp or seal but i was sorely put out by the absence of all elseof the body to my imagined instrumentof the text for my context  i presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the signature  something of that kind the fact is i felt irresistibly impressed with a presentiment of some vast good fortune impending i can scarcely say why perhaps after all it was rather a desire than an actual beliefbut do you know that jupiters silly words about the bug being of solid gold had a remarkable effect upon my fancy and then the series of accidents and coincidencesthese were so very extraordinary do you observe how mere an accident it was that these events should have occurred upon the sole day of all the year in which it has been or may be sufficiently cool for fire and that without the fire or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment in which he appeared i should never have become aware of the deathshead and so never the possessor of the treasure  but proceedi am all impatience  well you have heard of course the many stories currentthe thousand vague rumors afloat about money buried somewhere upon the atlantic coast by kidd and his associates these rumors must have had some foundation in fact and that the rumors have existed so long and so continuous could have resulted it appeared to me only from the circumstance of the buried treasure still remaining entombed had kidd concealed his plunder for a time and afterwards reclaimed it the rumors would scarcely have reached us in their present unvarying form you will observe that the stories told are all about moneyseekers not about moneyfinders had the pirate recovered his money there the affair would have dropped it seemed to me that some accidentsay the loss of a memorandum indicating its localityhad deprived him of the means of recovering it and that this accident had become known to his followers who otherwise might never have heard that treasure had been concealed at all and who busying themselves in vain because unguided attempts to regain it had given first birth and then universal currency to the reports which are now so common have you ever heard of any important treasure being unearthed along the coast  never  but that kidds accumulations were immense is well known i took it for granted therefore that the earth still held them and you will scarcely be surprised when i tell you that i felt a hope nearly amounting to certainty that the parchment so strangely found involved a lost record of the place of deposit  but how did you proceed  i held the vellum again to the fire after increasing the heat but nothing appeared i now thought it possible that the coating of dirt might have something to do with the failure so i carefully rinsed the parchment by pouring warm water over it and having done this i placed it in a tin pan with the skull downwards and put the pan upon a furnace of lighted charcoal in a few minutes the pan having become thoroughly heated i removed the slip and to my inexpressible joy found it spotted in several places with what appeared to be figures arranged in lines again i placed it in the pan and suffered it to remain another minute upon taking it off the whole was just as you see it now here legrand having reheated the parchment submitted it to my inspection the following characters were rudely traced in a red tint between the deathshead and the goat    53ÂÂÂ305648264Â4Â80648Â8Â¶60851ÂÂ   8Â83885Â4688968Â4855Â2Â4956   2548Â¶840692856Â84ÂÂ1Â94808188Â14   8Â854485Â52880681Â948884Â34484Â161   188Â  but said i returning him the slip i am as much in the dark as ever were all the jewels of golconda awaiting me upon my solution of this enigma i am quite sure that i should be unable to earn them  and yet said legrand the solution is by no means so difficult as you might be lead to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the characters these characters as any one might readily guess form a cipherthat is to say they convey a meaning but then from what is known of kidd i could not suppose him capable of constructing any of the more abstruse cryptographs i made up my mind at once that this was of a simple speciessuch however as would appear to the crude intellect of the sailor absolutely insoluble without the key  and you really solved it  readily i have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand times greater circumstances and a certain bias of mind have led me to take interest in such riddles and it may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not by proper application resolve in fact having once established connected and legible characters i scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of developing their import  in the present caseindeed in all cases of secret writingthe first question regards the language of the cipher for the principles of solution so far especially as the more simple ciphers are concerned depend upon and are varied by the genius of the particular idiom in general there is no alternative but experiment directed by probabilities of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution until the true one be attained but with the cipher now before us all difficulty was removed by the signature the pun upon the word kidd is appreciable in no other language than the english but for this consideration i should have begun my attempts with the spanish and french as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most naturally have been written by a pirate of the spanish main as it was i assumed the cryptograph to be english  you observe there are no divisions between the words had there been divisions the task would have been comparatively easy in such case i should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the shorter words and had a word of a single letter occurred as is most likely a or i for example i should have considered the solution as assured but there being no division my first step was to ascertain the predominant letters as well as the least frequent counting all i constructed a table thus  of the character 8 there are 33                                         26                           4             19                         Â              16                                        13                           5             12                           6             11                         Â 1              8                           0              6                         9 2              5                          3              4                                         3                           Â¶              2                                        1  now in english the letter which most frequently occurs is e afterwards succession runs thus a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l m w b k p q x z e predominates so remarkably that an individual sentence of any length is rarely seen in which it is not the prevailing character  here then we leave in the very beginning the groundwork for something more than a mere guess the general use which may be made of the table is obviousbut in this particular cipher we shall only very partially require its aid as our predominant character is 8 we will commence by assuming it as the e of the natural alphabet to verify the supposition let us observe if the 8 be seen often in couplesfor e is doubled with great frequency in englishin such words for example as meet fleet speed seen been agree c in the present instance we see it doubled no less than five times although the cryptograph is brief  let us assume 8 then as e now of all words in the language the is most usual let us see therefore whether there are not repetitions of any three characters in the same order of collocation the last of them being 8 if we discover repetitions of such letters so arranged they will most probably represent the word the upon inspection we find no less than seven such arrangements the characters being48 we may therefore assume that represents t 4 represents h and 8 represents ethe last being now well confirmed thus a great step has been taken  but having established a single word we are enabled to establish a vastly important point that is to say several commencements and terminations of other words let us refer for example to the last instance but one in which the combination48 occursnot far from the end of the cipher we know that the immediately ensuing is the commencement of a word and of the six characters succeeding this the we are cognizant of no less than five let us set these characters down thus by the letters we know them to represent leaving a space for the unknown  t eeth  here we are enabled at once to discard the th as forming no portion of the word commencing with the first t since by experiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the vacancy we perceive that no word can be formed of which this th can be a part we are thus narrowed into  t ee  and going through the alphabet if necessary as before we arrive at the word tree as the sole possible reading we thus gain another letter r represented by  with the words the tree in juxtaposition  looking beyond these words for a short distance we again see the combination48 and employ it by way of termination to what immediately precedes we have thus this arrangement  the tree4Â34 the  or substituting the natural letters where known it reads thus  the tree thrÂ3h the  now if in place of the unknown characters we leave blank spaces or substitute dots we read thus  the tree thrh the  when the word through makes itself evident at once but this discovery gives us three new letters o u and g represented by Â and 3  looking now narrowly through the cipher for combinations of known characters we find not very far from the beginning this arrangement  8388 or egree  which plainly is the conclusion of the word degree and gives us another letter d represented by Â  four letters beyond the word degree we perceive the combination  4688  translating the known characters and representing the unknown by dots as before we read thus th rtee an arrangement immediately suggestive of the word thirteen and again furnishing us with two new characters i and n represented by 6 and   referring now to the beginning of the cryptograph we find the combination

 we have therefore no less than ten of the most important letters represented and it will be unnecessary to proceed with the details of the solution i have said enough to convince you that ciphers of this nature are readily soluble and to give you some insight into the rationale of their development but be assured that the specimen before us appertains to the very simplest species of cryptograph it now only remains to give you the full translation of the characters upon the parchment as unriddled here it is  a good glass in the bishops hostel in the devils seat fortyone degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch seventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the deathshead a bee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out  but said i the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever how is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon about devils seats deaths heads and bishops hotels  i confess replied legrand that the matter still wears a serious aspect when regarded with a casual glance my first endeavor was to divide the sentence into the natural division intended by the cryptographist  you mean to punctuate it  something of that kind  but how was it possible to effect this  i reflected that it had been a point with the writer to run his words together without division so as to increase the difficulty of solution now a not overacute man in pursuing such an object would be nearly certain to overdo the matter when in the course of his composition he arrived at a break in his subject which would naturally require a pause or a point he would be exceedingly apt to run his characters at this place more than usually close together if you will observe the ms in the present instance you will easily detect five such cases of unusual crowding acting upon this hint i made the division thus a good glass in the bishops hostel in the devils seatfortyone degrees and thirteen minutesnortheast and by northmain branch seventh limb east sideshoot from the left eye of the deathsheada beeline from the tree through the shot fifty feet out  even this division said i leaves me still in the dark  it left me also in the dark replied legrand for a few days during which i made diligent inquiry in the neighborhood of sullivans island for any building which went by the name of the bishops hotel for of course i dropped the obsolete word hostel gaining no information on the subject i was on the point of extending my sphere of search and proceeding in a more systematic manner when one morning it entered into my head quite suddenly that this bishops hostel might have some reference to an old family of the name of bessop which time out of mind had held possession of an ancient manorhouse about four miles to the northward of the island i accordingly went over to the plantation and reinstituted my inquiries among the older negroes of the place at length one of the most aged of the women said that she had heard of such a place as bessops castle and thought that she could guide me to it but that it was not a castle nor a tavern but a high rock  i offered to pay her well for her trouble and after some demur she consented to accompany me to the spot we found it without much difficulty when dismissing her i proceeded to examine the place the castle consisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and rocksone of the latter being quite remarkable for its height as well as for its insulated and artificial appearance i clambered to its apex and then felt much at a loss as to what should be next done  while i was busied in reflection my eyes fell upon a narrow ledge in the eastern face of the rock perhaps a yard below the summit upon which i stood this ledge projected about eighteen inches and was not more than a foot wide while a niche in the cliff just above it gave it a rude resemblance to one of the hollowbacked chairs used by our ancestors i made no doubt that here was the devils seat alluded to in the ms and now i seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle  the good glass i knew could have reference to nothing but a telescope for the word glass is rarely employed in any other sense by seamen now here i at once saw was a telescope to be used and a definite point of view admitting no variation from which to use it nor did i hesitate to believe that the phrases fortyone degrees and thirteen minutes and northeast and by north were intended as directions for the levelling of the glass greatly excited by these discoveries i hurried home procured a telescope and returned to the rock  i let myself down to the ledge and found that it was impossible to retain a seat upon it except in one particular position this fact confirmed my preconceived idea i proceeded to use the glass of course the fortyone degrees and thirteen minutes could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the words northeast and by north this latter direction i at once established by means of a pocketcompass then pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of fortyone degrees of elevation as i could do it by guess i moved it cautiously up or down until my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped its fellows in the distance in the centre of this rift i perceived a white spot but could not at first distinguish what it was adjusting the focus of the telescope i again looked and now made it out to be a human skull  upon this discovery i was so sanguine as to consider the enigma solved for the phrase main branch seventh limb east side could refer only to the position of the skull upon the tree while shoot from the left eye of the deaths head admitted also of but one interpretation in regard to a search for buried treasure i perceived that the design was to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull and that a beeline or in other words a straight line drawn from the nearest point of the trunk through the shot or the spot where the bullet fell and thence extended to a distance of fifty feet would indicate a definite pointand beneath this point i thought it at least possible that a deposit of value lay concealed  all this i said is exceedingly clear and although ingenious still simple and explicit when you left the bishops hotel what then  why having carefully taken the bearings of the tree i turned homewards the instant that i left the devils seat however the circular rift vanished nor could i get a glimpse of it afterwards turn as i would what seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole business is the fact for repeated experiment has convinced me it is a fact that the circular opening in question is visible from no other attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge upon the face of the rock  in this expedition to the bishops hotel i had been attended by jupiter who had no doubt observed for some weeks past the abstraction of my demeanor and took especial care not to leave me alone but on the next day getting up very early i contrived to give him the slip and went into the hills in search of the tree after much toil i found it when i came home at night my valet proposed to give me a flogging with the rest of the adventure i believe you are as well acquainted as myself  i suppose said i you missed the spot in the first attempt at digging through jupiters stupidity in letting the bug fall through the right instead of through the left eye of the skull  precisely this mistake made a difference of about two inches and a half in the shotthat is to say in the position of the peg nearest the tree and had the treasure been beneath the shot the error would have been of little moment but the shot together with the nearest point of the tree were merely two points for the establishment of a line of direction of course the error however trivial in the beginning increased as we proceeded with the line and by the time we had gone fifty feet threw us quite off the scent but for my deepseated impressions that treasure was here somewhere actually buried we might have had all our labor in vain  but your grandiloquence and your conduct in swinging the beetlehow excessively odd i was sure you were mad and why did you insist upon letting fall the bug instead of a bullet from the skull  why to be frank i felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions touching my sanity and so resolved to punish you quietly in my own way by a little bit of sober mystification for this reason i swung the beetle and for this reason i let it fall it from the tree an observation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter idea  yes i perceive and now there is only one point which puzzles me what are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole  that is a question i am no more able to answer than yourself there seems however only one plausible way of accounting for themand yet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would imply it is clear that kiddif kidd indeed secreted this treasure which i doubt notit is clear that he must have had assistance in the labor but this labor concluded he may have thought it expedient to remove all participants in his secret perhaps a couple of blows with a mattock were sufficient while his coadjutors were busy in the pit perhaps it required a dozenwho shall tell     four beasts in onethe homocameleopard                       chacun a ses vertus                         crebillons xerxes  antiochus epiphanes is very generally looked upon as the gog of the prophet ezekiel this honor is however more properly attributable to cambyses the son of cyrus and indeed the character of the syrian monarch does by no means stand in need of any adventitious embellishment his accession to the throne or rather his usurpation of the sovereignty a hundred and seventyone years before the coming of christ his attempt to plunder the temple of diana at ephesus his implacable hostility to the jews his pollution of the holy of holies and his miserable death at taba after a tumultuous reign of eleven years are circumstances of a prominent kind and therefore more generally noticed by the historians of his time than the impious dastardly cruel silly and whimsical achievements which make up the sum total of his private life and reputation  let us suppose gentle reader that it is now the year of the world three thousand eight hundred and thirty and let us for a few minutes imagine ourselves at that most grotesque habitation of man the remarkable city of antioch to be sure there were in syria and other countries sixteen cities of that appellation besides the one to which i more particularly allude but ours is that which went by the name of antiochia epidaphne from its vicinity to the little village of daphne where stood a temple to that divinity it was built although about this matter there is some dispute by seleucus nicanor the first king of the country after alexander the great in memory of his father antiochus and became immediately the residence of the syrian monarchy in the flourishing times of the roman empire it was the ordinary station of the prefect of the eastern provinces and many of the emperors of the queen city among whom may be mentioned especially verus and valens spent here the greater part of their time but i perceive we have arrived at the city itself let us ascend this battlement and throw our eyes upon the town and neighboring country  what broad and rapid river is that which forces its way with innumerable falls through the mountainous wilderness and finally through the wilderness of buildings  that is the orontes and it is the only water in sight with the exception of the mediterranean which stretches like a broad mirror about twelve miles off to the southward every one has seen the mediterranean but let me tell you there are few who have had a peep at antioch by few i mean few who like you and me have had at the same time the advantages of a modern education therefore cease to regard that sea and give your whole attention to the mass of houses that lie beneath us you will remember that it is now the year of the world three thousand eight hundred and thirty were it laterfor example were it the year of our lord eighteen hundred and fortyfive we should be deprived of this extraordinary spectacle in the nineteenth century antioch isthat is to say antioch will bein a lamentable state of decay it will have been by that time totally destroyed at three different periods by three successive earthquakes indeed to say the truth what little of its former self may then remain will be found in so desolate and ruinous a state that the patriarch shall have removed his residence to damascus this is well i see you profit by my advice and are making the most of your time in inspecting the premisesin  satisfying your eyes  with the memorials and the things of fame  that most renown this city  i beg pardon i had forgotten that shakespeare will not flourish for seventeen hundred and fifty years to come but does not the appearance of epidaphne justify me in calling it grotesque  it is well fortified and in this respect is as much indebted to nature as to art  very true  there are a prodigious number of stately palaces  there are  and the numerous temples sumptuous and magnificent may bear comparison with the most lauded of antiquity  all this i must acknowledge still there is an infinity of mud huts and abominable hovels we cannot help perceiving abundance of filth in every kennel and were it not for the overpowering fumes of idolatrous incense i have no doubt we should find a most intolerable stench did you ever behold streets so insufferably narrow or houses so miraculously tall what gloom their shadows cast upon the ground it is well the swinging lamps in those endless colonnades are kept burning throughout the day we should otherwise have the darkness of egypt in the time of her desolation  it is certainly a strange place what is the meaning of yonder singular building see it towers above all others and lies to the eastward of what i take to be the royal palace  that is the new temple of the sun who is adored in syria under the title of elah gabalah hereafter a very notorious roman emperor will institute this worship in rome and thence derive a cognomen heliogabalus i dare say you would like to take a peep at the divinity of the temple you need not look up at the heavens his sunship is not thereat least not the sunship adored by the syrians that deity will be found in the interior of yonder building he is worshipped under the figure of a large stone pillar terminating at the summit in a cone or pyramid whereby is denoted fire  harkbeholdwho can those ridiculous beings be half naked with their faces painted shouting and gesticulating to the rabble  some few are mountebanks others more particularly belong to the race of philosophers the greatest portion howeverthose especially who belabor the populace with clubsare the principal courtiers of the palace executing as in duty bound some laudable comicality of the kings  but what have we here heavens the town is swarming with wild beasts how terrible a spectaclehow dangerous a peculiarity  terrible if you please but not in the least degree dangerous each animal if you will take the pains to observe is following very quietly in the wake of its master some few to be sure are led with a rope about the neck but these are chiefly the lesser or timid species the lion the tiger and the leopard are entirely without restraint they have been trained without difficulty to their present profession and attend upon their respective owners in the capacity of valetsdechambre it is true there are occasions when nature asserts her violated dominionsbut then the devouring of a manatarms or the throttling of a consecrated bull is a circumstance of too little moment to be more than hinted at in epidaphne  but what extraordinary tumult do i hear surely this is a loud noise even for antioch it argues some commotion of unusual interest  yesundoubtedly the king has ordered some novel spectaclesome gladiatorial exhibition at the hippodromeor perhaps the massacre of the scythian prisonersor the conflagration of his new palaceor the tearing down of a handsome templeor indeed a bonfire of a few jews the uproar increases shouts of laughter ascend the skies the air becomes dissonant with wind instruments and horrible with clamor of a million throats let us descend for the love of fun and see what is going on this waybe careful here we are in the principal street which is called the street of timarchus the sea of people is coming this way and we shall find a difficulty in stemming the tide they are pouring through the alley of heraclides which leads directly from the palacetherefore the king is most probably among the rioters yesi hear the shouts of the herald proclaiming his approach in the pompous phraseology of the east we shall have a glimpse of his person as he passes by the temple of ashimah let us ensconce ourselves in the vestibule of the sanctuary he will be here anon in the meantime let us survey this image what is it oh it is the god ashimah in proper person you perceive however that he is neither a lamb nor a goat nor a satyr neither has he much resemblance to the pan of the arcadians yet all these appearances have been giveni beg pardonwill be givenby the learned of future ages to the ashimah of the syrians put on your spectacles and tell me what it is what is it  bless me it is an ape  truea baboon but by no means the less a deity his name is a derivation of the greek simiawhat great fools are antiquarians but seeseeyonder scampers a ragged little urchin where is he going what is he bawling about what does he say oh he says the king is coming in triumph that he is dressed in state that he has just finished putting to death with his own hand a thousand chained israelitish prisoners for this exploit the ragamuffin is lauding him to the skies hark here comes a troop of a similar description they have made a latin hymn upon the valor of the king and are singing it as they go  mille mille mille  mille mille mille  decollavimus unus homo  mille mille mille mille decollavimus  mille mille mille  vivat qui mille mille occidit  tantum vini habet nemo  quantum sanguinis effudit1  which may be thus paraphrased  a thousand a thousand a thousand  a thousand a thousand a thousand  we with one warrior have slain  a thousand a thousand a thousand a thousand  sing a thousand over again  soholet us sing  long life to our king  who knocked over a thousand so fine  soholet us roar  he has given us more  red gallons of gore  than all syria can furnish of wine  do you hear that flourish of trumpets  yes the king is coming see the people are aghast with admiration and lift up their eyes to the heavens in reverence he comeshe is comingthere he is  whowherethe kingdo not behold himcannot say that i perceive him  then you must be blind  very possible still i see nothing but a tumultuous mob of idiots and madmen who are busy in prostrating themselves before a gigantic cameleopard and endeavoring to obtain a kiss of the animals hoofs see the beast has very justly kicked one of the rabble overand anotherand anotherand another indeed i cannot help admiring the animal for the excellent use he is making of his feet  rabble indeedwhy these are the noble and free citizens of epidaphne beasts did you saytake care that you are not overheard do you not perceive that the animal has the visage of a man why my dear sir that cameleopard is no other than antiochus epiphanes antiochus the illustrious king of syria and the most potent of all the autocrats of the east it is true that he is entitled at times antiochus epimanesantiochus the madmanbut that is because all people have not the capacity to appreciate his merits it is also certain that he is at present ensconced in the hide of a beast and is doing his best to play the part of a cameleopard but this is done for the better sustaining his dignity as king besides the monarch is of gigantic stature and the dress is therefore neither unbecoming nor over large we may however presume he would not have adopted it but for some occasion of especial state such you will allow is the massacre of a thousand jews with how superior a dignity the monarch perambulates on all fours his tail you perceive is held aloft by his two principal concubines elline and argelais and his whole appearance would be infinitely prepossessing were it not for the protuberance of his eyes which will certainly start out of his head and the queer color of his face which has become nondescript from the quantity of wine he has swallowed let us follow him to the hippodrome whither he is proceeding and listen to the song of triumph which he is commencing  who is king but epiphanes  saydo you know  who is king but epiphanes  bravobravo  there is none but epiphanes  nothere is none  so tear down the temples  and put out the sun  well and strenuously sung the populace are hailing him prince of poets as well as glory of the east delight of the universe and most remarkable of cameleopards they have encored his effusion and do you hearhe is singing it over again when he arrives at the hippodrome he will be crowned with the poetic wreath in anticipation of his victory at the approaching olympics  but good jupiter what is the matter in the crowd behind us  behind us did you sayoh ahi perceive my friend it is well that you spoke in time let us get into a place of safety as soon as possible herelet us conceal ourselves in the arch of this aqueduct and i will inform you presently of the origin of the commotion it has turned out as i have been anticipating the singular appearance of the cameleopard and the head of a man has it seems given offence to the notions of propriety entertained in general by the wild animals domesticated in the city a mutiny has been the result and as is usual upon such occasions all human efforts will be of no avail in quelling the mob several of the syrians have already been devoured but the general voice of the fourfooted patriots seems to be for eating up the cameleopard the prince of poets therefore is upon his hinder legs running for his life his courtiers have left him in the lurch and his concubines have followed so excellent an example delight of the universe thou art in a sad predicament glory of the east thou art in danger of mastication therefore never regard so piteously thy tail it will undoubtedly be draggled in the mud and for this there is no help look not behind thee then at its unavoidable degradation but take courage ply thy legs with vigor and scud for the hippodrome remember that thou art antiochus epiphanes antiochus the illustriousalso prince of poets glory of the east delight of the universe and most remarkable of cameleopards heavens what a power of speed thou art displaying what a capacity for legbail thou art developing run princebravo epiphanes well done cameleopardglorious antiochushe runshe leapshe flies like an arrow from a catapult he approaches the hippodrome he leapshe shriekshe is there this is well for hadst thou glory of the east been half a second longer in reaching the gates of the amphitheatre there is not a bears cub in epidaphne that would not have had a nibble at thy carcase let us be offlet us take our departurefor we shall find our delicate modern ears unable to endure the vast uproar which is about to commence in celebration of the kings escape listen it has already commenced seethe whole town is topsyturvy  surely this is the most populous city of the east what a wilderness of people what a jumble of all ranks and ages what a multiplicity of sects and nations what a variety of costumes what a babel of languages what a screaming of beasts what a tinkling of instruments what a parcel of philosophers  come let us be off  stay a moment i see a vast hubbub in the hippodrome what is the meaning of it i beseech you  thatoh nothing the noble and free citizens of epidaphne being as they declare well satisfied of the faith valor wisdom and divinity of their king and having moreover been eyewitnesses of his late superhuman agility do think it no more than their duty to invest his brows in addition to the poetic crown with the wreath of victory in the footracea wreath which it is evident he must obtain at the celebration of the next olympiad and which therefore they now give him in advance   footnotesfour beasts  1 flavius vospicus

browne   the mental features discoursed of as the analytical are in themselves but little susceptible of analysis we appreciate them only in their effects we know of them among other things that they are always to their possessor when inordinately possessed a source of the liveliest enjoyment as the strong man exults in his physical ability delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action so glories the analyst in that moral activity which disentangles he derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play he is fond of enigmas of conundrums of hieroglyphics exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension prÃ¦ternatural his results brought about by the very soul and essence of method have in truth the whole air of intuition  the faculty of resolution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study and especially by that highest branch of it which unjustly and merely on account of its retrograde operations has been called as if par excellence analysis yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse a chessplayer for example does the one without effort at the other it follows that the game of chess in its effects upon mental character is greatly misunderstood i am not now writing a treatise but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random i will therefore take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by a the elaborate frivolity of chess in this latter where the pieces have different and bizarre motions with various and variable values what is only complex is mistaken a not unusual error for what is profound the attention is here called powerfully into play if it flag for an instant an oversight is committed resulting in injury or defeat the possible moves being not only manifold but involute the chances of such oversights are multiplied and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers in draughts on the contrary where the moves are unique and have but little variation the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished and the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen to be less abstractlet us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings and where of course no oversight is to be expected it is obvious that here the victory can be decided the players being at all equal only by some recherchÃ© movement the result of some strong exertion of the intellect deprived of ordinary resources the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent identifies himself therewith and not unfrequently sees thus at a glance the sole methods sometime indeed absurdly simple ones by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation  whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it while eschewing chess as frivolous beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis the best chessplayer in christendom may be little more than the best player of chess but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all those more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind when i say proficiency i mean that perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources whence legitimate advantage may be derived these are not only manifold but multiform and lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary understanding to observe attentively is to remember distinctly and so far the concentrative chessplayer will do very well at whist while the rules of hoyle themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game are sufficiently and generally comprehensible thus to have a retentive memory and to proceed by the book are points commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing but it is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced he makes in silence a host of observations and inferences so perhaps do his companions and the difference in the extent of the information obtained lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation the necessary knowledge is that of what to observe our player confines himself not at all nor because the game is the object does he reject deductions from things external to the game he examines the countenance of his partner comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents he considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand often counting trump by trump and honor by honor through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each he notes every variation of face as the play progresses gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty of surprise of triumph or of chagrin from the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the suit he recognises what is played through feint by the air with which it is thrown upon the table a casual or inadvertent word the accidental dropping or turning of a card with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment the counting of the tricks with the order of their arrangement embarrassment hesitation eagerness or trepidationall afford to his apparently intuitive perception indications of the true state of affairs the first two or three rounds having been played he is in full possession of the contents of each hand and thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own  the analytical power should not be confounded with ample ingenuity for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis the constructive or combining power by which ingenuity is usually manifested and to which the phrenologists i believe erroneously have assigned a separate organ supposing it a primitive faculty has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon idiocy as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals between ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater indeed than that between the fancy and the imagination but of a character very strictly analogous it will be found in fact that the ingenious are always fanciful and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic  the narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced  residing in paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18 i there became acquainted with a monsieur c auguste dupin this young gentleman was of an excellentindeed of an illustrious family but by a variety of untoward events had been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it and he ceased to bestir himself in the world or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes by courtesy of his creditors there still remained in his possession a small remnant of his patrimony and upon the income arising from this he managed by means of a rigorous economy to procure the necessaries of life without troubling himself about its superfluities books indeed were his sole luxuries and in paris these are easily obtained  our first meeting was at an obscure library in the rue montmartre where the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very remarkable volume brought us into closer communion we saw each other again and again i was deeply interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor which a frenchman indulges whenever mere self is his theme i was astonished too at the vast extent of his reading and above all i felt my soul enkindled within me by the wild fervor and the vivid freshness of his imagination seeking in paris the objects i then sought i felt that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price and this feeling i frankly confided to him it was at length arranged that we should live together during my stay in the city and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his own i was permitted to be at the expense of renting and furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper a timeeaten and grotesque mansion long deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the faubourg st germain  had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world we should have been regarded as madmenalthough perhaps as madmen of a harmless nature our seclusion was perfect we admitted no visitors indeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates and it had been many years since dupin had ceased to know or be known in paris we existed within ourselves alone  it was a freak of fancy in my friend for what else shall i call it to be enamored of the night for her own sake and into this bizarrerie as into all his others i quietly fell giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon the sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always but we could counterfeit her presence at the first dawn of the morning we closed all the messy shutters of our old building lighting a couple of tapers which strongly perfumed threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays by the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreamsreading writing or conversing until warned by the clock of the advent of the true darkness then we sallied forth into the streets arm in arm continuing the topics of the day or roaming far and wide until a late hour seeking amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford  at such times i could not help remarking and admiring although from his rich ideality i had been prepared to expect it a peculiar analytic ability in dupin he seemed too to take an eager delight in its exerciseif not exactly in its displayand did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived he boasted to me with a low chuckling laugh that most men in respect to himself wore windows in their bosoms and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own his manner at these moments was frigid and abstract his eyes were vacant in expression while his voice usually a rich tenor rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation observing him in these moods i often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the bipart soul and amused myself with the fancy of a double dupinthe creative and the resolvent  let it not be supposed from what i have just said that i am detailing any mystery or penning any romance what i have described in the frenchman was merely the result of an excited or perhaps of a diseased intelligence but of the character of his remarks at the periods in question an example will best convey the idea  we were strolling one night down a long dirty street in the vicinity of the palais royal being both apparently occupied with thought neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least all at once dupin broke forth with these words  he is a very little fellow thats true and would do better for the thÃ©Ã¢tre des variÃ©tÃ©s  there can be no doubt of that i replied unwittingly and not at first observing so much had i been absorbed in reflection the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations in an instant afterward i recollected myself and my astonishment was profound  dupin said i gravely this is beyond my comprehension i do not hesitate to say that i am amazed and can scarcely credit my senses how was it possible you should know i was thinking of  here i paused to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom i thought  of chantilly said he why do you pause you were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy  this was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections chantilly was a quondam cobbler of the rue st denis who becoming stagemad had attempted the rÃ´le of xerxes in crÃ©billons tragedy so called and been notoriously pasquinaded for his pains  tell me for heavens sake i exclaimed the methodif method there isby which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter in fact i was even more startled than i would have been willing to express  it was the fruiterer replied my friend who brought you to the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for xerxes et id genus omne  the fruitereryou astonish mei know no fruiterer whomsoever  the man who ran up against you as we entered the streetit may have been fifteen minutes ago  i now remembered that in fact a fruiterer carrying upon his head a large basket of apples had nearly thrown me down by accident as we passed from the rue c  into the thoroughfare where we stood but what this had to do with chantilly i could not possibly understand  there was not a particle of charlÃ¢tanerie about dupin i will explain he said and that you may comprehend all clearly we will first retrace the course of your meditations from the moment in which i spoke to you until that of the rencontre with the fruiterer in question the larger links of the chain run thuschantilly orion dr nichols epicurus stereotomy the street stones the fruiterer  there are few persons who have not at some period of their lives amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained the occupation is often full of interest and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the startingpoint and the goal what then must have been my amazement when i heard the frenchman speak what he had just spoken and when i could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth he continued  we had been talking of horses if i remember aright just before leaving the rue c  this was the last subject we discussed as we crossed into this street a fruiterer with a large basket upon his head brushing quickly past us thrust you upon a pile of paving stones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair you stepped upon one of the loose fragments slipped slightly strained your ankle appeared vexed or sulky muttered a few words turned to look at the pile and then proceeded in silence i was not particularly attentive to what you did but observation has become with me of late a species of necessity  you kept your eyes upon the groundglancing with a petulant expression at the holes and ruts in the pavement so that i saw you were still thinking of the stones until we reached the little alley called lamartine which has been paved by way of experiment with the overlapping and riveted blocks here your countenance brightened up and perceiving your lips move i could not doubt that you murmured the word stereotomy a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement i knew that you could not say to yourself stereotomy without being brought to think of atomies and thus of the theories of epicurus and since when we discussed this subject not very long ago i mentioned to you how singularly yet with how little notice the vague guesses of that noble greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony i felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in orion and i certainly expected that you would do so you did look up and i was now assured that i had correctly followed your steps but in that bitter tirade upon chantilly which appeared in yesterdays musÃ©e the satirist making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler s change of name upon assuming the buskin quoted a latin line about which we have often conversed i mean the line       perdidit antiquum litera sonum  i had told you that this was in reference to orion formerly written urion and from certain pungencies connected with this explanation i was aware that you could not have forgotten it it was clear therefore that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of orion and chantilly that you did combine them i saw by the character of the smile which passed over your lips you thought of the poor cobblers immolation so far you had been stooping in your gait but now i saw you draw yourself up to your full height i was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of chantilly at this point i interrupted your meditations to remark that as in fact he was a very little fellowthat chantillyhe would do better at the thÃ©Ã¢tre des variÃ©tÃ©s  not long after this we were looking over an evening edition of the gazette des tribunaux when the following paragraphs arrested our attention  extraordinary murdersthis morning about three oclock the inhabitants of the quartier st roch were aroused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks issuing apparently from the fourth story of a house in the rue morgue known to be in the sole occupancy of one madame lespanaye and her daughter mademoiselle camille lespanaye after some delay occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner the gateway was broken in with a crowbar and eight or ten of the neighbors entered accompanied by two gendarmes by this time the cries had ceased but as the party rushed up the first flight of stairs two or more rough voices in angry contention were distinguished and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house as the second landing was reached these sounds also had ceased and everything remained perfectly quiet the party spread themselves and hurried from room to room upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth story the door of which being found locked with the key inside was forced open a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less with horror than with astonishment  the apartment was in the wildest disorderthe furniture broken and thrown about in all directions there was only one bedstead and from this the bed had been removed and thrown into the middle of the floor on a chair lay a razor besmeared with blood on the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of grey human hair also dabbled in blood and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots upon the floor were found four napoleons an earring of topaz three large silver spoons three smaller of mÃ©tal dalger and two bags containing nearly four thousand francs in gold the drawers of a bureau which stood in one corner were open and had been apparently rifled although many articles still remained in them a small iron safe was discovered under the bed not under the bedstead it was open with the key still in the door it had no contents beyond a few old letters and other papers of little consequence  of madame lespanaye no traces were here seen but an unusual quantity of soot being observed in the fireplace a search was made in the chimney and horrible to relate the corpse of the daughter head downward was dragged therefrom it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance the body was quite warm upon examining it many excoriations were perceived no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged upon the face were many severe scratches and upon the throat dark bruises and deep indentations of finger nails as if the deceased had been throttled to death  after a thorough investigation of every portion of the house without farther discovery the party made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of the building where lay the corpse of the old lady with her throat so entirely cut that upon an attempt to raise her the head fell off the body as well as the head was fearfully mutilatedthe former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity  to this horrible mystery there is not as yet we believe the slightest clew  the next days paper had these additional particulars  the tragedy in the rue morgue many individuals have been examined in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair the word affaire has not yet in france that levity of import which it conveys with us but nothing whatever has transpired to throw light upon it we give below all the material testimony elicited  pauline dubourg laundress deposes that she has known both the deceased for three years having washed for them during that period the old lady and her daughter seemed on good termsvery affectionate towards each other they were excellent pay could not speak in regard to their mode or means of living believed that madame l told fortunes for a living was reputed to have money put by never met any persons in the house when she called for the clothes or took them home was sure that they had no servant in employ there appeared to be no furniture in any part of the building except in the fourth story  pierre moreau tobacconist deposes that he has been in the habit of selling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to madame lespanaye for nearly four years was born in the neighborhood and has always resided there the deceased and her daughter had occupied the house in which the corpses were found for more than six years it was formerly occupied by a jeweller who underlet the upper rooms to various persons the house was the property of madame l she became dissatisfied with the abuse of the premises by her tenant and moved into them herself refusing to let any portion the old lady was childish witness had seen the daughter some five or six times during the six years the two lived an exceedingly retired lifewere reputed to have money had heard it said among the neighbors that madame l told fortunesdid not believe it had never seen any person enter the door except the old lady and her daughter a porter once or twice and a physician some eight or ten times  many other persons neighbors gave evidence to the same effect no one was spoken of as frequenting the house it was not known whether there were any living connexions of madame l and her daughter the shutters of the front windows were seldom opened those in the rear were always closed with the exception of the large back room fourth story the house was a good housenot very old  isidore muset gendarme deposes that he was called to the house about three oclock in the morning and found some twenty or thirty persons at the gateway endeavoring to gain admittance forced it open at length with a bayonetnot with a crowbar had but little difficulty in getting it open on account of its being a double or folding gate and bolted neither at bottom not top the shrieks were continued until the gate was forcedand then suddenly ceased they seemed to be screams of some person or persons in great agonywere loud and drawn out not short and quick witness led the way up stairs upon reaching the first landing heard two voices in loud and angry contentionthe one a gruff voice the other much shrillera very strange voice could distinguish some words of the former which was that of a frenchman was positive that it was not a womans voice could distinguish the words sacrÃ© and diable the shrill voice was that of a foreigner could not be sure whether it was the voice of a man or of a woman could not make out what was said but believed the language to be spanish the state of the room and of the bodies was described by this witness as we described them yesterday  henri duval a neighbor and by trade a silversmith deposes that he was one of the party who first entered the house corroborates the testimony of musÃ¨t in general as soon as they forced an entrance they reclosed the door to keep out the crowd which collected very fast notwithstanding the lateness of the hour the shrill voice this witness thinks was that of an italian was certain it was not french could not be sure that it was a mans voice it might have been a womans was not acquainted with the italian language could not distinguish the words but was convinced by the intonation that the speaker was an italian knew madame l and her daughter had conversed with both frequently was sure that the shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased  odenheimer restaurateur this witness volunteered his testimony not speaking french was examined through an interpreter is a native of amsterdam was passing the house at the time of the shrieks they lasted for several minutesprobably ten they were long and loudvery awful and distressing was one of those who entered the building corroborated the previous evidence in every respect but one was sure that the shrill voice was that of a manof a frenchman could not distinguish the words uttered they were loud and quickunequalspoken apparently in fear as well as in anger the voice was harshnot so much shrill as harsh could not call it a shrill voice the gruff voice said repeatedly sacrÃ© diable and once mon dieu  jules mignaud banker of the firm of mignaud et fils rue deloraine is the elder mignaud madame lespanaye had some property had opened an account with his banking house in the spring of the yeareight years previously made frequent deposits in small sums had checked for nothing until the third day before her death when she took out in person the sum of 4000 francs this sum was paid in gold and a clerk went home with the money  adolphe le bon clerk to mignaud et fils deposes that on the day in question about noon he accompanied madame lespanaye to her residence with the 4000 francs put up in two bags upon the door being opened mademoiselle l appeared and took from his hands one of the bags while the old lady relieved him of the other he then bowed and departed did not see any person in the street at the time it is a byestreetvery lonely  william bird tailor deposes that he was one of the party who entered the house is an englishman has lived in paris two years was one of the first to ascend the stairs heard the voices in contention the gruff voice was that of a frenchman could make out several words but cannot now remember all heard distinctly sacrÃ© and mon dieu there was a sound at the moment as if of several persons strugglinga scraping and scuffling sound the shrill voice was very loudlouder than the gruff one is sure that it was not the voice of an englishman appeared to be that of a german might have been a womans voice does not understand german  four of the abovenamed witnesses being recalled deposed that the door of the chamber in which was found the body of mademoiselle l was locked on the inside when the party reached it every thing was perfectly silentno groans or noises of any kind upon forcing the door no person was seen the windows both of the back and front room were down and firmly fastened from within a door between the two rooms was closed but not locked the door leading from the front room into the passage was locked with the key on the inside a small room in the front of the house on the fourth story at the head of the passage was open the door being ajar this room was crowded with old beds boxes and so forth these were carefully removed and searched there was not an inch of any portion of the house which was not carefully searched sweeps were sent up and down the chimneys the house was a four story one with garrets mansardes a trapdoor on the roof was nailed down very securelydid not appear to have been opened for years the time elapsing between the hearing of the voices in contention and the breaking open of the room door was variously stated by the witnesses some made it as short as three minutessome as long as five the door was opened with difficulty  alfonzo garcio undertaker deposes that he resides in the rue morgue is a native of spain was one of the party who entered the house did not proceed up stairs is nervous and was apprehensive of the consequences of agitation heard the voices in contention the gruff voice was that of a frenchman could not distinguish what was said the shrill voice was that of an englishmanis sure of this does not understand the english language but judges by the intonation  alberto montani confectioner deposes that he was among the first to ascend the stairs heard the voices in question the gruff voice was that of a frenchman distinguished several words the speaker appeared to be expostulating could not make out the words of the shrill voice spoke quick and unevenly thinks it the voice of a russian corroborates the general testimony is an italian never conversed with a native of russia  several witnesses recalled here testified that the chimneys of all the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human being by sweeps were meant cylindrical sweeping brushes such as are employed by those who clean chimneys these brushes were passed up and down every flue in the house there is no back passage by which any one could have descended while the party proceeded up stairs the body of mademoiselle lespanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that it could not be got down until four or five of the party united their strength  paul dumas physician deposes that he was called to view the bodies about daybreak they were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead in the chamber where mademoiselle l was found the corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated the fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances the throat was greatly chafed there were several deep scratches just below the chin together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression of fingers the face was fearfully discolored and the eyeballs protruded the tongue had been partially bitten through a large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach produced apparently by the pressure of a knee in the opinion of m dumas mademoiselle lespanaye had been throttled to death by some person or persons unknown the corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated all the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered the left tibia much splintered as well as all the ribs of the left side whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored it was not possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted a heavy club of wood or a broad bar of irona chairany large heavy and obtuse weapon would have produced such results if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man no woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon the head of the deceased when seen by witness was entirely separated from the body and was also greatly shattered the throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp instrumentprobably with a razor  alexandre etienne surgeon was called with m dumas to view the bodies corroborated the testimony and the opinions of m dumas  nothing farther of importance was elicited although several other persons were examined a murder so mysterious and so perplexing in all its particulars was never before committed in parisif indeed a murder has been committed at all the police are entirely at faultan unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature there is not however the shadow of a clew apparent  the evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement still continued in the quartier st rochthat the premises in question had been carefully researched and fresh examinations of witnesses instituted but all to no purpose a postscript however mentioned that adolphe le bon had been arrested and imprisonedalthough nothing appeared to criminate him beyond the facts already detailed  dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affairat least so i judged from his manner for he made no comments it was only after the announcement that le bon had been imprisoned that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders  i could merely agree with all paris in considering them an insoluble mystery i saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the murderer  we must not judge of the means said dupin by this shell of an examination the parisian police so much extolled for acumen are cunning but no more there is no method in their proceedings beyond the method of the moment they make a vast parade of measures but not unfrequently these are so ill adapted to the objects proposed as to put us in mind of monsieur jourdains calling for his robedechambrepour mieux entendre la musique the results attained by them are not unfrequently surprising but for the most part are brought about by simple diligence and activity when these qualities are unavailing their schemes fail vidocq for example was a good guesser and a persevering man but without educated thought he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations he impaired his vision by holding the object too close he might see perhaps one or two points with unusual clearness but in so doing he necessarily lost sight of the matter as a whole thus there is such a thing as being too profound truth is not always in a well in fact as regards the more important knowledge i do believe that she is invariably superficial the depth lies in the valleys where we seek her and not upon the mountaintops where she is found the modes and sources of this kind of error are well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies to look at a star by glancesto view it in a sidelong way by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior is to behold the star distinctlyis to have the best appreciation of its lustrea lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it a greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case but in the former there is the more refined capacity for comprehension by undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought and it is possible to make even venus herself vanish from the firmanent by a scrutiny too sustained too concentrated or too direct  as for these murders let us enter into some examinations for ourselves before we make up an opinion respecting them an inquiry will afford us amusement i thought this an odd term so applied but said nothing and besides le bon once rendered me a service for which i am not ungrateful we will go and see the premises with our own eyes i know g the prefect of police and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission  the permission was obtained and we proceeded at once to the rue morgue this is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the rue richelieu and the rue st roch it was late in the afternoon when we reached it as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we resided the house was readily found for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters with an objectless curiosity from the opposite side of the way it was an ordinary parisian house with a gateway on one side of which was a glazed watchbox with a sliding panel in the window indicating a loge de concierge before going in we walked up the street turned down an alley and then again turning passed in the rear of the buildingdupin meanwhile examining the whole neighborhood as well as the house with a minuteness of attention for which i could see no possible object  retracing our steps we came again to the front of the dwelling rang and having shown our credentials were admitted by the agents in charge we went up stairsinto the chamber where the body of mademoiselle lespanaye had been found and where both the deceased still lay the disorders of the room had as usual been suffered to exist i saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the gazette des tribunaux dupin scrutinized every thingnot excepting the bodies of the victims we then went into the other rooms and into the yard a gendarme accompanying us throughout the examination occupied us until dark when we took our departure on our way home my companion stepped in for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers  i have said that the whims of my friend were manifold and that je les mÃ©nagaisfor this phrase there is no english equivalent it was his humor now to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder until about noon the next day he then asked me suddenly if i had observed any thing peculiar at the scene of the atrocity  there was something in his manner of emphasizing the word peculiar which caused me to shudder without knowing why  no nothing peculiar i said nothing more at least than we both saw stated in the paper  the gazette he replied has not entered i fear into the unusual horror of the thing but dismiss the idle opinions of this print it appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solutioni mean for the outrÃ© character of its features the police are confounded by the seeming absence of motivenot for the murder itselfbut for the atrocity of the murder they are puzzled too by the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention with the facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated mademoiselle lespanaye and that there were no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending the wild disorder of the room the corpse thrust with the head downward up the chimney the frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady these considerations with those just mentioned and others which i need not mention have sufficed to paralyze the powers by putting completely at fault the boasted acumen of the government agents they have fallen into the gross but common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse but it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary that reason feels its way if at all in its search for the true in investigations such as we are now pursuing it should not be so much asked what has occurred as what has occurred that has never occurred before in fact the facility with which i shall arrive or have arrived at the solution of this mystery is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police  i stared at the speaker in mute astonishment  i am now awaiting continued he looking toward the door of our apartmenti am now awaiting a person who although perhaps not the perpetrator of these butcheries must have been in some measure implicated in their perpetration of the worst portion of the crimes committed it is probable that he is innocent i hope that i am right in this supposition for upon it i build my expectation of reading the entire riddle i look for the man herein this roomevery moment it is true that he may not arrive but the probability is that he will should he come it will be necessary to detain him here are pistols and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use  i took the pistols scarcely knowing what i did or believing what i heard while dupin went on very much as if in a soliloquy i have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times his discourse was addressed to myself but his voice although by no means loud had that intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance his eyes vacant in expression regarded only the wall  that the voices heard in contention he said by the party upon the stairs were not the voices of the women themselves was fully proved by the evidence this relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter and afterward have committed suicide i speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method for the strength of madame lespanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughters corpse up the chimney as it was found and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely preclude the idea of selfdestruction murder then has been committed by some third party and the voices of this third party were those heard in contention let me now advertnot to the whole testimony respecting these voicesbut to what was peculiar in that testimony did you observe any thing peculiar about it  i remarked that while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a frenchman there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill or as one individual termed it the harsh voice  that was the evidence itself said dupin but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence you have observed nothing distinctive yet there was something to be observed the witnesses as you remark agreed about the gruff voice they were here unanimous but in regard to the shrill voice the peculiarity isnot that they disagreedbut that while an italian an englishman a spaniard a hollander and a frenchman attempted to describe it each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen each likens itnot to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is conversantbut the converse the frenchman supposes it the voice of a spaniard and might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with the spanish the dutchman maintains it to have been that of a frenchman but we find it stated that not understanding french this witness was examined through an interpreter the englishman thinks it the voice of a german and does not understand german the spaniard is sure that it was that of an englishman but judges by the intonation altogether as he has no knowledge of the english the italian believes it the voice of a russian but has never conversed with a native of russia a second frenchman differs moreover with the first and is positive that the voice was that of an italian but not being cognizant of that tongue is like the spaniard convinced by the intonation now how strangely unusual must that voice have really been about which such testimony as this could have been elicitedin whose tones even denizens of the five great divisions of europe could recognise nothing familiar you will say that it might have been the voice of an asiaticof an african neither asiatics nor africans abound in paris but without denying the inference i will now merely call your attention to three points the voice is termed by one witness harsh rather than shrill it is represented by two others to have been quick and unequal no wordsno sounds resembling wordswere by any witness mentioned as distinguishable  i know not continued dupin what impression i may have made so far upon your own understanding but i do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimonythe portion respecting the gruff and shrill voicesare in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of the mystery i said legitimate deductions but my meaning is not thus fully expressed i designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result what the suspicion is however i will not say just yet i merely wish you to bear in mind that with myself it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite forma certain tendencyto my inquiries in the chamber  let us now transport ourselves in fancy to this chamber what shall we first seek here the means of egress employed by the murderers it is not too much to say that neither of us believe in prÃ¦ternatural events madame and mademoiselle lespanaye were not destroyed by spirits the doers of the deed were material and escaped materially then how fortunately there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point and that mode must lead us to a definite decisionlet us examine each by each the possible means of egress it is clear that the assassins were in the room where mademoiselle lespanaye was found or at least in the room adjoining when the party ascended the stairs it is then only from these two apartments that we have to seek issues the police have laid bare the floors the ceilings and the masonry of the walls in every direction no secret issues could have escaped their vigilance but not trusting to their eyes i examined with my own there were then no secret issues both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked with the keys inside let us turn to the chimneys these although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths will not admit throughout their extent the body of a large cat the impossibility of egress by means already stated being thus absolute we are reduced to the windows through those of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street the murderers must have passed then through those of the back room now brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are it is not our part as reasoners to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities it is only left for us to prove that these apparent impossibilities are in reality not such  there are two windows in the chamber one of them is unobstructed by furniture and is wholly visible the lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it the former was found securely fastened from within it resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it a large gimlethole had been pierced in its frame to the left and a very stout nail was found fitted therein nearly to the head upon examining the other window a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash failed also the police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions and therefore it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows  my own examination was somewhat more particular and was so for the reason i have just givenbecause here it was i knew that all apparent impossibilities must be proved to be not such in reality  i proceeded to think thusÃ  posteriori the murderers did escape from one of these windows this being so they could not have refastened the sashes from the inside as they were found fastenedthe consideration which put a stop through its obviousness to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter yet the sashes were fastened they must then have the power of fastening themselves there was no escape from this conclusion i stepped to the unobstructed casement withdrew the nail with some difficulty and attempted to raise the sash it resisted all my efforts as i had anticipated a concealed spring must i now know exist and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my premises at least were correct however mysterious still appeared the circumstances attending the nails a careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring i pressed it and satisfied with the discovery forbore to upraise the sash  i now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively a person passing out through this window might have reclosed it and the spring would have caughtbut the nail could not have been replaced the conclusion was plain and again narrowed in the field of my investigations the assassins must have escaped through the other window supposing then the springs upon each sash to be the same as was probable there must be found a difference between the nails or at least between the modes of their fixture getting upon the sacking of the bedstead i looked over the headboard minutely at the second casement passing my hand down behind the board i readily discovered and pressed the spring which was as i had supposed identical in character with its neighbor i now looked at the nail it was as stout as the other and apparently fitted in the same mannerdriven in nearly up to the head  you will say that i was puzzled but if you think so you must have misunderstood the nature of the inductions to use a sporting phrase i had not been once at fault the scent had never for an instant been lost there was no flaw in any link of the chain i had traced the secret to its ultimate resultand that result was the nail it had i say in every respect the appearance of its fellow in the other window but this fact was an absolute nullity conclusive us it might seem to be when compared with the consideration that here at this point terminated the clew there must be something wrong i said about the nail i touched it and the head with about a quarter of an inch of the shank came off in my fingers the rest of the shank was in the gimlethole where it had been broken off the fracture was an old one for its edges were incrusted with rust and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer which had partially imbedded in the top of the bottom sash the head portion of the nail i now carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence i had taken it and the resemblance to a perfect nail was completethe fissure was invisible pressing the spring i gently raised the sash for a few inches the head went up with it remaining firm in its bed i closed the window and the semblance of the whole nail was again perfect  the riddle so far was now unriddled the assassin had escaped through the window which looked upon the bed dropping of its own accord upon his exit or perhaps purposely closed it had become fastened by the spring and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the nailfarther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary  the next question is that of the mode of descent upon this point i had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building about five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightningrod from this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself to say nothing of entering it i observed however that the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by parisian carpenters ferradesa kind rarely employed at the present day but frequently seen upon very old mansions at lyons and bourdeaux they are in the form of an ordinary door a single not a folding door except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellisthus affording an excellent hold for the hands in the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad when we saw them from the rear of the house they were both about half openthat is to say they stood off at right angles from the wall it is probable that the police as well as myself examined the back of the tenement but if so in looking at these ferrades in the line of their breadth as they must have done they did not perceive this great breadth itself or at all events failed to take it into due consideration in fact having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination it was clear to me however that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed would if swung fully back to the wall reach to within two feet of the lightningrod it was also evident that by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage an entrance into the window from the rod might have been thus effectedby reaching to the distance of two feet and a half we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trelliswork letting go then his hold upon the rod placing his feet securely against the wall and springing boldly from it he might have swung the shutter so as to close it and if we imagine the window open at the time might even have swung himself into the room  i wish you to bear especially in mind that i have spoken of a very unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult a feat it is my design to show you first that the thing might possibly have been accomplishedbut secondly and chiefly i wish to impress upon your understanding the very extraordinarythe almost prÃ¦ternatural character of that agility which could have accomplished it  you will say no doubt using the language of the law that to make out my case i should rather undervalue than insist upon a full estimation of the activity required in this matter this may be the practice in law but it is not the usage of reason my ultimate object is only the truth my immediate purpose is to lead you to place in juxtaposition that very unusual activity of which i have just spoken with that very peculiar shrill or harsh and unequal voice about whose nationality no two persons could be found to agree and in whose utterance no syllabification could be detected  at these words a vague and halfformed conception of the meaning of dupin flitted over my mind i seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension without power to comprehendmen at times find themselves upon the brink of remembrance without being able in the end to remember my friend went on with his discourse  you will see he said that i have shifted the question from the mode of egress to that of ingress it was my design to convey the idea that both were effected in the same manner at the same point let us now revert to the interior of the room let us survey the appearances here the drawers of the bureau it is said had been rifled although many articles of apparel still remained within them the conclusion here is absurd it is a mere guessa very silly oneand no more how are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally contained madame lespanaye and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired lifesaw no companyseldom went outhad little use for numerous changes of habiliment those found were at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies if a thief had taken any why did he not take the bestwhy did he not take all in a word why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of linen the gold was abandoned nearly the whole sum mentioned by monsieur mignaud the banker was discovered in bags upon the floor i wish you therefore to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of motive engendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house coincidences ten times as remarkable as this the delivery of the money and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it happen to all of us every hour of our lives without attracting even momentary notice coincidences in general are great stumblingblocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilitiesthat theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration in the present instance had the gold been gone the fact of its delivery three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence it would have been corroborative of this idea of motive but under the real circumstances of the case if we are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage we must also imagine the perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together  keeping now steadily in mind the points to which i have drawn your attentionthat peculiar voice that unusual agility and that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as thislet us glance at the butchery itself here is a woman strangled to death by manual strength and thrust up a chimney head downward ordinary assassins employ no such modes of murder as this least of all do they thus dispose of the murdered in the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney you will admit that there was something excessively outrÃ©something altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of human action even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men think too how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down  turn now to other indications of the employment of a vigor most marvellous on the hearth were thick tressesvery thick tressesof grey human hair these had been torn out by the roots you are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together you saw the locks in question as well as myself their roots a hideous sight were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalpsure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time the throat of the old lady was not merely cut but the head absolutely severed from the body the instrument was a mere razor i wish you also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds of the bruises upon the body of madame lespanaye i do not speak monsieur dumas and his worthy coadjutor monsieur etienne have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument and so far these gentlemen are very correct the obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard upon which the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed this idea however simple it may now seem escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped thembecause by the affair of the nails their perceptions had been hermetically sealed against the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all  if now in addition to all these things you have properly reflected upon the odd disorder of the chamber we have gone so far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding a strength superhuman a ferocity brutal a butchery without motive a grotesquerie in horror absolutely alien from humanity and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations and devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification what result then has ensued what impression have i made upon your fancy  i felt a creeping of the flesh as dupin asked me the question a madman i said has done this deedsome raving maniac escaped from a neighboring maison de santÃ©  in some respects he replied your idea is not irrelevant but the voices of madmen even in their wildest paroxysms are never found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs madmen are of some nation and their language however incoherent in its words has always the coherence of syllabification besides the hair of a madman is not such as i now hold in my hand i disentangled this little tuft from the rigidly clutched fingers of madame lespanaye tell me what you can make of it  dupin i said completely unnerved this hair is most unusualthis is no human hair  i have not asserted that it is said he but before we decide this point i wish you to glance at the little sketch i have here traced upon this paper it is a facsimile drawing of what has been described in one portion of the testimony as dark bruises and deep indentations of finger nails upon the throat of mademoiselle lespanaye and in another by messrs dumas and etienne as a series of livid spots evidently the impression of fingers  you will perceive continued my friend spreading out the paper upon the table before us that this drawing gives the idea of a firm and fixed hold there is no slipping apparent each finger has retainedpossibly until the death of the victimthe fearful grasp by which it originally imbedded itself attempt now to place all your fingers at the same time in the respective impressions as you see them  i made the attempt in vain  we are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial he said the paper is spread out upon a plane surface but the human throat is cylindrical here is a billet of wood the circumference of which is about that of the throat wrap the drawing around it and try the experiment again  i did so but the difficulty was even more obvious than before this i said is the mark of no human hand  read now replied dupin this passage from cuvier  it was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large fulvous ourangoutang of the east indian islands the gigantic stature the prodigious strength and activity the wild ferocity and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all i understood the full horrors of the murder at once  the description of the digits said i as i made an end of reading is in exact accordance with this drawing i see that no animal but an ourangoutang of the species here mentioned could have impressed the indentations as you have traced them this tuft of tawny hair too is identical in character with that of the beast of cuvier but i cannot possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery besides there were two voices heard in contention and one of them was unquestionably the voice of a frenchman  true and you will remember an expression attributed almost unanimously by the evidence to this voicethe expression mon dieu this under the circumstances has been justly characterized by one of the witnesses montani the confectioner as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation upon these two words therefore i have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle a frenchman was cognizant of the murder it is possibleindeed it is far more than probablethat he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took place the ourangoutang may have escaped from him he may have traced it to the chamber but under the agitating circumstances which ensued he could never have recaptured it it is still at large i will not pursue these guessesfor i have no right to call them moresince the shades of reflection upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect and since i could not pretend to make them intelligible to the understanding of another we will call them guesses then and speak of them as such if the frenchman in question is indeed as i suppose innocent of this atrocity this advertisement which i left last night upon our return home at the office of le monde a paper devoted to the shipping interest and much sought by sailors will bring him to our residence  he handed me a paper and i read thus  caughtin the bois de boulogne early in the morning of theinst the morning of the murder a very large tawny ourangoutang of the bornese species the owner who is ascertained to be a sailor belonging to a maltese vessel may have the animal again upon identifying it satisfactorily and paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping call at no  rue  faubourg st germainau troisiÃªme  how was it possible i asked that you should know the man to be a sailor and belonging to a maltese vessel  i do not know it said dupin i am not sure of it here however is a small piece of ribbon which from its form and from its greasy appearance has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long queues of which sailors are so fond moreover this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie and is peculiar to the maltese i picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightningrod it could not have belonged to either of the deceased now if after all i am wrong in my induction from this ribbon that the frenchman was a sailor belonging to a maltese vessel still i can have done no harm in saying what i did in the advertisement if i am in error he will merely suppose that i have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble to inquire but if i am right a great point is gained cognizant although innocent of the murder the frenchman will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisementabout demanding the ourangoutang he will reason thusi am innocent i am poor my ourangoutang is of great valueto one in my circumstances a fortune of itselfwhy should i lose it through idle apprehensions of danger here it is within my grasp it was found in the bois de boulogneat a vast distance from the scene of that butchery how can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed the police are at faultthey have failed to procure the slightest clew should they even trace the animal it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance above all i am known the advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast i am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend should i avoid claiming a property of so great value which it is known that i possess i will render the animal at least liable to suspicion it is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast i will answer the advertisement get the ourangoutang and keep it close until this matter has blown over  at this moment we heard a step upon the stairs  be ready said dupin with your pistols but neither use them nor show them until at a signal from myself  the front door of the house had been left open and the visiter had entered without ringing and advanced several steps upon the staircase now however he seemed to hesitate presently we heard him descending dupin was moving quickly to the door when we again heard him coming up he did not turn back a second time but stepped up with decision and rapped at the door of our chamber  come in said dupin in a cheerful and hearty tone  a man entered he was a sailor evidentlya tall stout and muscularlooking person with a certain daredevil expression of countenance not altogether unprepossessing his face greatly sunburnt was more than half hidden by whisker and mustachio he had with him a huge oaken cudgel but appeared to be otherwise unarmed he bowed awkwardly and bade us good evening in french accents which although somewhat neufchatelish were still sufficiently indicative of a parisian origin  sit down my friend said dupin i suppose you have called about the ourangoutang upon my word i almost envy you the possession of him a remarkably fine and no doubt a very valuable animal how old do you suppose him to be  the sailor drew a long breath with the air of a man relieved of some intolerable burden and then replied in an assured tone  i have no way of tellingbut he cant be more than four or five years old have you got him here  oh no we had no conveniences for keeping him here he is at a livery stable in the rue dubourg just by you can get him in the morning of course you are prepared to identify the property  to be sure i am sir  i shall be sorry to part with him said dupin  i dont mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing sir said the man couldnt expect it am very willing to pay a reward for the finding of the animalthat is to say any thing in reason  well replied my friend that is all very fair to be sure let me thinkwhat should i have oh i will tell you my reward shall be this you shall give me all the information in your power about these murders in the rue morgue  dupin said the last words in a very low tone and very quietly just as quietly too he walked toward the door locked it and put the key in his pocket he then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it without the least flurry upon the table  the sailors face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation he started to his feet and grasped his cudgel but the next moment he fell back into his seat trembling violently and with the countenance of death itself he spoke not a word i pitied him from the bottom of my heart  my friend said dupin in a kind tone you are alarming yourself unnecessarilyyou are indeed we mean you no harm whatever i pledge you the honor of a gentleman and of a frenchman that we intend you no injury i perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities in the rue morgue it will not do however to deny that you are in some measure implicated in them from what i have already said you must know that i have had means of information about this mattermeans of which you could never have dreamed now the thing stands thus you have done nothing which you could have avoidednothing certainly which renders you culpable you were not even guilty of robbery when you might have robbed with impunity you have nothing to conceal you have no reason for concealment on the other hand you are bound by every principle of honor to confess all you know an innocent man is now imprisoned charged with that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator  the sailor had recovered his presence of mind in a great measure while dupin uttered these words but his original boldness of bearing was all gone  so help me god said he after a brief pause i will tell you all i know about this affairbut i do not expect you to believe one half i sayi would be a fool indeed if i did still i am innocent and i will make a clean breast if i die for it  what he stated was in substance this he had lately made a voyage to the indian archipelago a party of which he formed one landed at borneo and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure himself and a companion had captured the ourangoutang this companion dying the animal fell into his own exclusive possession after great trouble occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in paris where not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his neighbors he kept it carefully secluded until such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot received from a splinter on board ship his ultimate design was to sell it  returning home from some sailors frolic the night or rather in the morning of the murder he found the beast occupying his own bedroom into which it had broken from a closet adjoining where it had been as was thought securely confined razor in hand and fully lathered it was sitting before a lookingglass attempting the operation of shaving in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the keyhole of the closet terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious and so well able to use it the man for some moments was at a loss what to do he had been accustomed however to quiet the creature even in its fiercest moods by the use of a whip and to this he now resorted upon sight of it the ourangoutang sprang at once through the door of the chamber down the stairs and thence through a window unfortunately open into the street  the frenchman followed in despair the ape razor still in hand occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer until the latter had nearly come up with it it then again made off in this manner the chase continued for a long time the streets were profoundly quiet as it was nearly three oclock in the morning in passing down an alley in the rear of the rue morgue the fugitives attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of madame lespanayes chamber in the fourth story of her house rushing to the building it perceived the lightning rod clambered up with inconceivable agility grasped the shutter which was thrown fully back against the wall and by its means swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed the whole feat did not occupy a minute the shutter was kicked open again by the ourangoutang as it entered the room  the sailor in the meantime was both rejoiced and perplexed he had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured except by the rod where it might be intercepted as it came down on the other hand there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house this latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive a lightning rod is ascended without difficulty especially by a sailor but when he had arrived as high as the window which lay far to his left his career was stopped the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room at this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night which had startled from slumber the inmates of the rue morgue madame lespanaye and her daughter habited in their night clothes had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned which had been wheeled into the middle of the room it was open and its contents lay beside it on the floor the victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window and from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived the flappingto of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind  as the sailor looked in the gigantic animal had seized madame lespanaye by the hair which was loose as she had been combing it and was flourishing the razor about her face in imitation of the motions of a barber the daughter lay prostrate and motionless she had swooned the screams and struggles of the old lady during which the hair was torn from her head had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the ourangoutang into those of wrath with one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body the sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy gnashing its teeth and flashing fire from its eyes it flew upon the body of the girl and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat retaining its grasp until she expired its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed over which the face of its master rigid with horror was just discernible the fury of the beast who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip was instantly converted into fear conscious of having deserved punishment it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved and dragging the bed from the bedstead in conclusion it seized first the corpse of the daughter and thrust it up the chimney as it was found then that of the old lady which it immediately hurled through the window headlong  as the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden the sailor shrank aghast to the rod and rather gliding than clambering down it hurried at once homedreading the consequences of the butchery and gladly abandoning in his terror all solicitude about the fate of the ourangoutang the words heard by the party upon the staircase were the frenchmans exclamations of horror and affright commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the brute  i have scarcely anything to add the ourangoutang must have escaped from the chamber by the rod just before the break of the door it must have closed the window as it passed through it it was subsequently caught by the owner himself who obtained for it a very large sum at the jardin des plantes le don was instantly released upon our narration of the circumstances with some comments from dupin at the bureau of the prefect of police this functionary however well disposed to my friend could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two about the propriety of every person minding his own business  let him talk said dupin who had not thought it necessary to reply let him discourse it will ease his conscience i am satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle nevertheless that he failed in the solution of this mystery is by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it for in truth our friend the prefect is somewhat too cunning to be profound in his wisdom is no stamen it is all head and no body like the pictures of the goddess lavernaor at best all head and shoulders like a codfish but he is a good creature after all i like him especially for one master stroke of cant by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity i mean the way he has de nier ce qui est et

 novalis 2 moral ansichten  there are few persons even among the calmest thinkers who have not occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling halfcredence in the supernatural by coincidences of so seemingly marvellous a character that as mere coincidences the intellect has been unable to receive them such sentimentsfor the halfcredences of which i speak have never the full force of thoughtsuch sentiments are seldom thoroughly stifled unless by reference to the doctrine of chance or as it is technically termed the calculus of probabilities now this calculus is in its essence purely mathematical and thus we have the anomaly of the most rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and spirituality of the most intangible in speculation  the extraordinary details which i am now called upon to make public will be found to form as regards sequence of time the primary branch of a series of scarcely intelligible coincidences whose secondary or concluding branch will be recognized by all readers in the late murder of mary cecila rogers at new york  when in an article entitled the murders in the rue morgue i endeavored about a year ago to depict some very remarkable features in the mental character of my friend the chevalier c auguste dupin it did not occur to me that i should ever resume the subject this depicting of character constituted my design and this design was thoroughly fulfilled in the wild train of circumstances brought to instance dupins idiosyncrasy i might have adduced other examples but i should have proven no more late events however in their surprising development have startled me into some farther details which will carry with them the air of extorted confession hearing what i have lately heard it would be indeed strange should i remain silent in regard to what i both heard and saw so long ago  upon the winding up of the tragedy involved in the deaths of madame lespanaye and her daughter the chevalier dismissed the affair at once from his attention and relapsed into his old habits of moody reverie prone at all times to abstraction i readily fell in with his humor and continuing to occupy our chambers in the faubourg saint germain we gave the future to the winds and slumbered tranquilly in the present weaving the dull world around us into dreams  but these dreams were not altogether uninterrupted it may readily be supposed that the part played by my friend in the drama at the rue morgue had not failed of its impression upon the fancies of the parisian police with its emissaries the name of dupin had grown into a household word the simple character of those inductions by which he had disentangled the mystery never having been explained even to the prefect or to any other individual than myself of course it is not surprising that the affair was regarded as little less than miraculous or that the chevaliers analytical abilities acquired for him the credit of intuition his frankness would have led him to disabuse every inquirer of such prejudice but his indolent humor forbade all farther agitation of a topic whose interest to himself had long ceased it thus happened that he found himself the cynosure of the political eyes and the cases were not few in which attempt was made to engage his services at the prefecture one of the most remarkable instances was that of the murder of a young girl named marie rogÃªt  this event occurred about two years after the atrocity in the rue morgue marie whose christian and family name will at once arrest attention from their resemblance to those of the unfortunate cigargirl was the only daughter of the widow estelle rogÃªt the father had died during the childs infancy and from the period of his death until within eighteen months before the assassination which forms the subject of our narrative the mother and daughter had dwelt together in the rue pavÃ©e saint andrÃ©e 3 madame there keeping a pension assisted by marie affairs went on thus until the latter had attained her twentysecond year when her great beauty attracted the notice of a perfumer who occupied one of the shops in the basement of the palais royal and whose custom lay chiefly among the desperate adventurers infesting that neighborhood monsieur le blanc 4 was not unaware of the advantages to be derived from the attendance of the fair marie in his perfumery and his liberal proposals were accepted eagerly by the girl although with somewhat more of hesitation by madame  the anticipations of the shopkeeper were realized and his rooms soon became notorious through the charms of the sprightly grisette she had been in his employ about a year when her admirers were thrown info confusion by her sudden disappearance from the shop monsieur le blanc was unable to account for her absence and madame rogÃªt was distracted with anxiety and terror the public papers immediately took up the theme and the police were upon the point of making serious investigations when one fine morning after the lapse of a week marie in good health but with a somewhat saddened air made her reappearance at her usual counter in the perfumery all inquiry except that of a private character was of course immediately hushed monsieur le blanc professed total ignorance as before marie with madame replied to all questions that the last week had been spent at the house of a relation in the country thus the affair died away and was generally forgotten for the girl ostensibly to relieve herself from the impertinence of curiosity soon bade a final adieu to the perfumer and sought the shelter of her mothers residence in the rue pavÃ©e saint andrÃ©e  it was about five months after this return home that her friends were alarmed by her sudden disappearance for the second time three days elapsed and nothing was heard of her on the fourth her corpse was found floating in the seine  near the shore which is opposite the quartier of the rue saint andree and at a point not very far distant from the secluded neighborhood of the barriÃ¨re du roule 6  the atrocity of this murder for it was at once evident that murder had been committed the youth and beauty of the victim and above all her previous notoriety conspired to produce intense excitement in the minds of the sensitive parisians i can call to mind no similar occurrence producing so general and so intense an effect for several weeks in the discussion of this one absorbing theme even the momentous political topics of the day were forgotten the prefect made unusual exertions and the powers of the whole parisian police were of course tasked to the utmost extent  upon the first discovery of the corpse it was not supposed that the murderer would be able to elude for more than a very brief period the inquisition which was immediately set on foot it was not until the expiration of a week that it was deemed necessary to offer a reward and even then this reward was limited to a thousand francs in the mean time the investigation proceeded with vigor if not always with judgment and numerous individuals were examined to no purpose while owing to the continual absence of all clue to the mystery the popular excitement greatly increased at the end of the tenth day it was thought advisable to double the sum originally proposed and at length the second week having elapsed without leading to any discoveries and the prejudice which always exists in paris against the police having given vent to itself in several serious Ã©meutes the prefect took it upon himself to offer the sum of twenty thousand francs for the conviction of the assassin or if more than one should prove to have been implicated for the conviction of any one of the assassins in the proclamation setting forth this reward a full pardon was promised to any accomplice who should come forward in evidence against his fellow and to the whole was appended wherever it appeared the private placard of a committee of citizens offering ten thousand francs in addition to the amount proposed by the prefecture the entire reward thus stood at no less than thirty thousand francs which will be regarded as an extraordinary sum when we consider the humble condition of the girl and the great frequency in large cities of such atrocities as the one described  no one doubted now that the mystery of this murder would be immediately brought to light but although in one or two instances arrests were made which promised elucidation yet nothing was elicited which could implicate the parties suspected and they were discharged forthwith strange as it may appear the third week from the discovery of the body had passed and passed without any light being thrown upon the subject before even a rumor of the events which had so agitated the public mind reached the ears of dupin and myself engaged in researches which absorbed our whole attention it had been nearly a month since either of us had gone abroad or received a visiter or more than glanced at the leading political articles in one of the daily papers the first intelligence of the murder was brought us by g  in person he called upon us early in the afternoon of the thirteenth of july 18 and remained with us until late in the night he had been piqued by the failure of all his endeavors to ferret out the assassins his reputationso he said with a peculiarly parisian airwas at stake even his honor was concerned the eyes of the public were upon him and there was really no sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for the development of the mystery he concluded a somewhat droll speech with a compliment upon what he was pleased to term the tact of dupin and made him a direct and certainly a liberal proposition the precise nature of which i do not feel myself at liberty to disclose but which has no bearing upon the proper subject of my narrative  the compliment my friend rebutted as best he could but the proposition he accepted at once although its advantages were altogether provisional this point being settled the prefect broke forth at once into explanations of his own views interspersing them with long comments upon the evidence of which latter we were not yet in possession he discoursed much and beyond doubt learnedly while i hazarded an occasional suggestion as the night wore drowsily away dupin sitting steadily in his accustomed armchair was the embodiment of respectful attention he wore spectacles during the whole interview and an occasional signal glance beneath their green glasses sufficed to convince me that he slept not the less soundly because silently throughout the seven or eight leadenfooted hours which immediately preceded the departure of the prefect  in the morning i procured at the prefecture a full report of all the evidence elicited and at the various newspaper offices a copy of every paper in which from first to last had been published any decisive information in regard to this sad affair freed from all that was positively disproved this mass of information stood thus  marie rogÃªt left the residence of her mother in the rue pavÃ©e st andrÃ©e about nine oclock in the morning of sunday june the twentysecond 18 in going out she gave notice to a monsieur jacques st eustache 7 and to him only of her intent intention to spend the day with an aunt who resided in the rue des drÃ´mes the rue des drÃ´mes is a short and narrow but populous thoroughfare not far from the banks of the river and at a distance of some two miles in the most direct course possible from the pension of madame rogÃªt st eustache was the accepted suitor of marie and lodged as well as took his meals at the pension he was to have gone for his betrothed at dusk and to have escorted her home in the afternoon however it came on to rain heavily and supposing that she would remain all night at her aunts as she had done under similar circumstances before he did not think it necessary to keep his promise as night drew on madame rogÃªt who was an infirm old lady seventy years of age was heard to express a fear that she should never see marie again but this observation attracted little attention at the time  on monday it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the rue des drÃ´mes and when the day elapsed without tidings of her a tardy search was instituted at several points in the city and its environs it was not however until the fourth day from the period of disappearance that any thing satisfactory was ascertained respecting her on this day wednesday the twentyfifth of june a monsieur beauvais 8 who with a friend had been making inquiries for marie near the barriÃ¨re du roule on the shore of the seine which is opposite the rue pavÃ©e st andrÃ©e was informed that a corpse had just been towed ashore by some fishermen who had found it floating in the river upon seeing the body beauvais after some hesitation identified it as that of the perfumerygirl his friend recognized it more promptly  the face was suffused with dark blood some of which issued from the mouth no foam was seen as in the case of the merely drowned there was no discoloration in the cellular tissue about the throat were bruises and impressions of fingers the arms were bent over on the chest and were rigid the right hand was clenched the left partially open on the left wrist were two circular excoriations apparently the effect of ropes or of a rope in more than one volution a part of the right wrist also was much chafed as well as the back throughout its extent but more especially at the shoulderblades in bringing the body to the shore the fishermen had attached to it a rope but none of the excoriations had been effected by this the flesh of the neck was much swollen there were no cuts apparent or bruises which appeared the effect of blows a piece of lace was found tied so tightly around the neck as to be hidden from sight it was completely buried in the flesh and was fasted by a knot which lay just under the left ear this alone would have sufficed to produce death the medical testimony spoke confidently of the virtuous character of the deceased she had been subjected it said to brutal violence the corpse was in such condition when found that there could have been no difficulty in its recognition by friends  the dress was much torn and otherwise disordered in the outer garment a slip about a foot wide had been torn upward from the bottom hem to the waist but not torn off it was wound three times around the waist and secured by a sort of hitch in the back the dress immediately beneath the frock was of fine muslin and from this a slip eighteen inches wide had been torn entirely outtorn very evenly and with great care it was found around her neck fitting loosely and secured with a hard knot over this muslin slip and the slip of lace the strings of a bonnet were attached the bonnet being appended the knot by which the strings of the bonnet were fastened was not a ladys but a slip or sailors knot  after the recognition of the corpse it was not as usual taken to the morgue this formality being superfluous but hastily interred not far front the spot at which it was brought ashore through the exertions of beauvais the matter was industriously hushed up as far as possible and several days had elapsed before any public emotion resulted a weekly paper 9 however at length took up the theme the corpse was disinterred and a reexamination instituted but nothing was elicited beyond what has been already noted the clothes however were now submitted to the mother and friends of the deceased and fully identified as those worn by the girl upon leaving home  meantime the excitement increased hourly several individuals were arrested and discharged st eustache fell especially under suspicion and he failed at first to give an intelligible account of his whereabouts during the sunday on which marie left home subsequently however he submitted to monsieur g affidavits accounting satisfactorily for every hour of the day in question as time passed and no discovery ensued a thousand contradictory rumors were circulated and journalists busied themselves in suggestions among these the one which attracted the most notice was the idea that marie rogÃªt still livedthat the corpse found in the seine was that of some other unfortunate it will be proper that i submit to the reader some passages which embody the suggestion alluded to these passages are literal translations from letoile 10 a paper conducted in general with much ability  mademoiselle rogÃªt left her mothers house on sunday morning june the twentysecond 18 with the ostensible purpose of going to see her aunt or some other connexion in the rue des drÃ´mes from that hour nobody is proved to have seen her there is no trace or tidings of her at all there has no person whatever come forward so far who saw her at all on that day after she left her mothers door now though we have no evidence that marie rogÃªt was in the land of the living after nine oclock on sunday june the twentysecond we have proof that up to that hour she was alive on wednesday noon at twelve a female body was discovered afloat on the shore of the barriÃ¨re de roule this was even if we presume that marie rogÃªt was thrown into the river within three hours after she left her mothers house only three days from the time she left her homethree days to an hour but it is folly to suppose that the murder if murder was committed on her body could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight those who are guilty of such horrid crimes choose darkness rather the light thus we see that if the body found in the river was that of marie rogÃªt it could only have been in the water two and a half days or three at the outside all experience has shown that drowned bodies or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence require from six to ten days for decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water even where a cannon is fired over a corpse and it rises before at least five or six days immersion it sinks again if let alone now we ask what was there in this cave to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature if the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until tuesday night some trace would be found on shore of the murderers it is a doubtful point also whether the body would be so soon afloat even were it thrown in after having been dead two days and furthermore it is exceedingly improbable that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed would have throw the body in without weight to sink it when such a precaution could have so easily been taken  the editor here proceeds to argue that the body must have been in the water not three days merely but at least five times three days because it was so far decomposed that beauvais had great difficulty in recognizing it this latter point however was fully disproved i continue the translation  what then are the facts on which m beauvais says that he has no doubt the body was that of marie rogÃªt he ripped up the gown sleeve and says he found marks which satisfied him of the identity the public generally supposed those marks to have consisted of some description of scars he rubbed the arm and found hair upon itsomething as indefinite we think as can readily be imaginedas little conclusive as finding an arm in the sleeve m beauvais did not return that night but sent word to madame rogÃªt at seven oclock on wednesday evening that an investigation was still in progress respecting her daughter if we allow that madame rogÃªt from her age and grief could not go over which is allowing a great deal there certainly must have been some one who would have thought it worth while to go over and attend the investigation if they thought the body was that of marie nobody went over there was nothing said or heard about the matter in the rue pavÃ©e st andrÃ©e that reached even the occupants of the same building m st eustache the lover and intended husband of marie who boarded in her mothers house deposes that he did not hear of the discovery of the body of his intended until the next morning when m beauvais came into his chamber and told him of it for an item of news like this it strikes us it was very coolly received  in this way the journal endeavored to create the impression of an apathy on the part of the relatives of marie inconsistent with the supposition that these relatives believed the corpse to be hers its insinuations amount to thisthat marie with the connivance of her friends had absented herself from the city for reasons involving a charge against her chastity and that these friends upon the discovery of a corpse in the seine somewhat resembling that of the girl had availed themselves of the opportunity to impress press the public with the belief of her death but letoile was again overhasty it was distinctly proved that no apathy such as was imagined existed that the old lady was exceedingly feeble and so agitated as to be unable to attend to any duty that st eustache so far from receiving the news coolly was distracted with grief and bore himself so frantically that m beauvais prevailed upon a friend and relative to take charge of him and prevent his attending the examination at the disinterment moreover although it was stated by letoile that the corpse was reinterred at the public expensethat an advantageous offer of private sculpture was absolutely declined by the familyand that no member of the family attended the ceremonialalthough i say all this was asserted by letoile in furtherance of the impression it designed to conveyyet all this was satisfactorily disproved in a subsequent number of the paper an attempt was made to throw suspicion upon beauvais himself the editor says  now then a change comes over the matter we are told that on one occasion while a madame b was at madame rogÃªts house m beauvais who was going out told her that a gendarme was expected there and she madame b must not say anything to the gendarme until he returned but let the matter be for him in the present posture of affairs m beauvais appears to have the whole matter looked up in his head a single step cannot be taken without m beauvais for go which way you will you run against him for some reason he determined that nobody shall have any thing to do with the proceedings but himself and he has elbowed the male relatives out of the way according to their representations in a very singular manner he seems to have been very much averse to permitting the relatives to see the body  by the following fact some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown upon beauvais a visiter at his office a few days prior to the girls disappearance and during the absence of its occupant had observed a rose in the keyhole of the door and the name marie inscribed upon a slate which hung near at hand  the general impression so far as we were enabled to glean it from the newspapers seemed to be that marie had been the victim of a gang of desperadoesthat by these she had been borne across the river maltreated and murdered le commerciel 11 however a print of extensive influence was earnest in combating this popular idea i quote a passage or two from its columns  we are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been on a false scent so far as it has been directed to the barriÃ¨re du roule it is impossible that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was should have passed three blocks without some one having seen her and any one who saw her would have remembered it for she interested all who knew her it was when the streets were full of people when she went out it is impossible that she could have gone to the barriÃ¨re du roule or to the rue des drÃ´mes without being recognized by a dozen persons yet no one has come forward who saw her outside of her mothers door and there is no evidence except the testimony concerning her expressed intentions that she did go out at all her gown was torn bound round her and tied and by that the body was carried as a bundle if the murder had been committed at the barriÃ¨re du roule there would have been no necessity for any such arrangement the fact that the body was found floating near the barriÃ¨re is no proof as to where it was thrown into the water a piece of one of the unfortunate girls petticoats two feet long and one foot wide was torn out and tied under her chin around the back of her head probably to prevent screams this was done by fellows who had no pockethandkerchief  a day or two before the prefect called upon us however some important information reached the police which seemed to overthrow at least the chief portion of le commerciels argument two small boys sons of a madame deluc while roaming among the woods near the barriÃ¨re du roule chanced to penetrate a close thicket within which were three or four large stones forming a kind of seat with a back and footstool on the upper stone lay a white petticoat on the second a silk scarf a parasol gloves and a pockethandkerchief were also here found the handkerchief bore the name marie rogÃªt fragments of dress were discovered on the brambles around the earth was trampled the bushes were broken and there was every evidence of a struggle between the thicket and the river the fences were found taken down and the ground bore evidence of some heavy burthen having been dragged along it  a weekly paper le soleil12 had the following comments upon this discoverycomments which merely echoed the sentiment of the whole parisian press  the things had all evidently been there at least three or four weeks they were all mildewed down hard with the action of the rain and stuck together from mildew the grass had grown around and over some of them the silk on the parasol was strong but the threads of it were run together within the upper part where it had been doubled and folded was all mildewed and rotten and tore on its being opened the pieces of her frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long one part was the hem of the frock and it had been mended the other piece was part of the skirt not the hem they looked like strips torn off and were on the thorn bush about a foot from the ground there can be no doubt therefore that the spot of this appalling outrage has been discovered  consequent upon this discovery new evidence appeared madame deluc testified that she keeps a roadside inn not far from the bank of the river opposite the barriÃ¨re du roule the neighborhood is secludedparticularly so it is the usual sunday resort of blackguards from the city who cross the river in boats about three oclock in the afternoon of the sunday in question a young girl arrived at the inn accompanied by a young man of dark complexion the two remained here for some time on their departure they took the road to some thick woods in the vicinity madame delucs attention was called to the dress worn by the girl on account of its resemblance to one worn by a deceased relative a scarf was particularly noticed soon after the departure of the couple a gang of miscreants made their appearance behaved boisterously ate and drank without making payment followed in the route of the young man and girl returned to the inn about dusk and recrossed the river as if in great haste  it was soon after dark upon this same evening that madame deluc as well as her eldest son heard the screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn the screams were violent but brief madame d recognized not only the scarf which was found in the thicket but the dress which was discovered upon the corpse an omnibus driver valence 13 now also testified that he saw marie rogÃªt cross a ferry on the seine on the sunday in question in company with a young man of dark complexion he valence knew marie and could not be mistaken in her identity the articles found in the thicket were fully identified by the relatives of marie  the items of evidence and information thus collected by myself from the newspapers at the suggestion of dupin embraced only one more pointbut this was a point of seemingly vast consequence it appears that immediately after the discovery of the clothes as above described the lifeless or nearly lifeless body of st eustache maries betrothed was found in the vicinity of what all now supposed the scene of the outrage a phial labelled laudanum and emptied was found near him his breath gave evidence of the poison he died without speaking upon his person was found a letter briefly stating his love for marie with his design of selfdestruction  i need scarcely tell you said dupin as he finished the perusal of my notes that this is a far more intricate case than that of the rue morgue from which it differs in one important respect this is an ordinary although an atrocious instance of crime there is nothing peculiarly outrÃ© about it you will observe that for this reason the mystery has been considered easy when for this reason it should have been considered difficult of solution thus at first it was thought unnecessary to offer a reward the myrmidons of g were able at once to comprehend how and why such an atrocity might have been committed they could picture to their imaginations a modemany modesand a motivemany motives and because it was not impossible that either of these numerous modes and motives could have been the actual one they have taken it for granted that one of them must but the case with which these variable fancies were entertained and the very plausibility which each assumed should have been understood as indicative rather of the difficulties than of the facilities which must attend elucidation i have before observed that it is by prominences above the plane of the ordinary that reason feels her way if at all in her search for the true and that the proper question in cases such as this is not so much what has occurred as what has occurred that has never occurred before in the investigations at the house of madame lespanaye 14 the agents of g were discouraged and confounded by that very unusualness which to a properly regulated intellect would have afforded the surest omen of success while this same intellect might have been plunged in despair at the ordinary character of all that met the eye in the case of the perfumerygirl and yet told of nothing but easy triumph to the functionaries of the prefecture  in the case of madame lespanaye and her daughter there was even at the beginning of our investigation no doubt that murder had been committed the idea of suicide was excluded at once here too we are freed at the commencement from all supposition of selfmurder the body found at the barriÃ¨re du roule was found under such circumstances as to leave us no room for embarrassment upon this important point but it has been suggested that the corpse discovered is not that of the marie rogÃªt for the conviction of whose assassin or assassins the reward is offered and respecting whom solely our agreement has been arranged with the prefect we both know this gentleman well it will not do to trust him too far if dating our inquiries from the body found and thence tracing a murderer we yet discover this body to be that of some other individual than marie or if starting from the living marie we find her yet find her unassassinatedin either case we lose our labor since it is monsieur g with whom we have to deal for our own purpose therefore if not for the purpose of justice it is indispensable that our first step should be the determination of the identity of the corpse with the marie rogÃªt who is missing  with the public the arguments of letoile have had weight and that the journal itself is convinced of their importance would appear from the manner in which it commences one of its essays upon the subjectseveral of the morning papers of the day it says speak of the conclusive article in mondays etoile to me this article appears conclusive of little beyond the zeal of its inditer we should bear in mind that in general it is the object of our newspapers rather to create a sensationto make a pointthan to further the cause of truth the latter end is only pursued when it seems coincident with the former the print which merely falls in with ordinary opinion however well founded this opinion may be earns for itself no credit with the mob the mass of the people regard as profound only him who suggests pungent contradictions of the general idea in ratiocination not less than in literature it is the epigram which is the most immediately and the most universally appreciated in both it is of the lowest order of merit  what i mean to say is that it is the mingled epigram and melodrame of the idea that marie rogÃªt still lives rather than any true plausibility in this idea which have suggested it to letoile and secured it a favorable reception with the public let us examine the heads of this journals argument endeavoring to avoid the incoherence with which it is originally set forth  the first aim of the writer is to show from the brevity of the interval between maries disappearance and the finding of the floating corpse that this corpse cannot be that of marie the reduction of this interval to its smallest possible dimension becomes thus at once an object with the reasoner in the rash pursuit of this object he rushes into mere assumption at the outset it is folly to suppose he says that the murder if murder was committed on her body could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight we demand at once and very naturally why why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed within five minutes after the girls quitting her mothers house why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed at any given period of the day there have been assassinations at all hours but had the murder taken place at any moment between nine oclock in the morning of sunday and a quarter before midnight there would still have been time enough to throw the body into the river before midnight this assumption then amounts precisely to thisthat the murder was not committed on sunday at alland if we allow letoile to assume this we may permit it any liberties whatever the paragraph beginning it is folly to suppose that the murder etc however it appears as printed in letoile may be imagined to have existed actually thus in the brain of its inditerit is folly to suppose that the murder if murder was committed on the body could have been committed soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight it is folly we say to suppose all this and to suppose at the same time as we are resolved to suppose that the body was not thrown in until after midnighta sentence sufficiently inconsequential in itself but not so utterly preposterous as the one printed  were it my purpose continued dupin merely to make out a case against this passage of letoiles argument i might safely leave it where it is it is not however with letoile that we have to do but with the truth the sentence in question has but one meaning as it stands and this meaning i have fairly stated but it is material that we go behind the mere words for an idea which these words have obviously intended and failed to convey it was the design of the journalist to say that at whatever period of the day or night of sunday this murder was committed it was improbable that the assassins would have ventured to bear the corpse to the river before midnight and herein lies really the assumption of which i complain it is assumed that the murder was committed at such a position and under such circumstances that the bearing it to the river became necessary now the assassination might have taken place upon the rivers brink or on the river itself and thus the throwing the corpse in the water might have been resorted to at any period of the day or night as the most obvious and most immediate mode of disposal you will understand that i suggest nothing here as probable or as cÃ¶incident with my own opinion my design so far has no reference to the facts of the case i wish merely to caution you against the whole tone of letoiles suggestion by calling your attention to its ex parte character at the outset  having prescribed thus a limit to suit its own preconceived notions having assumed that if this were the body of marie it could have been in the water but a very brief time the journal goes on to say  all experience has shown that drowned bodies or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water even when a cannon is fired over a corpse and it rises before at least five or six days immersion it sinks again if let alone  these assertions have been tacitly received by every paper in paris with the exception of le moniteur 15 this latter print endeavors to combat that portion of the paragraph which has reference to drowned bodies only by citing some five or six instances in which the bodies of individuals known to be drowned were found floating after the lapse of less time than is insisted upon by letoile but there is something excessively unphilosophical in the attempt on the part of le moniteur to rebut the general assertion of letoile by a citation of particular instances militating against that assertion had it been possible to adduce fifty instead of five examples of bodies found floating at the end of two or three days these fifty examples could still have been properly regarded only as exceptions to letoiles rule until such time as the rule itself should be confuted admitting the rule and this le moniteur does not deny insisting merely upon its exceptions the argument of letoile is suffered to remain in full force for this argument does not pretend to involve more than a question of the probability of the body having risen to the surface in less than three days and this probability will be in favor of letoiles position until the instances so childishly adduced shall be sufficient in number to establish an antagonistical rule  you will see at once that all argument upon this head should be urged if at all against the rule itself and for this end we must examine the rationale of the rule now the human body in general is neither much lighter nor much heavier than the water of the seine that is to say the specific gravity of the human body in its natural condition is about equal to the bulk of fresh water which it displaces the bodies of fat and fleshy persons with small bones and of women generally are lighter than those of the lean and largeboned and of men and the specific gravity of the water of a river is somewhat influenced by the presence of the tide from sea but leaving this tide out of question it may be said that very few human bodies will sink at all even in fresh water of their own accord almost any one falling into a river will be enabled to float if he suffer the specific gravity of the water fairly to be adduced in comparison with his ownthat is to say if he suffer his whole person to be immersed with as little exception as possible the proper position for one who cannot swim is the upright position of the walker on land with the head thrown fully back and immersed the mouth and nostrils alone remaining above the surface thus circumstanced we shall find that we float without difficulty and without exertion it is evident however that the gravities of the body and of the bulk of water displaced are very nicely balanced and that a trifle will cause either to preponderate an arm for instance uplifted from the water and thus deprived of its support is an additional weight sufficient to immerse the whole head while the accidental aid of the smallest piece of timber will enable us to elevate the head so as to look about now in the struggles of one unused to swimming the arms are invariably thrown upwards while an attempt is made to keep the head in its usual perpendicular position the result is the immersion of the mouth and nostrils and the inception during efforts to breathe while beneath the surface of water into the lungs much is also received into the stomach and the whole body becomes heavier by the difference between the weight of the air originally distending these cavities and that of the fluid which now fills them this difference is sufficient to cause the body to sink as a general rule but is insufficient in the cases of individuals with small bones and an abnormal quantity of flaccid or fatty matter such individuals float even after drowning  the corpse being supposed at the bottom of the river will there remain until by some means its specific gravity again becomes less than that of the bulk of water which it displaces this effect is brought about by decomposition or otherwise the result of decomposition is the generation of gas distending the cellular tissues and all the cavities and giving the puffed appearance which is so horrible when this distension has so far progressed that the bulk of the corpse is materially increased without a corresponding increase of mass or weight its specific gravity becomes less than that of the water displaced and it forthwith makes its appearance at the surface but decomposition is modified by innumerable circumstancesis hastened or retarded by innumerable agencies for example by the heat or cold of the season by the mineral impregnation or purity of the water by its depth or shallowness by its currency or stagnation by the temperament of the body by its infection or freedom from disease before death thus it is evident that we can assign no period with any thing like accuracy at which the corpse shall rise through decomposition under certain conditions this result would be brought about within an hour under others it might not take place at all there are chemical infusions by which the animal frame can be preserved forever from corruption the bichloride of mercury is one but apart from decomposition there may be and very usually is a generation of gas within the stomach from the acetous fermentation of vegetable matter or within other cavities from other causes sufficient to induce a distension which will bring the body to the surface the effect produced by the firing of a cannon is that of simple vibration this may either loosen the corpse from the soft mud or ooze in which it is imbedded thus permitting it to rise when other agencies have already prepared it for so doing or it may overcome the tenacity of some putrescent portions of the cellular tissue allowing the cavities to distend under the influence of the gas  having thus before us the whole philosophy of this subject we can easily test by it the assertions of letoile all experience shows says this paper that drowned bodies or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water even when a cannon is fired over a corpse and it rises before at least five or six days immersion it sinks again if let alone  the whole of this paragraph must now appear a tissue of inconsequence and incoherence all experience does not show that drowned bodies require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the surface both science and experience show that the period of their rising is and necessarily must be indeterminate if moreover a body has risen to the surface through firing of cannon it will not sink again if let alone until decomposition has so far progressed as to permit the escape of the generated gas but i wish to call your attention to the distinction which is made between drowned bodies and bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence although the writer admits the distinction he yet includes them all in the same category i have shown how it is that the body of a drowning man becomes specifically heavier than its bulk of water and that he would not sink at all except for the struggles by which he elevates his arms above the surface and his gasps for breath while beneath the surfacegasps which supply by water the place of the original air in the lungs but these struggles and these gasps would not occur in the body thrown into the water immediately after death by violence thus in the latter instance the body as a general rule would not sink at alla fact of which letoile is evidently ignorant when decomposition had proceeded to a very great extentwhen the flesh had in a great measure left the bonesthen indeed but not till then should we lose sight of the corpse  and now what are we to make of the argument that the body found could not be that of marie rogÃªt because three days only having elapsed this body was found floating if drowned being a woman she might never have sunk or having sunk might have reappeared in twentyfour hours or less but no one supposes her to have been drowned and dying before being thrown into the river she might have been found floating at any period afterwards whatever  but says letoile if the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until tuesday night some trace would be found on shore of the murderers here it is at first difficult to perceive the intention of the reasoner he means to anticipate what he imagines would be an objection to his theoryviz that the body was kept on shore two days suffering rapid decompositionmore rapid than if immersed in water he supposes that had this been the case it might have appeared at the surface on the wednesday and thinks that only under such circumstances it could so have appeared he is accordingly in haste to show that it was not kept on shore for if so some trace would be found on shore of the murderers i presume you smile at the sequitur you cannot be made to see how the mere duration of the corpse on the shore could operate to multiply traces of the assassins nor can i  and furthermore it is exceedingly improbable continues our journal that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it when such a precaution could have so easily been taken observe here the laughable confusion of thought no onenot even letoiledisputes the murder committed on the body found the marks of violence are too obvious it is our reasoners object merely to show that this body is not maries he wishes to prove that marie is not assassinatednot that the corpse was not yet his observation proves only the latter point here is a corpse without weight attached murderers casting it in would not have failed to attach a weight therefore it was not thrown in by murderers this is all which is proved if any thing is the question of identity is not even approached and letoile has been at great pains merely to gainsay now what it has admitted only a moment before we are perfectly convinced it says that the body found was that of a murdered female  nor is this the sole instance even in this division of his subject where our reasoner unwittingly reasons against himself his evident object i have already said is to reduce us much as possible the interval between maries disappearance and the finding of the corpse yet we find him urging the point that no person saw the girl from the moment of her leaving her mothers house we have no evidence he says that marie rogÃªt was in the land of the living after nine oclock on sunday june the twentysecond as his argument is obviously an ex parte one he should at least have left this matter out of sight for had any one been known to see marie say on monday or on tuesday the interval in question would have been much reduced and by his own ratiocination the probability much diminished of the corpse being that of the grisette it is nevertheless amusing to observe that letoile insists upon its point in the full belief of its furthering its general argument  reperuse now that portion of this argument which has reference to the identification of the corpse by beauvais in regard to the hair upon the arm letoile has been obviously disingenuous m beauvais not being an idiot could never have urged in identification of the corpse simply hair upon its arm no arm is without hair the generality of the expression of letoile is a mere perversion of the witness phraseology he must have spoken of some peculiarity in this hair it must have been a peculiarity of color of quantity of length or of situation  her foot says the journal was smallso are thousands of feet her garter is no proof whatevernor is her shoefor shoes and garters are sold in packages the same may be said of the flowers in her hat one thing upon which m beauvais strongly insists is that the clasp on the garter found had been set back to take it in this amounts to nothing for most women find it proper to take a pair of garters home and fit them to the size of the limbs they are to encircle rather than to try them in the store where they purchase here it is difficult to suppose the reasoner in earnest had m beauvais in his search for the body of marie discovered a corpse corresponding in general size and appearance to the missing girl he would have been warranted without reference to the question of habiliment at all in forming an opinion that his search had been successful if in addition to the point of general size and contour he had found upon the arm a peculiar hairy appearance which he had observed upon the living marie his opinion might have been justly strengthened and the increase of positiveness might well have been in the ratio of the peculiarity or unusualness of the hairy mark if the feet of marie being small those of the corpse were also small the increase of probability that the body was that of marie would not be an increase in a ratio merely arithmetical but in one highly geometrical or accumulative add to all this shoes such as she had been known to wear upon the day of her disappearance and although these shoes may be sold in packages you so far augment the probability as to verge upon the certain what of itself would be no evidence of identity becomes through its corroborative position proof most sure give us then flowers in the hat corresponding to those worn by the missing girl and we seek for nothing farther if only one flower we seek for nothing fartherwhat then if two or three or more each successive one is multiple evidenceproof not added to proof but multiplied by hundreds or thousands let us now discover upon the deceased garters such as the living used and it is almost folly to proceed but these garters are found to be tightened by the setting back of a clasp in just such a manner as her own had been tightened by marie shortly previous to her leaving home it is now madness or hypocrisy to doubt what letoile says in respect to this abbreviation of the garters being an usual occurrence shows nothing beyond its own pertinacity in error the elastic nature of the claspgarter is selfdemonstration of the unusualness of the abbreviation what is made to adjust itself must of necessity require foreign adjustment but rarely it must have been by an accident in its strictest sense that these garters of marie needed the tightening described they alone would have amply established her identity but it is not that the corpse was found to have the garters of the missing girl or found to have her shoes or her bonnet or the flowers of her bonnet or her feet or a peculiar mark upon the arm or her general size and appearanceit is that the corpse had each and all collectively could it be proved that the editor of letoile really entertained a doubt under the circumstances there would be no need in his case of a commission de lunatico inquirendo he has thought it sagacious to echo the small talk of the lawyers who for the most part content themselves with echoing the rectangular precepts of the courts i would here observe that very much of what is rejected as evidence by a court is the best of evidence to the intellect for the court guiding itself by the general principles of evidencethe recognized and booked principlesis averse from swerving at particular instances and this steadfast adherence to principle with rigorous disregard of the conflicting exception is a sure mode of attaining the maximum of attainable truth in any long sequence of time the practice in mass is therefore philosophical but it is not the less certain that it engenders vast individual error 16  in respect to the insinuations levelled at beauvais you will be willing to dismiss them in a breath you have already fathomed the true character of this good gentleman he is a busybody with much of romance and little of wit any one so constituted will readily so conduct himself upon occasion of real excitement as to render himself liable to suspicion on the part of the over acute or the illdisposed m beauvais as it appears from your notes had some personal interviews with the editor of letoile and offended him by venturing an opinion that the corpse notwithstanding the theory of the editor was in sober fact that of marie he persists says the paper in asserting the corpse to be that of marie but cannot give a circumstance in addition to those which we have commented upon to make others believe now without readverting to the fact that stronger evidence to make others believe could never have been adduced it may be remarked that a man may very well be understood to believe in a case of this kind without the ability to advance a single reason for the belief of a second party nothing is more vague than impressions of individual identity each man recognizes his neighbor yet there are few instances in which any one is prepared to give a reason for his recognition the editor of letoile had no right to be offended at m beauvais unreasoning belief  the suspicious circumstances which invest him will be found to tally much better with my hypothesis of romantic busybodyism than with the reasoners suggestion of guilt once adopting the more charitable interpretation we shall find no difficulty in comprehending the rose in the keyhole the marie upon the slate the elbowing the male relatives out of the way the aversion to permitting them to see the body the caution given to madame b that she must hold no conversation with the gendarme until his return beauvais and lastly his apparent determination that nobody should have anything to do with the proceedings except himself it seems to me unquestionable that beauvais was a suitor of maries that she coquetted with him and that he was ambitious of being thought to enjoy her fullest intimacy and confidence i shall say nothing more upon this point and as the evidence fully rebuts the assertion of letoile touching the matter of apathy on the part of the mother and other relativesan apathy inconsistent with the supposition of their believing the corpse to be that of the perfumerygirlwe shall now proceed as if the question of identity were settled to our perfect satisfaction  and what i here demanded do you think of the opinions of le commerciel  that in spirit they are far more worthy of attention than any which have been promulgated upon the subject the deductions from the premises are philosophical and acute but the premises in two instances at least are founded in imperfect observation le commerciel wishes to intimate that marie was seized by some gang of low ruffians not far from her mothers door it is impossible it urges that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was should have passed three blocks without some one having seen her this is the idea of a man long resident in parisa public manand one whose walks to and fro in the city have been mostly limited to the vicinity of the public offices he is aware that he seldom passes so far as a dozen blocks from his own bureau without being recognized and accosted and knowing the extent of his personal acquaintance with others and of others with him he compares his notoriety with that of the perfumerygirl finds no great difference between them and reaches at once the conclusion that she in her walks would be equally liable to recognition with himself in his this could only be the case were her walks of the same unvarying methodical character and within the same species of limited region as are his own he passes to and fro at regular intervals within a confined periphery abounding in individuals who are led to observation of his person through interest in the kindred nature of his occupation with their own but the walks of marie may in general be supposed discursive in this particular instance it will be understood as most probable that she proceeded upon a route of more than average diversity from her accustomed ones the parallel which we imagine to have existed in the mind of le commerciel would only be sustained in the event of the two individuals traversing the whole city in this case granting the personal acquaintances to be equal the chances would be also equal that an equal number of personal rencounters would be made for my own part i should hold it not only as possible but as very far more than probable that marie might have proceeded at any given period by any one of the many routes between her own residence and that of her aunt without meeting a single individual whom she knew or by whom she was known in viewing this question in its full and proper light we must hold steadily in mind the great disproportion between the personal acquaintances of even the most noted individual in paris and the entire population of paris itself  but whatever force there may still appear to be in the suggestion of le commerciel will be much diminished when we take into consideration the hour at which the girl went abroad it was when the streets were full of people says le commerciel that she went out but not so it was at nine oclock in the morning now at nine oclock of every morning in the week with the exception of sunday the streets of the city are it is true thronged with people at nine on sunday the populace are chiefly within doors preparing for church no observing person can have failed to notice the peculiarly deserted air of the town from about eight until ten on the morning of every sabbath between ten and eleven the streets are thronged but not at so early a period as that designated  there is another point at which there seems a deficiency of observation on the part of le commerciel a piece it says of one of the unfortunate girls petticoats two feet long and one foot wide was torn out and tied under her chin and around the back of her head probably to prevent screams this was done by fellows who had no pockethandkerchiefs whether this idea is or is not well founded we will endeavor to see hereafter but by fellows who have no pockethandkerchiefs the editor intends the lowest class of ruffians these however are the very description of people who will always be found to have handkerchiefs even when destitute of shirts you must have had occasion to observe how absolutely indispensable of late years to the thorough blackguard has become the pockethandkerchief  and what are we to think i asked of the article in le soleil  that it is a vast pity its inditer was not born a parrotin which case he would have been the most illustrious parrot of his race he has merely repeated the individual items of the already published opinion collecting them with a laudable industry from this paper and from that the things had all evidently been there he saysat least three or four weeks and there can be no doubt that the spot of this appalling outrage has been discovered the facts here restated by le soleil are very far indeed from removing my own doubts upon this subject and we will examine them more particularly hereafter in connexion with another division of the theme  at present we must occupy ourselves with other investigations you cannot fail to have remarked the extreme laxity of the examination of the corpse to be sure the question of identity was readily determined or should have been but there were other points to be ascertained had the body been in any respect despoiled had the deceased any articles of jewelry about her person upon leaving home if so had she any when found these are important questions utterly untouched by the evidence and there are others of equal moment which have met with no attention we must endeavor to satisfy ourselves by personal inquiry the case of st eustache must be reexamined i have no suspicion of this person but let us proceed methodically we will ascertain beyond a doubt the validity of the affidavits in regard to his whereabouts on the sunday affidavits of this character are readily made matter of mystification should there be nothing wrong here however we will dismiss st eustache from our investigations his suicide however corroborative of suspicion were there found to be deceit in the affidavits is without such deceit in no respect an unaccountable circumstance or one which need cause us to deflect from the line of ordinary analysis  in that which i now propose we will discard the interior points of this tragedy and concentrate our attention upon its outskirts not the least usual error in investigations such as this is the limiting of inquiry to the immediate with total disregard of the collateral or circumstantial events it is the malpractice of the courts to confine evidence and discussion to the bounds of apparent relevancy yet experience has shown and a true philosophy will always show that a vast perhaps the larger portion of truth arises from the seemingly irrelevant it is through the spirit of this principle if not precisely through its letter that modern science has resolved to calculate upon the unforeseen but perhaps you do not comprehend me the history of human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to collateral or incidental or accidental events we are indebted for the most numerous and most valuable discoveries that it has at length become necessary in any prospective view of improvement to make not only large but the largest allowances for inventions that shall arise by chance and quite out of the range of ordinary expectation it is no longer philosophical to base upon what has been a vision of what is to be accident is admitted as a portion of the substructure we make chance a matter of absolute calculation we subject the unlooked for and unimagined to the mathematical formulae of the schools  i repeat that it is no more than fact that the larger portion of all truth has sprung from the collateral and it is but in accordance with the spirit of the principle involved in this fact that i would divert inquiry in the present case from the trodden and hitherto unfruitful ground of the event itself to the contemporary circumstances which surround it while you ascertain the validity of the affidavits i will examine the newspapers more generally than you have as yet done so far we have only reconnoitred the field of investigation but it will be strange indeed if a comprehensive survey such as i propose of the public prints will not afford us some minute points which shall establish a direction for inquiry  in pursuance of dupins suggestion i made scrupulous examination of the affair of the affidavits the result was a firm conviction of their validity and of the consequent innocence of st eustache in the mean time my friend occupied himself with what seemed to me a minuteness altogether objectless in a scrutiny of the various newspaper files at the end of a week he placed before me the following extracts  about three years and a half ago a disturbance very similar to the present was caused by the disappearance of this same marie rogÃªt from the parfumerie of monsieur le blanc in the palais royal at the end of a week however she reappeared at her customary comptoir as well as ever with the exception of a slight paleness not altogether usual it was given out by monsieur le blanc and her mother that she had merely been on a visit to some friend in the country and the affair was speedily hushed up we presume that the present absence is a freak of the same nature and that at the expiration of a week or perhaps of a month we shall have her among us againevening papermonday june 23 17  an evening journal of yesterday refers to a former mysterious disappearance of mademoiselle rogÃªt it is well known that during the week of her absence from le blancs parfumerie she was in the company of a young naval officer much noted for his debaucheries a quarrel it is supposed providentially led to her return home we have the name of the lothario in question who is at present stationed in paris but for obvious reasons forbear to make it publicle mercurietuesday morning june 24 18  an outrage of the most atrocious character was perpetrated near this city the day before yesterday a gentleman with his wife and daughter engaged about dusk the services of six young men who were idly rowing a boat to and fro near the banks of the seine to convey him across the river upon reaching the opposite shore the three passengers stepped out and had proceeded so far as to be beyond the view of the boat when the daughter discovered that she had left in it her parasol she returned for it was seized by the gang carried out into the stream gagged brutally treated and finally taken to the shore at a point not far from that at which she had originally entered the boat with her parents the villains have escaped for the time but the police are upon their trail and some of them will soon be takenmorning paperjune 25 19  we have received one or two communications the object of which is to fasten the crime of the late atrocity upon mennais 20 but as this gentleman has been fully exonerated by a loyal inquiry and as the arguments of our several correspondents appear to be more zealous than profound we do not think it advisable to make them publicmorning paperjune 28 21  we have received several forcibly written communications apparently from various sources and which go far to render it a matter of certainty that the unfortunate marie rogÃªt has become a victim of one of the numerous bands of blackguards which infest the vicinity of the city upon sunday our own opinion is decidedly in favor of this supposition we shall endeavor to make room for some of these arguments hereafterevening papertuesday june 31 22  on monday one of the bargemen connected with the revenue service saw a empty boat floating down the seine sails were lying in the bottom of the boat the bargeman towed it under the barge office the next morning it was taken from thence without the knowledge of any of the officers the rudder is now at the barge officele diligencethursday june 26  upon reading these various extracts they not only seemed to me irrelevant but i could perceive no mode in which any one of them could be brought to bear upon the matter in hand i waited for some explanation from dupin  it is not my present design he said to dwell upon the first and second of those extracts i have copied them chiefly to show you the extreme remissness of the police who as far as i can understand from the prefect have not troubled themselves in any respect with an examination of the naval officer alluded to yet it is mere folly to say that between the first and second disappearance of marie there is no supposable connection let us admit the first elopement to have resulted in a quarrel between the lovers and the return home of the betrayed we are now prepared to view a second elopement if we know that an elopement has again taken place as indicating a renewal of the betrayers advances rather than as the result of new proposals by a second individualwe are prepared to regard it as a making up of the old amour rather than as the commencement of a new one the chances are ten to one that he who had once eloped with marie would again propose an elopement rather than that she to whom proposals of elopement had been made by one individual should have them made to her by another and here let me call your attention to the fact that the time elapsing between the first ascertained and the second supposed elopement is a few months more than the general period of the cruises of our menofwar had the lover been interrupted in his first villany by the necessity of departure to sea and had he seized the first moment of his return to renew the base designs not yet altogether accomplishedor not yet altogether accomplished by him of all these things we know nothing  you will say however that in the second instance there was no elopement as imagined certainly notbut are we prepared to say that there was not the frustrated design beyond st eustache and perhaps beauvais we find no recognized no open no honorable suitors of marie of none other is there any thing said who then is the secret lover of whom the relatives at least most of them know nothing but whom marie meets upon the morning of sunday and who is so deeply in her confidence that she hesitates not to remain with him until the shades of the evening descend amid the solitary groves of the barriÃ¨re du roule who is that secret lover i ask of whom at least most of the relatives know nothing and what means the singular prophecy of madame rogÃªt on the morning of maries departurei fear that i shall never see marie again  but if we cannot imagine madame rogÃªt privy to the design of elopement may we not at least suppose this design entertained by the girl upon quitting home she gave it to be understood that she was about to visit her aunt in the rue des drÃ´mes and st eustache was requested to call for her at dark now at first glance this fact strongly militates against my suggestionbut let us reflect that she did meet some companion and proceed with him across the river reaching the barriÃ¨re du roule at so late an hour as three oclock in the afternoon is known but in consenting so to accompany this individual for whatever purposeto her mother known or unknown she must have thought of her expressed intention when leaving home and of the surprise and suspicion aroused in the bosom of her affianced suitor st eustache when calling for her at the hour appointed in the rue des drÃ´mes he should find that she had not been there and when moreover upon returning to the pension with this alarming intelligence he should become aware of her continued absence from home she must have thought of these things i say she must have foreseen the chagrin of st eustache the suspicion of all she could not have thought of returning to brave this suspicion but the suspicion becomes a point of trivial importance to her if we suppose her not intending to return  we may imagine her thinking thusi am to meet a certain person for the purpose of elopement or for certain other purposes known only to myself it is necessary that there be no chance of interruptionthere must be sufficient time given us to elude pursuiti will give it to be understood that i shall visit and spend the day with my aunt at the rue des drÃ´mesi well tell st eustache not to call for me until darkin this way my absence from home for the longest possible period without causing suspicion or anxiety will be accounted for and i shall gain more time than in any other manner if i bid st eustache call for me at dark he will be sure not to call before but if i wholly neglect to bid him call my time for escape will be diminished since it will be expected that i return the earlier and my absence will the sooner excite anxiety now if it were my design to return at allif i had in contemplation merely a stroll with the individual in questionit would not be my policy to bid st eustache call for calling he will be sure to ascertain that i have played him falsea fact of which i might keep him for ever in ignorance by leaving home without notifying him of my intention by returning before dark and by then stating that i had been to visit my aunt in the rue des drÃ´mes but as it is my design never to returnor not for some weeksor not until certain concealments are effectedthe gaining of time is the only point about which i need give myself any concern  you have observed in your notes that the most general opinion in relation to this sad affair is and was from the first that the girl had been the victim of a gang of blackguards now the popular opinion under certain conditions is not to be disregarded when arising of itselfwhen manifesting itself in a strictly spontaneous mannerwe should look upon it as analogous with that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius in ninetynine cases from the hundred i would abide by its decision but it is important that we find no palpable traces of suggestion the opinion must be rigorously the publics own and the distinction is often exceedingly difficult to perceive and to maintain in the present instance it appears to me that this public opinion in respect to a gang has been superinduced by the collateral event which is detailed in the third of my extracts all paris is excited by the discovered corpse of marie a girl young beautiful and notorious this corpse is found bearing marks of violence and floating in the river but it is now made known that at the very period or about the very period in which it is supposed that the girl was assassinated an outrage similar in nature to that endured by the deceased although less in extent was perpetuated by a gang of young ruffians upon the person of a second young female is it wonderful that the one known atrocity should influence the popular judgment in regard to the other unknown this judgment awaited direction and the known outrage seemed so opportunely to afford it marie too was found in the river and upon this very river was this known outrage committed the connexion of the two events had about it so much of the palpable that the true wonder would have been a failure of the populace to appreciate and to seize it but in fact the one atrocity known to be so committed is if any thing evidence that the other committed at a time nearly coincident was not so committed it would have been a miracle indeed if while a gang of ruffians were perpetrating at a given locality a most unheardof wrong there should have been another similar gang in a similar locality in the same city under the same circumstances with the same means and appliances engaged in a wrong of precisely the same aspect at precisely the same period of time yet in what if not in this marvellous train of coincidence does the accidentally suggested opinion of the populace call upon us to believe  before proceeding farther let us consider the supposed scene of the assassination in the thicket at the barriÃ¨re du roule this thicket although dense was in the close vicinity of a public road within were three or four large stones forming a kind of seat with a back and footstool on the upper stone was discovered a white petticoat on the second a silk scarf a parasol gloves and a pockethandkerchief were also here found the handkerchief bore the name marie rogÃªt fragments of dress were seen on the branches around the earth was trampled the bushes were broken and there was every evidence of a violent struggle  notwithstanding the acclamation with which the discovery of this thicket was received by the press and the unanimity with which it was supposed to indicate the precise scene of the outrage it must be admitted that there was some very good reason for doubt that it was the scene i may or i may not believebut there was excellent reason for doubt had the true scene been as le commerciel suggested in the neighborhood of the rue pavÃ©e st andrÃ©e the perpetrators of the crime supposing them still resident in paris would naturally have been stricken with terror at the public attention thus acutely directed into the proper channel and in certain classes of minds there would have arisen at once a sense of the necessity of some exertion to redivert this attention and thus the thicket of the barriÃ¨re du roule having been already suspected the idea of placing the articles where they were found might have been naturally entertained there is no real evidence although le soleil so supposes that the articles discovered had been more than a very few days in the thicket while there is much circumstantial proof that they could not have remained there without attracting attention during the twenty days elapsing between the fatal sunday and the afternoon upon which they were found by the boys they were all mildewed down hard says le soleil adopting the opinions of its predecessors with the action of the rain and stuck together from mildew the grass had grown around and over some of them the silk of the parasol was strong but the threads of it were run together within the upper part where it bad been doubled and folded was all mildewed and rotten and tore on being opened in respect to the grass having grown around and over some of them it is obvious that the fact could only have been ascertained from the words and thus from the recollections of two small boys for these boys removed the articles and took them home before they had been seen by a third party but grass will grow especially in warm and damp weather such as was that of the period of the murder as much as two or three inches in a single day a parasol lying upon a newly turfed ground might in a single week be entirely concealed from sight by the upspringing grass and touching that mildew upon which the editor of le soleil so pertinaciously insists that he employs the word no less than three times in the brief paragraph just quoted is he really unaware of the nature of this mildew is he to be told that it is one of the many classes of fungus of which the most ordinary feature is its upspringing and decadence within twentyfour hours  thus we see at a glance that what has been most triumphantly adduced in support of the idea that the articles bad been for at least three or four weeks in the thicket is most absurdly null as regards any evidence of that fact on the other hand it is exceedingly difficult to believe that these articles could have remained in the thicket specified for a longer period than a single weekfor a longer period than from one sunday to the next those who know any thing of the vicinity of paris know the extreme difficulty of finding seclusion unless at a great distance from its suburbs such a thing as an unexplored or even an unfrequently visited recess amid its woods or groves is not for a moment to be imagined let any one who being at heart a lover of nature is yet chained by duty to the dust and heat of this great metropolislet any such one attempt even during the weekdays to slake his thirst for solitude amid the scenes of natural loveliness which immediately surround us at every second step he will find the growing charm dispelled by the voice and personal intrusion of some ruffian or party of carousing blackguards he will seek privacy amid the densest foliage all in vain here are the very nooks where the unwashed most aboundhere are the temples most desecrate with sickness of the heart the wanderer will flee back to the polluted paris as to a less odious because less incongruous sink of pollution but if the vicinity of the city is so beset during the working days of the week how much more so on the sabbath it is now especially that released from the claims of labor or deprived of the customary opportunities of crime the town blackguard seeks the precincts of the town not through love of the rural which in his heart he despises but by way of escape from the restraints and conventionalities of society he desires less the fresh air and the green trees than the utter license of the country here at the roadside inn or beneath the foliage of the woods he indulges unchecked by any eye except those of his boon companions in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilaritythe joint offspring of liberty and of rum i say nothing more than what must be obvious to every dispassionate observer when i repeat that the circumstance of the articles in question having remained undiscovered for a longer periodthan from one sunday to another in any thicket in the immediate neighborhood of paris is to be looked upon as little less than miraculous  but there are not wanting other grounds for the suspicion that the articles were placed in the thicket with the view of diverting attention from the real scene of the outrage and first let me direct your notice to the date of the discovery of the articles collate this with the date of the fifth extract made by myself from the newspapers you will find that the discovery followed almost immediately the urgent communications sent to the evening paper these communications although various and apparently from various sources tended all to the same pointviz the directing of attention to a gang as the perpetrators of the outrage and to the neighborhood of the barriÃ¨re du roule as its scene now here of course the suspicion is not that in consequence of these communications or of the public attention by them directed the articles were found by the boys but the suspicion might and may well have been that the articles were not before found by the boys for the reason that the articles had not before been in the thicket having been deposited there only at so late a period as at the date or shortly prior to the date of the communications by the guilty authors of these communications themselves  this thicket was a singularan exceedingly singular one it was unusually dense within its naturally walled enclosure were three extraordinary stones forming a seat with a back and footstool and this thicket so full of a natural art was in the immediate vicinity within a few rods of the dwelling of madame deluc whose boys were in the habit of closely examining the shrubberies about them in search of the bark of the sassafras would it be a rash wagera wager of one thousand to onethat a day never passed over the heads of these boys without finding at least one of them ensconced in the umbrageous hall and enthroned upon its natural throne those who would hesitate at such a wager have either never been boys themselves or have forgotten the boyish nature i repeatit is exceedingly hard to comprehend how the articles could have remained in this thicket undiscovered for a longer period than one or two days and that thus there is good ground for suspicion in spite of the dogmatic ignorance of le soleil that they were at a comparatively late date deposited where found  but there are still other and stronger reasons for believing them so deposited than any which i have as yet urged and now let me beg your notice to the highly artificial arrangement of the articles on the upper stone lay a white petticoat on the second a silk scarf scattered around were a parasol gloves and a pockethandkerchief bearing the name marie rogÃªt here is just such an arrangement as would naturally be made by a not overacute person wishing to dispose the articles naturally but it is by no means a really natural arrangement i should rather have looked to see the things all lying on the ground and trampled under foot in the narrow limits of that bower it would have been scarcely possible that the petticoat and scarf should have retained a position upon the stones when subjected to the brushing to and fro of many struggling persons there was evidence it is said of a struggle and the earth was trampled the bushes were brokenbut the petticoat and the scarf are found deposited as if upon shelves the pieces of the frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long one part was the hem of the frock and it had been mended they looked like strips torn off here inadvertently le soleil has employed an exceedingly suspicious phrase the pieces as described do indeed look like strips torn off but purposely and by hand it is one of the rarest of accidents that a piece is torn off from any garment such as is now in question by the agency of a thorn from the very nature of such fabrics a thorn or nail becoming entangled in them tears them rectangularlydivides them into two longitudinal rents at right angles with each other and meeting at an apex where the thorn entersbut it is scarcely possible to conceive the piece torn off i never so knew it nor did you to tear a piece off from such fabric two distinct forces in different directions will be in almost every case required if there be two edges to the fabricif for example it be a pockethandkerchief and it is desired to tear from it a slip then and then only will the one force serve the purpose but in the present case the question is of a dress presenting but one edge to tear a piece from the interior where no edge is presented could only be effected by a miracle through the agency of thorns and no one thorn could accomplish it but even where an edge is presented two thorns will be necessary operating the one in two distinct directions and the other in one and this in the supposition that the edge is unhemmed if hemmed the matter is nearly out of the question we thus see the numerous and great obstacles in the way of pieces being torn off through the simple agency of thorns yet we are required to believe not only that one piece but that many have been so torn and one part too was the hem of the frock another piece was part of the skirt not the hemthat is to say was torn completely out through the agency of thorns from the uncaged interior of the dress these i say are things which one may well be pardoned for disbelieving yet taken collectedly they form perhaps less of reasonable ground for suspicion than the one startling circumstance of the articles having been left in this thicket at all by any murderers who had enough precaution to think of removing the corpse you will not have apprehended me rightly however if you suppose it my design to deny this thicket as the scene of the outrage there might have been a wrong here or more possibly an accident at madame delucs but in fact this is a point of minor importance we are not engaged in an attempt to discover the scene but to produce the perpetrators of the murder what i have adduced notwithstanding the minuteness with which i have adduced it has been with the view first to show the folly of the positive and headlong assertions of le soleil but secondly and chiefly to bring you by the most natural route to a further contemplation of the doubt whether this assassination has or has not been the work of a gang  we will resume this question by mere allusion to the revolting details of the surgeon examined at the inquest it is only necessary to say that is published inferences in regard to the number of ruffians have been properly ridiculed as unjust and totally baseless by all the reputable anatomists of paris not that the matter might not have been as inferred but that there was no ground for the inferencewas there not much for another  let us reflect now upon the traces of a struggle and let me ask what these traces have been supposed to demonstrate a gang but do they not rather demonstrate the absence of a gang what struggle could have taken placewhat struggle so violent and so enduring as to have left its traces in all directionsbetween a weak and defenceless girl and the gang of ruffians imagined the silent grasp of a few rough arms and all would have been over the victim must have been absolutely passive at their will you will here bear in mind that the arguments urged against the thicket as the scene are applicable in chief part only against it as the scene of an outrage committed by more than a single individual if we imagine but one violator we can conceive and thus only conceive the struggle of so violent and so obstinate a nature as to have left the traces apparent  and again i have already mentioned the suspicion to be excited by the fact that the articles in question were suffered to remain at all in the thicket where discovered it seems almost impossible that these evidences of guilt should have been accidentally left where found there was sufficient presence of mind it is supposed to remove the corpse and yet a more positive evidence than the corpse itself whose features might have been quickly obliterated by decay is allowed to lie conspicuously in the scene of the outragei allude to the handkerchief with the name of the deceased if this was accident it was not the accident of a gang we can imagine it only the accident of an individual let us see an individual has committed the murder he is alone with the ghost of the departed he is appalled by what lies motionless before him the fury of his passion is over and there is abundant room in his heart for the natural awe of the deed his is none of that confidence which the presence of numbers inevitably inspires he is alone with the dead he trembles and is bewildered yet there is a necessity for disposing of the corpse he bears it to the river but leaves behind him the other evidences of guilt for it is difficult if not impossible to carry all the burthen at once and it will be easy to return for what is left but in his toilsome journey to the water his fears redouble within him the sounds of life encompass his path a dozen times he hears or fancies the step of an observer even the very lights from the city bewilder him yet in time and by long and frequent pauses of deep agony he reaches the rivers brink and disposes of his ghastly chargeperhaps through the medium of a boat but now what treasure does the world holdwhat threat of vengeance could it hold outwhich would have power to urge the return of that lonely murderer over that toilsome and perilous path to the thicket and its blood chilling recollections he returns not let the consequences be what they may he could not return if he would his sole thought is immediate escape he turns his back forever upon those dreadful shrubberies and flees as from the wrath to come  but how with a gang their number would have inspired them with confidence if indeed confidence is ever wanting in the breast of the arrant blackguard and of arrant blackguards alone are the supposed gangs ever constituted their number i say would have prevented the bewildering and unreasoning terror which i have imagined to paralyze the single man could we suppose an oversight in one or two or three this oversight would have been remedied by a fourth they would have left nothing behind them for their number would have enabled them to carry all at once there would have been no need of return  consider now the circumstance that in the outer garment of the corpse when found a slip about a foot wide had been torn upward from the bottom hem to the waist wound three times round the waist and secured by a sort of hitch in the back this was done with the obvious design of affording a handle by which to carry the body but would any number of men have dreamed of resorting to such an expedient to three or four the limbs of the corpse would have afforded not only a sufficient but the best possible hold the device is that of a single individual and this brings us to the fact that between the thicket and the river the rails of the fences were found taken down and the ground bore evident traces of some heavy burden having been dragged along it but would a number of men have put themselves to the superfluous trouble of taking down a fence for the purpose of dragging through it a corpse which they might have lifted over any fence in an instant would a number of men have so dragged a corpse at all as to have left evident traces of the dragging  and here we must refer to an observation of le commerciel an observation upon which i have already in some measure commented a piece says this journal of one of the unfortunate girls petticoats was torn out and tied under her chin and around the back of her head probably to prevent screams this was done by fellows who had no pockethandkerchiefs  i have before suggested that a genuine blackguard is never without a pockethandkerchief but it is not to this fact that i now especially advert that it was not through want of a handkerchief for the purpose imagined by le commerciel that this bandage was employed is rendered apparent by the handkerchief left in the thicket and that the object was not to prevent screams appears also from the bandage having been employed in preference to what would so much better have answered the purpose but the language of the evidence speaks of the strip in question as found around the neck fitting loosely and secured with a hard knot these words are sufficiently vague but differ materially from those of le commerciel the slip was eighteen inches wide and therefore although of muslin would form a strong band when folded or rumpled longitudinally and thus rumpled it was discovered my inference is this the solitary murderer having borne the corpse for some distance whether from the thicket or elsewhere by means of the bandage hitched around its middle found the weight in this mode of procedure too much for his strength he resolved to drag the burthenthe evidence goes to show that it was dragged with this object in view it became necessary to attach something like a rope to one of the extremities it could be best attached about the neck where the head would prevent its slipping off and now the murderer bethought him unquestionably of the bandage about the loins he would have used this but for its volution about the corpse the hitch which embarrassed it and the reflection that it had not been torn off from the garment it was easier to tear a new slip from the petticoat he tore it made it fast about the neck and so dragged his victim to the brink of the river that this bandage only attainable with trouble and delay and but imperfectly answering its purposethat this bandage was employed at all demonstrates that the necessity for its employment sprang from circumstances arising at a period when the handkerchief was no longer attainablethat is to say arising as we have imagined after quitting the thicket if the thicket it was and on the road between the thicket and the river  but the evidence you will say of madame deluc  points especially to the presence of a gang in the vicinity of the thicket at or about the epoch of the murder this i grant i doubt if there were not a dozen gangs such as described by madame deluc in and about the vicinity of the barriÃ¨re du roule at or about the period of this tragedy but the gang which has drawn upon itself the pointed animadversion although the somewhat tardy and very suspicious evidence of madame deluc is the only gang which is represented by that honest and scrupulous old lady as having eaten her cakes and swallowed her brandy without putting themselves to the trouble of making her payment et hinc illÃ¦ irÃ¦  but what is the precise evidence of madame deluc a gang of miscreants made their appearance behaved boisterously ate and drank without making payment followed in the route of the young man and girl returned to the inn about dusk and recrossed the river as if in great haste  now this great haste very possibly seemed greater haste in the eyes of madame deluc since she dwelt lingeringly and lamentingly upon her violated cakes and alecakes and ale for which she might still have entertained a faint hope of compensation why otherwise since it was about dusk should she make a point of the haste it is no cause for wonder surely that even a gang of blackguards should make haste to get home when a wide river is to be crossed in small boats when storm impends and when night approaches  i say approaches for the night had not yet arrived it was only about dusk that the indecent haste of these miscreants offended the sober eyes of madame deluc but we are told that it was upon this very evening that madame deluc as well as her eldest son heard the screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn and in what words does madame deluc designate the period of the evening at which these screams were heard it was soon after dark she says but soon after dark is at least dark and about dusk is as certainly daylight thus it is abundantly clear that the gang quitted the barriÃ¨re du roule prior to the screams overheard  by madame deluc and although in all the many reports of the evidence the relative expressions in question are distinctly and invariably employed just as i have employed them in this conversation with yourself no notice whatever of the gross discrepancy has as yet been taken by any of the public journals or by any of the myrmidons of police  i shall add but one to the arguments against a gang but this one has to my own understanding at least a weight altogether irresistible under the circumstances of large reward offered and full pardon to any kings evidence it is not to be imagined for a moment that some member of a gang of low ruffians or of any body of men would not long ago have betrayed his accomplices each one of a gang so placed is not so much greedy of reward or anxious for escape as fearful of betrayal he betrays eagerly and early that he may not himself be betrayed that the secret has not been divulged is the very best of proof that it is in fact a secret the horrors of this dark deed are known only to one or two living human beings and to god  let us sum up now the meagre yet certain fruits of our long analysis we have attained the idea either of a fatal accident under the roof of madame deluc or of a murder perpetrated in the thicket at the barriÃ¨re du roule by a lover or at least by an intimate and secret associate of the deceased this associate is of swarthy complexion this complexion the hitch in the bandage and the sailors knot with which the bonnetribbon is tied point to a seaman his companionship with the deceased a gay but not an abject young girl designates him as above the grade of the common sailor here the well written and urgent communications to the journals are much in the way of corroboration the circumstance of the first elopement as mentioned by le mercurie tends to blend the idea of this seaman with that of the naval officer who is first known to have led the unfortunate into crime  and here most fitly comes the consideration of the continued absence of him of the dark complexion let me pause to observe that the complexion of this man is dark and swarthy it was no common swarthiness which constituted the sole point of remembrance both as regards valence and madame deluc but why is this man absent was he murdered by the gang if so why are there only traces of the assassinated girl the scene of the two outrages will naturally be supposed identical and where is his corpse the assassins would most probably have disposed of both in the same way but it may be said that this man lives and is deterred from making himself known through dread of being charged with the murder this consideration might be supposed to operate upon him nowat this late periodsince it has been given in evidence that he was seen with mariebut it would have had no force at the period of the deed the first impulse of an innocent man would have been to announce the outrage and to aid in identifying the ruffians this policy would have suggested he had been seen with the girl he had crossed the river with her in an open ferryboat the denouncing of the assassins would have appeared even to an idiot the surest and sole means of relieving himself from suspicion we cannot suppose him on the night of the fatal sunday both innocent himself and incognizant of an outrage committed yet only under such circumstances is it possible to imagine that he would have failed if alive in the denouncement of the assassins  and what means are ours of attaining the truth we shall find these means multiplying and gathering distinctness as we proceed let us sift to the bottom this affair of the first elopement let us know the full history of the officer with his present circumstances and his whereabouts at the precise period of the murder let us carefully compare with each other the various communications sent to the evening paper in which the object was to inculpate a gang this done let us compare these communications both as regards style and ms with those sent to the morning paper at a previous period and insisting so vehemently upon the guilt of mennais and all this done let us again compare these various communications with the known mss of the officer let us endeavor to ascertain by repeated questionings of madame deluc and her boys as well as of the omnibus driver valence something more of the personal appearance and bearing of the man of dark complexion queries skilfully directed will not fail to elicit from some of these parties information on this particular point or upon othersinformation which the parties themselves may not even be aware of possessing and let us now trace the boat picked up by the bargeman on the morning of monday the twentythird of june and which was removed from the bargeoffice without the cognizance of the officer in attendance and without the rudder at some period prior to the discovery of the corpse with a proper caution and perseverance we shall infallibly trace this boat for not only can the bargeman who picked it up identify it but the rudder is at hand the rudder of a sailboat would not have been abandoned without inquiry by one altogether at ease in heart and here let me pause to insinuate a question there was no advertisement of the picking up of this boat it was silently taken to the bargeoffice and as silently removed but its owner or employerhow happened he at so early a period as tuesday morning to be informed without the agency of advertisement of the locality of the boat taken up on monday unless we imagine some connexion with the navysome personal permanent connexion leading to cognizance of its minute in interestsits petty local news  in speaking of the lonely assassin dragging his burden to the shore i have already suggested the probability of his availing himself of a boat now we are to understand that marie rogÃªt was precipitated from a boat this would naturally have been the case the corpse could not have been trusted to the shallow waters of the shore the peculiar marks on the back and shoulders of the victim tell of the bottom ribs of a boat that the body was found without weight is also corroborative of the idea if thrown from the shore a weight would have been attached we can only account for its absence by supposing the murderer to have neglected the precaution of supplying himself with it before pushing off in the act of consigning the corpse to the water he would unquestionably have noticed his oversight but then no remedy would have been at hand any risk would have been preferred to a return to that accursed shore having rid himself of his ghastly charge the murderer would have hastened to the city there at some obscure wharf he would have leaped on land but the boatwould he have secured it he would have been in too great haste for such things as securing a boat moreover in fastening it to the wharf he would have felt as if securing evidence against himself his natural thought would have been to cast from him as far as possible all that had held connection with his crime he would not only have fled from the wharf but he would not have permitted the boat to remain assuredly he would have cast it adrift let us pursue our fanciesin the morning the wretch is stricken with unutterable horror at finding that the boat has been picked up and detained at a locality which he is in the daily habit of frequenting at a locality perhaps which his duty compels him to frequent the next night without daring to ask for the rudder he removes it now where is that rudderless boat let it be one of our first purposes to discover with the first glimpse we obtain of it the dawn of our success shall begin this boat shall guide us with a rapidity which will surprise even ourselves to him who employed it in the midnight of the fatal sabbath corroboration will rise upon corroboration and the murderer will be traced  for reasons which we shall not specify but which to many readers will appear obvious we have taken the liberty of here omitting from the mss placed in our hands such portion as details the following up of the apparently slight clew obtained by dupin we feel it advisable only to state in brief that the result desired was brought to pass and that the prefect fulfilled punctually although with reluctance the terms of his compact with the chevalier mr poes article concludes with the following wordseds 23  it will be understood that i speak of coincidences and no more what i have said above upon this topic must suffice in my own heart there dwells no faith in prÃ¦ternature that nature and its god are two no man who thinks will deny that the latter creating the former can at will control or modify it is also unquestionable i say at will for the question is of will and not as the insanity of logic has assumed of power it is not that the deity cannot modify his laws but that we insult him in imagining a possible necessity for modification in their origin these laws were fashioned to embrace all contingencies which could lie in the future with god all is now  i repeat then that i speak of these things only as of coincidences and farther in what i relate it will be seen that between the fate of the unhappy mary cecilia rogers so far as that fate is known and the fate of one marie rogÃªt up to a certain epoch in her history there has existed a parallel in the contemplation of whose wonderful exactitude the reason becomes embarrassed i say all this will be seen but let it not for a moment be supposed that in proceeding with the sad narrative of marie from the epoch just mentioned and in tracing to its dÃ©nouement the mystery which enshrouded her it is my covert design to hint at an extension of the parallel or even to suggest that the measures adopted in paris for the discovery of the assassin of a grisette or measures founded in any similar ratiocination would produce any similar result  for in respect to the latter branch of the supposition it should be considered that the most trifling variation in the facts of the two cases might give rise to the most important miscalculations by diverting thoroughly the two courses of events very much as in arithmetic an error which in its own individuality may be inappreciable produces at length by dint of multiplication at all points of the process a result enormously at variance with truth and in regard to the former branch we must not fail to hold in view that the very calculus of probabilities to which i have referred forbids all idea of the extension of the parallelforbids it with a positiveness strong and decided just in proportion as this parallel has already been longdrawn and exact this is one of those anomalous propositions which seemingly appealing to thought altogether apart from the mathematical is yet one which only the mathematician can fully entertain nothing for example is more difficult than to convince the merely general reader that the fact of sixes having been thrown twice in succession by a player at dice is sufficient cause for betting the largest odds that sixes will not be thrown in the third attempt a suggestion to this effect is usually rejected by the intellect at once it does not appear that the two throws which have been completed and which lie now absolutely in the past can have influence upon the throw which exists only in the future the chance for throwing sixes seems to be precisely as it was at any ordinary timethat is to say subject only to the influence of the various other throws which may be made by the dice and this is a reflection which appears so exceedingly obvious that attempts to controvert it are received more frequently with a derisive smile than with anything like respectful attention the error here involveda gross error redolent of mischiefi cannot pretend to expose within the limits assigned me at present and with the philosophical it needs no exposure it may be sufficient here to say that it forms one of an infinite series of mistakes which arise in the path or reason through her propensity for seeking truth in detail  footnotesmarie rogÃªt  1 upon the original publication of marie roget the footnotes now appended were considered unnecessary but the lapse of several years since the tragedy upon which the tale is based renders it expedient to give them and also to say a few words in explanation of the general design a young girl mary cecilia rogers was murdered in the vicinity of new york and although her death occasioned an intense and longenduring excitement the mystery attending it had remained unsolved at the period when the present paper was written and published november 1842 herein under pretence of relating the fate of a parisian grisette the author has followed in minute detail the essential while merely paralleling the inessential facts of the real murder of mary rogers thus all argument founded upon the fiction is applicable to the truth and the investigation of the truth was the object the mystery of marie roget was composed at a distance from the scene of the atrocity and with no other means of investigation than the newspapers afforded thus much escaped the writer of which he could have availed himself had he been upon the spot and visited the localities it may not be improper to record nevertheless that the confessions of two persons one of them the madame deluc of the narrative made at different periods long subsequent to the publication confirmed in full not only the general conclusion but absolutely all the chief hypothetical details by which that conclusion was attained  2 the nom de plume of von hardenburg  3 nassau

fact in the new york sun a  daily newspaper and therein fully subserved the purpose of creating  indigestible aliment for the quidnuncs during the few hours  intervening between a couple of the

the machineand in the inconceivably brief period of seventyfive hours from shore to shore by the energy of an agent at charleston sc we are enabled to be the first to furnish the public with a detailed account of this most extraordinary voyage which was performed between saturday the 6th instant at 11 am and 2 pm on tuesday the 9th instant by sir everard bringhurst mr osborne a nephew of lord bentincks mr monck mason and mr robert holland the wellknown Ã¦ronauts mr harrison ainsworth author of jack sheppard c and mr henson the projector of the late unsuccessful flying machinewith two seamen from woolwichin all eight persons the particulars furnished below may be relied on as authentic and accurate in every respect as with a slight exception they are copied verbatim from the joint diaries of mr monck mason and mr harrison ainsworth to whose politeness our agent is also indebted for much verbal information respecting the balloon itself its construction and other matters of interest the only alteration in the ms received has been made for the purpose of throwing the hurried account of our agent mr forsyth into a connected and intelligible form  the balloon  two very decided failures of latethose of mr henson and sir george cayleyhad much weakened the public interest in the subject of aerial navigation mr hensons scheme which at first was considered very feasible even by men of science was founded upon the principle of an inclined plane started from an eminence by an extrinsic force applied and continued by the revolution of impinging vanes in form and number resembling the vanes of a windmill but in all the experiments made with models at the adelaide gallery it was found that the operation of these fans not only did not propel the machine but actually impeded its flight the only propelling force it ever exhibited was the mere impetus acquired from the descent of the inclined plane and this impetus carried the machine farther when the vanes were at rest than when they were in motiona fact which sufficiently demonstrates their inutility and in the absence of the propelling which was also the sustaining power the whole fabric would necessarily descend this consideration led sir george cayley to think only of adapting a propeller to some machine having of itself an independent power of supportin a word to a balloon the idea however being novel or original with sir george only so far as regards the mode of its application to practice he exhibited a model of his invention at the polytechnic institution the propelling principle or power was here also applied to interrupted surfaces or vanes put in revolution these vanes were four in number but were found entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon or in aiding its ascending power the whole project was thus a complete failure  it was at this juncture that mr monck mason whose voyage from dover to weilburg in the balloon nassau occasioned so much excitement in 1837 conceived the idea of employing the principle of the archimedean screw for the purpose of propulsion through the airrightly attributing the failure of mr hensons scheme and of sir george cayleys to the interruption of surface in the independent vanes he made the first public experiment at williss rooms but afterward removed his model to the adelaide gallery  like sir george cayleys balloon his own was an ellipsoid its length was thirteen feet six inchesheight six feet eight inches it contained about three hundred and twenty cubic feet of gas which if pure hydrogen would support twentyone pounds upon its first inflation before the gas has time to deteriorate or escape the weight of the whole machine and apparatus was seventeen poundsleaving about four pounds to spare beneath the centre of the balloon was a frame of light wood about nine feet long and rigged on to the balloon itself with a network in the customary manner from this framework was suspended a wicker basket or car  the screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube eighteen inches in length through which upon a semispiral inclined at fifteen degrees pass a series of steel wire radii two feet long and thus projecting a foot on either side these radii are connected at the outer extremities by two bands of flattened wirethe whole in this manner forming the framework of the screw which is completed by a covering of oiled silk cut into gores and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform surface at each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of hollow brass tube descending from the hoop in the lower ends of these tubes are holes in which the pivots of the axis revolve from the end of the axis which is next the car proceeds a shaft of steel connecting the screw with the pinion of a piece of spring machinery fixed in the car by the operation of this spring the screw is made to revolve with great rapidity communicating a progressive motion to the whole by means of the rudder the machine was readily turned in any direction the spring was of great power compared with its dimensions being capable of raising fortyfive pounds upon a barrel of four inches diameter after the first turn and gradually increasing as it was wound up it weighed altogether eight pounds six ounces the rudder was a light frame of cane covered with silk shaped somewhat like a battledoor and was about three feet long and at the widest one foot its weight was about two ounces it could be turned flat and directed upwards or downwards as well as to the right or left and thus enabled the Ã¦ronaut to transfer the resistance of the air which in an inclined position it must generate in its passage to any side upon which he might desire to act thus determining the balloon in the opposite direction  this model which through want of time we have necessarily described in an imperfect manner was put in action at the adelaide gallery where it accomplished a velocity of five miles per hour although strange to say it excited very little interest in comparison with the previous complex machine of mr hensonso resolute is the world to despise anything which carries with it an air of simplicity to accomplish the great desideratum of Ã¦rial navigation it was very generally supposed that some exceedingly complicated application must be made of some unusually profound principle in dynamics  so well satisfied however was mr mason of the ultimate success of his invention that he determined to construct immediately if possible a balloon of sufficient capacity to test the question by a voyage of some extentthe original design being to cross the british channel as before in the nassau balloon to carry out his views he solicited and obtained the patronage of sir everard bringhurst and mr osborne two gentlemen well known for scientific acquirement and especially for the interest they have exhibited in the progress of Ã¦rostation the project at the desire of mr osborne was kept a profound secret from the publicthe only persons entrusted with the design being those actually engaged in the construction of the machine which was built under the superintendence of mr mason mr holland sir everard bringhurst and mr osborne at the seat of the latter gentleman near penstruthal in wales mr henson accompanied by his friend mr ainsworth was admitted to a private view of the balloon on saturday lastwhen the two gentlemen made final arrangements to be included in the adventure we are not informed for what reason the two seamen were also included in the partybut in the course of a day or two we shall put our readers in possession of the minutest particulars respecting this extraordinary voyage  the balloon is composed of silk varnished with the liquid gum caoutchouc it is of vast dimensions containing more than 40000 cubic feet of gas but as coal gas was employed in place of the more expensive and inconvenient hydrogen the supporting power of the machine when fully inflated and immediately after inflation is not more than about 2500 pounds the coal gas is not only much less costly but is easily procured and managed  for its introduction into common use for purposes of aerostation we are indebted to mr charles green up to his discovery the process of inflation was not only exceedingly expensive but uncertain two and even three days have frequently been wasted in futile attempts to procure a sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon from which it had great tendency to escape owing to its extreme subtlety and its affinity for the surrounding atmosphere in a balloon sufficiently perfect to retain its contents of coalgas unaltered in quantity or amount for six months an equal quantity of hydrogen could not be maintained in equal purity for six weeks  the supporting power being estimated at 2500 pounds and the united weights of the party amounting only to about 1200 there was left a surplus of 1300 of which again 1200 was exhausted by ballast arranged in bags of different sizes with their respective weights marked upon themby cordage barometers telescopes barrels containing provision for a fortnight watercasks cloaks carpetbags and various other indispensable matters including a coffeewarmer contrived for warming coffee by means of slacklime so as to dispense altogether with fire if it should be judged prudent to do so all these articles with the exception of the ballast and a few trifles were suspended from the hoop overhead the car is much smaller and lighter in proportion than the one appended to the model it is formed of a light wicker and is wonderfully strong for so frail looking a machine its rim is about four feet deep the rudder is also very much larger in proportion than that of the model and the screw is considerably smaller the balloon is furnished besides with a grapnel and a guiderope which latter is of the most indispensable importance a few words in explanation will here be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the details of aerostation  as soon as the balloon quits the earth it is subjected to the influence of many circumstances tending to create a difference in its weight augmenting or diminishing its ascending power for example there may be a deposition of dew upon the silk to the extent even of several hundred pounds ballast has then to be thrown out or the machine may descend this ballast being discarded and a clear sunshine evaporating the dew and at the same time expanding the gas in the silk the whole will again rapidly ascend to check this ascent the only recourse is or rather was until mr greens invention of the guiderope the permission of the escape of gas from the valve but in the loss of gas is a proportionate general loss of ascending power so that in a comparatively brief period the bestconstructed balloon must necessarily exhaust all its resources and come to the earth this was the great obstacle to voyages of length  the guiderope remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner conceivable it is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail from the car and the effect of which is to prevent the balloon from changing its level in any material degree if for example there should be a deposition of moisture upon the silk and the machine begins to descend in consequence there will be no necessity for discharging ballast to remedy the increase of weight for it is remedied or counteracted in an exactly just proportion by the deposit on the ground of just so much of the end of the rope as is necessary if on the other hand any circumstances should cause undue levity and consequent ascent this levity is immediately counteracted by the additional weight of rope upraised from the earth thus the balloon can neither ascend or descend except within very narrow limits and its resources either in gas or ballast remain comparatively unimpaired when passing over an expanse of water it becomes necessary to employ small kegs of copper or wood filled with liquid ballast of a lighter nature than water these float and serve all the purposes of a mere rope on land another most important office of the guiderope is to point out the direction of the balloon the rope drags either on land or sea while the balloon is free the latter consequently is always in advance when any progress whatever is made a comparison therefore by means of the compass of the relative positions of the two objects will always indicate the course in the same way the angle formed by the rope with the vertical axis of the machine indicates the velocity when there is no anglein other words when the rope hangs perpendicularly the whole apparatus is stationary but the larger the angle that is to say the farther the balloon precedes the end of the rope the greater the velocity and the converse  as the original design was to cross the british channel and alight as near paris as possible the voyagers had taken the precaution to prepare themselves with passports directed to all parts of the continent specifying the nature of the expedition as in the case of the nassau voyage and entitling the adventurers to exemption from the usual formalities of office unexpected events however rendered these passports superfluous  the inflation was commenced very quietly at daybreak on saturday morning the 6th instant in the courtyard of wealvor house mr osbornes seat about a mile from penstruthal in north wales and at 7 minutes past 11 every thing being ready for departure the balloon was set free rising gently but steadily in a direction nearly south no use being made for the first half hour of either the screw or the rudder we proceed now with the journal as transcribed by mr forsyth from the joint mss of mr monck mason and mr ainsworth the body of the journal as given is in the handwriting of mr mason and a p s is appended each day by mr ainsworth who has in preparation and will shortly give the public a more minute and no doubt a thrillingly interesting account of the voyage  the journal  saturday april the 6thevery preparation likely to embarrass us having been made over night we commenced the inflation this morning at daybreak but owing to a thick fog which encumbered the folds of the silk and rendered it unmanageable we did not get through before nearly eleven oclock cut loose then in high spirits and rose gently but steadily with a light breeze at north which bore us in the direction of the british channel found the ascending force greater than we had expected and as we arose higher and so got clear of the cliffs and more in the suns rays our ascent became very rapid i did not wish however to lose gas at so early a period of the adventure and so concluded to ascend for the present we soon ran out our guiderope but even when we had raised it clear of the earth we still went up very rapidly the balloon was unusually steady and looked beautifully in about ten minutes after starting the barometer indicated an altitude of 15000 feet the weather was remarkably fine and the view of the subjacent countrya most romantic one when seen from any pointwas now especially sublime the numerous deep gorges presented the appearance of lakes on account of the dense vapors with which they were filled and the pinnacles and crags to the south east piled in inextricable confusion resembling nothing so much as the giant cities of eastern fable we were rapidly approaching the mountains in the south but our elevation was more than sufficient to enable us to pass them in safety in a few minutes we soared over them in fine style and mr ainsworth with the seamen was surprised at their apparent want of altitude when viewed from the car the tendency of great elevation in a balloon being to reduce inequalities of the surface below to nearly a dead level at halfpast eleven still proceeding nearly south we obtained our first view of the bristol channel and in fifteen minutes afterward the line of breakers on the coast appeared immediately beneath us and we were fairly out at sea we now resolved to let off enough gas to bring our guiderope with the buoys affixed into the water this was immediately done and we commenced a gradual descent in about twenty minutes our first buoy dipped and at the touch of the second soon afterwards we remained stationary as to elevation we were all now anxious to test the efficiency of the rudder and screw and we put them both into requisition forthwith for the purpose of altering our direction more to the eastward and in a line for paris by means of the rudder we instantly effected the necessary change of direction and our course was brought nearly at right angles to that of the wind when we set in motion the spring of the screw and were rejoiced to find it propel us readily as desired upon this we gave nine hearty cheers and dropped in the sea a bottle enclosing a slip of parchment with a brief account of the principle of the invention hardly however had we done with our rejoicings when an unforeseen accident occurred which discouraged us in no little degree the steel rod connecting the spring with the propeller was suddenly jerked out of place at the car end by a swaying of the car through some movement of one of the two seamen we had taken up and in an instant hung dangling out of reach from the pivot of the axis of the screw while we were endeavoring to regain it our attention being completely absorbed we became involved in a strong current of wind from the east which bore us with rapidly increasing force towards the atlantic we soon found ourselves driving out to sea at the rate of not less certainly than fifty or sixty miles an hour so that we came up with cape clear at some forty miles to our north before we had secured the rod and had time to think what we were about it was now that mr ainsworth made an extraordinary but to my fancy a by no means unreasonable or chimerical proposition in which he was instantly seconded by mr hollandviz that we should take advantage of the strong gale which bore us on and in place of beating back to paris make an attempt to reach the coast of north america after slight reflection i gave a willing assent to this bold proposition which strange to say met with objection from the two seamen only as the stronger party however we overruled their fears and kept resolutely upon our course we steered due west but as the trailing of the buoys materially impeded our progress and we had the balloon abundantly at command either for ascent or descent we first threw out fifty pounds of ballast and then wound up by means of a windlass so much of the rope as brought it quite clear of the sea we perceived the effect of this manoeuvre immediately in a vastly increased rate of progress and as the gale freshened we flew with a velocity nearly inconceivable the guiderope flying out behind the car like a streamer from a vessel it is needless to say that a very short time sufficed us to lose sight of the coast we passed over innumerable vessels of all kinds a few of which were endeavoring to beat up but the most of them lying to we occasioned the greatest excitement on board allan excitement greatly relished by ourselves and especially by our two men who now under the influence of a dram of geneva seemed resolved to give all scruple or fear to the wind many of the vessels fired signal guns and in all we were saluted with loud cheers which we heard with surprising distinctness and the waving of caps and handkerchiefs we kept on in this manner throughout the day with no material incident and as the shades of night closed around us we made a rough estimate of the distance traversed it could not have been less than five hundred miles and was probably much more the propeller was kept in constant operation and no doubt aided our progress materially as the sun went down the gale freshened into an absolute hurricane and the ocean beneath was clearly visible on account of its phosphorescence the wind was from the east all night and gave us the brightest omen of success we suffered no little from cold and the dampness of the atmosphere was most unpleasant but the ample space in the car enabled us to lie down and by means of cloaks and a few blankets we did sufficiently well  ps by mr ainsworth the last nine hours have been unquestionably the most exciting of my life i can conceive nothing more sublimating than the strange peril and novelty of an adventure such as this may god grant that we succeed i ask not success for mere safety to my insignificant person but for the sake of human knowledge andfor the vastness of the triumph and yet the feat is only so evidently feasible that the sole wonder is why men have scrupled to attempt it before one single gale such as now befriends uslet such a tempest whirl forward a balloon for four or five days these gales often last longer and the voyager will be easily borne in that period from coast to coast in view of such a gale the broad atlantic becomes a mere lake i am more struck just now with the supreme silence which reigns in the sea beneath us notwithstanding its agitation than with any other phenomenon presenting itself the waters give up no voice to the heavens the immense flaming ocean writhes and is tortured uncomplainingly the mountainous surges suggest the idea of innumerable dumb gigantic fiends struggling in impotent agony in a night such as is this to me a man liveslives a whole century of ordinary lifenor would i forego this rapturous delight for that of a whole century of ordinary existence  sunday the seventh mr masons ms this morning the gale by 10 had subsided to an eight or nineknot breeze for a vessel at sea and bears us perhaps thirty miles per hour or more it has veered however very considerably to the north and now at sundown we are holding our course due west principally by the screw and rudder which answer their purposes to admiration i regard the project as thoroughly successful and the easy navigation of the air in any direction not exactly in the teeth of a gale as no longer problematical we could not have made head against the strong wind of yesterday but by ascending we might have got out of its influence if requisite against a pretty stiff breeze i feel convinced we can make our way with the propeller at noon today ascended to an elevation of nearly 25000 feet by discharging ballast did this to search for a more direct current but found none so favorable as the one we are now in we have an abundance of gas to take us across this small pond even should the voyage last three weeks i have not the slightest fear for the result the difficulty has been strangely exaggerated and misapprehended i can choose my current and should i find all currents against me i can make very tolerable headway with the propeller we have had no incidents worth recording the night promises fair  ps by mr ainsworth i have little to record except the fact to me quite a surprising one that at an elevation equal to that of cotopaxi i experienced neither very intense cold nor headache nor difficulty of breathing neither i find did mr mason nor mr holland nor sir everard mr osborne complained of constriction of the chestbut this soon wore off we have flown at a great rate during the day and we must be more than half way across the atlantic we have passed over some twenty or thirty vessels of various kinds and all seem to be delightfully astonished crossing the ocean in a balloon is not so difficult a feat after all omne ignotum pro magnifico mem at 25000 feet elevation the sky appears nearly black and the stars are distinctly visible while the sea does not seem convex as one might suppose but absolutely and most unequivocally concave1  monday the 8th mr masons ms this morning we had again some little trouble with the rod of the propeller which must be entirely remodelled for fear of serious accidenti mean the steel rodnot the vanes the latter could not be improved the wind has been blowing steadily and strongly from the northeast all day and so far fortune seems bent upon favoring us just before day we were all somewhat alarmed at some odd noises and concussions in the balloon accompanied with the apparent rapid subsidence of the whole machine these phenomena were occasioned by the expansion of the gas through increase of heat in the atmosphere and the consequent disruption of the minute particles of ice with which the network had become encrusted during the night threw down several bottles to the vessels below saw one of them picked up by a large shipseemingly one of the new york line packets endeavored to make out her name but could not be sure of it mr osbornes telescope made it out something like atalanta it is now 12 at night and we are still going nearly west at a rapid pace the sea is peculiarly phosphorescent  ps by mr ainsworth it is now 2 am and nearly calm as well as i can judgebut it is very difficult to determine this point since we move with the air so completely i have not slept since quitting whealvor but can stand it no longer and must take a nap we cannot be far from the american coast  tuesday the 9th mr ainsworths ms one pm we are in full view of the low coast of south carolina the great problem is accomplished we have crossed the atlanticfairly and easily crossed it in a balloon god be praised who shall say that anything is impossible hereafter  the journal here ceases some particulars of the descent were communicated however by mr ainsworth to mr forsyth it was nearly dead calm when the voyagers first came in view of the coast which was immediately recognized by both the seamen and by mr osborne the latter gentleman having acquaintances at fort moultrie it was immediately resolved to descend in its vicinity the balloon was brought over the beach the tide being out and the sand hard smooth and admirably adapted for a descent and the grapnel let go which took firm hold at once the inhabitants of the island and of the fort thronged out of course to see the balloon but it was with the greatest difficulty that any one could be made to credit the actual voyagethe crossing of the atlantic the grapnel caught at 2 pm precisely and thus the whole voyage was completed in seventyfive hours or rather less counting from shore to shore no serious accident occurred no real danger was at any time apprehended the balloon was exhausted and secured without trouble and when the ms  from which this narrative is compiled was despatched from charleston the party were still at fort moultrie their farther intentions were not ascertained but we can safely promise our readers some additional information either on monday or in the course of the next day at farthest  this is unquestionably the most stupendous the most interesting and the most important undertaking ever accomplished or even attempted by man what magnificent events may ensue it would be useless now to think of determining  1 notemr ainsworth has not attempted to account for this phenomenon which however is quite susceptible of explanation a line dropped from an elevation of 25000 feet perpendicularly to the surface of the earth or sea would form the perpendicular of a rightangled triangle of which the base would extend from the right angle to the horizon and the hypothenuse from the horizon to the balloon but the 25000 feet of altitude is little or nothing in comparison with the extent of the prospect in other words the base and hypothenuse of the supposed triangle would be so long when compared with the perpendicular that the two former may be regarded as nearly parallel in this manner the horizon of the Ã¦ronaut would appear to be on a level with the car but as the point immediately beneath him seems and is at a great distance below him it seems of course also at a great distance below the horizon hence the impression of concavity and this impression must remain until the elevation shall bear so great a proportion to the extent of prospect that the apparent parallelism of the base and hypothenuse disappearswhen the earths real convexity must become apparent     ms found in a bottle                 qui na plus quun moment a vivre                 na plus rien a dissimuler                              quinaultatys  of my country and of my family i have little to say ill usage and length of years have driven me from the one and estranged me from the other hereditary wealth afforded me an education of no common order and a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to methodize the stores which early study very diligently garnered upbeyond all things the study of the german moralists gave me great delight not from any illadvised admiration of their eloquent madness but from the ease with which my habits of rigid thought enabled me to detect their falsities i have often been reproached with the aridity of my genius a deficiency of imagination has been imputed to me as a crime and the pyrrhonism of my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious indeed a strong relish for physical philosophy has i fear tinctured my mind with a very common error of this agei mean the habit of referring occurrences even the least susceptible of such reference to the principles of that science upon the whole no person could be less liable than myself to be led away from the severe precincts of truth by the ignes fatui of superstition i have thought proper to premise thus much lest the incredible tale i have to tell should be considered rather the raving of a crude imagination than the positive experience of a mind to which the reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a nullity  after many years spent in foreign travel i sailed in the year 18  from the port of batavia in the rich and populous island of java on a voyage to the archipelago of the sunda islands i went as passengerhaving no other inducement than a kind of nervous restlessness which haunted me as a fiend  our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons copperfastened and built at bombay of malabar teak she was freighted with cottonwool and oil from the lachadive islands we had also on board coir jaggeree ghee cocoanuts and a few cases of opium the stowage was clumsily done and the vessel consequently crank  we got under way with a mere breath of wind and for many days stood along the eastern coast of java without any other incident to beguile the monotony of our course than the occasional meeting with some of the small grabs of the archipelago to which we were bound  one evening leaning over the taffrail i observed a very singular isolated cloud to the nw it was remarkable as well for its color as from its being the first we had seen since our departure from batavia i watched it attentively until sunset when it spread all at once to the eastward and westward girting in the horizon with a narrow strip of vapor and looking like a long line of low beach my notice was soon afterwards attracted by the duskyred appearance of the moon and the peculiar character of the sea the latter was undergoing a rapid change and the water seemed more than usually transparent although i could distinctly see the bottom yet heaving the lead i found the ship in fifteen fathoms the air now became intolerably hot and was loaded with spiral exhalations similar to those arising from heat iron as night came on every breath of wind died away an more entire calm it is impossible to conceive the flame of a candle burned upon the poop without the least perceptible motion and a long hair held between the finger and thumb hung without the possibility of detecting a vibration however as the captain said he could perceive no indication of danger and as we were drifting in bodily to shore he ordered the sails to be furled and the anchor let go no watch was set and the crew consisting principally of malays stretched themselves deliberately upon deck i went belownot without a full presentiment of evil indeed every appearance warranted me in apprehending a simoom i told the captain my fears but he paid no attention to what i said and left me without deigning to give a reply my uneasiness however prevented me from sleeping and about midnight i went upon deckas i placed my foot upon the upper step of the companionladder i was startled by a loud humming noise like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a millwheel and before i could ascertain its meaning i found the ship quivering to its centre in the next instant a wilderness of foam hurled us upon our beamends and rushing over us fore and aft swept the entire decks from stem to stern  the extreme fury of the blast proved in a great measure the salvation of the ship although completely waterlogged yet as her masts had gone by the board she rose after a minute heavily from the sea and staggering awhile beneath the immense pressure of the tempest finally righted  by what miracle i escaped destruction it is impossible to say stunned by the shock of the water i found myself upon recovery jammed in between the sternpost and rudder with great difficulty i gained my feet and looking dizzily around was at first struck with the idea of our being among breakers so terrific beyond the wildest imagination was the whirlpool of mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were engulfed after a while i heard the voice of an old swede who had shipped with us at the moment of our leaving port i hallooed to him with all my strength and presently he came reeling aft we soon discovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident all on deck with the exception of ourselves had been swept overboardthe captain and mates must have perished as they slept for the cabins were deluged with water without assistance we could expect to do little for the security of the ship and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the momentary expectation of going down our cable had of course parted like packthread at the first breath of the hurricane or we should have been instantaneously overwhelmed we scudded with frightful velocity before the sea and the water made clear breaches over us the framework of our stern was shattered excessively and in almost every respect we had received considerable injury but to our extreme joy we found the pumps unchoked and that we had made no great shifting of our ballast the main fury of the blast had already blown over and we apprehended little danger from the violence of the wind but we looked forward to its total cessation with dismay well believing that in our shattered condition we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell which would ensue but this very just apprehension seemed by no means likely to be soon verified for five entire days and nightsduring which our only subsistence was a small quantity of jaggeree procured with great difficulty from the forecastlethe hulk flew at a rate defying computation before rapidly succeeding flaws of wind which without equalling the first violence of the simoom were still more terrific than any tempest i had before encountered our course for the first four days was with trifling variations se and by s and we must have run down the coast of new hollandon the fifth day the cold became extreme although the wind had hauled round a point more to the northwardthe sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre and clambered a very few degrees above the horizonemitting no decisive lightthere were no clouds apparent yet the wind was upon the increase and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury about noon as nearly as we could guess our attention was again arrested by the appearance of the sun it gave out no light properly so called but a dull and sullen glow without reflection as if all its rays were polarized just before sinking within the turgid sea its central fires suddenly went out as if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power it was a dim sliverlike rim alone as it rushed down the unfathomable ocean  we waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth daythat day to me has not arrivedto the swede never did arrive thenceforward we were enshrouded in patchy darkness so that we could not have seen an object at twenty paces from the ship eternal night continued to envelop us all unrelieved by the phosphoric seabrilliancy to which we had been accustomed in the tropics we observed too that although the tempest continued to rage with unabated violence there was no longer to be discovered the usual appearance of surf or foam which had hitherto attended us all around were horror and thick gloom and a black sweltering desert of ebonysuperstitious terror crept by degrees into the spirit of the old swede and my own soul was wrapped up in silent wonder we neglected all care of the ship as worse than useless and securing ourselves as well as possible to the stump of the mizenmast looked out bitterly into the world of ocean we had no means of calculating time nor could we form any guess of our situation we were however well aware of having made farther to the southward than any previous navigators and felt great amazement at not meeting with the usual impediments of ice in the meantime every moment threatened to be our lastevery mountainous billow hurried to overwhelm us the swell surpassed anything i had imagined possible and that we were not instantly buried is a miracle my companion spoke of the lightness of our cargo and reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship but i could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of hope itself and prepared myself gloomily for that death which i thought nothing could defer beyond an hour as with every knot of way the ship made the swelling of the black stupendous seas became more dismally appalling at times we gasped for breath at an elevation beyond the albatrossat times became dizzy with the velocity of our descent into some watery hell where the air grew stagnant and no sound disturbed the slumbers of the kraken  we were at the bottom of one of these abysses when a quick scream from my companion broke fearfully upon the night see see cried he shrieking in my ears almighty god see see as he spoke i became aware of a dull sullen glare of red light which streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we lay and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our deck casting my eyes upwards i beheld a spectacle which froze the current of my blood at a terrific height directly above us and upon the very verge of the precipitous descent hovered a gigantic ship of perhaps four thousand tons although upreared upon the summit of a wave more than a hundred times her own altitude her apparent size exceeded that of any ship of the line or east indiaman in existence her huge hull was of a deep dingy black unrelieved by any of the customary carvings of a ship a single row of brass cannon protruded from her open ports and dashed from their polished surfaces the fires of innumerable battlelanterns which swung to and fro about her rigging but what mainly inspired us with horror and astonishment was that she bore up under a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea and of that ungovernable hurricane when we first discovered her her bows were alone to be seen as she rose slowly from the dim and horrible gulf beyond her for a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy pinnacle as if in contemplation of her own sublimity then trembled and tottered andcame down  at this instant i know not what sudden selfpossession came over my spirit staggering as far aft as i could i awaited fearlessly the ruin that was to overwhelm our own vessel was at length ceasing from her struggles and sinking with her head to the sea the shock of the descending mass struck her consequently in that portion of her frame which was already under water and the inevitable result was to hurl me with irresistible violence upon the rigging of the stranger  as i fell the ship hove in stays and went about and to the confusion ensuing i attributed my escape from the notice of the crew with little difficulty i made my way unperceived to the main hatchway which was partially open and soon found an opportunity of secreting myself in the hold why i did so i can hardly tell an indefinite sense of awe which at first sight of the navigators of the ship had taken hold of my mind was perhaps the principle of my concealment i was unwilling to trust myself with a race of people who had offered to the cursory glance i had taken so many points of vague novelty doubt and apprehension i therefore thought proper to contrive a hidingplace in the hold this i did by removing a small portion of the shiftingboards in such a manner as to afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the ship  i had scarcely completed my work when a footstep in the hold forced me to make use of it a man passed by my place of concealment with a feeble and unsteady gait i could not see his face but had an opportunity of observing his general appearance there was about it an evidence of great age and infirmity his knees tottered beneath a load of years and his entire frame quivered under the burthen he muttered to himself in a low broken tone some words of a language which i could not understand and groped in a corner among a pile of singularlooking instruments and decayed charts of navigation his manner was a wild mixture of the peevishness of second childhood and the solemn dignity of a god he at length went on deck and i saw him no more        a feeling for which i have no name has taken possession of my soul a sensation which will admit of no analysis to which the lessons of bygone times are inadequate and for which i fear futurity itself will offer me no key to a mind constituted like my own the latter consideration is an evil i shall neveri know that i shall neverbe satisfied with regard to the nature of my conceptions yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite since they have their origin in sources so utterly novel a new sensea new entity is added to my soul        it is long since i first trod the deck of this terrible ship and the rays of my destiny are i think gathering to a focus incomprehensible men wrapped up in meditations of a kind which i cannot divine they pass me by unnoticed concealment is utter folly on my part for the people will not see it was but just now that i passed directly before the eyes of the mateit was no long while ago that i ventured into the captains own private cabin and took thence the materials with which i write and have written i shall from time to time continue this journal it is true that i may not find an opportunity of transmitting it to the world but i will not fall to make the endeavour at the last moment i will enclose the ms in a bottle and cast it within the sea        an incident has occurred which has given me new room for meditation are such things the operation of ungoverned chance i had ventured upon deck and thrown myself down without attracting any notice among a pile of ratlinstuff and old sails in the bottom of the yawl while musing upon the singularity of my fate i unwittingly daubed with a tarbrush the edges of a neatlyfolded studdingsail which lay near me on a barrel the studdingsail is now bent upon the ship and the thoughtless touches of the brush are spread out into the word discovery  i have made many observations lately upon the structure of the vessel although well armed she is not i think a ship of war her rigging build and general equipment all negative a supposition of this kind what she is not i can easily perceivewhat she is i fear it is impossible to say i know not how it is but in scrutinizing her strange model and singular cast of spars her huge size and overgrown suits of canvas her severely simple bow and antiquated stern there will occasionally flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things and there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection an unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago        i have been looking at the timbers of the ship she is built of a material to which i am a stranger there is a peculiar character about the wood which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the purpose to which it has been applied i mean its extreme porousness considered independently by the wormeaten condition which is a consequence of navigation in these seas and apart from the rottenness attendant upon age it will appear perhaps an observation somewhat overcurious but this wood would have every characteristic of spanish oak if spanish oak were distended by any unnatural means  in reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of an old weatherbeaten dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection it is as sure he was wont to say when any doubt was entertained of his veracity as sure as there is a sea where the ship itself will grow in bulk like the living body of the seaman        about an hour ago i made bold to thrust myself among a group of the crew they paid me no manner of attention and although i stood in the very midst of them all seemed utterly unconscious of my presence like the one i had at first seen in the hold they all bore about them the marks of a hoary old age their knees trembled with infirmity their shoulders were bent double with decrepitude their shrivelled skins rattled in the wind their voices were low tremulous and broken their eyes glistened with the rheum of years and their gray hairs streamed terribly in the tempest around them on every part of the deck lay scattered mathematical instruments of the most quaint and obsolete construction        i mentioned some time ago the bending of a studdingsail from that period the ship being thrown dead off the wind has continued her terrific course due south with every rag of canvas packed upon her from her trucks to her lower studdingsail booms and rolling every moment her topgallant yardarms into the most appalling hell of water which it can enter into the mind of a man to imagine i have just left the deck where i find it impossible to maintain a footing although the crew seem to experience little inconvenience it appears to me a miracle of miracles that our enormous bulk is not swallowed up at once and forever we are surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink of eternity without taking a final plunge into the abyss from billows a thousand times more stupendous than any i have ever seen we glide away with the facility of the arrowy seagull and the colossal waters rear their heads above us like demons of the deep but like demons confined to simple threats and forbidden to destroy i am led to attribute these frequent escapes to the only natural cause which can account for such effecti must suppose the ship to be within the influence of some strong current or impetuous undertow        i have seen the captain face to face and in his own cabinbut as i expected he paid me no attention although in his appearance there is to a casual observer nothing which might bespeak him more or less than manstill a feeling of irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the sensation of wonder with which i regarded him in stature he is nearly my own height that is about five feet eight inches he is of a wellknit and compact frame of body neither robust nor remarkably otherwise but it is the singularity of the expression which reigns upon the faceit is the intense the wonderful the thrilling evidence of old age so utter so extreme which excites within my spirit a sensea sentiment ineffable his forehead although little wrinkled seems to bear upon it the stamp of a myriad of yearshis gray hairs are records of the past and his grayer eyes are sybils of the future the cabin floor was thickly strewn with strange ironclasped folios and mouldering instruments of science and obsolete longforgotten charts his head was bowed down upon his hands and he pored with a fiery unquiet eye over a paper which i took to be a commission and which at all events bore the signature of a monarch he muttered to himself as did the first seaman whom i saw in the hold some low peevish syllables of a foreign tongue and although the speaker was close at my elbow his voice seemed to reach my ears from the distance of a mile        the ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of eld the crew glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries their eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning and when their fingers fall athwart my path in the wild glare of the battlelanterns i feel as i have never felt before although i have been all my life a dealer in antiquities and have imbibed the shadows of fallen columns at balbec and tadmor and persepolis until my very soul has become a ruin        when i look around me i feel ashamed of my former apprehensions if i trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us shall i not stand aghast at a warring of wind and ocean to convey any idea of which the words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective all in the immediate vicinity of the ship is the blackness of eternal night and a chaos of foamless water but about a league on either side of us may be seen indistinctly and at intervals stupendous ramparts of ice towering away into the desolate sky and looking like the walls of the universe        as i imagined the ship proves to be in a current if that appellation can properly be given to a tide which howling and shrieking by the white ice thunders on to the southward with a velocity like the headlong dashing of a cataract        to conceive the horror of my sensations is i presume utterly impossible yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful regions predominates even over my despair and will reconcile me to the most hideous aspect of death it is evident that we are hurrying onwards to some exciting knowledgesome nevertobeimparted secret whose attainment is destruction perhaps this current leads us to the southern pole itself it must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild has every probability in its favor        the crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step but there is upon their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of hope than of the apathy of despair  in the meantime the wind is still in our poop and as we carry a crowd of canvas the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the seaoh horror upon horror the ice opens suddenly to the right and to the left and we are whirling dizzily in immense concentric circles round and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre the summit of whose walls is lost in the darkness and the distance but little time will be left me to ponder upon my destinythe circles rapidly grow smallwe are plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpooland amid a roaring and bellowing and thundering of ocean and of tempest the ship is quivering oh god andgoing down  notethe ms found in a bottle was originally published in 1831 and it was not until many years afterwards that i became acquainted with the maps of mercator in which the ocean is represented as rushing by four mouths into the northern polar gulf to be absorbed into the bowels of the earth the pole itself being represented by a black rock towering to a prodigious height     the oval portrait  the chateau into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance rather than permit me in my desperately wounded condition to pass a night in the open air was one of those piles of commingled gloom and grandeur which have so long frowned among the appennines not less in fact than in the fancy of mrs radcliffe to all appearance it had been temporarily and very lately abandoned we established ourselves in one of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments it lay in a remote turret of the building its decorations were rich yet tattered and antique its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with manifold and multiform armorial trophies together with an unusually great number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of rich golden arabesque in these paintings which depended from the walls not only in their main surfaces but in very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the chateau rendered necessaryin these paintings my incipient delirium perhaps had caused me to take deep interest so that i bade pedro to close the heavy shutters of the roomsince it was already nightto light the tongues of a tall candelabrum which stood by the head of my bedand to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains of black velvet which enveloped the bed itself i wished all this done that i might resign myself if not to sleep at least alternately to the contemplation of these pictures and the perusal of a small volume which had been found upon the pillow and which purported to criticise and describe them  longlong i readand devoutly devotedly i gazed rapidly and gloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came the position of the candelabrum displeased me and outreaching my hand with difficulty rather than disturb my slumbering valet i placed it so as to throw its rays more fully upon the book  but the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated the rays of the numerous candles for there were many now fell within a niche of the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the bedposts i thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before it was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood i glanced at the painting hurriedly and then closed my eyes why i did this was not at first apparent even to my own perception but while my lids remained thus shut i ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting them it was an impulsive movement to gain time for thoughtto make sure that my vision had not deceived meto calm and subdue my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze in a very few moments i again looked fixedly at the painting  that i now saw aright i could not and would not doubt for the first flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to dissipate the dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses and to startle me at once into waking life  the portrait i have already said was that of a young girl it was a mere head and shoulders done in what is technically termed a vignette manner much in the style of the favorite heads of sully the arms the bosom and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into the vague yet deep shadow which formed the background of the whole the frame was oval richly gilded and filigreed in moresque as a thing of art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself but it could have been neither the execution of the work nor the immortal beauty of the countenance which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me least of all could it have been that my fancy shaken from its half slumber had mistaken the head for that of a living person i saw at once that the peculiarities of the design of the vignetting and of the frame must have instantly dispelled such ideamust have prevented even its momentary entertainment thinking earnestly upon these points i remained for an hour perhaps half sitting half reclining with my vision riveted upon the portrait at length satisfied with the true secret of its effect i fell back within the bed i had found the spell of the picture in an absolute lifelikeliness of expression which at first startling finally confounded subdued and appalled me with deep and reverent awe i replaced the candelabrum in its former position the cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view i sought eagerly the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories turning to the number which designated the oval portrait i there read the vague and quaint words which follow  she was a maiden of rarest beauty and not more lovely than full of glee and evil was the hour when she saw and loved and wedded the painter he passionate studious austere and having already a bride in his art she a maiden of rarest beauty and not more lovely than full of glee all light and smiles and frolicsome as the young fawn loving and cherishing all things hating only the art which was her rival dreading only the pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments which deprived her of the countenance of her lover it was thus a terrible thing for this lady to hear the painter speak of his desire to portray even his young bride but she was humble and obedient and sat meekly for many weeks in the dark high turretchamber where the light dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead but he the painter took glory in his work which went on from hour to hour and from day to day and he was a passionate and wild and moody man who became lost in reveries so that he would not see that the light which fell so ghastly in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his bride who pined visibly to all but him yet she smiled on and still on uncomplainingly because she saw that the painter who had high renown took a fervid and burning pleasure in his task and wrought day and night to depict her who so loved him yet who grew daily more dispirited and weak and in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its resemblance in low words as of a mighty marvel and a proof not less of the power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom he depicted so surpassingly well but at length as the labor drew nearer to its conclusion there were admitted none into the turret for the painter had grown wild with the ardor of his work and turned his eyes from canvas merely even to regard the countenance of his wife and he would not see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the cheeks of her who sate beside him and when many weeks had passed and but little remained to do save one brush upon the mouth and one tint upon the eye the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the flame within the socket of the lamp and then the brush was given and then the tint was placed and for one moment the painter stood entranced before the work which he had wrought but in the next while he yet gazed he grew tremulous and very pallid and aghast and crying with a loud voice this is indeed life itself turned suddenly to regard his belovedshe was dead
