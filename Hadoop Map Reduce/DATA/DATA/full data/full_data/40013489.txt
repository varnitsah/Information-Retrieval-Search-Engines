resident in the isles of guernsey jersey alderney and sark the humble dedication of their devoted admirer  sheweth   that your dedicator has perused with feelings of virtuous indignation a work purporting to be sketches of young ladies written by quiz illustrated by phiz and published in one volume square twelvemo  that after an attentive and vigilant perusal of the said work your dedicator is humbly of opinion that so many libels upon your honourable sex were never contained in any previously published work in twelvemo or any other mo  that in the title page and preface to the said work your honourable sex are described and classified as animals and although your dedicator is not at present prepared to deny that you are animals still he humbly submits that it is not polite to call you so  that in the aforesaid preface your honourable sex are also described as troglodites which being a hard word may for aught your honourable sex or your dedicator can say to the contrary be an injurious and disrespectful appellation  that the author of the said work applied himself to his task in malice prepense and with wickedness aforethought a fact which your dedicator contends is sufficiently demonstrated by his assuming the name of quiz which your dedicator submits denotes a foregone conclusion and implies an intention of quizzing  that in the execution of his evil design the said quiz or author of the said work must have betrayed some trust or confidence reposed in him by some members of your honourable sex otherwise he never could have acquired so much information relative to the manners and customs of your honourable sex in general  that actuated by these considerations and further moved by various slanders and insinuations respecting your honourable sex contained in the said work square twelvemo entitled sketches of young ladies your dedicator ventures to produce another work square twelvemo entitled sketches of young gentlemen of which he now solicits your acceptance and approval  that as the young ladies are the best companions of the young gentlemen so the young gentlemen should be the best companions of the young ladies and extending the comparison from animals to quote the disrespectful language of the said quiz to inanimate objects your dedicator humbly suggests that such of your honourable sex as purchased the bane should possess themselves of the antidote and that those of your honourable sex who were not rash enough to take the first should lose no time in swallowing the lastprevention being in all cases better than cure as we are informed upon the authority not only of general acknowledgment but also of traditionary wisdom  that with reference to the said bane and antidote your dedicator has no further remarks to make than are comprised in the printed directions issued with doctor morisons pills namely that whenever your honourable sex take twentyfive of number 1 you will be pleased to take fifty of number 2 without delay  and your dedicator shall ever pray c    the bashful young gentleman    we found ourself seated at a small dinner party the other day opposite a stranger of such singular appearance and manner that he irresistibly attracted our attention  this was a freshcoloured young gentleman with as good a promise of light whisker as one might wish to see and possessed of a very velvetlike softlooking countenance  we do not use the latter term invidiously but merely to denote a pair of smooth plump highlycoloured cheeks of capacious dimensions and a mouth rather remarkable for the fresh hue of the lips than for any marked or striking expression it presented  his whole face was suffused with a crimson blush and bore that downcast timid retiring look which betokens a man ill at ease with himself  there was nothing in these symptoms to attract more than a passing remark but our attention had been originally drawn to the bashful young gentleman on his first appearance in the drawingroom above stairs into which he was no sooner introduced than making his way towards us who were standing in a window and wholly neglecting several persons who warmly accosted him he seized our hand with visible emotion and pressed it with a convulsive grasp for a good couple of minutes after which he dived in a nervous manner across the room oversetting in his way a fine little girl of six years and a quarter oldand shrouding himself behind some hangings was seen no more until the eagle eye of the hostess detecting him in his concealment on the announcement of dinner he was requested to pair off with a lively single lady of two or three and thirty  this most flattering salutation from a perfect stranger would have gratified us not a little as a token of his having held us in high respect and for that reason been desirous of our acquaintance if we had not suspected from the first that the young gentleman in making a desperate effort to get through the ceremony of introduction had in the bewilderment of his ideas shaken hands with us at random  this impression was fully confirmed by the subsequent behaviour of the bashful young gentleman in question which we noted particularly with the view of ascertaining whether we were right in our conjecture  the young gentleman seated himself at table with evident misgivings and turning sharp round to pay attention to some observation of his loquacious neighbour overset his bread  there was nothing very bad in this and if he had had the presence of mind to let it go and say nothing about it nobody but the man who had laid the cloth would have been a bit the wiser but the young gentleman in various semisuccessful attempts to prevent its fall played with it a little as gentlemen in the streets may be seen to do with their hats on a windy day and then giving the roll a smart rap in his anxiety to catch it knocked it with great adroitness into a tureen of white soup at some distance to the unspeakable terror and disturbance of a very amiable bald gentleman who was dispensing the contents  we thought the bashful young gentleman would have gone off in an apoplectic fit consequent upon the violent rush of blood to his face at the occurrence of this catastrophe  from this moment we perceived in the phraseology of the fancy that it was all up with the bashful young gentleman and so indeed it was  several benevolent persons endeavoured to relieve his embarrassment by taking wine with him but finding that it only augmented his sufferings and that after mingling sherry champagne hock and moselle together he applied the greater part of the mixture externally instead of internally they gradually dropped off and left him to the exclusive care of the talkative lady who not noting the wildness of his eye firmly believed she had secured a listener  he broke a glass or two in the course of the meal and disappeared shortly afterwards it is inferred that he went away in some confusion inasmuch as he left the house in another gentlemans coat and the footmans hat  this little incident led us to reflect upon the most prominent characteristics of bashful young gentlemen in the abstract and as this portable volume will be the great textbook of young ladies in all future generations we record them here for their guidance and behoof  if the bashful young gentleman in turning a street corner chance to stumble suddenly upon two or three young ladies of his acquaintance nothing can exceed his confusion and agitation  his first impulse is to make a great variety of bows and dart past them which he does until observing that they wish to stop but are uncertain whether to do so or not he makes several feints of returning which causes them to do the same and at length after a great quantity of unnecessary dodging and falling up against the other passengers he returns and shakes hands most affectionately with all of them in doing which he knocks out of their grasp sundry little parcels which he hastily picks up and returns very muddy and disordered  the chances are that the bashful young gentleman then observes it is very fine weather and being reminded that it has only just left off raining for the first time these three days he blushes very much and smiles as if he had said a very good thing  the young lady who was most anxious to speak here inquires with an air of great commiseration how his dear sister harriet is today to which the young gentleman without the slightest consideration replies with many thanks that she is remarkably well  well mr hopkins cries the young lady why we heard she was bled yesterday evening and have been perfectly miserable about her  oh ah says the young gentleman so she was  oh shes very ill very ill indeed  the young gentleman then shakes his head and looks very desponding he has been smiling perpetually up to this time and after a short pause gives his glove a great wrench at the wrist and says with a strong emphasis on the adjective good morning good morning and making a great number of bows in acknowledgment of several little messages to his sister walks backward a few paces and comes with great violence against a lamppost knocking his hat off in the contact which in his mental confusion and bodily pain he is going to walk away without until a great roar from a carter attracts his attention when he picks it up and tries to smile cheerfully to the young ladies who are looking back and who he has the satisfaction of seeing are all laughing heartily  at a quadrille party the bashful young gentleman always remains as near the entrance of the room as possible from which position he smiles at the people he knows as they come in and sometimes steps forward to shake hands with more intimate friends  a process which on each repetition seems to turn him a deeper scarlet than before he declines dancing the first set or two observing in a faint voice that he would rather wait a little but at length is absolutely compelled to allow himself to be introduced to a partner when he is led in a great heat and blushing furiously across the room to a spot where halfadozen unknown ladies are congregated together  miss lambert let me introduce mr hopkins for the next quadrille  miss lambert inclines her head graciously  mr hopkins bows and his fair conductress disappears leaving mr hopkins as he too well knows to make himself agreeable  the young lady more than half expects that the bashful young gentleman will say something and the bashful young gentleman feeling this seriously thinks whether he has got anything to say which upon mature reflection he is rather disposed to conclude he has not since nothing occurs to him  meanwhile the young lady after several inspections of her bouquet all made in the expectation that the bashful young gentleman is going to talk whispers her mamma who is sitting next her which whisper the bashful young gentleman immediately suspects and possibly with very good reason must be about him  in this comfortable condition he remains until it is time to stand up when murmuring a will you allow me he gives the young lady his arm and after inquiring where she will stand and receiving a reply that she has no choice conducts her to the remotest corner of the quadrille and making one attempt at conversation which turns out a desperate failure preserves a profound silence until it is all over when he walks her twice round the room deposits her in her old seat and retires in confusion  a married bashful gentlemanfor these bashful gentlemen do get married sometimes how it is ever brought about is a mystery to usa married bashful gentleman either causes his wife to appear bold by contrast or merges her proper importance in his own insignificance  bashful young gentlemen should be cured or avoided  they are never hopeless and never will be while female beauty and attractions retain their influence as any young lady will find who may think it worth while on this confident assurance to take a patient in hand    the outandout young gentleman    outandout young gentlemen may be divided into two classesthose who have something to do and those who have nothing  i shall commence with the former because that species come more frequently under the notice of young ladies whom it is our province to warn and to instruct  the outandout young gentleman is usually no great dresser his instructions to his tailor being all comprehended in the one general direction to make that whatsaname a regular bangup sort of thing  for some years past the favourite costume of the outandout young gentleman has been a rough pilot coat with two gilt hooks and eyes to the velvet collar buttons somewhat larger than crownpieces a black or fancy neckerchief loosely tied a widebrimmed hat with a low crown tightish inexpressibles and ironshod boots  out of doors he sometimes carries a large ash stick but only on special occasions for he prefers keeping his hands in his coat pockets  he smokes at all hours of course and swears considerably  the outandout young gentleman is employed in a city counting house or solicitors office in which he does as little as he possibly can  his chief places of resort are the streets the taverns and the theatres  in the streets at evening time out andout young gentlemen have a pleasant custom of walking six or eight abreast thus driving females and other inoffensive persons into the road which never fails to afford them the highest satisfaction especially if there be any immediate danger of their being run over which enhances the fun of the thing materially  in all places of public resort the outandouters are careful to select each a seat to himself upon which he lies at full length and if the weather be very dirty but not in any other case he lies with his knees up and the soles of his boots planted firmly on the cushion so that if any low fellow should ask him to make room for a lady he takes ample revenge upon her dress without going at all out of his way to do it  he always sits with his hat on and flourishes his stick in the air while the play is proceeding with a dignified contempt of the performance if it be possible for one or two outandout young gentlemen to get up a little crowding in the passages they are quite in their element squeezing pushing whooping and shouting in the most humorous manner possible  if they can only succeed in irritating the gentleman who has a family of daughters under his charge they are like to die with laughing and boast of it among their companions for a week afterwards adding that one or two of them were devilish fine girls and that they really thought the youngest would have fainted which was the only thing wanted to render the joke complete  if the outandout young gentleman have a mother and sisters of course he treats them with becoming contempt inasmuch as they poor things having no notion of life or gaiety are far too weakspirited and moping for him  sometimes however on a birth day or at christmastime he cannot very well help accompanying them to a party at some old friends with which view he comes home when they have been dressed an hour or two smelling very strongly of tobacco and spirits and after exchanging his rough coat for some more suitable attire in which however he loses nothing of the outandouter gets into the coach and grumbles all the way at his own good nature  his bitter reflections aggravated by the recollection that tom smith has taken the chair at a little impromptu dinner at a fighting mans and that a setto was to take place on a diningtable between the fighting man and his brother inlaw which is probably coming off at that very instant  as the outandout young gentleman is by no means at his ease in ladies society he shrinks into a corner of the drawingroom when they reach the friends and unless one of his sisters is kind enough to talk to him remains there without being much troubled by the attentions of other people until he espies lingering outside the door another gentleman whom he at once knows by his air and manner for there is a kind of freemasonry in the craft to be a brother outandouter and towards whom he accordingly makes his way  conversation being soon opened by some casual remark the second outandouter confidentially informs the first that he is one of the rough sort and hates that kind of thing only he couldnt very well be off coming to which the other replies that thats just his caseand ill tell you what continues the out andouter in a whisper i should like a glass of warm brandy and water just nowor a pint of stout and a pipe suggests the other outandouter  the discovery is at once made that they are sympathetic souls each of them says at the same moment that he sees the other understands whats what  and they become fast friends at once more especially when it appears that the second outandouter is no other than a gentleman long favourably known to his familiars as mr warmint blake who upon divers occasions has distinguished himself in a manner that would not have disgraced the fighting man and who having been a pretty long time about townhad the honour of once shaking hands with the celebrated mr thurtell himself  at supper these gentlemen greatly distinguish themselves brightening up very much when the ladies leave the table and proclaiming aloud their intention of beginning to spend the eveninga process which is generally understood to be satisfactorily performed when a great deal of wine is drunk and a great deal of noise made both of which feats the outandout young gentlemen execute to perfection  having protracted their sitting until long after the host and the other guests have adjourned to the drawingroom and finding that they have drained the decanters empty they follow them thither with complexions rather heightened and faces rather bloated with wine and the agitated lady of the house whispers her friends as they waltz together to the great terror of the whole room that both mr blake and mr dummins are very nice sort of young men in their way only they are eccentric persons and unfortunately rather too wild  the remaining class of outandout young gentlemen is composed of persons who having no money of their own and a soul above earning any enjoy similar pleasures nobody knows how  these respectable gentlemen without aiming quite so much at the outandout in external appearance are distinguished by all the same amiable and attractive characteristics in an equal or perhaps greater degree and now and then find their way into society through the medium of the other class of outandout young gentlemen who will sometimes carry them home and who usually pay their tavern bills  as they are equally gentlemanly clever witty intelligent wise and wellbred we need scarcely have recommended them to the peculiar consideration of the young ladies if it were not that some of the gentle creatures whom we hold in such high respect are perhaps a little too apt to confound a great many heavier terms with the light word eccentricity which we beg them henceforth to take in a strictly johnsonian sense without any liberality or latitude of construction    the very friendly young gentleman    we knowand all people knowso many specimens of this class that in selecting the few heads our limits enable us to take from a great number we have been induced to give the very friendly young gentleman the preference over many others to whose claims upon a more cursory view of the question we had felt disposed to assign the priority  the very friendly young gentleman is very friendly to everybody but he attaches himself particularly to two or at most to three families  regulating his choice by their dinners their circle of acquaintance or some other criterion in which he has an immediate interest  he is of any age between twenty and forty unmarried of course must be fond of children and is expected to make himself generally useful if possible  let us illustrate our meaning by an example which is the shortest mode and the clearest  we encountered one day by chance an old friend of whom we had lost sight for some years and whoexpressing a strong anxiety to renew our former intimacyurged us to dine with him on an early day that we might talk over old times  we readily assented adding that we hoped we should be alone  oh certainly certainly said our friend not a soul with us but mincin  and who is mincin was our natural inquiry  o dont mind him replied our friend hes a most particular friend of mine and a very friendly fellow you will find him and so he left us  we thought no more about mincin until we duly presented ourselves at the house next day when after a hearty welcome our friend motioned towards a gentleman who had been previously showing his teeth by the fireplace and gave us to understand that it was mr mincin of whom he had spoken  it required no great penetration on our part to discover at once that mr mincin was in every respect a very friendly young gentleman  i am delighted said mincin hastily advancing and pressing our hand warmly between both of his i am delighted i am sure to make your acquaintancehere he smiledvery much delighted indeed here he exhibited a little emotioni assure you that i have looked forward to it anxiously for a very long time here he released our hands and rubbing his own observed that the day was severe but that he was delighted to perceive from our appearance that it agreed with us wonderfully and then went on to observe that notwithstanding the coldness of the weather he had that morning seen in the paper an exceedingly curious paragraph to the effect that there was now in the garden of mr wilkins of chichester a pumpkin measuring four feet in height and eleven feet seven inches in circumference which he looked upon as a very extraordinary piece of intelligence  we ventured to remark that we had a dim recollection of having once or twice before observed a similar paragraph in the public prints upon which mr mincin took us confidentially by the button and said exactly exactly to be sure we were very right and he wondered what the editors meant by putting in such things  who the deuce he should like to know did they suppose cared about them that struck him as being the best of it  the lady of the house appeared shortly afterwards and mr mincins friendliness as will readily be supposed suffered no diminution in consequence he exerted much strength and skill in wheeling a large easychair up to the fire and the lady being seated in it carefully closed the door stirred the fire and looked to the windows to see that they admitted no air having satisfied himself upon all these points he expressed himself quite easy in his mind and begged to know how she found herself today  upon the ladys replying very well mr mincin who it appeared was a medical gentleman offered some general remarks upon the nature and treatment of colds in the head which occupied us agreeably until dinnertime  during the meal he devoted himself to complimenting everybody not forgetting himself so that we were an uncommonly agreeable quartette  ill tell you what capper said mr mincin to our host as he closed the room door after the lady had retired you have very great reason to be fond of your wife  sweet woman mrs capper sir  nay mincini beg interposed the host as we were about to reply that mrs capper unquestionably was particularly sweet pray mincin dont  why not exclaimed mr mincin why not why should you feel any delicacy before your old friendour old friend if i may be allowed to call you so sir why should you i ask  we of course wished to know why he should also upon which our friend admitted that mrs capper was a very sweet woman at which admission mr mincin cried bravo and begged to propose mrs capper with heartfelt enthusiasm whereupon our host said thank you mincin with deep feeling and gave us in a low voice to understand that mincin had saved mrs cappers cousins life no less than fourteen times in a year and a half which he considered no common circumstancean opinion to which we most cordially subscribed  now that we three were left to entertain ourselves with conversation mr mincins extreme friendliness became every moment more apparent he was so amazingly friendly indeed that it was impossible to talk about anything in which he had not the chief concern  we happened to allude to some affairs in which our friend and we had been mutually engaged nearly fourteen years before when mr mincin was all at once reminded of a joke which our friend had made on that day four years which he positively must insist upon tellingand which he did tell accordingly with many pleasant recollections of what he said and what mrs capper said and how he well remembered that they had been to the play with orders on the very night previous and had seen romeo and juliet and the pantomime and how mrs capper being faint had been led into the lobby where she smiled said it was nothing after all and went back again with many other interesting and absorbing particulars after which the friendly young gentleman went on to assure us that our friend had experienced a marvellously prophetic opinion of that same pantomime which was of such an admirable kind that two morning papers took the same view next day  to this our friend replied with a little triumph that in that instance he had some reason to think he had been correct which gave the friendly young gentleman occasion to believe that our friend was always correct and so we went on until our friend filling a bumper said he must drink one glass to his dear friend mincin than whom he would say no man saved the lives of his acquaintances more or had a more friendly heart  finally our friend having emptied his glass said god bless you mincinand mr mincin and he shook hands across the table with much affection and earnestness  but great as the friendly young gentleman is in a limited scene like this he plays the same part on a larger scale with increased eclat  mr mincin is invited to an evening party with his dear friends the martins where he meets his dear friends the cappers and his dear friends the watsons and a hundred other dear friends too numerous to mention  he is as much at home with the martins as with the cappers but how exquisitely he balances his attentions and divides them among his dear friends  if he flirts with one of the miss watsons he has one little martin on the sofa pulling his hair and the other little martin on the carpet riding on his foot he carries mrs watson down to supper on one arm and miss martin on the other and takes wine so judiciously and in such exact order that it is impossible for the most punctilious old lady to consider herself neglected  if any young lady being prevailed upon to sing become nervous afterwards mr mincin leads her tenderly into the next room and restores her with port wine which she must take medicinally  if any gentleman be standing by the piano during the progress of the ballad mr mincin seizes him by the arm at one point of the melody and softly beating time the while with his head expresses in dumb show his intense perception of the delicacy of the passage  if anybodys selflove is to be flattered mr mincin is at hand  if anybodys overweening vanity is to be pampered mr mincin will surfeit it  what wonder that people of all stations and ages recognise mr mincins friendliness that he is universally allowed to be handsome as amiable that mothers think him an oracle daughters a dear brothers a beau and fathers a wonder  and who would not have the reputation of the very friendly young gentleman    the military young gentleman    we are rather at a loss to imagine how it has come to pass that military young gentlemen have obtained so much favour in the eyes of the young ladies of this kingdom  we cannot think so lightly of them as to suppose that the mere circumstance of a mans wearing a red coat ensures him a ready passport to their regard and even if this were the case it would be no satisfactory explanation of the circumstance because although the analogy may in some degree hold good in the case of mail coachmen and guards still general postmen wear red coats and they are not to our knowledge better received than other men nor are firemen either who wear or used to wear not only red coats but very resplendent and massive badges besidesmuch larger than epaulettes  neither do the twopenny post office boys if the result of our inquiries be correct find any peculiar favour in womans eyes although they wear very bright red jackets and have the additional advantage of constantly appearing in public on horseback which last circumstance may be naturally supposed to be greatly in their favour  we have sometimes thought that this phenomenon may take its rise in the conventional behaviour of captains and colonels and other gentlemen in red coats on the stage where they are invariably represented as fine swaggering fellows talking of nothing but charming girls their king and country their honour and their debts and crowing over the inferior classes of the community whom they occasionally treat with a little gentlemanly swindling no less to the improvement and pleasure of the audience than to the satisfaction and approval of the choice spirits who consort with them  but we will not devote these pages to our speculations upon the subject inasmuch as our business at the present moment is not so much with the young ladies who are bewitched by her majestys livery as with the young gentlemen whose heads are turned by it for heads we had written brains but upon consideration we think the former the more appropriate word of the two  these young gentlemen may be divided into two classesyoung gentlemen who are actually in the army and young gentlemen who having an intense and enthusiastic admiration for all things appertaining to a military life are compelled by adverse fortune or adverse relations to wear out their existence in some ignoble countinghouse  we will take this latter description of military young gentlemen first  the whole heart and soul of the military young gentleman are concentrated in his favourite topic  there is nothing that he is so learned upon as uniforms he will tell you without faltering for an instant what the habiliments of any one regiment are turned up with what regiment wear stripes down the outside and inside of the leg and how many buttons the tenth had on their coats he knows to a fraction how many yards and odd inches of gold lace it takes to make an ensign in the guards is deeply read in the comparative merits of different bands and the apparelling of trumpeters and is very luminous indeed in descanting upon crack regiments and the crack gentlemen who compose them of whose mightiness and grandeur he is never tired of telling  we were suggesting to a military young gentleman only the other day after he had related to us several dazzling instances of the profusion of halfadozen honourable ensign somebodies or nobodies in the articles of kid gloves and polished boots that possibly cracked regiments would be an improvement upon crack as being a more expressive and appropriate designation when he suddenly interrupted us by pulling out his watch and observing that he must hurry off to the park in a cab or he would be too late to hear the band play  not wishing to interfere with so important an engagement and being in fact already slightly overwhelmed by the anecdotes of the honourable ensigns aforementioned we made no attempt to detain the military young gentleman but parted company with ready goodwill  some three or four hours afterwards we chanced to be walking down whitehall on the admiralty side of the way when as we drew near to one of the little stone places in which a couple of horse soldiers mount guard in the daytime we were attracted by the motionless appearance and eager gaze of a young gentleman who was devouring both man and horse with his eyes so eagerly that he seemed deaf and blind to all that was passing around him  we were not much surprised at the discovery that it was our friend the military young gentleman but we were a little astonished when we returned from a walk to south lambeth to find him still there looking on with the same intensity as before  as it was a very windy day we felt bound to awaken the young gentleman from his reverie when he inquired of us with great enthusiasm whether that was not a glorious spectacle and proceeded to give us a detailed account of the weight of every article of the spectacles trappings from the mans gloves to the horses shoes  we have made it a practice since to take the horse guards in our daily walk and we find it is the custom of military young gentlemen to plant themselves opposite the sentries and contemplate them at leisure in periods varying from fifteen minutes to fifty and averaging twentyfive  we were much struck a day or two since by the behaviour of a very promising young butcher who evincing an interest in the service which cannot be too strongly commanded or encouraged after a prolonged inspection of the sentry proceeded to handle his boots with great curiosity and as much composure and indifference as if the man were waxwork  but the really military young gentleman is waiting all this time and at the very moment that an apology rises to our lips he emerges from the barrack gate he is quartered in a garrison town and takes the way towards the high street  he wears his undress uniform which somewhat mars the glory of his outward man but still how great how grand he is  what a happy mixture of ease and ferocity in his gait and carriage and how lightly he carries that dreadful sword under his arm making no more ado about it than if it were a silk umbrella  the lion is sleeping  only think if an enemy were in sight how soon hed whip it out of the scabbard and what a terrible fellow he would be  but he walks on thinking of nothing less than blood and slaughter and now he comes in sight of three other military young gentlemen arminarm who are bearing down towards him clanking their iron heels on the pavement and clashing their swords with a noise which should cause all peaceful men to quail at heart  they stop to talk  see how the flaxenhaired young gentleman with the weak legshe who has his pockethandkerchief thrust into the breast of his coatglares upon the fainthearted civilians who linger to look upon his glory how the next young gentleman elevates his head in the air and majestically places his arms akimbo while the third stands with his legs very wide apart and clasps his hands behind him  well may we inquirenot in familiar jest but in respectful earnestif you call that nothing  oh if some encroaching foreign powerthe emperor of russia for instance or any of those deep fellows could only see those military young gentlemen as they move on together towards the billiardroom over the way wouldnt he tremble a little  and then at the theatre at night when the performances are by command of colonel fitzsordust and the officers of the garrison what a splendid sight it is  how sternly the defenders of their country look round the house as if in mute assurance to the audience that they may make themselves comfortable regarding any foreign invasion for they the military young gentlemen are keeping a sharp lookout and are ready for anything  and what a contrast between them and that stagebox full of greyheaded officers with tokens of many battles about them who have nothing at all in common with the military young gentlemen and whobut for an oldfashioned kind of manly dignity in their looks and bearing might be common hardworking soldiers for anything they take the pains to announce to the contrary  ah here is a family just come in who recognise the flaxenheaded young gentleman and the flaxenheaded young gentleman recognises them too only he doesnt care to show it just now  very well done indeed  he talks louder to the little group of military young gentlemen who are standing by him and coughs to induce some ladies in the next box but one to look round in order that their faces may undergo the same ordeal of criticism to which they have subjected in not a wholly inaudible tone the majority of the female portion of the audience  oh a gentleman in the same box looks round as if he were disposed to resent this as an impertinence and the flaxenheaded young gentleman sees his friends at once and hurries away to them with the most charming cordiality  three young ladies one young man and the mamma of the party receive the military young gentleman with great warmth and politeness and in five minutes afterwards the military young gentleman stimulated by the mamma introduces the two other military young gentlemen with whom he was walking in the morning who take their seats behind the young ladies and commence conversation whereat the mamma bestows a triumphant bow upon a rival mamma who has not succeeded in decoying any military young gentlemen and prepares to consider her visitors from that moment three of the most elegant and superior young gentlemen in the whole world    the political young gentleman    once upon a timenot in the days when pigs drank wine but in a more recent period of our historyit was customary to banish politics when ladies were present  if this usage still prevailed we should have had no chapter for political young gentlemen for ladies would have neither known nor cared what kind of monster a political young gentleman was  but as this good custom in common with many others has gone out and left no word when it is likely to be home again as political young ladies are by no means rare and political young gentlemen the very reverse of scarce we are bound in the strict discharge of our most responsible duty not to neglect this natural division of our subject  if the political young gentleman be resident in a country town and there are political young gentlemen in country towns sometimes he is wholly absorbed in his politics as a pair of purple spectacles communicate the same uniform tint to all objects near and remote so the political glasses with which the young gentleman assists his mental vision give to everything the hue and tinge of party feeling  the political young gentleman would as soon think of being struck with the beauty of a young lady in the opposite interest as he would dream of marrying his sister to the opposite member  if the political young gentleman be a conservative he has usually some vague ideas about ireland and the pope which he cannot very clearly explain but which he knows are the right sort of thing and not to be very easily got over by the other side  he has also some choice sentences regarding church and state culled from the banners in use at the last election with which he intersperses his conversation at intervals with surprising effect  but his great topic is the constitution upon which he will declaim by the hour together with much heat and fury not that he has any particular information on the subject but because he knows that the constitution is somehow church and state and church and state somehow the constitution and that the fellows on the other side say it isnt which is quite a sufficient reason for him to say it is and to stick to it  perhaps his greatest topic of all though is the people  if a fight takes place in a populous town in which many noses are broken and a few windows the young gentleman throws down the newspaper with a triumphant air and exclaims heres your precious people  if halfadozen boys run across the course at race time when it ought to be kept clear the young gentleman looks indignantly round and begs you to observe the conduct of the people if the gallery demand a hornpipe between the play and the afterpiece the same young gentleman cries no and shame till he is hoarse and then inquires with a sneer what you think of popular moderation now in short the people form a neverfailing theme for him and when the attorney on the side of his candidate dwells upon it with great power of eloquence at election time as he never fails to do the young gentleman and his friends and the body they head cheer with great violence against the other people with whom of course they have no possible connexion  in much the same manner the audience at a theatre never fail to be highly amused with any jokes at the expense of the publicalways laughing heartily at some other public and never at themselves  if the political young gentleman be a radical he is usually a very profound person indeed having great store of theoretical questions to put to you with an infinite variety of possible cases and logical deductions therefrom  if he be of the utilitarian school too which is more than probable he is particularly pleasant company having many ingenious remarks to offer upon the voluntary principle and various cheerful disquisitions connected with the population of the country the position of great britain in the scale of nations and the balance of power  then he is exceedingly well versed in all doctrines of political economy as laid down in the newspapers and knows a great many parliamentary speeches by heart nay he has a small stock of aphorisms none of them exceeding a couple of lines in length which will settle the toughest question and leave you nothing to say  he gives all the young ladies to understand that miss martineau is the greatest woman that ever lived and when they praise the good looks of mr hawkins the new member says hes very well for a representative all things considered but he wants a little calling to account and he is more than half afraid it will be necessary to bring him down on his knees for that vote on the miscellaneous estimates  at this the young ladies express much wonderment and say surely a member of parliament is not to be brought upon his knees so easily in reply to which the political young gentleman smiles sternly and throws out dark hints regarding the speedy arrival of that day when members of parliament will be paid salaries and required to render weekly accounts of their proceedings at which the young ladies utter many expressions of astonishment and incredulity while their ladymothers regard the prophecy as little else than blasphemous  it is extremely improving and interesting to hear two political young gentlemen of diverse opinions discuss some great question across a dinnertable such as whether if the public were admitted to westminster abbey for nothing they would or would not convey small chisels and hammers in their pockets and immediately set about chipping all the noses off the statues or whether if they once got into the tower for a shilling they would not insist upon trying the crown on their own heads and loading and firing off all the small arms in the armoury to the great discomposure of whitechapel and the minories  upon these and many other momentous questions which agitate the public mind in these desperate days they will discourse with great vehemence and irritation for a considerable time together both leaving off precisely where they began and each thoroughly persuaded that he has got the better of the other  in society at assemblies balls and playhouses these political young gentlemen are perpetually on the watch for a political allusion or anything which can be tortured or construed into being one when thrusting themselves into the very smallest openings for their favourite discourse they fall upon the unhappy company tooth and nail  they have recently had many favourable opportunities of opening in churches but as there the clergyman has it all his own way and must not be contradicted whatever politics he preaches they are fain to hold their tongues until they reach the outer door though at the imminent risk of bursting in the effort  as such discussions can please nobody but the talkative parties concerned we hope they will henceforth take the hint and discontinue them otherwise we now give them warning that the ladies have our advice to discountenance such talkers altogether    the domestic young gentleman    let us make a slight sketch of our amiable friend mr felix nixon we are strongly disposed to think that if we put him in this place he will answer our purpose without another word of comment  felix then is a young gentleman who lives at home with his mother just within the twopennypost office circle of three miles from st martinlegrand  he wears indiarubber goloshes when the weather is at all damp and always has a silk handkerchief neatly folded up in the righthand pocket of his greatcoat to tie over his mouth when he goes home at night moreover being rather near sighted he carries spectacles for particular occasions and has a weakish tremulous voice of which he makes great use for he talks as much as any old lady breathing  the two chief subjects of felixs discourse are himself and his mother both of whom would appear to be very wonderful and interesting persons  as felix and his mother are seldom apart in body so felix and his mother are scarcely ever separate in spirit if you ask felix how he finds himself today he prefaces his reply with a long and minute bulletin of his mothers state of health and the good lady in her turn edifies her acquaintance with a circumstantial and alarming account how he sneezed four times and coughed once after being out in the rain the other night but having his feet promptly put into hot water and his head into a flannelsomething which we will not describe more particularly than by this delicate allusion was happily brought round by the next morning and enabled to go to business as usual  our friend is not a very adventurous or hotheaded person but he has passed through many dangers as his mother can testify  there is one great story in particular concerning a hackney coachman who wanted to overcharge him one night for bringing them home from the play upon which felix gave the aforesaid coachman a look which his mother thought would have crushed him to the earth but which did not crush him quite for he continued to demand another sixpence notwithstanding that felix took out his pocketbook and with the aid of a flat candle pointed out the fare in print which the coachman obstinately disregarding he shut the streetdoor with a slam which his mother shudders to think of and then roused to the most appalling pitch of passion by the coachman knocking a double knock to show that he was by no means convinced he broke with uncontrollable force from his parent and the servant girl and running into the street without his hat actually shook his fist at the coachman and came back again with a face as white mrs nixon says looking about her for a simile as white as that ceiling she never will forget his fury that night never  to this account felix listens with a solemn face occasionally looking at you to see how it affects you and when his mother has made an end of it adds that he looked at every coachman he met for three weeks afterwards in hopes that he might see the scoundrel whereupon mrs nixon with an exclamation of terror requests to know what he would have done to him if he had seen him at which felix smiling darkly and clenching his right fist she exclaims goodness gracious with a distracted air and insists upon extorting a promise that he never will on any account do anything so rash which her dutiful sonit being something more than three years since the offence was committedreluctantly concedes and his mother shaking her head prophetically fears with a sigh that his spirit will lead him into something violent yet  the discourse then by an easy transition turns upon the spirit which glows within the bosom of felix upon which point felix himself becomes eloquent and relates a thrilling anecdote of the time when he used to sit up till two oclock in the morning reading french and how his mother used to say felix you will make yourself ill i know you will and how he used to say mother i dont carei will do it and how at last his mother privately procured a doctor to come and see him who declared the moment he felt his pulse that if he had gone on reading one night moreonly one night morehe must have put a blister on each temple and another between his shoulders and who as it was sat down upon the instant and writing a prescription for a blue pill said it must be taken immediately or he wouldnt answer for the consequences  the recital of these and many other moving perils of the like nature constantly harrows up the feelings of mr nixons friends  mrs nixon has a tolerably extensive circle of female acquaintance being a goodhumoured talkative bustling little body and to the unmarried girls among them she is constantly vaunting the virtues of her son hinting that she will be a very happy person who wins him but that they must mind their ps and qs for he is very particular and terribly severe upon young ladies  at this last caution the young ladies resident in the same row who happen to be spending the evening there put their pockethandkerchiefs before their mouths and are troubled with a short cough just then felix knocks at the door and his mother drawing the teatable nearer the fire calls out to him as he takes off his boots in the back parlour that he neednt mind coming in in his slippers for there are only the two miss greys and miss thompson and she is quite sure they will excuse him and nodding to the two miss greys she adds in a whisper that julia thompson is a great favourite with felix at which intelligence the short cough comes again and miss thompson in particular is greatly troubled with it till felix coming in very faint for want of his tea changes the subject of discourse and enables her to laugh out boldly and tell amelia grey not to be so foolish  here they all three laugh and mrs nixon says they are giddy girls in which stage of the proceedings felix who has by this time refreshened himself with the grateful herb that cheers but not inebriates removes his cup from his countenance and says with a knowing smile that all girls are whereat his admiring mamma pats him on the back and tells him not to be sly which calls forth a general laugh from the young ladies and another smile from felix who thinking he looks very sly indeed is perfectly satisfied  tea being over the young ladies resume their work and felix insists upon holding a skein of silk while miss thompson winds it on a card  this process having been performed to the satisfaction of all parties he brings down his flute in compliance with a request from the youngest miss grey and plays divers tunes out of a very small musicbook till suppertime when he is very facetious and talkative indeed  finally after half a tumblerful of warm sherry and water he gallantly puts on his goloshes over his slippers and telling miss thompsons servant to run on first and get the door open escorts that young lady to her house five doors off  the miss greys who live in the next house but one stopping to peep with merry faces from their own door till he comes back again when they call out very well mr felix and trip into the passage with a laugh more musical than any flute that was ever played  felix is rather prim in his appearance and perhaps a little priggish about his books and flute and so forth which have all their peculiar corners of peculiar shelves in his bedroom indeed all his female acquaintance and they are good judges have long ago set him down as a thorough old bachelor  he is a favourite with them however in a certain way as an honest inoffensive kindhearted creature and as his peculiarities harm nobody not even himself we are induced to hope that many who are not personally acquainted with him will take our good word in his behalf and be content to leave him to a long continuance of his harmless existence    the censorious young gentleman    there is an amiable kind of young gentleman going about in society upon whom after much experience of him and considerable turning over of the subject in our mind we feel it our duty to affix the above appellation  young ladies mildly call him a sarcastic young gentleman or a severe young gentleman  we who know better beg to acquaint them with the fact that he is merely a censorious young gentleman and nothing else  the censorious young gentleman has the reputation among his familiars of a remarkably clever person which he maintains by receiving all intelligence and expressing all opinions with a dubious sneer accompanied with a half smile expressive of anything you please but goodhumour  this sets people about thinking what on earth the censorious young gentleman means and they speedily arrive at the conclusion that he means something very deep indeed for they reason in this waythis young gentleman looks so very knowing that he must mean something and as i am by no means a dull individual what a very deep meaning he must have if i cant find it out  it is extraordinary how soon a censorious young gentleman may make a reputation in his own small circle if he bear this in his mind and regulate his proceedings accordingly  as young ladies are generallynot curious but laudably desirous to acquire information the censorious young gentleman is much talked about among them and many surmises are hazarded regarding him  i wonder exclaims the eldest miss greenwood laying down her work to turn up the lamp i wonder whether mr fairfax will ever be married  bless me dear cries miss marshall what ever made you think of him  really i hardly know replies miss greenwood he is such a very mysterious person that i often wonder about him  well to tell you the truth replies miss marshall and so do i  here two other young ladies profess that they are constantly doing the like and all present appear in the same condition except one young lady who not scrupling to state that she considers mr fairfax a horror draws down all the opposition of the others which having been expressed in a great many ejaculatory passages such as well did i everand lor emily dear ma takes up the subject and gravely states that she must say she does not think mr fairfax by any means a horror but rather takes him to be a young man of very great ability and i am quite sure adds the worthy lady he always means a great deal more than he says  the door opens at this point of the disclosure and who of all people alive walks into the room but the very mr fairfax who has been the subject of conversation  well it really is curious cries ma we were at that very moment talking about you  you did me great honour replies mr fairfax may i venture to ask what you were saying  why if you must know returns the eldest girl we were remarking what a very mysterious man you are  ay ay observes mr fairfax indeed  now mr fairfax says this ay ay and indeed which are slight words enough in themselves with so very unfathomable an air and accompanies them with such a very equivocal smile that ma and the young ladies are more than ever convinced that he means an immensity and so tell him he is a very dangerous man and seems to be always thinking ill of somebody which is precisely the sort of character the censorious young gentleman is most desirous to establish wherefore he says oh dear no in a tone obviously intended to mean you have me there and which gives them to understand that they have hit the right nail on the very centre of its head  when the conversation ranges from the mystery overhanging the censorious young gentlemans behaviour to the general topics of the day he sustains his character to admiration  he considers the new tragedy well enough for a new tragedy but lord bless uswell no matter he could say a great deal on that point but he would rather not lest he should be thought illnatured as he knows he would be  but is not mr soandsos performance truly charming inquires a young lady  charming replies the censorious young gentleman  oh dear yes certainly very charmingoh very charming indeed  after this he stirs the fire smiling contemptuously all the while  and a modest young gentleman who has been a silent listener thinks what a great thing it must be to have such a critical judgment  of music pictures books and poetry the censorious young gentleman has an equally fine conception  as to men and women he can tell all about them at a glance  now let us hear your opinion of young mrs barker says some great believer in the powers of mr fairfax but dont be too severe  i never am severe replies the censorious young gentleman  well never mind that now  she is very ladylike is she not  ladylike repeats the censorious young gentleman for he always repeats when he is at a loss for anything to say  did you observe her manner  bless my heart and soul mrs thompson did you observe her mannerthats all i ask  i thought i had done so rejoins the poor lady much perplexed i did not observe it very closely perhaps  oh not very closely rejoins the censorious young gentleman triumphantly  very good then i did  let us talk no more about her  the censorious young gentleman purses up his lips and nods his head sagely as he says this and it is forthwith whispered about that mr fairfax who though he is a little prejudiced must be admitted to be a very excellent judge has observed something exceedingly odd in mrs barkers manner    the funny young gentleman    as one funny young gentleman will serve as a sample of all funny young gentlemen we purpose merely to note down the conduct and behaviour of an individual specimen of this class whom we happened to meet at an annual family christmas party in the course of this very last christmas that ever came  we were all seated round a blazing fire which crackled pleasantly as the guests talked merrily and the urn steamed cheerilyfor being an oldfashioned party there was an urn and a teapot besideswhen there came a postmans knock at the door so violent and sudden that it startled the whole circle and actually caused two or three very interesting and most unaffected young ladies to scream aloud and to exhibit many afflicting symptoms of terror and distress until they had been several times assured by their respective adorers that they were in no danger  we were about to remark that it was surely beyond posttime and must have been a runaway knock when our host who had hitherto been paralysed with wonder sank into a chair in a perfect ecstasy of laughter and offered to lay twenty pounds that it was that droll dog griggins he had no sooner said this than the majority of the company and all the children of the house burst into a roar of laughter too as if some inimitable joke flashed upon them simultaneously and gave vent to various exclamations ofto be sure it must be griggins and how like him that was and what spirits he was always in with many other commendatory remarks of the like nature  not having the happiness to know griggins we became extremely desirous to see so pleasant a fellow the more especially as a stout gentleman with a powdered head who was sitting with his breeches buckles almost touching the hob whispered us he was a wit of the first water when the door opened and mr griggins being announced presented himself amidst another shout of laughter and a loud clapping of hands from the younger branches  this welcome he acknowledged by sundry contortions of countenance imitative of the clown in one of the new pantomimes which were so extremely successful that one stout gentleman rolled upon an ottoman in a paroxysm of delight protesting with many gasps that if somebody didnt make that fellow griggins leave off he would be the death of him he knew  at this the company only laughed more boisterously than before and as we always like to accommodate our tone and spirit if possible to the humour of any society in which we find ourself we laughed with the rest and exclaimed oh capital capital as loud as any of them  when he had quite exhausted all beholders mr griggins received the welcomes and congratulations of the circle and went through the needful introductions with much ease and many puns  this ceremony over he avowed his intention of sitting in somebodys lap unless the young ladies made room for him on the sofa which being done after a great deal of tittering and pleasantry he squeezed himself among them and likened his condition to that of love among the roses  at this novel jest we all roared once more  you should consider yourself highly honoured sir said we  sir replied mr griggins you do me proud  here everybody laughed again and the stout gentleman by the fire whispered in our ear that griggins was making a dead set at us  the teathings having been removed we all sat down to a round game and here mr griggins shone forth with peculiar brilliancy abstracting other peoples fish and looking over their hands in the most comical manner  he made one most excellent joke in snuffing a candle which was neither more nor less than setting fire to the hair of a pale young gentleman who sat next him and afterwards begging his pardon with considerable humour  as the young gentleman could not see the joke however possibly in consequence of its being on the top of his own head it did not go off quite as well as it might have done indeed the young gentleman was heard to murmur some general references to impertinence and a rascal and to state the number of his lodgings in an angry tonea turn of the conversation which might have been productive of slaughterous consequences if a young lady betrothed to the young gentleman had not used her immediate influence to bring about a reconciliation  emphatically declaring in an agitated whisper intended for his peculiar edification but audible to the whole table that if he went on in that way she never would think of him otherwise than as a friend though as that she must always regard him  at this terrible threat the young gentleman became calm and the young lady overcome by the revulsion of feeling instantaneously fainted  mr grigginss spirits were slightly depressed for a short period by this unlookedfor result of such a harmless pleasantry but being promptly elevated by the attentions of the host and several glasses of wine he soon recovered and became even more vivacious than before insomuch that the stout gentleman previously referred to assured us that although he had known him since he was that high something smaller than a nutmeggrater he had never beheld him in such excellent cue  when the round game and several games at blind mans buff which followed it were all over and we were going down to supper the inexhaustible mr griggins produced a small sprig of mistletoe from his waistcoat pocket and commenced a general kissing of the assembled females which occasioned great commotion and much excitement  we observed that several young gentlemenincluding the young gentleman with the pale countenancewere greatly scandalised at this indecorous proceeding and talked very big among themselves in corners and we observed too that several young ladies when remonstrated with by the aforesaid young gentlemen called each other to witness how they had struggled and protested vehemently that it was very rude and that they were surprised at mrs browns allowing it and that they couldnt bear it and had no patience with such impertinence  but such is the gentle and forgiving nature of woman that although we looked very narrowly for it we could not detect the slightest harshness in the subsequent treatment of mr griggins  indeed upon the whole it struck us that among the ladies he seemed rather more popular than before  to recount all the drollery of mr griggins at supper would fill such a tiny volume as this to the very bottom of the outside cover  how he drank out of other peoples glasses and ate of other peoples bread how he frightened into screaming convulsions a little boy who was sitting up to supper in a high chair by sinking below the table and suddenly reappearing with a mask on how the hostess was really surprised that anybody could find a pleasure in tormenting children and how the host frowned at the hostess and felt convinced that mr griggins had done it with the very best intentions how mr griggins explained and how everybodys goodhumour was restored but the childsto tell these and a hundred other things ever so briefly would occupy more of our room and our readers patience than either they or we can conveniently spare  therefore we change the subject merely observing that we have offered no description of the funny young gentlemans personal appearance believing that almost every society has a griggins of its own and leaving all readers to supply the deficiency according to the particular circumstances of their particular case    the theatrical young gentleman    all gentlemen who love the dramaand there are few gentlemen who are not attached to the most intellectual and rational of all our amusementsdo not come within this definition  as we have no mean relish for theatrical entertainments ourself we are disinterestedly anxious that this should be perfectly understood  the theatrical young gentleman has early and important information on all theatrical topics  well says he abruptly when you meet him in the street heres a pretty todo  flimkins has thrown up his part in the melodrama at the surreyand whats to be done you inquire with as much gravity as you can counterfeit  ah thats the point replies the theatrical young gentleman looking very serious boozle declines it positively declines it  from all i am told i should say it was decidedly in boozles line and that he would be very likely to make a great hit in it but he objects on the ground of flimkins having been put up in the part first and says no earthly power shall induce him to take the character  its a fine part tooexcellent business im told  he has to kill six people in the course of the piece and to fight over a bridge in red fire which is as safe a card you know as can be  dont mention it but i hear that the last scene when he is first poisoned and then stabbed by mrs flimkins as vengedora will be the greatest thing that has been done these many years with this piece of news and laying his finger on his lips as a caution for you not to excite the town with it the theatrical young gentleman hurries away  the theatrical young gentleman from often frequenting the different theatrical establishments has pet and familiar names for them all  thus coventgarden is the garden drurylane the lane the victoria the vic and the olympic the pic  actresses too are always designated by their surnames only as taylor nisbett faucit honey that talented and ladylike girl sheriff that clever little creature horton and so on  in the same manner he prefixes christian names when he mentions actors as charley young jemmy buckstone fred yates paul bedford  when he is at a loss for a christian name the word old applied indiscriminately answers quite as well  as old charley matthews at vestriss old harley and old braham  he has a great knowledge of the private proceedings of actresses especially of their getting married and can tell you in a breath halfadozen who have changed their names without avowing it  whenever an alteration of this kind is made in the playbills he will remind you that he let you into the secret six months ago  the theatrical young gentleman has a great reverence for all that is connected with the stage department of the different theatres he would at any time prefer going a street or two out of his way to omitting to pass a stageentrance into which he always looks with a curious and searching eye  if he can only identify a popular actor in the street he is in a perfect transport of delight and no sooner meets him than he hurries back and walks a few paces in front of him so that he can turn round from time to time and have a good stare at his features  he looks upon a theatricalfund dinner as one of the most enchanting festivities ever known and thinks that to be a member of the garrick club and see so many actors in their plain clothes must be one of the highest gratifications the world can bestow  the theatrical young gentleman is a constant halfprice visitor at one or other of the theatres and has an infinite relish for all pieces which display the fullest resources of the establishment he likes to place implicit reliance upon the playbills when he goes to see a showpiece and works himself up to such a pitch of enthusiasm as not only to believe if the bills say so that there are three hundred and seventyfive people on the stage at one time in the last scene but is highly indignant with you unless you believe it also  he considers that if the stage be opened from the footlights to the back wall in any new play the piece is a triumph of dramatic writing and applauds accordingly  he has a great notion of trapdoors too and thinks any character going down or coming up a trap no matter whether he be an angel or a demon they both do it occasionally one of the most interesting feats in the whole range of scenic illusion  besides these acquirements he has several veracious accounts to communicate of the private manners and customs of different actors which during the pauses of a quadrille he usually communicates to his partner or imparts to his neighbour at a supper table  thus he is advised that mr liston always had a footman in gorgeous livery waiting at the sidescene with a brandy bottle and tumbler to administer half a pint or so of spirit to him every time he came off without which assistance he must infallibly have fainted  he knows for a fact that after an arduous part mr george bennett is put between two feather beds to absorb the perspiration and is credibly informed that mr baker has for many years submitted to a course of lukewarm toastandwater to qualify him to sustain his favourite characters  he looks upon mr fitz ball as the principal dramatic genius and poet of the day but holds that there are great writers extant besides himin proof whereof he refers you to various dramas and melodramas recently produced of which he takes in all the sixpenny and threepenny editions as fast as they appear  the theatrical young gentleman is a great advocate for violence of emotion and redundancy of action  if a father has to curse a child upon the stage he likes to see it done in the thoroughgoing style with no mistake about it  to which end it is essential that the child should follow the father on her knees and be knocked violently over on her face by the old gentleman as he goes into a small cottage and shuts the door behind him  he likes to see a blessing invoked upon the young lady when the old gentleman repents with equal earnestness and accompanied by the usual conventional forms which consist of the old gentleman looking anxiously up into the clouds as if to see whether it rains and then spreading an imaginary tablecloth in the air over the young ladys headsoft music playing all the while  upon these and other points of a similar kind the theatrical young gentleman is a great critic indeed  he is likewise very acute in judging of natural expressions of the passions and knows precisely the frown wink nod or leer which stands for any one of them or the means by which it may be converted into any other  as jealousy with a good stamp of the right foot becomes anger or wildness with the hands clasped before the throat instead of tearing the wig is passionate love  if you venture to express a doubt of the accuracy of any of these portraitures the theatrical young gentleman assures you with a haughty smile that it always has been done in that way and he supposes they are not going to change it at this time of day to please you to which of course you meekly reply that you suppose not  there are innumerable disquisitions of this nature in which the theatrical young gentleman is very profound especially to ladies whom he is most in the habit of entertaining with them but as we have no space to recapitulate them at greater length we must rest content with calling the attention of the young ladies in general to the theatrical young gentlemen of their own acquaintance    the poetical young gentleman    time was and not very long ago either when a singular epidemic raged among the young gentlemen vast numbers of whom under the influence of the malady tore off their neckerchiefs turned down their shirt collars and exhibited themselves in the open streets with bare throats and dejected countenances before the eyes of an astonished public  these were poetical young gentlemen  the custom was gradually found to be inconvenient as involving the necessity of too much clean linen and too large washing bills and these outward symptoms have consequently passed away but we are disposed to think notwithstanding that the number of poetical young gentlemen is considerably on the increase  we know a poetical young gentlemana very poetical young gentleman we do not mean to say that he is troubled with the gift of poesy in any remarkable degree but his countenance is of a plaintive and melancholy cast his manner is abstracted and bespeaks affliction of soul  he seldom has his hair cut and often talks about being an outcast and wanting a kindred spirit from which as well as from many general observations in which he is wont to indulge concerning mysterious impulses and yearnings of the heart and the supremacy of intellect gilding all earthly things with the glowing magic of immortal verse it is clear to all his friends that he has been stricken poetical  the favourite attitude of the poetical young gentleman is lounging on a sofa with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling or sitting bolt upright in a highbacked chair staring with very round eyes at the opposite wall  when he is in one of these positions his mother who is a worthy affectionate old soul will give you a nudge to bespeak your attention without disturbing the abstracted one and whisper with a shake of the head that johns imagination is at some extraordinary work or other you may take her word for it hereupon john looks more fiercely intent upon vacancy than before and suddenly snatching a pencil from his pocket puts down three words and a cross on the back of a card sighs deeply paces once or twice across the room inflicts a most unmerciful slap upon his head and walks moodily up to his dormitory  the poetical young gentleman is apt to acquire peculiar notions of things too which plain ordinary people unblessed with a poetical obliquity of vision would suppose to be rather distorted  for instance when the sickening murder and mangling of a wretched woman was affording delicious food wherewithal to gorge the insatiable curiosity of the public our friend the poetical young gentleman was in ecstasiesnot of disgust but admiration heavens cried the poetical young gentleman how grand how great  we ventured deferentially to inquire upon whom these epithets were bestowed  our humble thoughts oscillating between the police officer who found the criminal and the lockkeeper who found the head  upon whom exclaimed the poetical young gentleman in a frenzy of poetry upon whom should they be bestowed but upon the murdererand thereupon it came out in a fine torrent of eloquence that the murderer was a great spirit a bold creature full of daring and nerve a man of dauntless heart and determined courage and withal a great casuist and able reasoner as was fully demonstrated in his philosophical colloquies with the great and noble of the land  we held our peace and meekly signified our indisposition to controvert these opinionsfirstly because we were no match at quotation for the poetical young gentleman and secondly because we felt it would be of little use our entering into any disputation if we were  being perfectly convinced that the respectable and immoral hero in question is not the first and will not be the last hanged gentleman upon whom false sympathy or diseased curiosity will be plentifully expended  this was a stern mystic flight of the poetical young gentleman  in his milder and softer moments he occasionally lays down his neckcloth and pens stanzas which sometimes find their way into a ladys magazine or the poets corner of some country newspaper or which in default of either vent for his genius adorn the rainbow leaves of a ladys album  these are generally written upon some such occasions as contemplating the bank of england by midnight or beholding saint pauls in a snowstorm and when these gloomy objects fail to afford him inspiration he pours forth his soul in a touching address to a violet or a plaintive lament that he is no longer a child but has gradually grown up  the poetical young gentleman is fond of quoting passages from his favourite authors who are all of the gloomy and desponding school he has a great deal to say too about the world and is much given to opining especially if he has taken anything strong to drink that there is nothing in it worth living for  he gives you to understand however that for the sake of society he means to bear his part in the tiresome play manfully resisting the gratification of his own strong desire to make a premature exit and consoles himself with the reflection that immortality has some chosen nook for himself and the other great spirits whom earth has chafed and wearied  when the poetical young gentleman makes use of adjectives they are all superlatives  everything is of the grandest greatest noblest mightiest loftiest or the lowest meanest obscurest vilest and most pitiful  he knows no medium  for enthusiasm is the soul of poetry and who so enthusiastic as a poetical young gentleman  mr milkwash says a young lady as she unlocks her album to receive the young gentlemans original impromptu contribution how very silent you are  i think you must be in love  love cries the poetical young gentleman starting from his seat by the fire and terrifying the cat who scampers off at full speed love that burning consuming passion that ardour of the soul that fierce glowing of the heart  love  the withering blighting influence of hope misplaced and affection slighted  love did you say  ha ha ha  with this the poetical young gentleman laughs a laugh belonging only to poets and mr o smith of the adelphi theatre and sits down pen in hand to throw off a page or two of verse in the biting semiatheistical demoniac style which like the poetical young gentleman himself is full of sound and fury signifying nothing    the throwingoff young gentleman    there is a certain kind of impostora bragging vaunting puffing young gentlemanagainst whom we are desirous to warn that fairer part of the creation to whom we more peculiarly devote these our labours  and we are particularly induced to lay especial stress upon this division of our subject by a little dialogue we held some short time ago with an esteemed young lady of our acquaintance touching a most gross specimen of this class of men we had been urging all the absurdities of his conduct and conversation and dwelling upon the impossibilities he constantly recountedto which indeed we had not scrupled to prefix a certain hard little word of one syllable and three letterswhen our fair friend unable to maintain the contest any longer reluctantly cried well he certainly has a habit of throwingoff but then what then  throw him off yourself said we  and so she did but not at our instance for other reasons appeared and it might have been better if she had done so at first  the throwingoff young gentleman has so often a father possessed of vast property in some remote district of ireland that we look with some suspicion upon all young gentlemen who volunteer this description of themselves  the deceased grandfather of the throwingoff young gentleman was a man of immense possessions and untold wealth the throwingoff young gentleman remembers as well as if it were only yesterday the deceased baronets library with its long rows of scarce and valuable books in superbly embossed bindings arranged in cases reaching from the lofty ceiling to the oaken floor and the fine antique chairs and tables and the noble old castle of ballykillbabaloo with its splendid prospect of hill and dale and wood and rich wild scenery and the fine hunting stables and the spacious courtyards andandeverything upon the same magnificent scale says the throwingoff young gentleman princely quite princely  ah  and he sighs as if mourning over the fallen fortunes of his noble house  the throwingoff young gentleman is a universal genius at walking running rowing swimming and skating he is unrivalled at all games of chance or skill at hunting shooting fishing riding driving or amateur theatricals no one can touch himthat is could not because he gives you carefully to understand lest there should be any opportunity of testing his skill that he is quite out of practice just now and has been for some years  if you mention any beautiful girl of your common acquaintance in his hearing the throwingoff young gentleman starts smiles and begs you not to mind him for it was quite involuntary  people do say indeed that they were once engaged but noalthough she is a very fine girl he was so situated at that time that he couldnt possibly encourage thebut its of no use talking about it he adds interrupting himself  she has got over it now and i firmly hope and trust is happy  with this benevolent aspiration he nods his head in a mysterious manner and whistling the first part of some popular air thinks perhaps it will be better to change the subject  there is another great characteristic of the throwingoff young gentleman which is that he happens to be acquainted with a most extraordinary variety of people in all parts of the world  thus in all disputed questions when the throwingoff young gentleman has no argument to bring forward he invariably happens to be acquainted with some distant person intimately connected with the subject whose testimony decides the point against you to the greatmay we say itto the great admiration of three young ladies out of every four who consider the throwingoff young gentleman a very highlyconnected young man and a most charming person  sometimes the throwingoff young gentleman happens to look in upon a little family circle of young ladies who are quietly spending the evening together and then indeed is he at the very height and summit of his glory for it is to be observed that he by no means shines to equal advantage in the presence of men as in the society of overcredulous young ladies which is his proper element  it is delightful to hear the number of pretty things the throwingoff young gentleman gives utterance to during tea and still more so to observe the ease with which from long practice and study he delicately blends one compliment to a lady with two for himself did you ever see a more lovely blue than this flower mr caveton asks a young lady who truth to tell is rather smitten with the throwingoff young gentleman  never he replies bending over the object of admiration never but in your eyes oh mr caveton cries the young lady blushing of course indeed i speak the truth replies the throwingoff young gentleman i never saw any approach to them  i used to think my cousins blue eyes lovely but they grow dim and colourless beside yours  oh a beautiful cousin mr caveton replies the young lady with that perfect artlessness which is the distinguishing characteristic of all young ladies an affair of course  no indeed indeed you wrong me rejoins the throwingoff young gentleman with great energy  i fervently hope that her attachment towards me may be nothing but the natural result of our close intimacy in childhood and that in change of scene and among new faces she may soon overcome it  i love her  think not so meanly of me miss lowfield i beseech as to suppose that title lands riches and beauty can influence my choice  the heart the heart miss lowfield  here the throwingoff young gentleman sinks his voice to a still lower whisper and the young lady duly proclaims to all the other young ladies when they go upstairs to put their bonnets on that mr cavetons relations are all immensely rich and that he is hopelessly beloved by title lands riches and beauty  we have seen a throwingoff young gentleman who to our certain knowledge was innocent of a note of music and scarcely able to recognise a tune by ear volunteer a spanish air upon the guitar when he had previously satisfied himself that there was not such an instrument within a mile of the house  we have heard another throwingoff young gentleman after striking a note or two upon the piano and accompanying it correctly by dint of laborious practice with his voice assure a circle of wondering listeners that so acute was his ear that he was wholly unable to sing out of tune let him try as he would  we have lived to witness the unmasking of another throwingoff young gentleman who went out a visiting in a military cap with a gold band and tassel and who after passing successfully for a captain and being lauded to the skies for his red whiskers his bravery his soldierly bearing and his pride turned out to be the dishonest son of an honest linendraper in a small country town and whom if it were not for this fortunate exposure we should not yet despair of encountering as the fortunate husband of some rich heiress ladies ladies the throwingoff young gentlemen are often swindlers and always fools  so pray you avoid them    the young ladies young gentleman    this young gentleman has several titles  some young ladies consider him a nice young man others a fine young man others quite a ladys man others a handsome man others a remarkably goodlooking young man  with some young ladies he is a perfect angel and with others quite a love  he is likewise a charming creature a duck and a dear  the young ladies young gentleman has usually a fresh colour and very white teeth which latter articles of course he displays on every possible opportunity  he has brown or black hair and whiskers of the same if possible but a slight tinge of red or the hue which is vulgarly known as sandy is not considered an objection  if his head and face be large his nose prominent and his figure square he is an uncommonly fine young man and worshipped accordingly  should his whiskers meet beneath his chin so much the better though this is not absolutely insisted on but he must wear an underwaistcoat and smile constantly  there was a great party got up by some partyloving friends of ours last summer to go and dine in epping forest  as we hold that such wild expeditions should never be indulged in save by people of the smallest means who have no dinner at home we should indubitably have excused ourself from attending if we had not recollected that the projectors of the excursion were always accompanied on such occasions by a choice sample of the young ladies young gentleman whom we were very anxious to have an opportunity of meeting  this determined us and we went  we were to make for chigwell in four glass coaches each with a trifling company of six or eight inside and a little boy belonging to the projectors on the boxand to start from the residence of the projectors woburnplace russellsquare at halfpast ten precisely  we arrived at the place of rendezvous at the appointed time and found the glass coaches and the little boys quite ready and divers young ladies and young gentlemen looking anxiously over the breakfastparlour blinds who appeared by no means so much gratified by our approach as we might have expected but evidently wished we had been somebody else  observing that our arrival in lieu of the unknown occasioned some disappointment we ventured to inquire who was yet to come when we found from the hasty reply of a dozen voices that it was no other than the young ladies young gentleman  i cannot imagine said the mamma what has become of mr balim always so punctual always so pleasant and agreeable  i am sure i cannot think  as these last words were uttered in that measured emphatic manner which painfully announces that the speaker has not quite made up his or her mind what to say but is determined to talk on nevertheless the eldest daughter took up the subject and hoped no accident had happened to mr balim upon which there was a general chorus of dear mr balim and one young lady more adventurous than the rest proposed that an express should be straightway sent to dear mr balims lodgings  this however the papa resolutely opposed observing in what a short young lady behind us termed quite a bearish way that if mr balim didnt choose to come he might stop at home  at this all the daughters raised a murmur of oh pa except one sprightly little girl of eight or ten years old who taking advantage of a pause in the discourse remarked that perhaps mr balim might have been married that morningfor which impertinent suggestion she was summarily ejected from the room by her eldest sister  we were all in a state of great mortification and uneasiness when one of the little boys running into the room as airily as little boys usually run who have an unlimited allowance of animal food in the holidays and keep their hands constantly forced down to the bottoms of very deep trouserpockets when they take exercise joyfully announced that mr balim was at that moment coming up the street in a hackneycab and the intelligence was confirmed beyond all doubt a minute afterwards by the entry of mr balim himself who was received with repeated cries of where have you been you naughty creature whereunto the naughty creature replied that he had been in bed in consequence of a late party the night before and had only just risen  the acknowledgment awakened a variety of agonizing fears that he had taken no breakfast which appearing after a slight crossexamination to be the real state of the case breakfast for one was immediately ordered notwithstanding mr balims repeated protestations that he couldnt think of it  he did think of it though and thought better of it too for he made a remarkably good meal when it came and was assiduously served by a select knot of young ladies  it was quite delightful to see how he ate and drank while one pair of fair hands poured out his coffee and another put in the sugar and another the milk the rest of the company ever and anon casting angry glances at their watches and the glass coachesand the little boys looking on in an agony of apprehension lest it should begin to rain before we set out it might have rained all day after we were once too far to turn back again and welcome for aught they cared  however the cavalcade moved at length every coachman being accommodated with a hamper between his legs something larger than a wheelbarrow and the company being packed as closely as they possibly could in the carriages according as one married lady observed to the immemorial custom which was half the diversion of gipsy parties  thinking it very likely it might be we have never been able to discover the other half we submitted to be stowed away with a cheerful aspect and were fortunate enough to occupy one corner of a coach in which were one old lady four young ladies and the renowned mr balim the young ladies young gentleman  we were no sooner fairly off than the young ladies young gentleman hummed a fragment of an air which induced a young lady to inquire whether he had danced to that the night before  by heaven then i did replied the young gentleman and with a lovely heiress a superb creature with twenty thousand pounds you seem rather struck observed another young lady  gad she was a sweet creature returned the young gentleman arranging his hair  of course she was struck too inquired the first young lady  how can you ask love interposed the second could she fail to be  well honestly i think she was observed the young gentleman  at this point of the dialogue the young lady who had spoken first and who sat on the young gentlemans right struck him a severe blow on the arm with a rosebud and said he was a vain manwhereupon the young gentleman insisted on having the rosebud and the young lady appealing for help to the other young ladies a charming struggle ensued terminating in the victory of the young gentleman and the capture of the rosebud  this little skirmish over the married lady who was the mother of the rosebud smiled sweetly upon the young gentleman and accused him of being a flirt the young gentleman pleading not guilty a most interesting discussion took place upon the important point whether the young gentleman was a flirt or not which being an agreeable conversation of a light kind lasted a considerable time  at length a short silence occurring the young ladies on either side of the young gentleman fell suddenly fast asleep and the young gentleman winking upon us to preserve silence won a pair of gloves from each thereby causing them to wake with equal suddenness and to scream very loud  the lively conversation to which this pleasantry gave rise lasted for the remainder of the ride and would have eked out a much longer one  we dined rather more comfortably than people usually do under such circumstances nothing having been left behind but the corkscrew and the bread  the married gentlemen were unusually thirsty which they attributed to the heat of the weather the little boys ate to inconvenience mammas were very jovial and their daughters very fascinating and the attendants being wellbehaved men got exceedingly drunk at a respectful distance  we had our eye on mr balim at dinnertime and perceived that he flourished wonderfully being still surrounded by a little group of young ladies who listened to him as an oracle while he ate from their plates and drank from their glasses in a manner truly captivating from its excessive playfulness  his conversation too was exceedingly brilliant  in fact one elderly lady assured us that in the course of a little lively badinage on the subject of ladies dresses he had evinced as much knowledge as if he had been born and bred a milliner  as such of the fat people who did not happen to fall asleep after dinner entered upon a most vigorous game at ball we slipped away alone into a thicker part of the wood hoping to fall in with mr balim the greater part of the young people having dropped off in twos and threes and the young ladies young gentleman among them nor were we disappointed for we had not walked far when peeping through the trees we discovered him before us and truly it was a pleasant thing to contemplate his greatness  the young ladies young gentleman was seated upon the ground at the feet of a few young ladies who were reclining on a bank he was so profusely decked with scarfs ribands flowers and other pretty spoils that he looked like a lambor perhaps a calf would be a better simileadorned for the sacrifice  one young lady supported a parasol over his interesting head another held his hat and a third his neckcloth which in romantic fashion he had thrown off the young gentleman himself with his hand upon his breast and his face moulded into an expression of the most honeyed sweetness was warbling forth some choice specimens of vocal music in praise of female loveliness in a style so exquisitely perfect that we burst into an involuntary shout of laughter and made a hasty retreat  what charming fellows these young ladies young gentlemen are ducks dears loves angels are all terms inadequate to express their merit  they are such amazingly uncommonly wonderfully nice men    conclusion    as we have placed before the young ladies so many specimens of young gentlemen and have also in the dedication of this volume given them to understand how much we reverence and admire their numerous virtues and perfections as we have given them such strong reasons to treat us with confidence and to banish in our case all that reserve and distrust of the male sex which as a point of general behaviour they cannot do better than preserve and maintainwe say as we have done all this we feel that now when we have arrived at the close of our task they may naturally press upon us the inquiry what particular description of young gentlemen we can conscientiously recommend  here we are at a loss  we look over our list and can neither recommend the bashful young gentleman nor the outandout young gentleman nor the very friendly young gentleman nor the military young gentleman nor the political young gentleman nor the domestic young gentleman nor the censorious young gentleman nor the funny young gentleman nor the theatrical young gentleman nor the poetical young gentleman nor the throwingoff young gentleman nor the young ladies young gentleman  as there are some good points about many of them which still are not sufficiently numerous to render any one among them eligible as a whole our respectful advice to the young ladies is to seek for a young gentleman who unites in himself the best qualities of all and the worst weaknesses of none and to lead him forthwith to the hymeneal altar whether he will or no  and to the young lady who secures him we beg to tender one short fragment of matrimonial advice selected from many sound passages of a similar tendency to be found in a letter written by dean swift to a young lady on her marriage  the grand affair of your life will be to gain and preserve the esteem of your husband  neither goodnature nor virtue will suffer him to esteem you against his judgment and although he is not capable of using you ill yet you will in time grow a thing indifferent and perhaps contemptible unless you can supply the loss of youth and beauty with more durable qualities  you have but a very few years to be young and handsome in the eyes of the world and as few months to be so in the eyes of a husband who is not a fool for i hope you do not still dream of charms and raptures which marriage ever did and ever will put a sudden end to  from the anxiety we express for the proper behaviour of the fortunate lady after marriage it may possibly be inferred that the young gentleman to whom we have so delicately alluded is no other than ourself  without in any way committing ourself upon this point we have merely to observe that we are ready to receive sealed offers containing a full specification of age temper appearance and condition but we beg it to be distinctly understood that we do not pledge ourself to accept the highest bidder  these offers may be forwarded to the publishers messrs chapman and hall london to whom all pieces of plate and other testimonials of approbation from the young ladies generally are respectfully requested to be addressed
