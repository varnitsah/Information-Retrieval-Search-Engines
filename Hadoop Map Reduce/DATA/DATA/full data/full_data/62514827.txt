dormer died he left his two daughters utterly penniless upon the world and it must be said of egbert dormer that nothing else could have been expected of him the two girls were both pretty but lucy who was twentyone was supposed to be simple and comparatively unattractive whereas ayala was creditedas her somewhat romantic name might showwith poetic charm and a taste for romance ayala when her father died was nineteen  we must begin yet a little earlier and say that there had beenand had died many years before the death of egbert dormera clerk in the admiralty by name reginald dosett who and whose wife had been conspicuous for personal beauty their charms were gone but the records of them had been left in various grandchildren there had been a son born to mr dosett who was also a reginald and a clerk in the admiralty and who also in his turn had been a handsome man with him in his decadence the reader will become acquainted there were also two daughters whose reputation for perfect feminine beauty had never been contested the elder had married a city man of wealthof wealth when he married her but who had become enormously wealthy by the time of our story he had when he married been simply mister but was now sir thomas tringle baronet and was senior partner in the great firm of travers and treason of traverses and treasons there were none left in these days and mr tringle was supposed to manipulate all the millions with which the great firm in lombard street was concerned he had married old mr dosetts eldest daughter emmeline who was now lady tringle with a house at the top of queens gate rented at £1500 a year with a palatial moor in scotland with a seat in sussex and as many carriages and horses as would suit an archduchess lady tringle had everything in the world a son two daughters and an openhanded stout husband who was said to have told her that money was a matter of no consideration  the second miss dosett adelaide dosett who had been considerably younger than her sister had insisted upon giving herself to egbert dormer the artist whose death we commemorated in our first line but she had died before her husband they who remembered the two miss dosetts as girls were wont to declare that though lady tringle might perhaps have had the advantage in perfection of feature and in unequalled symmetry adelaide had been the more attractive from expression and brilliancy to her lord sizes had offered his hand and coronet promising to abandon for her sake all the haunts of his matured life to her mr tringle had knelt before he had taken the elder sister for her mr program the popular preacher of the day for a time so totally lost himself that he was nearly minded to go over to rome she was said to have had offers from a widowed lord chancellor and from a russian prince her triumphs would have quite obliterated that of her sister had she not insisted on marrying egbert dormer  then there had been and still was reginald dosett the son of old dosett and the eldest of the family he too had married and was now living with his wife but to them had no children been born luckily as he was a poor man alas to a beautiful son it is not often that beauty can be a fortune as to a daughter young reginald dosetthe is anything now but younghad done but little for himself with his beauty having simply married the estimable daughter of a brother clerk now at the age of fifty he had his £900 a year from his office and might have lived in fair comfort had he not allowed a small millstone of debt to hang round his neck from his earlier years but still he lived creditably in a small but very genteel house at notting hill and would have undergone any want rather than have declared himself to be a poor man to his rich relations the tringles  such were now the remaining two children of old mr dosettlady tringle namely and reginald dosett the clerk in the admiralty adelaide the beauty in chief of the family was gone and now also her husband the improvident artist had followed his wife dormer had been by no means a failing artist he had achieved great honourhad at an early age been accepted into the royal academyhad sold pictures to illustrious princes and more illustrious dealers had been engraved and had lived to see his own works resold at five times their original prices egbert dormer might also have been a rich man but he had a taste for other beautiful things besides a wife the sweetest little phaeton that was to cost nothing the most perfect bijou of a little house at south kensingtonhe had boasted that it might have been packed without trouble in his brotherinlaw tringles diningroomthe simplest little gem for his wife just a blue set of china for his dinner table just a painted cornice for his studio just satin hangings for his drawingroomand a few simple ornaments for his little girls these with a few rings for himself and velvet suits of clothing in which to do his painting these with a few little dinner parties to show off his blue china were the first and last of his extravagances but when he went and when his pretty things were sold there was not enough to cover his debts there was however a sweet savour about his name when he died it was said of him that his wifes death had killed him he had dropped his pallette refused to finish the ordered portrait of a princess and had simply turned himself round and died  then there were the two daughters lucy and ayala it should be explained that though a proper family intercourse had always been maintained between the three families the tringles the dormers and the dosetts there had never been cordiality between the first and the two latter the wealth of the tringles had seemed to convey with it a fetid odour egbert dormer with every luxury around him which money could purchase had affected to despise the heavy magnificence of the tringles it may be that he affected a fashion higher than that which the tringles really attained reginald dosett who was neither brilliant nor fashionable was in truth independent and perhaps a little thinskinned he would submit to no touch of arrogance from sir thomas and sir thomas seemed to carry arrogance in his brow and in his paunch it was there rather perhaps than in his heart but there are men to whom a knack of fumbling their money in their pockets and of looking out from under penthouse brows over an expanse of waistcoat gives an air of overweening pride which their true idiosyncracies may not justify to dosett had perhaps been spoken a word or two which on some occasion he had inwardly resented and from thenceforward he had ever been ready to league with dormer against the bullionaire as they agreed to call sir thomas lady tringle had even said a word to her sister mrs dormer as to expenses and that had never been forgiven by the artist so things were when mrs dormer died first and so they remained when her husband followed her  then there arose a sudden necessity for action which for a while brought reginald dosett into connexion with sir thomas and lady tringle something must be done for the poor girls that the something should come out of the pocket of sir thomas would have seemed to be natural money with him was no objectnot at all another girl or two would be nothing to himas regarded simple expenditure but the care of a human being is an important matter and so sir thomas knew dosett had not a child at all and would be the better for such a windfall dosett he supposed to bein his dosetts wayfairly well off so he made this proposition he would take one girl and let dosett take the other to this lady tringle added her proviso that she should have the choice to her nerves affairs of taste were of such paramount importance to this dosett yielded the matter was decided in lady tringles back drawingroom mrs dosett was not even consulted in that matter of choice having already acknowledged the duty of mothering a motherless child dosett had thought that the bullionaire should have said a word as to some future provision for the penniless girl for whom he would be able to do so little but sir thomas had said no such word and dosett himself lacked both the courage and the coarseness to allude to the matter then lady tringle declared that she must have ayala and so the matter was settled ayala the romantic ayala the poetic it was a matter of course that ayala should be chosen ayala had already been made intimate with the magnificent saloons of the tringles and had been felt by lady tringle to be an attraction her long dark black locks which had never hitherto been tucked up which were never curled which were never so long as to be awkward were already known as being the loveliest locks in london she sang as though nature had intended her to be a singingbirdrequiring no education no labour she had been once for three months in paris and french had come naturally to her her father had taught her something of his art and flatterers had already begun to say that she was born to be the one great female artist of the world her hands her feet her figure were perfect though she was as yet but nineteen london had already begun to talk about ayala dormer of course lady tringle chose ayala not remembering at the moment that her own daughters might probably be superseded by their cousin  and therefore as lady tringle said herself to lucy with her sweetest smilemrs dosett had chosen lucy the two girls were old enough to know something of the meaning of such a choice ayala the younger was to be adopted into immense wealth and lucy was to be given up to comparative poverty she knew nothing of her uncle dosetts circumstances but the genteel house at notting hillno 3 kingsbury crescentwas known to her and was but a poor affair as compared even with the bijou in which she had hitherto lived her aunt dosett never rose to any vehicle beyond a fourwheeler and was careful even in thinking of that accommodation ayala would be whirled about the park by a wirewig and a pair of brown horses which they had heard it said were not to be matched in london ayala would be carried with her aunt and her cousin to the showroom of madame tonsonville the great french milliner of bond street whereas she lucy might too probably be called on to make her own gowns all the fashion of queens gate something perhaps of the fashion of eaton square would be open to ayala lucy understood enough to know that ayalas own charms might probably cause still more august gates to be opened to her whereas aunt dosett entered no gates it was quite natural that ayala should be chosen lucy acknowledged as much to herself but they were sisters and had been so near by what a chasm would they be dissevered now so far asunder  lucy herself was a lovely girl and knew her own loveliness she was fairer than ayala somewhat taller and much more quiet in her demeanour she was also clever but her cleverness did not show itself so quickly she was a musician whereas her sister could only sing she could really draw whereas her sister would rush away into effects in which the drawing was not always very excellent lucy was doing the best she could for herself knowing something of french and german though as yet not very fluent with her tongue the two girls were in truth both greatly gifted but ayala had the gift of showing her talent without thought of showing it lucy saw it all and knew that she was outshone but how great had been the price of the outshining  the artists house had been badly ordered and the two girls were of better disposition and better conduct than might have been expected from such fitful training ayala had been the fathers pet and lucy the mothers parents do ill in making pets and here they had done ill ayala had been taught to think herself the favourite because the artist himself had been more prominent before the world than his wife but the evil had not been lasting enough to have made bad feeling between the sisters lucy knew that her sister had been preferred to her but she had been selfdenying enough to be aware that some such preference was due to ayala she too admired ayala and loved her with her whole heart and ayala was always good to herhad tried to divide everythinghad assumed no preference as a right the two were true sisters but when it was decided that lucy was to go to kingsbury crescent the difference was very great the two girls on their fathers death had been taken to the great red brick house in queens gate and from thence three or four days after the funeral lucy was to be transferred to her aunt dosett hitherto there had been little between them but weeping for their father now had come the hour of parting  the tidings had been communicated to lucy and to lucy alone by aunt tringleas you are the eldest dear we think that you will be best able to be a comfort to your aunt said lady tringle  i will do the best i can aunt emmeline said lucy declaring to herself that in giving such a reason her aunt was lying basely  i am sure you will poor dear ayala is younger than her cousins and will be more subject to them so in truth was lucy younger than her cousins but of that she said nothing i am sure you will agree with me that it is best that we should have the youngest  perhaps it is aunt emmeline  sir thomas would not have had it any other way said lady tringle with a little severity feeling that lucys accord had hardly been as generous as it should be but she recovered herself quickly remembering how much it was that ayala was to get how much that lucy was to lose but my dear we shall see you very often you know it is not so far across the park and when we do have a few parties again  oh aunt i am not thinking of that  of course not we can none of us think of it just now but when the time does come of course we shall always have you just as if you were one of us then her aunt gave her a roll of banknotes a little present of twentyfive pounds to begin the world with and told her that the carriage should take her to kingsbury crescent on the following morning on the whole lucy behaved well and left a pleasant impression on her aunts mind the difference between queens gate and kingsbury crescentbetween queens gate and kingsbury crescent for lifewas indeed great  i wish it were you with all my heart said ayala clinging to her sister  it could not have been me  why not  because you are so pretty and you are so clever  no  yes if we were to be separated of course it would be so do not suppose dear that i am disappointed  i am  if i can only like aunt margaretaunt margaret was mrs dosett with whom neither of the girls had hitherto become intimate and who was known to be quiet domestic and economical but who had also been spoken of as having a will of her owni shall do better with her than you would ayala  i dont see why  because i can remain quiet longer than you it will be very quiet i wonder how we shall see each other i cannot walk across the park alone  uncle reg will bring you  not often i fear uncle reg has enough to do with his office  you can come in a cab  cabs cost money ayey dear  but uncle thomas  we had better understand one or two things ayala uncle thomas will pay everything for you and as he is very rich things will come as they are wanted there will be cabs and if not cabs carriages uncle reg must pay for me and he is very very kind to do so but as he is not rich there will be no carriages and not a great many cabs it is best to understand it all  but they will send for you  thats as they please i dont think they will very often i would not for the world put you against uncle thomas but i have a feeling that i shall never get on with him but you will never separate yourself from me ayala  separate myself  you will notnot be my sister because you will be one of these rich ones  oh i wishi wish that i were to be the poor one im sure i should like it best i never cared about being rich oh lucy cant we make them change  no ayey my own we cant make them change and if we could we wouldnt it is altogether best that you should be a rich tringle and that i should be a poor dosett  i will always be a dormer said ayala proudly  and i will always be so too my pet but you should be a bright dormer among the tringles and i will be a dull dormer among the dosetts i shall begrudge nothing if only we can see each other  so the two girls were parted the elder being taken away to kingsbury crescent and the latter remaining with her rich relations at queens gate ayala had not probably realized the great difference of their future positions to her the attractions of wealth and the privations of comparative poverty had not made themselves as yet palpably plain they do not become so manifest to those to whom the wealth fallsat any rate not in early lifeas to the opposite party if the other lot had fallen to ayala she might have felt it more keenly  lucy felt it keenly enough without any longing after the magnificence of the tringle mansion she knew how great was the fall from her fathers wellassorted luxuries and prettinesses down to the plain walls tables and chairs of her uncle dosetts house her aunt did not subscribe to mudies the old piano had not been tuned for the last ten years the parlourmaid was a cross old woman her aunt always sat in the diningroom through the greater part of the day and of all rooms the diningroom in kingsbury crescent was the dingiest lucy understood very well to what she was going her father and mother were gone her sister was divided from her her life offered for the future nothing to her but with it all she carried a good courage there was present to her an idea of great misfortune but present to her at the same time an idea also that she would do her duty     chapter ii  lucy with her aunt dosett   for some days lucy found herself to be absolutely crushedin the first place by a strong resolution to do some disagreeable duty and then by a feeling that there was no duty the doing of which was within her reach it seemed to her that her whole life was a blank her fathers house had been a small affair and considered to be poor when compared with the tringle mansion but she now became aware that everything there had in truth abounded in one little room there had been two or three hundred beautifully bound books that mudies unnumbered volumes should come into the house as they were wanted had almost been as much a provision of nature as water gas and hot rolls for breakfast a piano of the best kind and always in order had been a first necessary of life and like other necessaries of course forthcoming there had been the little room in which the girls painted joining their fathers studio and sharing its light surrounded by every pretty female appliance then there had always been visitors the artists from kensington had been wont to gather there and the artists daughters and perhaps the artists sons every day had had its round of delightsits round of occupations as the girls would call them there had been some reading some painting some musicperhaps a little needlework and a great deal of talking  how little do we know how other people live in the houses close to us we see the houses looking like our own and we see the people come out of them looking like ourselves but a chinaman is not more different from the english john bull than is no 10 from no 11 here there are books paintings music wine a little dilettanti gettingup of subjects of the day a little dilettanti thinking on great affairs perhaps a little dilettanti religion few domestic laws and those easily broken few domestic duties and those easily evaded breakfast when you will with dinner almost as little binding with much company and acknowledged aptitude for idle luxury that is life at no 10 at no 11 everything is cased in iron there shall be equal plenty but at no 11 even plenty is a bondage duty rules everything and it has come to be acknowledged that duty is to be hard so many hours of needlework so many hours of books so many hours of prayer that all the household shall shiver before daylight is a law the breach of which by any member either augurs sickness or requires condign punishment to be comfortable is a sin to laugh is almost equal to bad language such and so various is life at no 10 and at no 11  from one extremity as far removed to another poor lucy had been conveyed though all the laws were not exactly carried out in kingsbury crescent as they have been described at no 11 the enforced prayers were not there nor the early hours it was simply necessary that lucy should be down to breakfast at nine and had she not appeared nothing violent would have been said but it was required of her that she should endure a life which was altogether without adornment uncle dosett himself as a clerk in the admiralty had a certain position in the world which was sufficiently maintained by decent apparel a wellkept slight grey whisker and an umbrella which seemed never to have been violated by use dosett was popular at his office and was regarded by his brother clerks as a friend but no one was acquainted with his house and home they did not dine with him nor he with them there are such men in all public officesnot the less respected because of the quiescence of their lives it was known of him that he had burdens though it was not known what his burdens were his friends therefore were intimate with him as far as the entrance into somerset housewhere his duties layand not beyond it lucy was destined to know the other side of his affairs the domestic side which was as quiet as the official side the link between them which consisted of a journey by the underground railway to the temple station and a walk home along the embankment and across the parks and kensington gardens was the pleasantest part of dosetts life  mr dosetts salary has been said to be £900 per annum what a fund of comfort there is in the word when the youth of nineteen enters an office how far beyond want would he think himself should he ever reach the pecuniary paradise of £900 ayear how he would see all his friends and in return be seen of them but when the income has been achieved its capabilities are found to be by no means endless and dosett in the earlier spheres of his married life had unfortunately anticipated something of such comforts for a year or two he had spent a little money imprudently something which he had expected had not come to him and as a result he had been forced to borrow and to insure his life for the amount borrowed then too when that misfortune as to the money camecame from the nonrealization of certain claims which his wife had been supposed to possessprovision had also to be made for her in this way an assurance office eat up a large fraction of his income and left him with means which in truth were very straitened dosett at once gave up all glories of social life settled himself in kingsbury crescent and resolved to satisfy himself with his walk across the park and his frugal dinner afterwards he never complained to any one nor did his wife he was a man small enough to be contented with a thin existence but far too great to ask any one to help him to widen it sir thomas tringle never heard of that £175 paid annually to the assurance office nor had lady tringle dosetts sister even heard of it when it was suggested to him that he should take one of the dormer girls he consented to take her and said nothing of the assurance office  mrs dosett had had her great blow in life and had suffered more perhaps than her husband this money had been expected there had been no doubt of the moneyat any rate on her part it did not depend on an old gentleman with or without good intentions but simply on his death there was to be ever so much of it four or five hundred ayear which would last for ever when the old gentleman died which took place some ten years after dosetts marriage it was found that the money tied tight as it had been by halfadozen lawyers had in some fashion vanished whither it had gone is little to our purpose but it had gone then there came a great crash upon the dosetts which she for a while had been hardly able to endure  but when she had collected herself together after the crash and had made up her mind as had dosett also to the nature of the life which they must in future lead she became more stringent in it even than he he could bear and say nothing but she in bearing found herself compelled to say much it had been her faultthe fault of people on her sideand she would fain have fed her husband with the full flowery potato while she ate only the rind she told him unnecessarily over and over again that she had ruined him by her marriage no such idea was ever in his head the thing had come and so it must be there was food to eat potatoes enough for both and a genteel house in which to live he could still be happy if she would not groan a certain amount of groaning she did postpone while in his presence the sewing of seams and the darning of household linen which in his eyes amounted to groaning was done in his absence after their genteel dinner he would sleep a little and she would knit he would have his glass of wine but would make his bottle of port last almost for a week this was the house to which lucy dormer was brought when mr dosett had consented to share with sir thomas the burden left by the death of the improvident artist  when a month passed by lucy began to think that time itself would almost drive her mad her father had died early in september the tringles had then of course been out of town but sir thomas and his wife had found themselves compelled to come up on such an occasion something they knew must be done about the girls and they had not chosen that that something should be done in their absence mr dosett was also enjoying his official leave of absence for the year but was enjoying it within the economical precincts of kingsbury crescent there was but seldom now an excursion for him or his wife to the joys of the country once some years ago they had paid a visit to the palatial luxuries of glenbogie but the delights of the place had not paid for the expense of the long journey they therefore had been at hand to undertake their duties dosett and tringle with a score of artists had followed poor dormer to his grave in kensal green and then dosett and tringle had parted again probably not to see each other for another term of years  my dear what do you like to do with your time mrs dosett said to her niece after the first week at this time lucys wardrobe was not yet of a nature to need much work over its ravages the dormer girls had hardly known where their frocks had come from when they wanted frockshardly with more precision than the tringle girls frocks had comedark gloomy frocks lately alas and these too had now come a second time let creditors be ever so unsatisfied new raiment will always be found for mourning families everything about lucy was nearly new the need of repairing would come upon her by degrees but it had not come as yet therefore there had seemed to the anxious aunt to be a necessity for some such question as the above  ill do anything you like aunt said lucy  it is not for me my dear i get through a deal of work and am obliged to do so she was at this time sitting with a sheet in her lap which she was turning lucy had indeed once offered to assist but her assistance had been rejected this had been two days since and she had not renewed the proposal as she should have done this had been mainly from bashfulness though the work would certainly be distasteful to her she would do it but she had not liked to seem to interfere not having as yet fallen into ways of intimacy with her aunt i dont want to burden you with my taskwork continued mrs dosett but i am afraid you seem to be listless  i was reading till just before you spoke said lucy again turning her eyes to the little volume of poetry which was one of the few treasures which she had brought away with her from her old home  reading is very well but i do not like it as an excuse lucy lucys anger boiled within her when she was told of an excuse and she declared to herself that she could never like her aunt i am quite sure that for young girls as well as for old women there must be a great deal of waste time unless there be needle and thread always about and i know too unless ladies are well off they cannot afford to waste time any more than gentlemen  in the whole course of her life nothing so much like scolding as this had ever been addressed to her so at least thought lucy at that moment mrs dosett had intended the remarks all in good part thinking them to be simply fitting from an aunt to a niece it was her duty to give advice and for the giving of such advice some day must be taken as the beginning she had purposely allowed a week to run by and now she had spoken her wordas she thought in good season  to lucy it was a new and most bitter experience though she was reading the idylls of the king or pretending to read them she was in truth thinking of all that had gone from her her mind had at that moment been intent upon her mother who in all respects had been so different from this careful sheetdarning housewife of a woman and in thinking of her mother there had no doubt been regrets for many things of which she would not have ventured to speak as sharing her thoughts with the memory of her mother but which were nevertheless there to add darkness to the retrospective everything behind had been so bright and everything behind had gone away from her everything before was so gloomy and everything before must last for so long after her aunts lecture about wasted time lucy sat silent for a few minutes and then burst into uncontrolled tears  i did not mean to vex you said her aunt  i was thinking of mydarling darling mamma sobbed lucy  of course lucy you will think of her how should you not and of your father those are sorrows which must be borne but sorrows such as those are much lighter to the busy than to the idle i sometimes think that the labourers grieve less for those they love than we do just because they have not time to grieve  i wish i were a labourer then said lucy through her tears  you may be if you will the sooner you begin to be a labourer the better for yourself and for those about you  that aunt dosetts voice was harsh was not her faultnor that in the obduracy of her daily life she had lost much of her original softness she had simply meant to be useful and to do her duty but in telling lucy that it would be better that the labouring should be commenced at once for the sake of those about youwho could only be aunt dosett herselfshe had seemed to the girl to be harsh selfish and almost unnatural the volume of poetry fell from her hand and she jumped up from the chair quickly give it me at once she said taking hold of the sheetwhich was not itself a pleasant object lucy had never seen such a thing at the bijou give it me at once she said and clawed the long folds of linen nearly out of her aunts lap  i did not mean anything of the kind said aunt dosett you should not take me up in that way i am speaking only for your good because i know that you should not dawdle away your existence leave the sheet  lucy did leave the sheet and then sobbing violently ran out of the room up to her own chamber mrs dosett determined that she would not follow her she partly forgave the girl because of her sorrows partly reminded herself that she was not soft and facile as had been her sisterinlaw lucys mother and then as she continued her work she assured herself that it would be best to let her niece have her cry out upstairs lucys violence had astonished her for a moment but she had taught herself to think it best to allow such little ebullitions to pass off by themselves  lucy when she was alone flung herself upon her bed in absolute agony she thought that she had misbehaved and yet how cruelhow harsh had been her aunts words if she the quiet one had misbehaved what would ayala have done and how was she to find strength with which to look forward to the future she struggled hard with herself for a resolution should she determine that she would henceforward darn sheets morning noon and night till she worked her fingers to the bone perhaps there had been something of truth in that assertion of her aunts that the labourers have no time to grieve as everything else was shut out from her it might be well for her to darn sheets should she rush down penitent and beg her aunt to allow her to commence at once  she would have done it as far as the sheets were concerned but she could not do it as regarded her aunt she could put herself into unison with the crumpled soiled linen but not with the hard woman  oh how terrible was the change her father and her mother who had been so gentle to her all the sweet prettinesses of her life all her occupations all her friends all her delights even ayala was gone from her how was she to bear it she begrudged ayala nothingno nothing but yet it was hard ayala was to have everything aunt emmelinethough they had not hitherto been very fond of aunt emmelinewas sweetness itself as compared with this woman the sooner you begin to labour the better for yourself and those about you would it not have been fitter that she should have been sent at once to some actual poorhouse in which there would have been no mistake as to her position  that it should all have been decided for her for her and ayala not by any will of their own not by any concert between themselves but simply by the fantasy of another why should she thus be made a slave to the fantasy of any one let ayala have her uncles wealth and her aunts palaces at her command and she would walk out simply a pauper into the worldinto some workhouse so that at least she need not be obedient to the harsh voice and the odious common sense of her aunt dosett but how should she take herself to some workhouse in what way could she prove her right to be admitted even then it seemed to her that the same decree which had admitted ayala into the golden halls of the fairies had doomed her not only to poverty but to slavery there was no escape for her from her aunt and her aunts sermons oh ayala my darlingmy own one oh ayala if you did but know she said to herself what would ayala think how would ayala bear it could she but guess by what a gulf was her heaven divided from her sisters hell i will never tell her she said to herself i will die and she shall never know  as she lay there sobbing all the gilded things of the world were beautiful in her eyes alas yes it was true the magnificence of the mansion at queens gate the glories of glenbogie the closely studied comforts of merle park as the place in sussex was called all the carriages and horses madame tonsonville and all the draperies the seats at the albert hall into which she had been accustomed to go with as much ease as into her bedroom the box at the opera the pretty furniture the frequent gems even the raiment which would make her pleasing to the eyes of men whom she would like to pleaseall these things grew in her eyes and became beautiful no 3 kingsbury crescent was surely of all places on the earths surface the most ugly and yetyet she had endeavoured to do her duty if it had been the workhouse i could have borne it she said to herself but not to be the slave of my aunt dosett again she appealed to her sister oh ayala if you did but know it then she remembered herself declaring that it might have been worse to ayala than even to her if one had to bear it it was better for me she said as she struggled to prepare herself for her uncles dinner     chapter iii  lucys troubles   the evening after the affair with the sheet went off quietly as did many days and many evenings mrs dosett was wise enough to forget the little violence and to forget also the feeling which had been displayed when lucy first asked for some household needlework which she did with a faltering voice and shamefaced remembrance of her fault her aunt took it all in good part and gave her a task somewhat lighter as a beginning than the handling of a sheet lucy sat at it and suffered she went on sitting and suffering she told herself that she was a martyr at every stitch she made as she occupied the seat opposite to her aunts accustomed chair she would hardly speak at all but would keep her mind always intent on ayala and the joys of ayalas life that they who had been born together sisters with equal fortunes who had so closely lived together should be sundered so utterly one from the other that the one should be so exalted and the other so debased and why what justice had there been could it be from heaven or even from earth that the law had gone forth for such a division of the things of the world between them  you have got very little to say to a person said aunt dosett one morning this too was a reproach this too was scolding and yet aunt dosett had intended to be as pleasant as she knew how  i have very little to say replied lucy with repressed anger  but why  because i am stupid said lucy stupid people cant talk you should have had ayala  i hope you do not envy ayala her fortune lucy a woman with any tact would not have asked such a question at such a time she should have felt that a touch of such irony might be natural and that unless it were expressed loudly or shown actively it might be left to be suppressed by affection and time but she as she had grown old had taught herself to bear disappointment and thought it wise to teach lucy to do the same  envy said lucy not passionately but after a little pause for thought i sometimes think it is very hard to know what envy is  envy hatred and malice said mrs dosett hardly knowing what she meant by the use of the wellworn words  i do know what hatred and malice are said lucy do you think i hate ayala  i am sure you do not  or that i bear her malice  certainly not  if i had the power to take anything from her would i do it i love ayala with my whole heart whatever be my misery i would rather bear it than let ayala have even a share of it whatever good things she may have i would not rob her even of a part of them if there be joy and sorrow to be divided between us i would wish to have the sorrow so that she might have the joy that is not hatred and malice mrs dosett looked at her over her spectacles this was the girl who had declared that she could not speak because she was too stupid but when you ask me whether i envy her i hardly know continued lucy i think one does covet ones neighbours house in spite of the tenth commandment even though one does not want to steal it  mrs dosett repented herself that she had given rise to any conversation at all silence absolute silence the old silence which she had known for a dozen years before lucy had come to her would have been better than this she was very angry more angry than she had ever yet been with lucy and yet she was afraid to show her anger was this the girls gratitude for all that her uncle was doing for herfor shelter food comfort for all that she had in the world mrs dosett knew though lucy did not of the little increased pinchings which had been made necessary by the advent of another inmate in the house so many pounds of the meat in the week and so much bread and so much tea and sugar it had all been calculated in genteel houses such calculation must often be made and when by degreesdegrees very quickthe garments should become worn which lucy had brought with her there must be something taken from the tightfitting income for that need arrangements had already been made of which lucy knew nothing and already the two glasses of port wine a day had been knocked off from poor mr dosetts comforts his wife had sobbed in despair when he had said that it should be so he had declared gin and water to be as supporting as port wine and the thing had been done lucy inwardly had been disgusted by the gin and water knowing nothing of its history her father who had not always been punctual in paying his winemerchants bills would not have touched gin and water would not have allowed it to contaminate his table everything in mr dosetts house was paid for weekly  and now lucy who had been made welcome to all that the genteel house could afford who had been taken in as a child had spoken of her lot as one which was all sorrowful bad as it isthis living in kingsbury crescenti would rather bear it myself than subject ayala to such misery it was thus that she had in fact spoken of her new home when she had found it necessary to defend her feelings towards her sister it was impossible that her aunt should be altogether silent under such treatment we have done the best for you that is in our power lucy she said with a whole load of reproach in her tone  have i complained aunt  i thought you did  oh no you asked me whether i envied ayala what was i to say perhaps i should have said nothing but the idea of envying ayala was painful to me of course she  well  i had better say nothing more aunt if i were to pretend to be cheerful i should be false it is as yet only a few weeks since papa died then the work went on in silence between them for the next hour  and the work went on in solemn silence between them through the winter it came to pass that the sole excitement of lucys life came from ayalas lettersthe sole excitement except a meeting which took place between the sisters one day when lucy was taken to kingsbury crescent ayala was at once carried down to glenbogie and from thence there came letters twice a week for six weeks ayalas letters too were full of sorrow she too had lost her mother her father and her sister moreover in her foolish petulance she said things of her aunt emmeline and of the girls and of sir thomas which ought not to have been written of those who were kind to her her cousin tom too she ridiculedtom tringle the sonandheirsaying that he was a lout who endeavoured to make eyes at her oh how distasteful how vulgar they were after all that she had known perhaps the eldest girl augusta was the worst she did not think that she could put up with the assumed authority of augusta gertrude was better but a simpleton ayala declared herself to be sad at heart but then the sweet scenery of glenbogie and the colour of the moors and the glorious heights of ben alchan made some amends even in her sorrow she would rave about the beauties of glenbogie lucy as she read the letters told herself that ayalas grief was a grief to be borne a grief almost to be enjoyed to sit and be sad with a stream purling by you how different from the sadness of that diningroom in the crescent to look out upon the glories of a mountain while a tear would now and again force itself into the eye how much less bitter than the falling of salt drops over a tattered towel  lucy in her answers endeavoured to repress the groans of her spirit in the first place she did acknowledge that it did not become her to speak ill of those who were in truth her benefactors and then she was anxious not to declare to ayala her feeling of the injustice by which their two lots had been defined to them though she had failed to control herself once or twice in speaking to her aunt she did control herself in writing her letters she would never never write a word which should make ayala unnecessarily unhappy on that she was determined she would say nothing to explain to ayala the unutterable tedium of that downstairs parlour in which they passed their lives lest ayala should feel herself to be wounded by the luxurious comforts around her  it was thus she wrote then there came a time in which they were to meetjust at the beginning of november the tringles were going to rome they generally did go somewhere glenbogie merle park and the house in queens gate were not enough for the year sir thomas was to take them to rome and then return to london for the manipulation of the millions in lombard street he generally did remain nine months out of the twelve in town because of the millions making his visits at merle park very short but lady tringle found that change of air was good for the girls it was her intention now to remain at rome for two or three months  the party from scotland reached queens gate late one saturday evening and intended to start early on the monday to ayala who had made it quite a matter of course that she should see her sister lady tringle had said that in that case a carriage must be sent across it was awkward because there were no carriages in london she had thought that they had all intended to pass through london just as though they were not stopping sunday she had thought was not to be regarded as being a day at all then ayala flashed up she had flashed up some times before was it supposed that she was not going to see lucy carriage she would walk across kensington gardens and find the house out all by herself she would spend the whole day with lucy and come back alone in a cab she was strong enough at any rate to have her way so far that a carriage wherever it came from was sent for lucy about three in the afternoon and did take her back to kingsbury crescent after dinner  then at last the sisters were together in ayalas bedroom and now tell me about everything said ayala  but lucy was resolved that she would not tell anything i am so wretched that would have been all but she would not tell her wretchedness we are so quiet in kingsbury crescent she said you have so much more to talk of  oh lucy i do not like it  not your aunt  she is not the worst though she sometimes is hard to bear i cant tell you what it is but they all seem to think so much of themselves in the first place they never will say a word about papa  perhaps that is from feeling ayey  no it is not one would know that but they look down upon papa who had more in his little finger than they have with all their money  then i should hold my tongue  so i doabout him but it is very hard and then augusta has a way with me as though she had a right to order me i certainly will not be ordered by augusta you never ordered me  dear ayey  augusta is older than youof course ever so much they make her out twentythree at her last birthday but she is twentyfour but that is not difference enough for orderingcertainly between cousins i do hate augusta  i would not hate her  how is one to help onesself she has a way of whispering to gertrude and to her mother when i am there which almost kills me if youll only give me notice ill go out of the room at once i said the other day and they were all so angry  i would not make them angry if i were you ayey  why not  not sir thomas or aunt emmeline  i dont care a bit for sir thomas i am not sure but he is the most goodnatured though he is so podgy of course when aunt emmeline tells me anything i do it  it is so important that you should be on good terms with them  i dont see it at all said ayala flashing round  aunt emmeline can do so much for you we have nothing of our ownyou and i  am i to sell myself because they have got money no indeed no one despises money so much as i do i will never be other to them than if i had the money and they were the poor relations  that will not do ayey  i will make it do they may turn me out if they like of course i know that i should obey my aunt and so i will if sir thomas told me anything i should do it but not augusta then while lucy was thinking how she might best put into soft words advice which was so clearly needed ayala declared another trouble but there is worse still  what is that  tom  what does tom do  you know tom lucy  i have seen him  of all the horrors he is the horridest  does he order you about  no but he  what is it ayey  oh lucy he is so dreadful he  you dont mean that he makes love to you  he does what am i to do lucy  do they know it  augusta does im sure and pretends to think that it is my fault i am sure that there will be a terrible quarrel some day i told him the day before we left glenbogie that i should tell his mother i did indeed then he grinned he is such a fool and when i laughed he took it all as kindness i couldnt have helped laughing if i had died for it  but he has been left behind  yes for the present but he is to come over to us some time after christmas when uncle tringle has gone back  a girl need not be bothered by a lover unless she chooses ayey  but it will be such a bother to have to talk about it he looks at me and is such an idiot then augusta frowns when i see augusta frowning i am so angry that i feel like boxing her ears do you know lucy that i often think that it will not do and that i shall have to be sent away i wish it had been you that they had chosen  such was the conversation between the girls of what was said everything appertained to ayala of the very nature of lucys life not a word was spoken as ayala was talking lucy was constantly thinking of all that might be lost by her sisters imprudence even though augusta might be disagreeable even though tom might be a bore it should all be borneborne at any rate for a whileseeing how terrible would be the alternative the alternative to lucy seemed to be kingsbury crescent and aunt dosett it did not occur to her to think whether in any possible case ayala would indeed be added to the crescent family or what in that case would become of herself and whether they two might live with aunt dosett and whether in that case life would not be infinitely improved ayala had all that money could do for her and would have such a lookout into the world from a wealthy house as might be sure at last to bring her some such husband as would be desirable ayala in fact had everything before her and lucy had nothing wherefore it became lucys duty to warn ayala so that she should bear with much and throw away nothing if ayala could only know what life might be what life was at kingsbury crescent then she would be patient then she would softly make a confidence with her aunt as to toms folly then she would propitiate augusta not care for money ayala had not yet lived in an ugly room and darned sheets all the morning ayala had never sat for two hours between the slumbers of uncle dosett and the knitting of aunt dosett ayala had not been brought into contact with gin and water  oh ayala she said as they were going down to dinner together do struggle do bear it tell aunt emmeline she will like you to tell her if augusta wants you to go anywhere do go what does it signify papa and mamma are gone and we are alone all this she said without a word of allusion to her own sufferings ayala made a half promise she did not think she would go anywhere for augustas telling but she would do her best to satisfy aunt emmeline then they went to dinner and after dinner lucy was taken home without further words between them  ayala wrote long letters on her journey full of what she saw and full of her companions from paris she wrote and then from turin and then again on their immediate arrival at rome her letters were most imprudent as written from the close vicinity of her aunt and cousin it was such a comfort that that oaf tom had been left behind uncle tringle was angry because he did not get what he liked to eat aunt emmeline gave that courier such a terrible life sending for him every quarter of an hour augusta would talk first french and then italian of which no one could understand a word gertrude was so sick with travelling that she was as pale as a sheet nobody seemed to care for anything she could not get her aunt to look at the campanile at florence or her cousins to know one picture from another as for pictures i am quite sure that mangles angels would do as well as raffaels mangle was a brother academician whom their father had taught them to despise there was contempt most foolish contempt for all the tringles but luckily there had been no quarrelling then it seemed that both in paris and in florence ayala had bought pretty things from which it was to be argued that her uncle had provided her liberally with money one pretty thing had been sent from paris to lucy which could not have been bought for less than many franks it would not be fair that ayala should take so much without giving something in return  lucy knew that she too should give something in return though kingsbury crescent was not attractive though aunt dosett was not to her a pleasant companion she had begun to realise the fact that it behoved her to be grateful if only for the food she ate and for the bed on which she slept as she thought of all that ayala owed she remembered also her own debts as the winter went on she struggled to pay them but aunt dosett was a lady not much given to vacillation she had become aware at first that lucy had been rough to her and she did not easily open herself to lucys endearments lucys life at kingsbury crescent had begun badly and lucy though she understood much about it found it hard to turn a bad beginning to a good result     chapter iv  isadore hamel   it was suggested to lucy before she had been long in kingsbury crescent that she should take some exercise for the first week she had hardly been out of the house but this was attributed to her sorrow then she had accompanied her aunt for a few days during the halfhours marketing which took place every morning but in this there had been no sympathy lucy would not interest herself in the shoulder of mutton which must be of just such a weight as to last conveniently for two daystwelve poundsof which it was explained to her more than onehalf was intended for the two servants because there was always a more lavish consumption in the kitchen than in the parlour lucy would not appreciate the fact that eggs at a penny a piece whatever they might be must be used for puddings as eggs with even a reputation of freshness cost twopence aunt dosett beyond this never left the house on weekdays except for a few calls which were made perhaps once a month on which occasion the sunday gloves and the sunday silk dress were used on sunday they all went to church but this was not enough for exercise and as lucy was becoming pale she was recommended to take to walking in kensington gardens  it is generally understood that there are raging lions about the metropolis who would certainly eat up young ladies whole if young ladies were to walk about the streets or even about the parks by themselves there is however beginning to be some vacillation as to the received belief on this subject as regards london in large continental towns such as paris and vienna young ladies would be devoured certainly such at least is the creed in new york and washington there are supposed to be no lions so that young ladies go about free as air in london there is a rising doubt under which before long probably the lions will succumb altogether mrs dosett did believe somewhat in lions but she believed also in exercise and she was aware that the lions eat up chiefly rich people young ladies who must go about without mothers brothers uncles carriages or attendants of any sort are not often eaten or even roared at it is the dainty darlings for whom the roarings have to be feared mrs dosett aware that daintiness was no longer within the reach of her and hers did assent to these walkings in kensington gardens at some hour in the afternoon lucy would walk from the house by herself and within a quarter of an hour would find herself on the broad gravel path which leads down to the round pond from thence she would go by the back of the albert memorial and then across by the serpentine and return to the same gate never leaving kensington gardens aunt dosett had expressed some oldfashioned idea that lions were more likely to roar in hyde park than within the comparatively retired purlieus of kensington  now the reader must be taken back for a few moments to the bijou as the bijou was before either the artist or his wife had died in those days there had been a frequent concourse of people in the artists house society there had not consisted chiefly of eating and drinking men and women would come in and out as though really for a purpose of talking there would be three or four constantly with dormer in his studio helping him but little perhaps in the real furtherance of his work though discussing art subjects in a manner calculated to keep alive artfeeling among them a novelist or two of a morning might perhaps aid me in my general pursuit but would i think interfere with the actual tally of pages egbert dormer did not turn out from his hand so much work as some men that i know but he was overflowing with art up to his earsand with tobacco so that upon the whole the bijou was a pleasant rendezvous  there had come there of late quite of late a young sculptor named isadore hamel hamel was an englishman who however had been carried very early to rome and had been bred there of his mother question never was made but his father had been well known as an english sculptor resident at rome the elder hamel had been a man of mark who had a fine suite of rooms in the city and a villa on one of the lakes but who never came to england english connections were he said to him abominable by which he perhaps meant that the restrictions of decent life were not to his taste but his busts came and his groups in marble and now and again some great work for some public decoration so that money was plentiful with him and he was a man of note it must be acknowledged of him that he spared nothing in bringing up his son giving him such education as might best suit his future career as an artist and that money was always forthcoming for the lads wants and fantasies  then young hamel also became a sculptor of much promise but early in life differed from his father on certain subjects of importance the father was wedded to rome and to italy isadore gradually expressed an opinion that the nearer a man was to his market the better for him that all that art could do for a man in rome was as nothing to the position which a great artist might make for himself in londonthat in fact an englishman had better be an englishman at twentysix he succeeded in his attempt and became known as a young sculptor with a workshop at brompton he became known to many both by his work and his acquirements but it may not be surprising that after a year he was still unable to live as he had been taught to live without drawing upon his father then his father threw his failure in his teeth not refusing him money indeed but making the receipt of it unpleasant to him  at no house had isadore hamel been made so welcome as at dormers there was a sympathy between them both on that great question of art whether to an artist his art should be a matter to him of more importance than all the world besides so said dormerwho simply died because his wife died who could not have touched his brush if one of his girls had been suffering who with all his genius was but a faineant workman his art more than all the world to him no not to him perhaps here and again to some enthusiast and him hardly removed from madness where is the painter who shall paint a picture after his souls longing though he shall get not a penny for itthough he shall starve as he put his last touch to it when he knows that by drawing some duchess of the day he shall in a fortnight earn a ducal price shall a wife and child be less dear to him than to a lawyeror to a shoemaker or the very craving of his hunger less obdurate a mans self and what he has within him and his belongings with his outlook for this and other worldslet that be the first and the work noble or otherwise be the second to be honest is greater than to have painted the san sisto or to have chiselled the apollo to have assisted in making others honestinfinitely greater all of which were discussed at great length at the bijou and the bijouites always sided with the master of the house to an artist said dormer let his art be everythingabove wife and children above money above health above even character then he would put out his hand with his jewelled finger and stretch forth his velvetclad arm and soon after lead his friend away to the little dinner at which no luxury had been spared but young hamel agreed with the sermons and not the less because lucy dormer had sat by and listened to them with rapt attention  not a word of love had been spoken to her by the sculptor when her mother died but there had been glances and little feelings of which each was half conscious it is so hard for a young man to speak of love if there be real loveso impossible that a girl should do so not a word had been spoken but each had thought that the other must have known to lucy a word had been spoken by her motherdo not think too much of him till you know the mother had saidnot quite prudently oh no i will think of him not at all lucy had replied and she had thought of him day and night i wonder why mr hamel is so different with you ayala had said to her sister i am sure he is not different with me lucy had replied then ayala had shaken her full locks and smiled  things came quickly after that mrs dormer had sickened and died there was no time then for thinking of that handsome brow of that short jet black hair of those eyes so full of fire and thoughtfulness of that perfect mouth and the deep but yet soft voice still even in her sorrow this new god of her idolatry was not altogether forgotten it was told to her that he had been summoned off to rome by his father and she wondered whether he was to find his home at rome for ever then her father was ill and in his illness hamel came to say one word of farewell before he started  you find me crushed to the ground the painter said something the young man whispered as to the consolation which time would bring not to me said dormer it is as though one had lost his eyes one cannot see without his eyes it was true of him his light had been put out  then on the landing at the top of the stairs there had been one word between lucy and the sculptor i ought not to have intruded on you perhaps he said but after so much kindness i could hardly go without a word  i am sure he will be glad that you have come  and you  i am glad tooso that i may say goodbye then she put out her hand and he held it for a moment as he looked into her eyes there was not a word more but it seemed to lucy as though there had been so many words  things went on quickly egbert dormer died and lucy was taken away to kingsbury crescent when once ayala had spoken about mr hamel lucy had silenced her any allusion to the idea of love wounded her as though it was too impossible for dreams too holy for words how should there be words about a lover when father and mother were both dead he had gone to his old and natural home he had gone and of course he would not return to ayala when she came up to london early in november to ayala who was going to rome where isadore hamel now was isadore hamels name was not mentioned but through the long mornings of her life through the long evenings through the long nights she still thought of himshe could not keep herself from thinking to a girl whose life is full of delights her lover need not be so very muchneed not at least be everything though he be a lover to be loved at all points her friends will be something her dancing her horse her theatregoing her brothers and sisters even her father and mother but lucy had nothing the vision of isadore hamel had passed across her life and had left with her the only possession that she had it need hardly be said that she never alluded to that possession at kingsbury crescent it was not a possession from which any enjoyment could come except that of thinking of it he had passed away from her and there was no point of life at which he could come across her again there was no longer that halfjoint studio if it had been her lot to be as was ayala she then would have been taken to rome then again he would have looked into her eyes and taken her hand in his then perhaps but now even though he were to come back to london he would know nothing of her haunts even in that case nothing would bring them together as the idea was crossing her mindas it did cross it so frequentlyshe saw him turning from the path on which she was walking making his way towards the steps of the memorial  though she saw no more than his back she was sure that it was isadore hamel for a moment there was an impulse on her to run after him and to call his name it was then early in january and she was taking her daily walk through kensington gardens she had walked there daily now for the last two months and had never spoken a word or been addressedhad never seen a face that she had recognised it had seemed to her that she had not an acquaintance in the world except uncle reg and aunt dosett and now almost within reach of her hand was the one being in all the world whom she most longed to see she did stand and the word was formed within her lips but she could not speak it then came the thought that she would run after him but the thought was expelled quickly though she might lose him again and for ever she could not do that she stood almost gasping till he was out of sight and then she passed on upon her usual round  she never omitted her walks after that and always paused a moment as the path turned away to the memorial it was not that she thought that she might meet him therethere rather than elsewherebut there is present to us often an idea that when some object has passed from us that we have desired then it may be seen again day after day and week after week she did not see him during this time there came letters from ayala saying that their return to england was postponed till the first week in februarythat she would certainly see lucy in februarythat she was not going to be hurried through london in halfanhour because her aunt wished it and that she would do as she pleased as to visiting her sister then there was a word or two about tomoh tomthat idiot tom and another word or two about augusta augusta is worse than ever we have not spoken to each other for the last day or two this came but a day or two before the intended return of the tringles  no actual day had been fixed but on the day before that on which lucy thought it probable that the tringles might return to town she was again walking in the gardens having put two and two together as people do she felt sure that the travellers could not be away more than a day or two longer her mind was much intent upon ayala feeling that the imprudent girl was subjecting herself to great danger knowing that it was wrong that she and augusta should be together in the house without speakingthinking of her sisters perilswhen of a sudden hamel was close before her there was no question of calling to him nowno question of an attempt to see him face to face she had been wandering along the path with eyes fixed upon the ground when her name was sharply called and they two were close to each other hamel had a friend with him and it seemed to lucy at once that she could only bow to him only mutter something and then pass on how can a girl stand and speak to a gentleman in public especially when that gentleman has a friend with him she tried to look pleasant bowed smiled muttered something and was passing on but he was not minded to lose her thus immediately miss dormer he said i have seen your sister at rome may i not say a word about her  why should he not say a word about ayala in a minute he had left his friend and was walking back along the path with lucy there was not much that he had to say about ayala he had seen ayala and the tringles and did manage to let it escape him that lady tringle had not been very gracious to himself when once in public he had claimed acquaintance with ayala but at that he simply smiled then he had asked of lucy where she lived with my uncle mr dosett said lucy at kingsbury crescent then when he asked whether he might call lucy with many blushes had said that her aunt did not receive many visitorsthat her uncles house was different from what her fathers had been  shall i not see you at all then he asked  she did not like to ask him after his own purposes of life whether he was now a resident in london or whether he intended to return to rome she was covered with bashfulness and dreaded to seem even to be interested in his affairs oh yes she said perhaps we may meet some day  here he asked  oh no not here it was only an accident as she said this she determined that she must walk no more in kensington gardens it would be dreadful indeed were he to imagine that she would consent to make an appointment with him it immediately occurred to her that the lions were about and that she must shut herself up  i have thought of you every day since i have been back he said and i did not know where to hear of you now that we have met am i to lose you again lose her what did he mean by losing her she too had found a friendshe who had been so friendless would it not be dreadful to her also to lose him is there no place where i may ask of you  when ayala is back and they are in town perhaps i shall sometimes be at lady tringles said lucy resolved that she would not tell him of her immediate abode this was at any rate a certain address from where he might commence further inquiries should he wish to make inquiry and as such he accepted it i think i had better go now said lucy trembling at the apparent impropriety of her present conversation  he knew that it was intended that he should leave her and he went i hope i have not offended you in coming so far  oh no then again she gave him her hand and again there was the same look as he took his leave  when she got home which was before the dusk having resolved that she must at any rate tell her aunt that she had met a friend she found that her uncle had returned from his office this was a most unusual occurrence her uncle she knew left somerset house exactly at halfpast four and always took an hour and a quarter for his walk she had never seen him in kingsbury crescent till a quarter before six i have got letters from rome he said in a solemn voice  from ayala  one from ayala for you it is here and i have had one from my sister also and one in the course of the day from your uncle in lombard street you had better read them there was something terribly tragic in uncle dosetts voice as he spoke  and so must the reader read the letters but they must be delayed for a few chapters     chapter v  at glenbogie   we must go back to ayalas life during the autumn and winter she was rapidly whirled away to glenbogie amidst the affectionate welcomings of her aunt and cousins all manner of good things were done for her as to presents and comforts young as she was she had money given to her which was not without attraction and though she was of course in the depth of her mourning she was made to understand that even mourning might be made becoming if no expense were spared no expense among the tringles ever was spared and at first ayala liked the bounty of profusion but before the end of the first fortnight there grew upon her a feeling that even bank notes become tawdry if you are taught to use them as curlpapers it may be said that nothing in the world is charming unless it be achieved at some trouble if it rained 64 leovillewhich i regard as the most divine of nectarsi feel sure that i should never raise it to my lips ayala did not argue the matter out in her mind but in very early days she began to entertain a dislike to tringle magnificence there had been a good deal of luxury at the bijou but always with a feeling that it ought not to be therethat more money was being spent than prudence authorisedwhich had certainly added a savour to the luxuries a lovely bonnet is it not more lovely because the destined wearer knows that there is some wickedness in achieving it all the bonnets all the claret all the horses seemed to come at queens gate and at glenbogie without any wickedness there was no more question about them than as to ones ordinary bread and butter at breakfast sir thomas had a waya merit shall we call it or a faultof pouring out his wealth upon the family as though it were water running in perpetuity from a mountain tarn ayala the romantic ayala the poetic found very soon that she did not like it  perhaps the only pleasure left to the very rich is that of thinking of the deprivations of the poor the bonnets and the claret and the horses have lost their charm but the gladstone and the old hats and the fourwheeled cabs of their neighbours still have a little flavour for them from this source it seemed to ayala that the tringles drew much of the recreation of their lives sir thomas had his way of enjoying this amusement but it was a way that did not specially come beneath ayalas notice when she heard that breakatlast the huddersfield manufacturer had to sell his pictures and that all shoddy and stuffgoods grand doings for the last two years had only been a flash in the pan she did not understand enough about it to feel wounded but when she heard her aunt say that people like the poodles had better not have a place in scotland than have to let it and when augusta hinted that lady sophia smallware had pawned her diamonds then she felt that her nearest and dearest relatives smelt abominably of money  of all the family sir thomas was most persistently the kindest to her though he was a man who did not look to be kind she was pretty and though he was ugly himself he liked to look at things pretty he was too perhaps a little tired of his own wife and daughterswho were indeed what he had made them but still were not quite to his taste in a general way he gave instructions that ayala should be treated exactly as a daughter and he informed his wife that he intended to add a codicil to his will on her behalf is that necessary asked lady tringle who began to feel something like natural jealousy i suppose i ought to do something for a girl if i take her by the hand said sir thomas roughly if she gets a husband i will give her something and that will do as well nothing more was said about it but when sir thomas went up to town the codicil was added to his will  ayala was foolish rather than ungrateful not understanding the nature of the family to which she was relegated before she had been taken away she had promised lucy that she would be obedient to her aunt there had hardly been such a word as obedience known at the bijou if any were obedient it was the mother and the father to the daughters lucy and ayala as well had understood something of this and therefore ayala had promised to be obedient to her aunt and to uncle thomas lucy had demanded with an imploring embrace oh yes said ayala dreading her uncle at that time she soon learned that no obedience whatsoever was exacted from sir thomas she had to kiss him morning and evening and then to take whatever presents he made her an easy uncle he was to deal with and she almost learned to love him nor was aunt emmeline very exigeant though she was fantastic and sometimes disagreeable but augusta was the great difficulty lucy had not told her to obey augusta and augusta she would not obey now augusta demanded obedience  you never ordered me ayala had said to lucy when they met in london as the tringles were passing through at the bijou there had been a republic in which all the inhabitants and all the visitors had been free and equal such republicanism had been the very mainspring of life at the bijou ayala loved equality and she specially felt that it should exist among sisters do anything for lucy oh yes indeed anything abandon anything but for lucy as a sister among sisters not for an elder as from a younger and if she were not bound to serve lucy then certainly not augusta but augusta liked to be served on one occasion she sent ayala upstairs and on another she sent ayala downstairs ayala went but determined to be equal with her cousin on the morning following in the presence of aunt emmeline and of gertrude in the presence also of two other ladies who were visiting at the house she asked augusta if she would mind running upstairs and fetching her scrapbook she had been thinking about it all the night and all the morning plucking up her courage but she had been determined she found a great difficulty in saying the words but she said them the thing was so preposterous that all the ladies in the room looked aghast at the proposition i really think that augusta has got something else to do said aunt emmeline oh very well said ayala and then they were all silent augusta who was employed on a silk purse sat still and did not say a word  had a great secret or rather a great piece of news which pervaded the family been previously communicated to ayala she would not probably have made so insane a suggestion augusta was engaged to be married to the honourable septimus traffick the member for port glasgow a young lady who is already half a bride is not supposed to run up and down stairs as readily as a mere girl for running up and down stairs at the bijou ayala had been proverbial they were a family who ran up and down with the greatest alacrity oh papa my basket is out on the seatfor there had been a seat in the twofoot garden behind the house papa would go down in two jumps and come up with three skips and there was the basket only because his girl liked him to do something for her but for him ayala would run about as though she were a tricksy ariel had the important matrimonial news been conveyed to ariel with a true girls spirit she would have felt that during the present period augusta was entitled to special exemption from all ordering had she herself been engaged she would have run more and quicker than everwould have been excited thereto by the peculiar vitality of her new prospects but to even augusta she would be subservient because of her appreciation of bridal importance she however had not been told till that afternoon  you should not have asked augusta to go up stairs said aunt emmeline in a tone of mitigated reproach  oh i didnt know said ayala  you had meant to say that because she had sent you you were to send her there is a difference you know  i didnt know said ayala beginning to think that she would fight her battle if told of such differences as she believed to exist  i had meant to tell you before but i may as well tell you now augusta is engaged to be married to the honourable mr septimus traffick he is second son of lord boardotrade and is in the house  dear me said ayala acknowledging at once within her heart that the difference alleged was one against which she need not rouse herself to the fight aunt emmeline had in truth intended to insist on that differenceand another but her courage had failed her  yes indeed he is a man very much thought of just now in public life and augustas mind is naturally much occupied he writes all those letters in the times about supply and demand  does he aunt ayala did feel that if augustas mind was entirely occupied with supply and demand she ought not to be made to go upstairs to fetch a scrapbook but she had her doubts about augustas mind nevertheless if the forthcoming husband were true that might be a reason if anybody had told me before i wouldnt have asked her she said  then lady tringle explained that it had been thought better not to say anything heretofore as to the coming matrimonial hilarities because of the sadness which had fallen upon the dormer family ayala accepted this as an excuse and nothing further was said as to the iniquity of her request to her cousin but there was a general feeling among the women that ayala in lieu of gratitude had exhibited an intention of rebelling  on the next day mr traffick arrived whose coming had probably made it necessary that the news should be told ayala was never so surprised in her life as when she saw him she had never yet had a lover of her own had never dreamed of a lover but she had her own idea as to what a lover ought to be she had thought that isadore hamel would be a very nice loverfor her sister hamel was young handsome with a great deal to say on such a general subject as art but too bashful to talk easily to the girl he admired ayala had thought that all that was just as it should be she was altogether resolved that hamel and her sister should be lovers and was determined to be devoted to her future brotherinlaw but the honourable septimus traffick it was a question to her whether her uncle tringle would not have been better as a lover  and yet there was nothing amiss about mr traffick he was very much like an ordinary hardworking member of the house of commons over perhaps rather than under forty years of age he was somewhat bald somewhat grey somewhat fat and had lost that look of rosy plumpness which is seldom i fear compatible with hard work and late hours he was not particularly ugly nor was he absurd in appearance but he looked to be a disciple of business not of pleasure nor of art to sit out on the bank of a stream and have him beside one would not be particularly nice thought ayala to herself mr traffick no doubt would have enjoyed it very well if he could have spared the time but to ayala it seemed that such a man as that could have cared nothing for love as soon as she saw him and realised in her mind the fact that augusta was to become his wife she felt at once the absurdity of sending augusta on a message  augusta that evening was somewhat more than ordinarily kind to her cousin now that the great secret was told her cousin no doubt would recognise her importance i suppose you had not heard of him before she said to ayala  i never did  thats because you have not attended to the debates  i never have what are debates  mr traffick is very much thought of in the house of commons on all subjects affecting commerce  oh  it is the most glorious study which the world affords  the house of commons i dont think it can be equal to art  then augusta turned up her nose with a double turnfirst as against painters mr dormer having been no more and then at ayalas ignorance in supposing that the house of commons could have been spoken of as a study mr traffick will probably be in the government some day she said  has not he been yet asked ayala  not yet  then wont he be very old before he gets there this was a terrible question young ladies of fiveandtwenty when they marry gentlemen of fourandfifty make up their minds for wellunderstood and wellrecognised old age they see that they had best declare their purpose and they do declare it of course mr walker is old enough to be my father but i have made up my mind that i like that better than anything else then the wall has been jumped and the thing can go smoothly but at fortyfive there is supposed to be so much of youth left that the difference of age may possibly be tided over and not made to appear abnormal augusta tringle had determined to tide it over in this way the fortyfive had been gradually reduced to less than fortythough all the peerages were there to give the lie to the assertion she talked of her lover as septimus and was quite prepared to sit with him beside a stream if only halfanhour for the amusement could be found when therefore ayala suggested that if her lover wanted to get into office he had better do so quickly lest he should be too old augusta was not well pleased  lord boardotrade was much older when he began said augusta his friends indeed tell septimus that he should not push himself forward too quickly but i dont think that i ever came across any one who was so ignorant of such things as you are ayala  perhaps he is not so old as he looks said ayala after this it may be imagined that there was not close friendship between the cousins augustas mind was filled with a strong conception as to ayalas ingratitude the houseless penniless orphan had been taken in and had done nothing but make herself disagreeable young no doubt she was young but had she been as old as methuselah she could not have been more insolent it did not however matter to her augusta she was going away but it would be terrible to her mamma and to gertrude thus it was that augusta spoke of her cousin to her mother  and then there came another trouble which was more troublesome to ayala even than the other tom tringle who was in the house in lombard street who was the only son and heir to the title and no doubt to much of the wealth had chosen to take ayalas part and to enlist himself as her special friend ayala had at first accepted him as a cousin and had consented to fraternise with him then on some unfortunate day there had been some word or look which she had failed not to understand and immediately she had become afraid of tom tom was not like isadore hamelwas very far indeed from that idea of a perfect lover which ayalas mind had conceived but he was by no means a lout or an oaf or an idiot as ayala in her letters to her sister had described him he had been first at eton and then at oxford and having spent a great deal of money recklessly and done but little towards his education had been withdrawn and put into the office his father declared of him now that he would do fairly well in the world he had a taste for dress and kept four or five hunters which he got but little credit by riding he made a fuss about his shooting but did not shoot much he was stout and awkward lookingvery like his father but without that settled air which age gives to heavy men in appearance he was not the sort of lover to satisfy the preconceptions of such a girl as ayala but he was goodnatured and true at last he became to her terribly true his love such as it seemed at first was absurd to her if you make yourself such a fool tom ill never speak to you again she had said once even after that she had not understood that it was more than a stupid joke but the joke while it was considered as such was very distasteful to her and afterwards when a certain earnestness in it was driven in upon her it became worse than distasteful  she repudiated his love with such power as she had but she could not silence him she could not at all understand that a young man who seemed to her to be an oaf should really be in lovehonestly in love with her but such was the case then she became afraid lest others should see itafraid though she often told herself that she would appeal to her aunt for protection i tell you i dont care a bit about you and you oughtnt to go on she said but he did go on and though her aunt did not see it augusta did  then augusta spoke a word to her in scorn ayala she said you should not encourage tom  encourage him what a word from one girl to another what a world of wrong there was in the idea which had created the word what an absence of the sort of feeling which according to ayalas theory of life there should be on such a matter between two sisters two cousins or two friends encourage him when augusta ought to have been the first to assist her in her trouble oh augusta she said turning sharply round what a spiteful creature you are  i suppose you think so because i do not choose to approve  approve of what tom is thoroughly disagreeable sometimes he makes my life such a burden to me that i think i shall have to go to my aunt but you are worse oh exclaimed ayala shuddering as she thought of the unwomanly treachery of which her cousin was guilty towards her  nothing more came of it at glenbogie tom was required in lombard street and the matter was not suspected by aunt emmelineas far at least as ayala was aware when he was gone it was to her as though there would be a world of time before she would see him again they were to go to rome and he would not be at rome till january before that he might have forgotten his folly but ayala was quite determined that she would never forget the ill offices of augusta she did hate augusta as she had told her sister then in this frame of mind the family was taken to rome     chapter vi  at rome   during her journeying and during her sojourn at rome ayala did enjoy much but even these joys did not come to her without causing some trouble of spirit at glenbogie everybody had known that she was a dependent niece and that as such she was in truth nobody on that morning when she had ordered augusta to go upstairs the two visitors had stared with amazementwho would not have stared at all had they heard ayala ordered in the same way but it came about that in rome ayala was almost of more importance than the tringles it was absolutely true that lady tringle and augusta and gertrude were asked here and there because of ayala and the worst of it was that the fact was at last suspected by the tringles themselves sometimes they would not always be asked one of the tringle girls would only be named but ayala was never forgotten once or twice an effort was made by some grand lady whose taste was perhaps more conspicuous than her goodnature to get ayala without burdening herself with any of the tringles when this became clear to the mind of augustaof augusta engaged as she was to the honourable septimus traffick member of parliamentaugustas feelings weresuch as may better be understood than described dont let her go mamma she said to lady tringle one morning  but the marchesa has made such a point of it  bother the marchesa who is the marchesa i believe it is all ayalas doing because she expects to meet that mr hamel it is dreadful to see the way she goes on  mr hamel was a very intimate friend of her fathers  i dont believe a bit of it  he certainly used to be at his house i remember seeing him  i daresay but that doesnt justify ayala in running after him as she does i believe that all this about the marchesa is because of mr hamel this was better than believing that ayala was to be asked to sing and that ayala was to be fêted and admired and danced with simply because ayala was ayala and that they the tringles in spite of glenbogie merle park and queens gate were not wanted at all but when aunt emmeline signified to ayala that on that particular morning she had better not go to the marchesas picnic ayala simply said that she had promisedand ayala went  at this time no gentleman of the family was with them sir thomas had gone and tom tringle had not come then just at christmas the honourable septimus traffick came for a short visita very short visit no more than four or five days because supply and demand were requiring all his services in preparation for the coming session of parliament but for five halcyon days he was prepared to devote himself to the glories of rome under the guidance of augusta he did not of course sleep at the palazzo ruperti where it delighted lady tringle to inform her friends in rome that she had a suite of apartments au première but he ate there and drank there and almost lived there so that it became absolutely necessary to inform the world of rome that it was augustas destiny to become in course of time the honourable mrs traffick otherwise the close intimacy would hardly have been discreetunless it had been thought as the illnatured marchesa had hinted that mr traffick was lady tringles elder brother augusta however was by no means ashamed of her lover perhaps she felt that when it was known that she was about to be the bride of so great a man then doors would be open for her at any rate as wide as for her cousin at this moment she was very important to herself she was about to convey no less a sum than £120000 to mr traffick who in truth as younger son of lord boardotrade was himself not well endowed considering her own position and her future husbands rank and standing she did not know how a young woman could well be more important she was very important at any rate to mr traffick she was sure of that when therefore she learned that ayala had been asked to a grand ball at the marchesas that mr traffick was also to be among the guests and that none of the tringles had been invitedthen her anger became hot  she must have been very stupid when she took it into her head to be jealous of mr trafficks attention to her cousin stupid at any rate when she thought that her cousin was laying out feminine lures for mr traffick poor ayala we shall see much of her in these pages and it may be well to declare of her at once that her ideas at this moment about menor rather about a possible manwere confined altogether to the abstract she had floating in her young mind some fancies as to the beauty of love that there should be a hero must of course be necessary but in her daydreams this hero was almost celestialor at least æthereal it was a concentration of poetic perfection to which there was not as yet any appanage of apparel of features or of wealth it was a something out of heaven which should think it well to spend his whole time in adoring her and making her more blessed than had ever yet been a woman upon the earth then her first approach to a mundane feeling had been her acknowledgment to herself that isadore hamel would do as a lover for lucy isadore hamel was certainly very handsomewas possessed of infinite good gifts but even he would by no means have come up to her requirements for her own hero that hero must have wings tinged with azure whereas hamel had a not much more ætherealised than ordinary coat and waistcoat she knew that heroes with azure wings were not existent save in the imagination and as she desired a real lover for lucy hamel would do but for herself her imagination was too valuable then to allow her to put her foot upon earth such as she was must not augusta have been very stupid to have thought that ayala should become fond of her mr traffick  her cousin tom had come to her and had been to her as a newfoundland dog is when he jumps all over you just when he has come out of a horsepond she would have liked tom had he kept his doglike gambols at a proper distance but when he would cover her with muddy water he was abominable but this augusta had not understood with mr traffick there would be no doglike gambols and as he was not harsh to her ayala liked him she had liked her uncle such men were to her thinking more like dogs than lovers she sang when mr traffick asked her and made a picture for him and went with him to the coliseum and laughed at him about supply and demand she was very pretty and perhaps mr traffick did like to look at her  i really think you were too free with mr traffick last night augusta said to her one morning  free how free  you werelaughing at him  oh he likes that said ayala all that time we were up at the top of st peters i was quizzing him about his speeches he lets me say just what i please  this was wormwood in the first place there had been a word or two between the lovers about that going up of st peters and augusta had refused to join them she had wished septimus to remain down with herwhich would have been tantamount to preventing any of the party from going up but septimus had persisted on ascending then augusta had been left for a long hour alone with her mother gertrude had no doubt gone up but gertrude had lagged during the ascent ayala had skipped up the interminable stairs and mr traffick had trotted after her with admiring breathless industry this itself with the thoughts of the good time which septimus might be having at the top was very bad but now to be told that she ayala should laugh at him and that he septimus should like it i suppose he takes you to be a child said augusta but if you are a child you ought to conduct yourself  i suppose he does perceive the difference said ayala  she had not in the least known what the words might conveyhad probably meant nothing but to augusta it was apparent that ayala had declared that her lover her septimus had preferred her extreme youth to the more mature charms of his own true loveor had perhaps preferred ayalas raillery to augustas serious demeanour you are the most impertinent person i ever knew in my life said augusta rising from her chair and walking slowly out of the room ayala stared after her not above half comprehending the cause of the anger  then came the very serious affair of the ball the marchesa had asked that her dear little friend ayala dormer might be allowed to come over to a little dance which her own girls were going to have her own girls were so fond of ayala there would be no trouble there was a carriage which would be going somewhere else and she would be fetched and taken home ayala at once declared that she intended to go and her aunt emmeline did not refuse her sanction augusta was shocked declaring that the little dance was to be one of the great balls of the season and pronouncing the whole to be a falsehood but the affair was arranged before she could stop it  but mr trafficks affair in the matter came more within her range septimus she said i would rather you would not go to that womans party septimus had been asked only on the day before the partyas soon indeed as his arrival had become known to the marchesa  why my own one  she has not treated mamma wellnor yet me  ayala is going he had no right to call her ayala so augusta thought  my cousin is behaving badly in the matter and mamma ought not to allow her to go who knows anything about the marchesa baldoni  both he and she are of the very best families in rome said mr traffick who knew everything about it  at any rate they are behaving very badly to us and i will take it as a favour that you do not go asking ayala and then asking you as good as from the same house is too marked you ought not to go  perhaps mr traffick had on some former occasion felt some little interference with his freedom of action perhaps he liked the acquaintance of the marchesa perhaps he liked ayala dormer be that as it might he would not yield dear augusta it is right that i should go there if it be only for halfanhour this he said in a tone of voice with which augusta was already acquainted which she did not love and which when she heard it would make her think of her £120000 when he had spoken he left her and she began to think of her £120000  they both went ayala and mr traffickand mr traffick instead of staying halfanhour brought ayala back at three oclock in the morning though mr traffick was nearly as old as uncle tringle yet he could dance ayala had been astonished to find how well he could dance and thought that she might please her cousin augusta by praising the juvenility of her lover at luncheon the next day she had not appeared at breakfast but had been full of the ball at lunch oh dear yes i dare say there were two hundred people there  that is what she calls a little dance said augusta with scorn  i suppose that is the italian way of talking about it said ayala  italian way i hate italian ways  mr traffick liked it very much im sure hell tell you so i had no idea he would care to dance  augusta only shook herself and turned up her nose lady tringle thought it necessary to say something in defence of her daughters choice why should not mr traffick dance like any other gentleman  oh i dont know i thought that a man who makes so many speeches in parliament would think of something else i was very glad he did for he danced three times with me he can waltz as lightly as as though he were young she was going to say but then she stopped herself  he is the best dancer i ever danced with said augusta  but you almost never do dance said ayala  i suppose i may know about it as well as another said augusta angrily  the next day was the last of mr trafficks sojourn in rome and on that day he and augusta so quarrelled that for a certain number of hours it was almost supposed in the family that the match would be broken off on the afternoon of the day after the dance mr traffick was walking with ayala on the pincian while augusta was absolutely remaining behind with her mother for a quarterofanhourthe whole day as it seemed to augustathere was a full two hundred yards between them it was not that the engaged girl could not bear the severance but that she could not endure the attention paid to ayala on the next morning she had it out as some people say with her lover if i am to be treated in this way you had better tell me so at once she said  i know no better way of treating you said mr traffick  dancing with that chit all night turning her head and then walking with her all the next day i will not put up with such conduct  mr traffick valued £120000 very highly as do most men and would have done much to keep it but he believed that the best way of making sure of it would be by showing himself to be the master my own one he said you are really making an ass of yourself  very well then i will write to papa and let him know that it must be all over  for three hours there was terrible trouble in the apartments in the palazzo ruperti during which mr traffick was enjoying himself by walking up and down the forum and calculating how many romans could have congregated themselves in the space which is supposed to have seen so much of the worlds doings during this time augusta was very frequently in hysterics but whether in hysterics or out of them she would not allow ayala to come near her she gave it to be understood that ayala had interfered fatally foully damnably with all her happiness she demanded from fit to fit that telegrams should be sent over to bring her father to italy for her protection she would rave about septimus and then swear that under no consideration whatever would she ever see him again at the end of three hours she was told that septimus was in the drawingroom lady tringle had sent halfadozen messengers after him and at last he was found looking up at the arch of titus bid him go said augusta i never want to behold him again but within two minutes she was in his arms and before dinner she was able to take a stroll with him on the pincian  he left like a thriving lover high in the good graces of his beloved but the anger which had fallen on ayala had not been removed then came a rumour that the marchesa who was half english had called ayala cinderella and the name had added fuel to the fire of augustas wrath there was much said about it between lady tringle and her daughter the aunt really feeling that more blame was being attributed to ayala than she deserved perhaps she gives herself airs said lady tringle but really it is no more  she is a viper said augusta  gertrude rather took ayalas part telling her mother in private that the accusation about mr traffick was absurd the truth is said gertrude that ayala thinks herself very clever and very beautiful and augusta will not stand it gertrude acknowledged that ayala was upsetting and ungrateful poor lady tringle in her husbands absence did not know what to do about her niece  altogether they were uncomfortable after mr traffick went and before tom tringle had come on no consideration whatsoever would augusta speak to her cousin she declared that ayala was a viper and would give no other reason in all such quarrelings the matter most distressing is that the evil cannot be hidden everybody at rome who knew the tringles or who knew ayala was aware that augusta tringle would not speak to her cousin when ayala was asked she would shake her locks and open her eyes and declare that she knew nothing about it in truth she knew very little about it she remembered that passageatarms about the going upstairs at glenbogie but she could hardly understand that for so small an affront and one so distant augusta would now refuse to speak to her that augusta had always been angry with her and since mr trafficks arrival more angry than ever she had felt but that augusta was jealous in respect to her lover had never yet at all come home to ayala that she should have wanted to captivate mr traffickshe with her high ideas of some transcendental more than human hero  but she had to put up with it and to think of it she had sense enough to know that she was no more than a stranger in her aunts family and that she must go if she made herself unpleasant to them she was aware that hitherto she had not succeeded with her residence among them perhaps she might have to go some things she would bear and in them she would endeavour to amend her conduct in other matters she would hold her own and go if necessary though her young imagination was still full of her unsubstantial herothough she still had her castles in the air altogether incapable of terrestrial foundationstill there was a common sense about her which told her that she must give and take she would endeavour to submit herself to her aunt she would be kindas she had always been kindto gertrude she would in all matters obey her uncle her misfortune with the newfoundland dog had almost dwindled out of her mind to augusta she could not submit herself but then augusta as soon as the next session of parliament should be over would be married out of the way and on her own part she did think that her aunt was inclined to take her part in the quarrel with augusta  thus matters were going on in rome when there came up another and a worse cause for trouble     chapter vii  tom tringle in earnest   tom tringle though he had first appeared to his cousin ayala as a newfoundland dog which might perhaps be pleasantly playful and then as the same dog very unpleasant because dripping with muddy water was nevertheless a young man with so much manly truth about him as to be very much in love he did not look like it but then perhaps the young men who do fall most absolutely into love do not look like it to ayala her cousin tom was as unloveable as mr septimus traffick she could like them both well enough while they would be kind to her but as to regarding cousin tom as a loverthe idea was so preposterous to her that she could not imagine that any one else should look upon it as real but with tom the idea had been real and was moreover permanent the black locks which would be shaken here and there the bright glancing eyes which could be so joyous and could be so indignant the colour of her face which had nothing in it of pink which was brown rather but over which the telltale blood would rush with a quickness which was marvellous to him the lithe quick figure which had in it nothing of the weight of earth the little foot which in itself was a perfect joy the step with all the elasticity of a fawnthese charms together had mastered him tom was not romantic or poetic but the romance and poetry of ayala had been divine to him it is not always like to like in love titania loved the weaver bottom with the asss head bluebeard though a bad husband is supposed to have been fond of his last wife the beauty has always been beloved by the beast to ayala the thing was monstrousbut it was natural tom tringle was determined to have his way and when he started for rome was more intent upon his lovemaking than all the glories of the capitol and the vatican  when he first made his appearance before ayalas eyes he was bedecked in a manner that was awful to her down at glenbogie he had affected a rough attire as is the custom with young men of ample means when fishing shooting or the like is supposed to be the employment then in hand the roughness had been a little overdone but it had added nothing to his own uncouthness in london he was apt to run a little towards ornamental gilding but in london his tastes had been tempered by the illnatured criticism of the world at large he had hardly dared at queens gate to wear his biggest pins but he had taken upon himself to think that at rome an englishman might expose himself with all his jewelry oh tom i never saw anything so stunning his sister gertrude said to him he had simply frowned upon her and had turned himself to ayala as though ayala being an artist would be able to appreciate something beautiful in art ayala had looked at him and had marvelled and had ventured to hope that with his glenbogie dress his glenbogie manners and glenbogie propensities would be changed  at this time the family at rome was very uncomfortable augusta would not speak to her cousin and had declared to her mother and sister her determination never to speak to ayala again for a time aunt emmeline had almost taken her nieces part feeling that she might best bring things back to a condition of peace in this manner ayala she had thought might thus be decoyed into a state of submission ayala so instigated had made her attempt what is the matter augusta she had said that you are determined to quarrel with me then had followed a little offer that bygones should be bygones  i have quarrelled with you said augusta because you do not know how to behave yourself then ayala had flashed forth and the little attempt led to a worse condition than ever and words were spoken which even aunt emmeline had felt to be irrevocable irremediable  only that you are going away i would not consent to live here said ayala then aunt emmeline had asked her where she would go to live should it please her to remove herself ayala had thought of this for a moment and then had burst into tears if i could not live i could die anything would be better than to be treated as she treats me so the matters were when tom came to rome with all his jewelry  lady tringle had already told herself that in choosing ayala she had chosen wrong lucy though not so attractive as ayala was pretty quiet and ladylike so she thought now and as to ayalas attractions they were not at all of a nature to be serviceable to such a family as hers to have her own girls outshone to be made to feel that the poor orphan was the one person most worthy of note among them to be subjected to the caprices of a pretty proud illconditioned minxthus it was that aunt emmeline was taught to regard her own charity and goodnature towards her niece there was she said no gratitude in ayala had she said that there was no humility she would have been more nearly right she was entitled she thought to expect both gratitude and humility and she was sorry that she had opened the paradise of her opulent home to one so little grateful and so little humble as ayala she saw now her want of judgment in that she had not taken lucy  tom who was not a fool in spite of his trinkets saw the state of the case and took ayalas part at once i think you are quite right he said to her on the first occasion on which he had contrived to find himself alone with her after his arrival  right about what  in not giving up to augusta she was always like that when she was a child and now her head is turned about traffick  i shouldnt grudge her her lover if she would only let me alone  i dont suppose she hurts you much  she sets my aunt against me and that makes me unhappy of course i am wretched  oh ayala dont be wretched  how is one to help it i never said an illnatured word to her and now i am so lonely among them in saying thisin seeking to get one word of sympathy from her cousin she forgot for a moment his disagreeable pretensions but no sooner had she spoken of her loneliness than she saw that ogle in his eye of which she had spoken with so much ludicrous awe in her letters from glenbogie to her sister  i shall always take your part said he  i dont want any taking of parts  but i shall i am not going to see you put upon you are more to me ayala than any of them then he looked at her whereupon she got up and ran away  but she could not always run away nor could she always refuse when he asked her to go with him about the showplaces of the city to avoid starting alone with him was within her power but she found herself compelled to join herself to gertrude and her brother in some of those little excursions which were taken for her benefit at this time there had come to be a direct quarrel between lady tringle and the marchesa which however had arisen altogether on the part of augusta augusta had forced her mother to declare that she was insulted and then there was no more visiting between them this had been sad enough for ayala who had struck up an intimacy with the marchesas daughters but the marchesa had explained to her that there was no help for it it wont do for you to separate yourself from your aunt she had said of course we shall be friends and at some future time you shall come and see us so there had been a division and ayala would have been quite alone had she declined the proffered companionship of gertrude  within the walls and arches and upraised terraces of the coliseum they were joined one day by young hamel the sculptor who had not as yet gone back to londonand had not as yet met lucy in the gardens at kensington and with him there had been one frank houston who had made acquaintance with lady tringle and with the tringles generally since they had been at rome frank houston was a young man of family with a taste for art very goodlooking but not specially well off in regard to income he had heard of the good fortune of septimus traffick in having prepared for himself a connection with so wealthy a family as the tringles and had thought it possible that a settlement in life might be comfortable for himself what few soft words he had hitherto been able to say to gertrude had been taken in good part and when therefore they met among the walls of the coliseum she had naturally straggled away to see some special wonder which he had a special aptitude for showing hamel remained with ayala and tom talking of the old days at the bijou till he found himself obliged to leave them then tom had his opportunity  ayala he said all this must be altered  what must be altered  if you only knew ayala how much you are to me  i wish you wouldnt tom i dont want to be anything to anybody in particular  what i mean is that i wont have them sit upon you they treat you asaswell as though you had only half a right to be one of them  no more i have i have no right at all  but thats not the way i want it to be if you were my wife  tom pray dont  why not im in earnest why aint i to speak as i think oh ayala if you knew how much i think of you  but you shouldnt you havent got a right  i have got a right  but i dont want it tom and i wont have it he had carried her away now to the end of the terrace or ruined tier of seats on which they were walking and had got her so hemmed into a corner that she could not get away from him she was afraid of him lest he should put out his hand to take hold of herlest something even more might be attempted and yet his manner was manly and sincere and had it not been for his pins and his chains she could not but have acknowledged his goodness to her much as she might have disliked his person i want to get out she said i wont stay here any more mr traffick on the top of st peters had been a much pleasanter companion  dont you believe me when i tell you that i love you better than anybody pleaded tom  no  not believe me oh ayala  i dont want to believe anything i want to get out if you go on ill tell my aunt  tell her aunt there was a want of personal consideration to himself in this way of receiving his addresses which almost angered him tom tringle was not in the least afraid of his motherwas not even afraid of his father as long as he was fairly regular at the office in lombard street he was quite determined to please himself in marriage and was disposed to think that his father and mother would like him to be settled money was no object there was to his thinking no good reason why he should not marry his cousin for her the match was so excellent that he hardly expected she would reject him when she could be made to understand that he was really in earnest you may tell all the world he said proudly all i want is that you should love me  but i dont there are gertrude and mr houston and i want to go to them  say one nice word to me ayala  i dont know how to say a nice word cant you be made to understand that i dont like it  ayala  why dont you let me go away  ayalagive meonekiss then ayala did go away escaping by some kidlike manoeuvre among the ruins and running quickly while he followed her joined herself to the other pair of lovers who probably were less in want of her society than she of theirs ayala i am quite in earnest said tom as they were walking home and i mean to go on with it  ayala thought that there was nothing for it but to tell her aunt that there would be some absurdity in such a proceeding she did feelthat she would be acting as though her cousin were a naughty boy who was merely teasing her but she felt also the peculiar danger of her own position her aunt must be made to understand that she ayala was innocent in the matter it would be terrible to her to be suspected even for a moment of a desire to inveigle the heir that augusta would bring such an accusation against her she thought probable augusta had said as much even at glenbogie she must therefore be on the alert and let it be understood at once that she was not leagued with her cousin tom there would be an absurditybut that would be better than suspicion  she thought about it all that afternoon and in the evening she came to a resolution she would write a letter to her cousin and persuade him if possible to desist if he should again annoy her after that she would appeal to her aunt then she wrote and sent her letter which was as follows      dear tom     you dont know how unhappy you made me at the coliseum    today i dont think you ought to turn against me when    you know what i have to bear it is turning against me    to talk as you did of course it means nothing but you    shouldnt do it it never never could mean anything i    hope you will be goodnatured and kind to me and then i    shall be so much obliged to you if you wont say anything    more like that i will forget it altogether     your affectionate cousin     ayala   the letter ought to have convinced him those two underscored nevers should have eradicated from his mind the feeling which had been previously produced by the assertion that he had meant nothing but he was so assured in his own meanings that he paid no attention whatever to the nevers the letter was a delight to him because it gave him the opportunity of a rejoinderand he wrote his rejoinder on a scented sheet of notepaper and copied it twice      dearest ayala     why do you say that it means nothing it means everything    no man was ever more in earnest in speaking to a lady than    i am with you why should i not be in earnest when i am so    deeply in love from the first moment in which i saw you    down at glenbogie i knew how it was going to be with me     as for my mother i dont think she would say a word why    should she but i am not the sort of man to be talked out    of my intentions in such a matter as this i have set my    heart upon having you and nothing will ever turn me off     dearest ayala let me have one look to say that you will    love me and i shall be the happiest man in england i    think you so beautiful i do indeed the governor has    always said that if i would settle down and marry there    should be lots of money what could i do better with it    than make my darling look as grand as the best of them     yours always meaning it    most affectionately     t tringle   it almost touched hernot in the way of love but of gratitude he was still to her like bottom with the asss head or the newfoundland dog gambolling out of the water there was the heavy face and there were the big chains and the odious rings and the great hands and the clumsy feetmaking together a creature whom it was impossible even to think of with love she shuddered as she remembered the proposition which had been made to her in the coliseum  and now by writing to him she had brought down upon herself this absolute loveletter she had thought that by appealing to him as dear tom and by signing herself his affectionate cousin she might have prevailed if he could only be made to understand that it could never mean anything but now on the other hand she had begun to understand that it did mean a great deal he had sent to her a regular offer of marriage the magnitude of the thing struck her at last the heir of all the wealth of her mighty uncle wanted to make her his wife  but it was to her exactly as though the heir had come to her wearing an asss head on his shoulders love him marry himor even touch him oh no they might illuse her they might scold her they might turn her out of the house but no consideration would induce her to think of tom tringle as a lover  and yet he was in earnest and honest and good and some answersome further communication must be made to him she did recognise some nobility in him though personally he was so distasteful to her now his appeal to her had taken the guise of an absolute offer of marriage he was entitled to a discreet and civil answer romantic dreamy poetic childish as she was she knew as much as that go away tom you fool you would no longer do for the occasion as she thought of it all that night it was borne in upon her more strongly than ever that her only protection would be in telling her aunt and in getting her aunt to make tom understand that there must be no more of it early on the following morning she found herself in her aunts bedroom     chapter viii  the lout   aunt emmeline i want you to read this letter so it was that ayala commenced the interview at this moment ayala was not on much better terms with her aunt than she was with her cousin augusta ayala was a trouble to herlady tringlewho was altogether perplexed with the feeling that she had burdened herself with an inmate in her house who was distasteful to her and of whom she could not rid herself ayala had turned out on her hands something altogether different from the girl she had intended to cherish and patronise ayala was independent superior rather than inferior to her own girls more thought of by others apparently without any touch of that subservience which should have been produced in her by her position ayala seemed to demand as much as though she were a daughter of the house and at the same time to carry herself as though she were more gifted than the daughters of the house she was less obedient even than a daughter all this aunt emmeline could not endure with a placid bosom she was herself kind of heart she acknowledged her duty to her dead sister she wished to protect and foster the orphan she did not even yet wish to punish ayala by utter desertion she would protect her in opposition to augustas more declared malignity but she did wish to be rid of ayala if she only knew how  she took her sons letter and read it and as a matter of course misunderstood the position at glenbogie something had been whispered to her about tom and ayala but she had not believed much in it ayala was a child and tom was to her not much more than a boy but now here was a genuine lovelettera letter in which her son had made a distinct proposition to marry the orphan she did not stop to consider why ayala had brought the letter to her but entertained at once an idea that the two young people were going to vex her very soul by a lamentable love affair how imprudent she had been to let the two young people be together in rome seeing that the matter had been whispered to her at glenbogie how long has this been going on she asked severely  he used to tease me at glenbogie and now he is doing it again said ayala  there must certainly be put an end to it you must go away  ayala knew at once that her aunt was angry with her and was indignant at the injustice of course there must be put an end to it aunt emmeline he has no right to annoy me when i tell him not  i suppose you have encouraged him  this was too cruel to be borne encouraged him ayalas anger was caused not so much by a feeling that her aunt had misappreciated the cause of her coming as that it should have been thought possible that she should have encouraged such a lover it was the outrage to her taste rather than to her conduct which afflicted her he is a lout she said a stupid lout thus casting her scorn upon the mother as well as on the son and indeed upon the whole family i have not encouraged him it is untrue  ayala you are very impertinent  and you are very unjust because i want to put a stop to it i come to you and you tell me that i encourage him you are worse than augusta  this was too much for the good nature even of aunt emmeline whatever may have been the truth as to the love affair however innocent ayala may have been in that matter or however guilty tom such words from a niece to her auntfrom a dependent to her superiorwere unpardonable the extreme youthfulness of the girl a peculiar look of childhood which she still had with her made the feeling so much the stronger you are worse than augusta  and this was said to her who was specially conscious of her endeavours to mitigate augustas just anger she bridled up and tried to look big and knit her brows at that moment she could not think what must be the end of it but she felt that ayala must be crushed how dare you speak to me like that miss she said  so you are it is very cruel tom will go on saying all this nonsense to me and when i come to you you say i encourage him i never encouraged him i despise him too much i did not think my own aunt could have told me that i encouraged any man no i didnt you drive me to it so that i have got to be impertinent  you had better go to your room said the aunt then ayala lifting her head as high as she knew how walked towards the door you had better leave that letter with me ayala considered the matter for a moment and then handed the letter a second time to her aunt it could be nothing to her who saw the letter she did not want it having thus given it up she stalked off in silent disdain and went to her chamber  aunt emmeline when she was left alone felt herself to be enveloped in a cloud of doubt the desirableness of tom as a husband first forced itself upon her attention and the undesirableness of ayala as a wife for tom she was perplexed at her own folly in not having seen that danger of this kind would arise when she first proposed to take ayala into the house aunts and uncles do not like the marriage of cousins and the parents of rich children do not as a rule approve of marriages with those which are poor although ayala had been so violent lady tringle could not rid herself of the idea that her darling boy was going to throw himself away then her cheeks became red with anger as she remembered that her tom had been called a louta stupid lout there was an ingratitude in the use of such language which was not alleviated even by the remembrance that it tended against that matrimonial danger of which she was so much afraid ayala was behaving very badly she ought not to have coaxed tom to be her lover and she certainly ought not to have called tom a lout and then ayala had told her aunt that she was unjust and worse than augusta it was out of the question that such a state of things should be endured ayala must be made to go away  before the day was over lady tringle spoke to her son and was astonished to find that the lout was quite in earnestso much in earnest that he declared his purpose of marrying his cousin in opposition to his father and mother in opposition even to ayala herself he was so much in earnest that he would not be roused to wrath even when he was told that ayala had called him a lout and then grew upon the mother a feeling that the young man had never been so little loutish before for there had been even in her maternal bosom a feeling that tom was open to the criticism expressed on him tom had been a hobbledehoy one of those overgrown lads who come late to their manhood and who are regarded by young ladies as louts though he had spent his money only too freely when away his sisters had sometimes said that he could not say bo to a goose at home but nownow tom was quite an altered young man when his own letter was shown to him he simply said that he meant to stick to it when it was represented to him that his cousin would be quite an unfit wife for him he assured his mother that his own opinion on that matter was very different when his fathers anger was threatened he declared that his father would have no right to be angry with him if he married a lady at the word lout he simply smiled shell come to think different from that before shes done with me he said with a smile even the mother could not but perceive that the young man had been much improved by his love  but what was she to do two or three days went on during which there was no reconciliation between her and ayala between augusta and ayala no word was spoken messages were taken to her by gertrude the object of which was to induce her to ask her aunts pardon but ayala was of opinion that her aunt ought to ask her pardon and could not be beaten from it why did she say that i encouraged him she demanded indignantly of gertrude i dont think she did encourage him said gertrude to her mother this might possibly be true but not the less had she misbehaved and though she might not yet have encouraged her lover it was only too probable that she might do so when she found that her lover was quite in earnest  lady tringle was much harassed and then there came an additional trouble gertrude informed her mother that she had engaged herself to mr francis houston and that mr houston was going to write to her father with the object of proposing himself as a soninlaw mr houston came also to herself and told her in the most natural tone in the world that he intended to marry her daughter she had not known what to say it was sir thomas who managed all matters of money she had an idea that mr houston was very poor but then so also had been mr traffick who had been received into the family with open arms but then mr traffick had a career whereas mr houston was lamentably idle she could only refer mr houston to sir thomas and beg him not to come among them any more till sir thomas had decided upon this gertrude also got angry and shut herself up in her room the apartments ruperti were therefore upon the whole an uncomfortable home to them  letters upon letters were written to sir thomas and letters upon letters came the first letter had been about ayala he had been much more tender towards ayala than her aunt had been he talked of calflove and said that tom was a fool but he had not at once thought it necessary to give imperative orders for toms return as to ayalas impudence he evidently regarded it as nothing it was not till aunt emmeline had spoken out in her third letter that he seemed to recognise the possibility of getting rid of ayala altogether and this he did in answer to a suggestion which had been made to him if she likes to change with her sister lucy and you like it i shall not object said sir thomas then there came an order to tom that he should return to lombard street at once but this order had been rendered abortive by the sudden return of the whole family sir thomas in his first letter as to gertrude had declared that the houston marriage would not do at all then when he was told that gertrude and mr houston had certainly met each other more than once since an order had been given for their separation he desired the whole family to come back at once to merle park  the proposition as to lucy had arisen in this wise tom being in the same house with ayala of course had her very much at advantage and would carry on his suit in spite of any abuse which she might lavish upon him it was quite in vain that she called him lout youll think very different from that some of these days ayala he said more seriously  no i shant i shall think always the same  when you know how much i love you youll change  i dont want you to love me she said and if you were anything that is good you wouldnt go on after i have told you so often it is not manly of you you have brought me to all manner of trouble it is your fault but they make me suffer  after that ayala again went to her aunt and on this occasion the family misfortune was discussed in more seemly language ayala was still indignant but she said nothing insolent aunt emmeline was still averse to her niece but she abstained from crimination they knew each as enemies but recognised the wisdom of keeping the peace as for that aunt emmeline ayala said you may be quite sure that i shall never encourage him i shall never like him well enough  very well then we need say no more about that my dear of course it must be unpleasant to us all being in the same house together  it is very unpleasant to me when he will go on bothering me like that it makes me wish that i were anywhere else  then aunt emmeline began to think about it very seriously it was very unpleasant ayala had made herself disagreeable to all the ladies of the family and only too agreeable to the young gentleman nor did the manifest favour of sir thomas do much towards raising ayala in lady tringles estimation sir thomas had only laughed when augusta had been requested to go upstairs for the scrapbook sir thomas had been profuse with his presents even when ayala had been most persistent in her misbehaviour and then all that affair of the marchesa and even mr trafficks infatuation if ayala wished that she were somewhere else would it not be well to indulge her wish aunt emmeline certainly wished it if you think so perhaps some arrangement can be made said aunt emmeline very slowly  what arrangement  you must not suppose that i wish to turn you out  but what arrangement  you see ayala that unfortunately we have not all of us hit it off nicely have we  not at all aunt emmeline augusta is always angry with me and youyou think that i have encouraged tom  i am saying nothing about that ayala  but what arrangement is it aunt emmeline the matter was one of fearful import to ayala she was prudent enough to understand that well the arrangement must be one by which she would be banished from all the wealth of the tringles her coming among them had not been a success she had already made them tired of her by her petulance and independence young as she was she could see that and comprehend the material injury she had done herself by her folly she had been very wrong in telling augusta to go upstairs she had been wrong in the triumph of her exclusive visits to the marchesa she had been wrong in walking away with mr traffick on the pincian she could see that she had not been wrong in regard to tomexcept in calling him a lout but whether wrong or right she had been most unfortunate but the thing had been done and she must go  at this moment the wealth of the tringles seemed to be more to her than it had ever been beforeand her own poverty and destitution seemed to be more absolute when the word arrangement was whispered to her there came upon her a clear idea of all that which she was to lose she was to be banished from merle park from queens gate and from glenbogie for her there were to be no more carriages and horses and pretty trinketsnone of that abandon of the luxury of money among which the tringles lived but she had done it for herself and she would not say a word in opposition to the fate which was before her what arrangement aunt she said again in a voice which was intended to welcome any arrangement that might be made  then her aunt spoke very softly of course dear ayala we do not wish to do less than we at first intended but as you are not happy here then she paused almost ashamed of herself  i am not happy here said ayala boldly  how would it be if you were to changewith lucy  the idea which had been present to lady tringle for some weeks past had never struck ayala the moment she heard it she felt that she was more than ever bound to assent if the home from which she was to be banished was good then would that good fall upon lucy lucy would have the carriages and the horses and the trinkets lucy who certainly was not happy at kingsbury crescent i should be very glad indeed said ayala  her voice was so brave and decided that in itself it gave fresh offence to her aunt was there to be no regret after so much generosity but she misunderstood the girl altogether as the words were coming from her lipsi should be very glad indeedayalas heart was sinking with tenderness as she remembered how much after all had been done for her but as they wished her to go there should be not a word not a sign of unwillingness on her part  then perhaps it can be arranged said lady tringle  i dont know what uncle dosett may say perhaps they are very fond of lucy now  they wouldnt wish to stand in her way i should think  at any rate i wont if you and my uncles and aunt margaret will consent i will go whenever you choose of course i must do just as im told  aunt emmeline made a faint demur to this but still the matter was held to be arranged letters were written to sir thomas and letters came and at last even sir thomas had assented he suggested in the first place that all the facts which would follow the exchange should be explained to ayala but he was obliged after a while to acknowledge that this would be inexpedient the girl was willing and knew no doubt that she was to give up the great wealth of her present home but she had proved herself to be an unfit participator and it was better that she should go  then the departure of them all from rome was hurried on by the indiscretion of gertrude gertrude declared that she had a right to her lover as to his having no income what matter for that everyone knew that septimus traffick had no income papa had income enough for them all mr houston was a gentleman till this moment no one had known of how strong a will of her own gertrude was possessed when gertrude declared that she would not consent to be separated from mr houston then they were all hurried home     chapter ix  the exchange   such was the state of things when mr dosett brought the three letters home with him to kingsbury crescent having been so much disturbed by the contents of the two which were addressed to himself as to have found himself compelled to leave his office two hours before the proper time the three letters were handed together by her uncle to lucy and she seeing the importance of the occasion read the two open ones before she broke the envelope of her own that from sir thomas came first and was as follows      lombard street january 187     my dear dosett     i have had a correspondence with the ladies at rome which    has been painful in its nature but which i had better    perhaps communicate to you at once ayala has not got on    as well with lady tringle and the girls as might have been    wished and they all think it will be better that she and    lucy should change places i chiefly write to give my    assent your sister will no doubt write to you i may as    well mention to you should you consent to take charge of    ayala that i have made some provision for her in my will    and that i shall not change it i have to add on my own    account that i have no complaint of my own to make against    ayala     yours sincerely     t tringle   lucy when she had read this proceeded at once to the letter from her aunt the matter to her was one of terrible importance but the importance was quite as great to ayala she had been allowed to go up alone into her own room the letters were of such a nature that she could hardly have read them calmly in the presence of her aunt dosett it was thus that her aunt emmeline had written      palazzo ruperti rome thursday     my dear reginald     i am sure you will be sorry to hear that we are in great    trouble here this has become so bad that we are obliged    to apply to you to help us now you must understand that    i do not mean to say a word against dear ayalaonly she    does not suit it will occur sometimes that people who    are most attached to each other do not suit so it has    been with dear ayala she is not happy with us she has    not perhaps accommodated herself to her cousins quite as    carefully as she might have done she is fully as sensible    of this as i am and is herself persuaded that there had    better be a change     now my dear reginald i am quite aware that when poor    egbert died it was i who chose ayala and that you took    lucy partly in compliance with my wishes now i write to    suggest that there should be a change i am sure you will    give me credit for a desire to do the best i can for both    the poor dear girls i did think that this might be best    done by letting ayala come to us i now think that lucy    would do better with her cousins and that ayala would be    more attractive without the young people around her     when i see you i will tell you everything there has been    no great fault she has spoken a word or two to me which    had been better unsaid but i am well convinced that it    has come from hot temper and not from a bad heart perhaps    i had better tell you the truth tom has admired her she    has behaved very well but she could not bear to be spoken    to and so there have been unpleasantnesses and the girls    certainly have not got on well together sir thomas quite    agrees with me that if you will consent there had better    be a change     i will not write to dear lucy herself because you and    margaret can explain it all so much betterif you will    consent to our plan ayala also will write to her sister    but pray tell her from me that i will love her very dearly    if she will come to me and indeed i have loved ayala    almost as though she were my own only we have not been    quite able to hit it off together     of course neither has sir thomas or have i any idea of    escaping from a responsibility i should be quite unhappy    if i did not have one of poor dear egberts girls with me    only i do think that lucy would be the best for us and    ayala thinks so too i should be quite unhappy if i were    doing this in opposition to ayala     we shall be in england almost as soon as this letter and    i should be so glad if this could be decided at once if    a thing like this is to be done it is so much better for    all parties that it should be done quickly pray give my    best love to margaret and tell her that ayala shall bring    everything with her that she wants     your most affectionate sister     emmeline tringle   the letter though it was much longer than her uncles going into details such as that of toms unfortunate passion for his cousin had less effect upon lucy as it did not speak with so much authority as that from sir thomas what sir thomas said would surely be done whereas aunt emmeline was only a woman and her letter unsupported might not have carried conviction but if sir thomas wished it surely it must be done then at last came ayalas letter      rome thursday     dearest dearest lucy     oh i have such things to write to you aunt emmeline has    told it all to uncle reginald you are to come and be the    princess and i am to go and be the milkmaid at home i am    quite content that it should be so because i know that it    will be the best you ought to be a princess and i ought    to be a milkmaid     it has been coming almost ever since the first day that i    came among themsince i told augusta to go upstairs for    the scrapbook i felt from the very moment in which the    words were uttered that i had gone and done for myself    but i am not a bit sorry as you will come in my place    augusta will very soon be gone now and aunt emmeline    is not bad at all if you will only not contradict her    i always contradicted her and i know that i have been a    fool but i am not a bit sorry as you are to come instead    of me     but it is not only about augusta and aunt emmeline there    has been that oaf tom poor tom i do believe that he is    the most goodnatured fellow alive and if he had not so    many chains i should not dislike him so very much but he    will go on saying horrible things to me and then he wrote    me a letter oh dear i took the letter to aunt emmeline    and that made the quarrel she said that i hadencouraged    him oh lucy if you will think of that i was so angry    that i said ever so much to hertill she sent me out of    the room she had no business to say that i encouraged    him it was shameful but she has never forgiven me    because i scolded her so they have decided among them    that i am to be sent away and that you are to come in my    place     my own darling lucy it will be ever so much better i    know that you are not happy in kingsbury crescent and    that i shall bear it very much better i can sit still and    mend sheets   poor ayala how little she knew herself      and you will make a beautiful grand lady quiescent and    dignified as a grand lady ought to be at any rate it    would be impossible that i should remain here tom is bad    enough but to be told that i encourage him is more than i    can bear     i shall see you very soon but i cannot help writing and    telling it to you all give my love to aunt dosett if she    will consent to receive me i will endeavour to be good to    her in the meantime goodbye     your most affectionate sister     ayala   when lucy had completed the reading of the letters she sat for a considerable time wrapped in thought there was in truth very much that required thinking it was proposed that the whole tenour of her life should be changed and changed in a direction which would certainly suit her taste she had acknowledged to herself that she had hated the comparative poverty of her uncle dosetts life hating herself in that she was compelled to make such acknowledgment but there had been more than the poverty which had been distasteful to hera something which she had been able to tell herself that she might be justified in hating without shame there had been to her an absence of intellectual charm in the habits and manners of kingsbury crescent which she had regarded as unfortunate and depressing there had been no thought of art delights no one read poetry no one heard music no one looked at pictures a sheet to be darned was the one thing of greatest importance the due development of a leg of mutton the stretching of a pound of butter the best way of repressing the washerwomans billsthese had been the matters of interest and they had not been made the less irritating to her by her aunts extreme goodness in the matter the leg of mutton was to be developed in the absence of her uncleif possible without his knowledge he was to have his run of clean linen lucy did not grudge him anything but was sickened by that partnership in economy which was established between her and her aunt undoubtedly from time to time she had thought of the luxuries which had been thrown in ayalas way there had been a regretnot that ayala should have them but that she should have missed them money she declared that she despisedbut the easy luxury of the bijou was sweet to her memory  now it was suggested to her suddenly that she was to exchange the poverty for the luxury and to return to a mode of life in which her mind might be devoted to things of beauty the very scenery of glenbogiewhat a charm it would have for her judging from her uncles manner as well as she could during that moment in which he handed to her the letter she imagined that he intended to make no great objection her aunt disliked her she was sure that her aunt disliked her in spite of the partnership only that there was one other view of the casehow happy might the transfer be her uncle was always gentle to her but there could hardly as yet have grown up any strong affection for her to him she was grateful but she could not tell herself that to part from him would be a pang there was however another view of the case  ayala how would it be with ayala would ayala like the partnership and the economies would ayala be cheerful as she sat opposite to her aunt for four hours at a time ayala had said that she could sit still and mend sheets but was it not manifest enough that ayala knew nothing of the life of which she was speaking and would she lucy be able to enjoy the glories of glenbogie while she thought that ayala was eating out her heart in the sad companionship of kingsbury crescent for above an hour she sat and thought but of one aspect which the affair bore she did not think she did not reflect that she and ayala were in the hands of fate and that they must both do as their elders should require of them  at last there came a knock at the door and her aunt entered she would sooner that it should have been her uncle but there was no choice but that the matter should be now discussed with the woman whom she did not lovethis matter that was so dreadful to herself in all its bearings and so dreadful to one for whom she would willingly sacrifice herself if it were possible she did not know what she could say to create sympathy with aunt dosett lucy said aunt dosett this is a very serious proposal  very serious said lucy sternly  i have not read the letters but your uncle has told me about it then lucy handed her the two letters keeping that from ayala to herself and she sat perfectly still while her aunt read them both slowly your aunt emmeline is certainly in earnest said mrs dosett  aunt emmeline is very goodnatured and perhaps she will change her mind if we tell her that we wish it  but sir thomas has agreed to it  i am sure my uncle will give way if aunt emmeline will ask him he says he has no complaint to make against ayala i think it is augusta and augusta will be married and will go away very soon  then there came a change a visible change over the countenance of aunt dosett and a softening of the voiceso that she looked and spoke as lucy had not seen or heard her before there are people apparently so hard so ungenial so unsympathetic that they who only half know them expect no trait of tenderness think that features so little alluring cannot be compatible with softness lucy had acknowledged her aunt dosett to be good but believed her to be incapable of being touched but a word or two had now conquered her the girl did not want to leave herdid not seize the first opportunity of running from her poverty to the splendour of the tringles but lucy she said and came and placed herself nearer to lucy on the bed  ayala said lucy sobbing  i will be kind to herperhaps kinder than i have been to you  you have been kind and i have been ungrateful i know it but i will do better now aunt dosett i will stay if you will have me  they are rich and powerful and you will have to do as they direct  no who are they that i should be made to come and go at their bidding they cannot make me leave you  but they can rid themselves of ayala you see what your uncle says about money for ayala  i hate money  money is a thing which none of us can afford to hate do you think it will not be much to your uncle reginald to know that you are both provided for already he is wretched because there will be nothing to come to you if you go to your aunt emmeline sir thomas will do for you as he has done for ayala dear lucy it is not that i want to send you away then for the first time lucy put her arm round her aunts neck but it had better be as is proposed if your aunt still wishes it when she comes home i and your uncle reginald would not do right were we to allow you to throw away the prospects that are offered you it is natural that lady tringle should be anxious about her son  she need not in the least said lucy indignantly  but you see what they say  it is his fault not hers why should she be punished  because he is fortunes favourite and she is not it is no good kicking against the pricks my dear he is his fathers son and heir and everything must give way to him  but ayala does not want him ayala despises him it is too hard that she is to lose everything because a young man like that will go on making himself disagreeable they have no right to do it after having accustomed ayala to such a home dont you feel that aunt dosett  i do feel it  however it might have been arranged at first it ought to remain now even though ayala and i are only girls we ought not to be changed about as though we were horses if she had done anything wrongbut uncle tom says that she has done nothing wrong  i suppose she has spoken to her aunt disrespectfully  because her aunt told her that she had encouraged this man what would you have a girl say when she is falsely accused like that would you say it to me merely because some horrid man would come and speak to me then there came a slight pang of conscience as she remembered isadore hamel in kensington gardens if the men were not thought to be horrid then perhaps the speaking might be a sin worthy of most severe accusation  there was nothing more said about it that night nor till the following afternoon when mr dosett returned home at the usual hour from his office then lucy was closeted with him for a quarterofanhour in the drawingroom he had been into the city and seen sir thomas sir thomas had been of opinion that it would be much better that lady tringles wishes should be obeyed it was quite true that he himself had no complaint to make against ayala but he did think that ayala had been pert and though it might be true that ayala had not encouraged tom there was no knowing what might grow out of such a propensity on toms part and then it could not be pleasant to lady tringle or to himself that their son should be banished out of their house when something was hinted as to the injustice of this sir thomas endeavoured to put all that right by declaring that if lady tringles wishes could be attended to in this matter provision would be made for the two girls he certainly would not strike ayalas name out of his will and as certainly would not take lucy under his wing as his own child without making some provision for her looking at the matter in this light he did not think that mr dosett would be justified in robbing lucy of the advantages which were offered to her with this view mr dosett found himself compelled to agree and with these arguments he declared to lucy that it was her duty to submit herself to the proposed exchange  early in february all the tringle family were in queens gate and lucy on her first visit to the house found that everyone including ayala looked upon the thing as settled ayala who under these circumstances was living on affectionate terms with all the tringles except tom was quite radiant i suppose i had better go tomorrow aunt she said as though it were a matter of most trivial consequence  in a day or two ayala it will be better  it shall be monday then you must come over here in a cab lucy  the carriage shall be sent my dear  but then it must go back with me aunt emmeline  it shall my dear  and the horses must be put up because lucy and i must change all our things in the drawers lucy at the time was sitting in the drawingroom and augusta with most affectionate confidence was singing to her all the praises of mr traffick in this way it was settled and the change so greatly affecting the fortunes of our two sisters was arranged     chapter x  ayala and her aunt margaret   till the last moment for going ayala seemed to be childish triumphant and indifferent but till that last moment she was never alone with lucy it was the presence of her aunt and cousins which sustained her in her hardihood tom was never thereor so rarely as not to affect her greatly in london he had his own lodgings and was not encouraged to appear frequently till ayala should have gone but aunt emmeline and gertrude were perseveringly gracious and even augusta had somewhat relaxed from her wrath with them ayala was always goodhumoured but always brave she affected to rejoice at the change which was to be made she spoke of lucys coming and of her own going as an unmixed blessing this she did so effectually as to make aunt emmeline declare to sir thomas with tears in her eyes that the girl was heartless but when at the moment of parting the two girls were together then ayala broke down  they were in the room together which one had occupied and the other was to occupy and their boxes were still upon the floor though less than six months had passed since ayala had come among the rich things and lucy had been among the poor ayalas belongings had become much more important than her sisters though the tringles had been unpleasant they had been generous lucy was sitting upon the bed while ayala was now moving about the room restlessly now clinging to her sister and now sobbing almost in despair of course i know she said what is the use of telling stories about it any longer  it is not too late yet ayala if we both go to uncle tom he will let us change it  why should it be changed if i could change it by lifting up my little finger i could not do it why should it not be you as well as me they have tried me andas aunt emmeline saysi have not suited  aunt dosett is not illnatured my darling  no i dare say not it is i that am bad it is bad to like pretty things and money and to hate poor things or rather i do not believe it is bad at all because it is so natural i believe it is all a lie as to its being wicked to love riches i love them whether it is wicked or not  oh ayala  do not you dont let us be hypocritical lucy now at the last moment did you like the way in which they lived in kingsbury crescent  lucy paused before she answered i like it better than i did she said at any rate i would willingly go back to kingsbury crescent  yesfor my sake  indeed i would my pet  and for your sake i would rather die than stay but what is the good of talking about it lucy you and i have no voice in it though it is all about ourselves as you say we are like two tame birds who have to be moved from one cage into another just as the owner pleases we belong either to uncle tom or uncle dosett just as they like to settle it oh lucy i do so wish that i were dead  ayala that is wicked  how can i help it if i am wicked what am i to do when i get there what am i to say to them how am i to live lucy we shall never see each other  i will come across to you constantly  i meant to do so but i didnt they are two worlds miles asunder lucy will they let isadore hamel come here lucy blushed and hesitated i am sure he will come  lucy remembered that she had given her friend her address at queens gate and felt that she would seem to have done it as though she had known that she was about to be transferred to the other uncles house it will make no difference if he does she said  oh i have such a dreamsuch a castleintheair if i could think it might ever be so then i should not want to die  what do you dream but lucy though she asked the question knew the dream  if you had a little house of your own oh ever so tiny and if you and he  there is no he  there might be and if you and he would let me have any corner for myself then i should be happy then i would not want to die you would wouldnt you  how can i talk about it ayala there isnt such a thing but yetbut yet oh ayala do you not know that to have you with me would be better than anything  nonot better than anythingsecond best he would be best i do so hope that he may be he come in there was a knock at the door and aunt emmeline herself entered the room  now my dears the horses are standing there and the men are coming up for the luggage ayala i hope we shall see you very often and remember that as regards anything that is unpleasant bygones shall be bygones then there was a crowd of farewell kisses and in a few minutes ayala was alone in the carriage on her road up to kingsbury crescent  the thing had been done so quickly that hitherto there had hardly been time for tears to ayala herself the most remarkable matter in the whole affair had been toms persistence he had at last been allowed to bring them home from rome there having been no other gentleman whose services were available for the occasion he had been watched on the journey very closely and had had no slant in his favour as the young lady to whom he was devoted was quite as anxious to keep out of his way as had been the others of the party to separate them but he had made occasion more than once sufficient to express his intention i dont mean to give you up you know he had said to her when i say a thing i mean it i am not going to be put off by my mother and as for the governor he would not say a word against it if he thought we were both in earnest  but i aint in earnest said ayala or rather i am very much in earnest  so am i thats all ive got to say just at present from this there grew up within her mind a certain respect for the lout which however made him more disagreeable to her than he might have been had he been less persistent  it was late in the afternoon not much before dinner when ayala reached the house in kingsbury crescent hitherto she had known almost nothing of her aunt dosett and had never been intimate even with her uncle they of course had heard much of her and had been led to suppose that she was much less tractable than the simple lucy this feeling had been so strong that mr dosett himself would hardly have been led to sanction the change had it not been for that promise from sir thomas that he would not withdraw the provision he had made for ayala and would do as much for lucy if lucy should become an inmate of his family mrs dosett had certainly been glad to welcome any change when a change was proposed to her there had grown up something of affection at the last moment but up to that time she had certainly disliked her niece lucy had appeared to her to be at first idle and then sullen the girl had seemed to affect a higher nature than her own and had been wilfully indifferent to the little things which had given to her life whatever interest it possessed lucys silence had been a reproach to her though she herself had been able to do so little to abolish the silence perhaps ayala might be better  but they were both afraid of ayalaas they had not been afraid of lucy before her arrival they made more of preparation for her in their own minds and as to their own conduct mr dosett was there himself to receive her and was conscious in doing so that there had been something of failure in their intercourse with lucy lucy had been allowed to come in without preparation with an expectation that she would fall easily into her place and there had been failure there had been no regular consultation as to this new coming but both mr and mrs dosett were conscious of an intended effort  lady tringle and mr dosett had always been aunt emmeline and uncle reginald by reason of the nearness of their relationship circumstances of closer intercourse had caused sir thomas to be uncle tom but mrs dosett had never become more than aunt dosett to either of the girls this in itself had been matter almost of soreness to her and she had intended to ask lucy to adopt the more endearing form of her christian name but there had been so little endearment between them that the moment for doing so had never come she was thinking of all this up in her own room preparatory to the reception of this other girl while mr dosett was bidding her welcome to kingsbury crescent in the drawingroom below  ayala had been dissolved in tears during the drive round by kensington to bayswater and was hardly able to repress her sobs as she entered the house my dear said the uncle we will do all that we can to make you happy here  i am sure you will butbutit is so sad coming away from lucy  lucy i am sure will be happy with her cousins if lucys happiness were made to depend on her cousins thought ayala it would not be well assured and my sister emmeline is always goodnatured  aunt emmeline is very good only  only what  i dont know but it is such a sudden change uncle reginald  yes it is a very great change my dear they are very rich and we are poor enough i should hardly have consented to this for your sake but that there are reasons which will make it better for you both  as to that said ayala stoutly i had to come away i didnt suit  you shall suit us my dear  i hope so i will try i know more now than i did then i thought i was to be augustas equal  we shall all be equal here  people ought to be equal i thinkexcept old people and young people i will do whatever you and my aunt tell me there are no young people here so there wont be any trouble of that kind  there will be no other young person certainly you shall go upstairs now and see your aunt  then there was the interview upstairs which consisted chiefly in promises and kisses and ayala was left alone to unpack her boxes and prepare for dinner before she began her operations she sat still for a few moments and with an effort collected her energies and made her resolution she had said to lucy in her passion that she would that she were dead that that should have been wicked was not matter of much concern to her but she acknowledged to herself that it had been weak and foolish there was her life before her and she would still endeavour to be happy though there had been so much to distress her she had flung away wealth she was determined to fling it away still when it should present itself to her in the shape of her cousin tom but she had her dreamsher daydreamsthose castles in the air which it had been the delight of her life to construct and in the building of which her hours had never run heavy with her isadore hamel would of course come again and would of course marry lucy and then there would be a home for her after her own heart with isadore as her brother and her own own lucy close to her she would not feel the want of riches and of luxury if there were only some intellectual charm in her life some touch of art some devotion to things beautiful then she could do without gold and silver and costly raiment of course isadore would come and thenthenin the far distance something else would come something of which in her castlebuilding she had not yet developed the form of which she did not yet know the bearing or the manner of its beauty or the music of its voice but as to which she was very sure that its form would be beautiful and its voice full of music it can hardly be said that this something was the centre of her dreams or the foundation of her castles it was the extreme point of perfection at which she would arrive at last when her thoughts had become sublimated by the intensity of her thinking it was the tower of the castle from which she could look down upon the inferior world belowthe last point of the dream in arranging which she would all but escape from earth to heavenwhen in the moment of her escape the cruel waking back into the world would come upon her but this she knewthat this something whatever might be its form or whatever its voice would be exactly the opposite of tom tringle  she had fallen away from her resolution to her dreams for a time when suddenly she jumped up and began her work with immense energy open went one box after another and in five minutes the room was strewed with her possessions the modest set of drawers which was to supply all her wants was filled with immediate haste things were deposited in whatever nooks might be found and every corner was utilized her character for tidiness had never stood high at the bijou lucy or her mother or the favourite maid had always been at hand to make good her deficiencies with a reproach which had never gone beyond a smile or a kiss at glenbogie and even on the journey there had been attendant ladys maids but here she was all alone  everything was still in confusion when she was called to dinner as she went down she recalled to herself her second resolution she would be goodwhereby she intimated to herself that she would endeavour to do what might be pleasing to her aunt dosett she had little doubt as to her uncle but she was aware that there had been differences between her aunt and lucy if lucy had found it difficult to be good how great would be the struggle required from her  she sat herself down at table a little nearer to her aunt than her uncle because it was specially her aunt whom she wished to win and after a few minutes she put out her little soft hand and touched that of mrs dosett my dear said that lady i hope you will be happy  i am determined to be happy said ayala if you will let me love you  mrs dosett was not beautiful nor was she romantic in appearance she was the very reverse of ayala the cares of the world the looking after shillings and their results had given her that look of commonplace insignificance which is so frequent and so unattractive among middleaged women upon whom the world leans heavily but there was a tender corner in her heart which was still green and from which a little rill of sweet water could be made to flow when it was touched aright on this occasion a tear came to her eye as she pressed her nieces hand but she said nothing she was sure however that she would love ayala much better than she had been able to love lucy  what would you like me to do asked ayala when her aunt accompanied her that night to her bed room  to do my dear what do you generally do  nothing i read a little and draw a little but i do nothing useful i mean it to be different now  you shall do as you please ayala  oh but i mean it and you must tell me of course things have to be different  we are not rich like your uncle and aunt tringle  perhaps it is better not to be rich so that one may have something to do but i want you to tell me as though you really cared for me  i will care for you said aunt dosett sobbing  then first begin by telling me what to do i will try and do it of course i have thought about it coming away from all manner of rich things and i have determined that it shall not make me unhappy i will rise above it i will begin tomorrow and do anything if you will tell me then aunt dosett took her in her arms and kissed her and declared that on the morrow they would begin their work together in perfect confidence and love with each other  i think she will do better than lucy said mrs dosett to her husband that night  lucy was a dear girl too said uncle reginald  oh yesquite so i dont mean to say a word against lucy but i think that i can do better with ayala she will be more diligent uncle reginald said nothing to this but he could not but think that of the two lucy would be the one most likely to devote herself to hard work  on the next morning ayala went out with her aunt on the round to the shopkeepers and listened with profound attention to the domestic instructions which were given to her on the occasion when she came home she knew much of which she had known nothing before what was the price of mutton and how much mutton she was expected as one of the family to eat per week what were the necessities of the house in bread and butter how far a pint of milk might be stretchedwith a proper understanding that her uncle reginald as head of the family was to be subjected to no limits and before their return from that walkon the first morning of ayalas sojournayala had undertaken always to call mrs dosett aunt margaret for the future     chapter xi  tom tringle comes to the crescent   during the next three months up to the end of the winter and through the early spring things went on without any change either in queens gate or kingsbury crescent the sisters saw each other occasionally but not as frequently as either of them had intended lucy was not encouraged in the use of cabs nor was the carriage lent to her often for the purpose of going to the crescent the reader may remember that she had been in the habit of walking alone in kensington gardens and a walk across kensington gardens would carry her the greater part of the distance to kingsbury crescent but lucy in her new circumstances was not advisedperhaps i may say was not allowedto walk alone lady tringle being a lady of rank and wealth was afraid or pretended to be afraid of the lions poor ayala was really afraid of the lions thus it came to pass that the intercourse was not frequent in her daily life lucy was quiet and obedient she did not run counter to augusta whose approaching nuptials gave her that predominance in the house which is always accorded to young ladies in her recognised position gertrude was at this time a subject of trouble at queens gate sir thomas had not been got to approve of mr frank houston and gertrude had positively refused to give him up sir thomas was indeed considerably troubled by his children there had been a period of disagreeable obstinacy even with augusta before mr traffick had been taken into the bosom of the family now gertrude had her own ideas and so also had tom tom had become quite a trouble sir thomas and lady tringle together had determined that tom must be weaned by which they meant that he must be cured of his love but tom had altogether refused to be weaned mr dosett had been requested to deny him admittance to the house in kingsbury crescent and as this request had been fully endorsed by ayala herself orders had been given to the effect to the parlourmaid tom had called more than once and had been unable to obtain access to his beloved but yet he resolutely refused to be weaned he told his father to his face that he intended to marry ayala and abused his mother roundly when she attempted to interfere the whole family was astounded by his perseverance so that there had already sprung up an idea in the minds of some among the tringles that he would be successful at last augusta was very firm declaring that ayala was a viper but sir thomas himself began to inquire within his own bosom whether tom should not be allowed to settle down in the manner desired by himself in no consultation held at queens gate on the subject was there the slightest expression of an opinion that tom might be denied the opportunity of settling down as he wished through any unwillingness on the part of ayala  when things were in this position tom sought an interview one morning with his father in lombard street they rarely saw each other at the office each having his own peculiar branch of business sir thomas manipulated his millions in a little back room of his own while tom dealing probably with limited thousands made himself useful in an outer room they never went to or left the office together but sir thomas always took care to know that his son was or was not on the premises i want to say a word or two sir aboutabout the little affair of mine said tom  what affair said sir thomas looking up from his millions  i think i should like tomarry  the best thing you can do my boy only it depends upon who the young lady may be  my mind is made up about that sir i mean to marry my cousin i dont see why a young man isnt to choose for himself then sir thomas preached his sermon but preached it in the manner which men are wont to use when they know that they are preaching in vain there is a tone of refusal which though the words used may be manifestly enough words of denial is in itself indicative of assent sir thomas ended the conference by taking a week to think over the matter and when the week was over gave way he was still inclined to think that marriages with cousins had better be avoided but he gave way and at last promised that if tom and ayala were of one mind an income should be forthcoming  for the carrying out of this purpose it was necessary that the door of uncle dosetts house should be unlocked and with the object of turning the key sir thomas himself called at the admiralty i find my boy is quite in earnest about this he said to the admiralty clerk  oh indeed  i cant say i quite like it myself mr dosett could only shake his head cousins had better be cousins and nothing more  and then you would probably expect him to get money  not at all said sir thomas proudly i have got money enough for them both it isnt an affair of money to make a long story short i have given my consent and therefore if you do not mind i shall be glad if you will allow tom to call at the crescent of course you may have your own views but i dont suppose you can hope to do better for the girl cousins do marry you know very often mr dosett could only say that he could not expect to do anything for the girl nearly so good and that as far as he was concerned his nephew tom should be made quite welcome at kingsbury crescent it was not he added in his power to answer for ayala as to this sir thomas did not seem to have any doubts the good things of the world which it was in his power to offer were so good that it was hardly probable that a young lady in ayalas position should refuse them  my dear said aunt margaret the next morning speaking in her most suasive tone your cousin tom is to be allowed to call here  tom tringle  yes my dear sir thomas has consented  then he had better not said ayala bristling up in hot anger uncle tom has got nothing to do with it either in refusing or consenting i wont see him  i think you must see him if he calls  but i dont want oh aunt margaret pray make him not come i dont like him a bit we are doing so very well are we not aunt margaret  certainly my dear we are doing very wellat least i hope so but you are old enough now to understand that this is a very serious matter  of course it is serious said ayala who certainly was not guilty of the fault of making light of her future life those dreams of hers in which were contained all her hopes and all her aspirations were very serious to her this was so much the case that she had by no means thought of her cousin tom in a light spirit as though he were a matter of no moment to her he was to her just what the beast must have been to the beauty when the beast first began to be in love but her safety had consisted in the fact that no one had approved of the beast being in love with her now she could understand that all the horrors of oppression might fall upon her of course it was serious but not the less was she resolved that nothing should induce her to marry the beast  i think you ought to see him when he comes and to remember how different it will be when he comes with the approval of his father it is of course saying that they are ready to welcome you as their daughter  i dont want to be anybodys daughter  but ayala there are so many things to be thought of here is a young man who is able to give you not only every comfort but great opulence  i dont want to be opulent  and he will be a baronet  i dont care about baronets aunt margaret  and you will have a house of your own in which you may be of service to your sister  i had rather she should have a house  but tom is not in love with lucy  he is such a lout aunt margaret i wont have anything to say to him i would a great deal sooner die uncle tom has no right to send him here they have got rid of me and i am very glad of it but it isnt fair that he should come after me now that im gone away couldnt uncle reginald tell him to stay away  a great deal more was said but nothing that was said had the slightest effect on ayala when she was told of her dependent position and of the splendour of the prospects offered she declared that she would rather go into the poorhouse than marry her cousin when she was told that tom was goodnatured honest and true she declared that goodnature honesty and truth had nothing to do with it when she was asked what it was that she looked forward to in the world she could merely sob and say that there was nothing she could not tell even her sister lucy of those dreams and castles how then could she explain them to her aunt margaret how could she make her aunt understand that there could be no place in her heart for tom tringle seeing that it was to be kept in reserve for some angel of light who would surely make his appearance in due seasonbut who must still be there present to her as her angel of light even should he never show himself in the flesh how vain it was to talk of tom tringle to her when she had so visible before her eyes that angel of light with whom she was compelled to compare him  but though she could not be brought to say that she would listen patiently to his story she was nevertheless made to understand that she must see him when he came to her aunt margaret was very full on that subject a young man who was approved of by the young ladys friends and who had means at command was in mrs dosetts opinion entitled to a hearing how otherwise were properly authorised marriages to be made up and arranged when this was going on there was in some slight degree a diminished sympathy between ayala and her aunt ayala still continued her household dutiesover which in the privacy of her own room she groaned sadly but she continued them in silence her aunt upon whom she had counted was she thought turning against her mrs dosett on the other hand declared to herself that the girl was romantic and silly husbands with every immediate comfort and a prospect of almost unlimited wealth are not to be found under every hedge what right could a girl so dependent as ayala have to refuse an eligible match she therefore in this way became an advocate on behalf of tomas did also uncle reginald more mildly uncle reginald merely remarked that tom was attending to his business which was a great thing in a young man it was not much but it showed ayala that in this matter her uncle was her enemy in this her terrible crisis she had not a friend unless it might be lucy  then a day was fixed on which tom was to come which made the matter more terrible by anticipation what can be the good ayala said to her aunt when the hour named for the interview was told her as i can tell him everything just as well without his coming at all but all that had been settled aunt margaret had repeated over and over again that such an excellent young man as tom with such admirable intentions was entitled to a hearing from any young lady in reply to this ayala simply made a grimace which was intended to signify the utter contempt in which she held her cousin tom with all his wealth  tom tringle in spite of his rings and a certain dash of vulgarity which was perhaps not altogether his own fault was not a bad fellow having taken it into his heart that he was very much in love he was very much in love he pictured to himself a happiness of a wholesome cleanly kind to have the girl as his own to caress her and foster her and expend himself in making her happy to exalt her so as to have it acknowledged that she was at any rate as important as augusta to learn something from her so that he too might become romantic and in some degree poeticalall this had come home to him in a not ignoble manner but it had not come home to him that ayala might probably refuse him hitherto ayala had been very persistent in her refusals but then hitherto there had existed the opposition of all the family now he had overcome that and he felt therefore that he was entitled to ask and to receive  on the day fixed and at the hour fixed he came in the plenitude of all his rings poor tom it was a pity that he should have had no one to advise him as to his apparel ayala hated his jewelry she was not quite distinct in her mind as to the raiment which would be worn by the angel of light when he should come but she was sure that he would not be chiefly conspicuous for heavy gilding and tom moreover had a waistcoat which would of itself have been suicidal such as he was however he was shown up into the drawingroom where he found ayala alone it was certainly a misfortune to him that no preliminary conversation was possible ayala had been instructed to be there with the express object of listening to an offer of marriage the work had to be doneand should be done but it would not admit of other ordinary courtesies she was very angry with him and she looked her anger why should she be subjected to this terrible annoyance he had sense enough to perceive that there was no place for preliminary courtesy and therefore rushed away at once to the matter in hand ayala he exclaimed coming and standing before her as she sat upon the sofa  tom she said looking boldly up into his face  ayala i love you better than anything else in the world  but whats the good of it  of course it was different when i told you so before i meant to stick to it and i was determined that the governor should give way but you couldnt know that mother and the girls were all against us  they werent against me said ayala  they were against our being married and so they squeezed you out as it were that is why you have been sent to this place but they understand me now and know what i am about they have all given their consent and the governor has promised to be liberal when he says a thing hell do it there will be lots of money  i dont care a bit about money said ayala fiercely  no more do iexcept only that it is comfortable it wouldnt do to marry without moneywould it  it would do very well if anybody cared for anybody the angel of light generally appeared in formâ pauperis though there was always about him a tinge of bright azure which was hardly compatible with the draggletailed hue of everyday poverty  but an income is a good thing and the governor will come down like a brick  the governor has nothing to do with it i told you before that it is all nonsense if you will only go away and say nothing about it i shall always think you very goodnatured  but i wont go away said tom speaking out boldly i mean to stick to it ayala i dont believe you understand that i am thoroughly in earnest  why shouldnt i be in earnest too  but i love you ayala i have set my heart upon it you dont know how well i love you i have quite made up my mind about it  and i have made up my mind  but ayala now the tenor of his face changed and something of the look of a despairing lover took the place of that offensive triumph which had at first sat upon his brow i dont suppose you care for any other fellow yet  there was the angel of light but even though she might be most anxious to explain to him that his suit was altogether impracticable she could say nothing to him about the angel though she was sure that the angel would come she was not certain that she would ever give herself altogether even to the angel the celestial castle which was ever being built in her imagination was as yet very much complicated but had it been ever so clear it would have been quite impossible to explain anything of this to her cousin tom that has nothing to do with it she said  if you knew how i love you this came from him with a sob and as he sobbed he went down before her on his knees  dont be a fool tompray dont if you wont get up i shall go away i must go away i have heard all that there is to hear i told them that there is no use in your coming  ayala with this there were veritable sobs  then why dont you give it up and let us be good friends  i cant give it up i wont give it up when a fellow means it as i do he never gives it up nothing on earth shall make me give it up ayala youve got to do it and so i tell you  nobody can make me said ayala nodding her head but somewhat tamed by the unexpected passion of the young man  then you wont say one kind word to me  i cant say anything kinder  very well then i shall go away and come again constantly till you do i mean to have you when you come to know how very much i love you i do think you will give way at last with that he picked himself up from the ground and hurried out of the house without saying another word     chapter xii  would you   the scene described in the last chapter took place in march for three days afterwards there was quiescence in kingsbury crescent then there came a letter from tom to ayala very pressing full of love and resolution offering to wait any timeeven a monthif she wished it but still persisting in his declared intention of marrying her sooner or laternot by any means a bad letter had there not been about it a little touch of bombast which made it odious to ayalas sensitive appreciation to this ayala wrote a reply in the following words      when i tell you that i wont you oughtnt to go on it    isnt manly     ayala     pray do not write again for i shall never answer another   of this she said nothing to mrs dosett though the arrival of toms letter must have been known to that lady and she posted her own epistle without a word as to what she was doing  she wrote again and again to lucy imploring her sister to come to her urging that as circumstances now were she could not show herself at the house in queens gate to these lucy always replied but she did not reply by coming and hardly made it intelligible why she did not come aunt emmeline hoped she said that ayala would very soon be able to be at queens gate then there was a difficulty about the carriage no one would walk across with her except tom and walking by herself was forbidden aunt emmeline did not like cabs then there came a third or fourth letter in which lucy was more explanatory but yet not sufficiently so during the easter recess which would take place in the middle of april augusta and mr traffick would be married the happy couple were to be blessed with a divided honeymoon the interval between easter and whitsuntide would require mr trafficks presence in the house and the bride with her bridegroom were to return to queens gate then they would depart again for the second holidays and when they were so gone aunt emmeline hoped that ayala would come to them for a visit they quite understand said lucy that it will not do to have you and augusta together  this was not at all what ayala wanted it wont at all do to have me and him together said ayala to herself alluding of course to tom tringle but why did not lucy come over to her lucy who knew so well that her sister did not want to see any one of the tringles who must have been sure that any visit to queens gate must have been impossible ought to have come to her to whom else could she say a word in her trouble it was thus that ayala argued with herself declaring to herself that she must soon die in her miseryunless indeed that angel of light might come to her assistance very quickly  but lucy had troubles of her own in reference to the family at queens gate which did in fact make it almost impossible to visit her sister for some weeks sir thomas had given an unwilling but a frank consent to his sons marriageand then expected simply to be told that it would take place at such and such a time when money would be required lady tringle had given her consentbut not quite frankly she still would fain have forbidden the banns had any power of forbidding remained in her hands augusta was still hot against the marriage and still resolute to prevent it that proposed journey upstairs after the scrapbook at glenbogie that real journey up to the top of st peters still rankled in her heart that tom should make ayala a future baronets wife that tom should endow ayala with the greatest share of the tringle wealth that ayala should become powerful in queens gate and dominant probably at merle park and glenbogiewas wormwood to her she was conscious that ayala was pretty and witty though she could affect to despise the wit and the prettiness by instigating her mother and by inducing mr traffick to interfere when mr traffick should be a member of the family she thought that she might prevail with her mother she did in part prevail her future husband was at present too much engaged with supply and demand to be able to give his thoughts to toms affairs but there would soon be a time when he naturally would be compelled to divide his thoughts then there was gertrude gertrudes own affairs had not as yet been smiled upon and the want of smiles she attributed very much to augusta why should augusta have her way and not she gertrude nor her brother tom she therefore leagued herself with tom and declared herself quite prepared to receive ayala into the house in this way the family was very much divided  when lucy first made her petition for the carriage expressing her desire to see ayala both her uncle and her aunt were in the room objection was madesome frivolous objectionby lady tringle who did not in truth care to maintain much connection between queens gate and the crescent then sir thomas in his burly authoritative way had said that ayala had better come to them that same evening he had settled or intended to settle it with his wife let ayala come as soon as the trafficksas they then would beshould have gone to this lady tringle had assented knowing more than her husband as to ayalas feelings and thinking that in this way a breach might be made between them ayala had been a great trouble to her and she was beginning to be almost sick of the dormer connection altogether it was thus that lucy was hindered from seeing her sister for six weeks after that first formal declaration of his love made by tom to ayala tom had still persevered and had forced his way more than once into ayalas presence but ayalas answers had been always the same its a great shame and you have no right to treat me in this way  then came the traffick marriage with great éclat there were no less than four traffick bridesmaids all of them no doubt noble but none of them very young and gertrude and lucy were bridesmaidsand two of augustas friends ayala of course was not of the party tom was gorgeous in his apparel not in the least depressed by his numerous repulses quite confident of ultimate success and proud of his position as a lover with so beautiful a girl he talked of his affairs to all his friends and seemed to think that even on this weddingday his part was as conspicuous as that of his sister because of his affair with his beautiful cousin augusta doesnt hit it off with her he said to one of his friends who asked why ayala was not at the weddingaugusta is the biggest fool out you know shes proud of her husband because hes the son of a lord i wouldnt change ayala for the daughter of any duchess in europethus showing that he regarded ayala as being almost his own already lord boardotrade was there making a semijocose speech quite in the approved way for a cognate paterfamilias perhaps there was something of a thorn in this to sir thomas as it had become apparent at last that mr traffick himself did not purpose to add anything from his own resources to the income on which he intended to live with his wife lord boardotrade had been obliged to do so much for his eldest son that there appeared to be nothing left for the member for port glasgow sir thomas was prepared with his £120000 and did not perhaps mind this very much but a man when he pays his money likes to have some return for it and he did not quite like the tone with which the old nobleman not possessed of very old standing in the peerage seemed to imply that he like a noble old providence had enveloped the whole tringle family in the mantle of his noble blood he combined the jocose and the paternal in the manner appropriate to such occasions but there did run through sir thomass mind as he heard him an idea that £120000 was a sufficient sum to pay and that it might be necessary to make mr traffick understand that out of the income thenceforth coming he must provide a house for himself and his wife it had been already arranged that he was to return to queens gate with his wife for the period between easter and whitsuntide it had latelyquite latelybeen hinted to sir thomas that the married pair would run up again after the second holidays mr septimus traffick had once spoken of glenbogie as almost all his own and augusta had in her fathers hearing said a word intended to be very affectionate about dear merle park sir thomas was a father all over with all a fathers feelings but even a father does not like to be done mr traffick no doubt was a member of parliament and son of a peerbut there might be a question whether even mr traffick had not been purchased at quite his full value  nevertheless the marriage was pronounced to have been a success immediately after itearly indeed on the following morningsir thomas inquired when ayala was coming to queens gate is it necessary that she should come quite at present asked lady tringle  i thought it was all settled said sir thomas angrily this had been said in the privacy of his own dressingroom but downstairs at the breakfasttable in the presence of gertrude and lucy he returned to the subject tom who did not live in the house was not there i suppose we might as well have ayala now he said addressing himself chiefly to lucy do you go and manage it with her there was not a word more said sir thomas did not always have his own way in his family what man was ever happy enough to do that but he was seldom directly contradicted lady tringle when the order was given pursed up her lips and he had he been observant might have known that she did not intend to have ayala if she could help it but he was not observantexcept as to millions  when sir thomas was gone lady tringle discussed the matter with lucy of course my dear she said if we could make dear ayala happy  i dont think she will come aunt emmeline  not come this was not said at all in a voice of anger but simply as eliciting some further expression of opinion  shes afraid oftom lucy had never hitherto expressed a positive opinion on that matter at queens gate when augusta had spoken of ayala as having run after tom lucy had been indignant and had declared that the running had been all on the other side in a side way she had hinted that ayala at any rate at present was far from favourable to toms suit but she had never yet spoken out her mind at queens gate as ayala had spoken it to her  afraid of him said aunt emmeline  i mean that she is not a bit in love with him and when a girl is like that i suppose she isis afraid of a man if everybody else wants her to marry him  why should everybody want her to marry tom asked lady tringle indignantly i am sure i dont want her  i suppose it is uncle tom and aunt dosett and uncle reginald said poor lucy finding that she had made a mistake  i dont see why anybody should want her to marry tom tom is carried away by her baby face and makes a fool of himself as to everybody wanting her i hope she does not flatter herself that there is anything of the kind  i only meant that i think she would rather not be brought here where she would have to see him daily  after this the loan of the carriage was at last made and lucy was allowed to visit her sister at the crescent has he been there was almost the first question that ayala asked  what he do you mean  isadore hamel  no i have not seen him since i met him in the park but i do not want to talk about mr hamel ayala mr hamel is nothing  oh lucy  he is nothing had he been anything he has gone and there would be an end to it but he is nothing  if a man is true he may go but he will come back ayala had her ideas about the angel of light very clearly impressed upon her mind in regard to the conduct of the man though they were terribly vague as to his personal appearance his condition of life his appropriateness for marriage and many other details of his circumstances it had also often occurred to her that this angel of light when he should come might not be in love with herselfand that she might have to die simply because she had seen him and loved him in vain but he would be a man sure to come back if there were fitting reasons that he should do so isadore hamel was not quite an angel of light but he was nearly angelicat any rate very good and surely would come back  never mind about mr hamel ayala it is not nice to talk about a man who has never spoken a word  never spoken a word oh lucy  mr hamel has never spoken a word and i will not talk about him there all my heart is open to you ayala you know that but i will not talk about mr hamel aunt emmeline wants you to come to queens gate  i will not  or rather it is sir thomas who wants you to come i do like uncle tom i do indeed  so do i  you ought to come when he asks you  why ought i that lout would be thereof course  i dont know about his being a lout ayala  he comes here and i have to be perfectly brutal to him you cant guess the sort of things i say to him and he doesnt mind it a bit he thinks that he has to go on long enough and that i must give way at last if i were to go to queens gate it would be just as much as to say that i had given way  why not  lucy  why not he is not bad he is honest and true and kindhearted i know you cant be happy here  no  aunt dosett with all her affairs must be trouble to you i could not bear them patiently how can you  because they are better than tom tringle i read somewhere about there being seven houses of the devil each one being lower and worse than the other tom would be the lowestthe lowestthe lowest  ayala my darling  do not tell me that i ought to marry tom said ayala almost standing off in anger from the proferred kiss do you think that i could love him  i think you could if you tried because he is loveable it is so much to be good and then he loves you truly after all it is something to have everything nice around you you have not been made to be poor and uncomfortable i fear that it must be bad with you here  it is bad  i wish i could have stayed ayala i am more tranquil than you and could have borne it better  it is bad it is one of the housesbut not the lowest i can eat my heart out here peaceably and die with a great needle in my hand and a towel in my lap but if i were to marry him i should kill myself the first hour after i had gone away with him things what would things be with such a monster as that leaning over one would you marry him in answer to this lucy made no immediate reply why dont you say you want me to marry him would you  no  then why should i  i could not try to love him  try how can a girl try to love any man it should come because she cant help it let her try ever so trying to love tom tringle why cant you try  he doesnt want me  but if he did i dont suppose it would make the least difference to him which it was would you try if he asked  no  then why should i am i so much a poorer creature than you  you are a finer creature you know that i think so  i dont want to be finer i want to be the same  you are free to do as you please i am notquite  that means isadore hamel  i try to tell you all the truth ayala but pray do not talk about him even to me as for you you are free and if you could  i cant i dont know that i am free as you call it then lucy started as though about to ask the question which would naturally follow you neednt look like that lucy there isnt any one to be named  a man not to be named  there isnt a man at all there isnt anybody but i may have my own ideas if i please if i had an isadore hamel of my own i could compare tom or mr traffick or any other lout to him and could say how infinitely higher in the order of things was my isadore than any of them though i havent an isadore cant i have an image and cant i make my image brighter even higher than isadore you wont believe that of course and i dont want you to believe it yourself but you should believe it for me my image can make tom tringle just as horrible to me as isadore hamel can make him to you thus it was that ayala endeavoured to explain to her sister something of the castle which she had built in the air and of the angel of light who inhabited the castle  then it was decided between them that lucy should explain to aunt emmeline that ayala could not make a prolonged stay at queens gate but how shall i say it asked lucy  tell her the truth openly tom wants to marry ayala and ayala wont have him therefore of course she cant come because it would look as though she were going to change her mindwhich she isnt aunt emmeline will understand that and will not be a bit sorry she doesnt want to have me for a daughterinlaw she had quite enough of me at rome  all this time the carriage was waiting and lucy was obliged to return before half of all that was necessary had been said what was to be ayalas life for the future how were the sisters to see each other what was to be done when at the end of the coming summer lucy should be taken first to glenbogie and then to merle park there is a support in any excitement though it be in the excitement of sorrow only at the present moment ayala was kept alive by the necessity of her battle with tom tringle but how would it be with her when tom should have given up the fight lucy knew by sad experience how great might be the tedium of life in kingsbury crescent and knew also how unfitted ayala was to endure it there seemed to be no prospect of escape in future she knows nothing of what i am suffering said ayala when she gives me the things to do and tells me of more things and more and more how can there be so many things to be done in such a house as this but as lucy was endeavouring to explain how different were the arrangements in kingsbury crescent from those which had prevailed at the bijou the offended coachman sent up word to say that he didnt think sir thomas would like it if the horses were kept out in the rain any longer then lucy hurried down not having spoken of half the things which were down in her mind on the list for discussion     chapter xiii  how the tringles fell into trouble   after the easter holidays the trafficks came back to queens gate making a combination of honeymoon and business which did very well for a time it was understood that it was to be so during honeymoon times the fashionable married couple is always lodged and generally boarded for nothing that opening wide of generous hands which exhibits itself in the joyous enthusiasm of a coming marriage taking the shape of a houseful of presents of a gorgeous and ponderous trousseau of a splendid marriage feast and not unfrequently of subsidiary presents from the opulent papapresents which are subsidiary to the grand substratum of settled dowrygenerously extends itself to luxurious provision for a month or two that mr and mrs traffick should come back to queens gate for the six weeks intervening between easter and whitsuntide had been arranged and arranged also that the use of merle park for the whitsun holidays should be allowed to them this last boon augusta with her sweetest kiss had obtained from her father only two days before the wedding but when it was suggested just before the departure to merle park that mr trafficks unnecessary boots might be left at queens gate because he would come back there then sir thomas who had thought over the matter said a word  it was in this way mamma said augusta i suppose i can leave a lot of things in the big wardrobe jemima says i cannot take them to merle park without ever so many extra trunks  certainly my dear when anybody occupies the room they wont want all the wardrobe i dont know that any one will come this summer  this was only the thin end of the wedge and as augusta felt was not introduced successfully the words spoken seemed to have admitted that a return to queens gate had not been intended the conversation went no further at the moment but was recommenced the same evening mamma i suppose septimus can leave his things here  of course my dear he can leave anythingto be taken care of  it will be so convenient if we can come backjust for a few days  now there certainly had been a lack of confidence between the married daughter and her mother as to a new residence a word had been spoken and augusta had said that she supposed they would go to lord boardotrade when they left queens gate just to finish the season now it was known that his lordship with his four unmarried daughters lived in a small house in a small street in mayfair the locality is no doubt fashionable but the house was inconvenient mr traffick himself had occupied lodgings near the house of commons but these had been given up i think you must ask your papa said lady tringle  couldnt you ask him said the honourable mrs traffick lady tringle was driven at last to consent and then put the question to sir thomasbeginning with the suggestion as to the unnecessary boots  i suppose septimus can leave his things here  where do they mean to live when they come back to town asked sir thomas sharply  i suppose it would be convenient if they could come here for a little time said lady tringle  and stay till the end of the seasonand then go down to glenbogie and then to merle park where do they mean to live  i think there was a promise about glenbogie said lady tringle  i never made a promise i heard traffick say that he would like to have some shootingthough as far as i know he cant hit a haystack they may come to glenbogie for two or three weeks if they like but they shant stay here during the entire summer  you wont turn your own daughter out tom  ill turn traffick out and i suppose hell take his wife with him said sir thomas thus closing the conversation in wrath  the trafficks went and came back and were admitted into the bedroom with the big wardrobe and to the dressingroom where the boots were kept on the very first day of his arrival mr traffick was in the house at four and remained there till four the next morningcertain irish members having been very eloquent he was not down when sir thomas left the next morning at nine and was again at the house when sir thomas came home to dinner how long is it to be said sir thomas that night to his wife there was a certain tone in his voice which made lady tringle feel herself to be ill all over it must be said in justice to sir thomas that he did not often use this voice in his domestic circle though it was well known in lombard street but he used it now and his wife felt herself to be unwell i am not going to put up with it and he neednt think it  dont destroy poor augustas happiness so soon  that be dd said the father energetically whos going to destroy her happiness her happiness ought to consist in living in her husbands house what have i given her all that money for then lady tringle did not dare to say another word  it was not till the third day that sir thomas and his soninlaw met each other by that time sir thomas had got it into his head that his soninlaw was avoiding him but on the saturday there was no house it was then just the middle of junesaturday june 15and sir thomas had considered at the most that there would be yet nearly two months before parliament would cease to sit and the time for glenbogie would come he had fed his anger warm and was determined that he would not be done well traffick how are you he said encountering his soninlaw in the hall and leading him into the diningroom i havent seen you since youve been back  ive been in the house morning noon and night pretty near  i dare say i hope you found yourself comfortable at merle park  a charming housequite charming i dont know whether i shouldnt build the stables a little further from  very likely nothing is so easy as knocking other peoples houses about i hope youll soon have one to knock about of your own  all in good time said mr traffick smiling  sir thomas was one of those men who during the course of a successful life have contrived to repress their original roughnesses and who make a not ineffectual attempt to live after the fashion of those with whom their wealth and successes have thrown them but among such will occasionally be found one whose roughness does not altogether desert him and who can on an occasion use it with a purpose such a one will occasionally surprise his latterday associates by the sudden ferocity of his brow by the hardness of his voice and by an apparently unaccustomed use of violent words the man feels that he must fight and not having learned the practice of finer weapons fights in this way unskilled with foils or rapier he falls back upon the bludgeon with which his hand has not lost all its old familiarity such a one was sir thomas tringle and a time for such exercise had seemed to him to have come now there are other men who by the possession of imperturbable serenity seem to be armed equally against rapier and bludgeon whom there is no wounding with any weapon such a one was mr traffick when he was told of knocking about a house of his own he quite took the meaning of sir thomass words and was immediately prepared for the sort of conversation which would follow i wish i mighta merle park of my own for instance if i had gone into the city instead of to westminster it might have come in my way  it seems to me that a good deal has come in your way without very much trouble on your part  a seat in the house is a nice thingbut i work harder i take it than you do sir thomas  i never have had a shilling but what i earned when you leave this where are you and augusta going to live  this was a home question which would have disconcerted most gentlemen in mr trafficks position were it not that gentlemen easily disconcerted would hardly find themselves there  where shall we go when we leave this you were so kind as to say something about glenbogie when parliament is up  no i didnt  i thought i understood it  you said something and i didnt refuse  put it any way you like sir thomas  but what do you mean to do before parliament is up the long and the short of it is we didnt expect you to come back after the holidays i like to be plain this might go on for ever if i didnt speak out  and a very comfortable way of going on it would be sir thomas raised his eyebrows in unaffected surprise and then again assumed his frown of course im thinking of augusta chiefly  augusta made up her mind no doubt to leave her fathers house when she married  she shows her affection for her parents by wishing to remain in it the fact i suppose is you want the rooms  but even if we didnt youre not going to live here for ever i suppose  that sir is too good to be thought of i fear the truth is we had an idea of staying at my fathers he spoke of going down to the country and lending us the house my sisters have made him change his mind and so here we are of course we can go into lodgings  or to an hotel  too dear you see youve made me pay such a sum for insuring my life ill tell you what ill do if youll let us make it out here till the 10th of july well go into an hotel then sir thomas surprised at his own compliance did at last give way and then we can have a month at glenbogie from the 12th  three weeks said sir thomas shouting at the top of his voice  very well three weeks if you could have made it the month it would have been convenient but i hate to be disagreeable thus the matter was settled and mr traffick was altogether well pleased with the arrangement  what are we to do said augusta with a very long face what are we to do when we are made to go away  i hope i shall be able to make some of the girls go down by that time and then we must squeeze in at my fathers  this and other matters made sir thomas in those days irritable and disagreeable to the family tom he said to his wife is the biggest fool that ever lived  what is the matter with him now asked lady tringle who did not like to have her only son abused  hes away half his time and when he does come hed better be away if he wants to marry that girl why doesnt he marry her and have done with it  now this was a matter upon which lady tringle had ideas of her own which were becoming every day stronger im sure i should be very sorry to see it she said  why should you be sorry isnt it the best thing a young man can do if hes set his heart that way all the world wont talk him off i thought all that was settled  you cant make the girl marry him  is that it asked sir thomas with a whistle you used to say she was setting her cap at him  she is one of those girls you dont know what she would be at shes full of romance and nonsense and isnt half as fond of telling the truth as she ought to be she made my life a burden to me while she was with us and i dont think she would be any better for tom  but hes still determined  whats the use of that said lady tringle  then he shall have her i made him a promise and im not going to give it up i told him that if he was in earnest he should have her  you cant make a girl marry a young man  you have her here and then well take her to glenbogie now when i say it i mean it you go and fetch her and if you dont i will im not going to have her turned out into the cold in that way  she wont come tom then he turned round and frowned at her  the immediate result of this was that lady tringle herself did drive across to kingsbury crescent accompanied by gertrude and lucy and did make her request in form my dear your uncle particularly wants you to come to us for the next month mrs dosett was sitting by i hope ayala may be allowed to come to us for a month  ayala must answer for herself said mrs dosett firmly there had never been any warm friendship between mrs dosett and her husbands elder sister  i cant said ayala shaking her head  why not my dear said lady tringle  i cant said ayala  lady tringle was not in the least offended or annoyed at the refusal she did not at all desire that ayala should come to glenbogie ayala at glenbogie would make her life miserable to her it would of course lead to toms marriage and then there would be internecine fighting between ayala and augusta but it was necessary that she should take back to her husband some replyand this reply if in the form of refusal must come from ayala herself your uncle has sent me said lady tringle and i must give him some reason as for expense you knowthen she turned to mrs dosett with a smilethat of course would be our affair  if you ask me said mrs dosett i think that as ayala has come to us she had better remain with us of course things are very different and she would be only discontented at this lady tringle smiled her sweetest smileas though acknowledging that things certainly were differentand then turned to ayala for a further reply  aunt emmeline i cant said ayala  but why my dear cant isnt a courteous answer to a request that is meant to be kind  speak out ayala said mrs dosett there is nobody here but your aunts  because of tom  tom wouldnt eat you said lady tringle again smiling  its worse than eating me said ayala he will go on when i tell him not if i were down there hed be doing it always and then youd tell me that iencouraged him  lady tringle felt this to be unkind and undeserved those passages in rome had been very disagreeable to every one concerned the girl certainly as she thought had been arrogant and impertinent she had been accepted from charity and had then domineered in the family she had given herself airs and had gone out into company almost without authority into company which had rejected herlady tringle it had become absolutely necessary to get rid of an inmate so troublesome so unbearable the girl had been sent awayalmost ignominiously now she lady tringle the offended aunt the aunt who had so much cause for offence had been good enough gracious enough to pardon all this and was again offering the fruition of a portion of her good things to the sinner no doubt she was not anxious that the offer should be accepted but not the less was it made graciouslyas she felt herself in answer to this she had thrown back upon her the only hard word she had ever spoken to the girl you wouldnt be told anything of the kind but you neednt come if you dont like it  then i dont said ayala nodding her head  but i did think that after all that has passed and when i am trying to be kind to you you would have made yourself more pleasant to me i can only tell your uncle that you say you wont  give my love to my uncle and tell him that i am much obliged to him and that i know how good he is but i cantbecause of tom  tom is too good for you exclaimed aunt emmeline who could not bear to have her son depreciated even by the girl whom she did not wish to marry him  i didnt say he wasnt said ayala bursting into tears the archbishop of canterbury would be too good for me but i dont want to marry him then she got up and ran out of the room in order that she might weep over her troubles in the privacy of her own chamber she was thoroughly convinced that she was being illused no one had a right to tell her that any man was too good for her unless she herself should make pretensions to the man it was an insult to her even to connect her name with that of any man unless she had done something to connect it in her own estimation her cousin tom was infinitely beneath herworlds beneath hera denizen of an altogether inferior race such as the beast was to the beauty not that ayala had ever boasted to herself of her own face or form it was not in that respect that she likened herself to the beauty when she thought of tom as the beast her assumed superiority existed in certain intellectual or rather artistic and æsthetic giftscertain celestial gifts but as she had boasted of them to no one as she had never said that she and her cousin were poles asunder in their tastes poles asunder in their feelings poles asunder in their intelligence was it not very very cruel that she should be told first that she encouraged him and then that she was not good enough for him cinderella did not ask to have the prince for her husband when she had her own image of which no one could rob her and was content with that why should they treat her in this cruel way  i am afraid you are having a great deal of trouble with her said lady tringle to mrs dosett  no indeed of course she is romantic which is very objectionable  quite detestable said lady tringle  but she has been brought up like that so that it is not her fault now she endeavours to do her best  she is so upsetting  she is angry because her cousin persecutes her  persecutes her indeed tom is in a position to ask any girl to be his wife he can give her a home of her own and a good income she ought to be proud of the offer instead of speaking like that but nobody wants her to have him  he wants it i suppose  just taken by her baby facethats all it wont last and she neednt think so however ive done my best to be kind mrs dosett and theres an end of it if you please ill ring the bell for the carriage goodbye after that she swam out of the room and had herself carried back to queens gate     chapter xiv  frank houston   three or four days afterwards sir thomas asked whether ayala was to come to glenbogie she positively refused said his wife and was so rude and impertinent that i could not possibly have her now then sir thomas frowned and turned himself away and said not a word further on that occasion  there were many candidates for glenbogie on this occasion among others there was mr frank houston whose candidature was not pressed by himselfas could not well have been donebut was enforced by gertrude on his behalf it was now july gertrude and mr houston had seen something of each other in rome as may be remembered and since then had seen a good deal of each other in town gertrude was perfectly well aware that mr houston was impecunious but augusta had been allowed to have an impecunious lover and tom to throw himself at the feet of an impecunious love gertrude felt herself to be entitled to her £120000 did not for a moment doubt but that she would get it why shouldnt she give it to any young man she liked as long as he belonged to decent people mr houston wasnt a member of parliamentbut then he was young and goodlooking mr houston wasnt son to a lord but he was brother to a county squire and came of a family much older than that of those stupid boardotrade and traffick people and then frank houston was very presentable was not at all bald and was just the man for a girl to like as a husband it was dinned into her ears that houston had no income at alljust a few hundreds a year on which he never could keep himself out of debt but he was a generous man who would be more than contented with the income coming from £120000 he would not spunge upon the house at queens gate he would not make use of merle park and glenbogie he would have a house of his own for his old boots fourpercent would give them nearly £5000 a year gertrude knew all about it already they could have a nice house near queens gatesay somewhere about onslow gardens there would be quite enough for a carriage for three months upon a mountain in switzerland and three more among the art treasures of italy it was astonishing how completely gertrude had it all at her fingers ends when she discussed the matter with her mother mr houston was a man of no expensive tastes he didnt want to hunt he did shoot no doubt and perhaps a little shooting at glenbogie might be nice before they went to switzerland in that case two months on the top of the mountain would suffice but if he was not asked he would never condescend to demand an entry at glenbogie as a part of his wifes dower lady tringle was thus talked over though she did think that at least one of her daughters husbands ought to have an income of his own there was another point which gertrude put forward very frankly and which no doubt had weight with her mother mamma i mean to have him she said when lady tringle expressed a doubt  but papa  i mean to have him papa can scold of course if he pleases  but where would the income come from if papa did not give it  of course hell give it ive a right to it as much as augusta there was something in gertrudes face as she said this which made her mother think that she would have her way  but sir thomas had hitherto declined when frank houston after the manner of wouldbe sonsinlaw had applied to sir thomas sir thomas who already knew all about it asked after his income his prospects and his occupation fifty years ago young men used to encounter the misery of such questions and to live afterwards often in the enjoyment of the stern questioners money and daughters but there used in those days to be a bad quarter of an hour while the questions were being asked and not unfrequently a bad six months afterwards while the stern questioner was gradually undergoing a softening process under the hands of the females of the family but the young man of today has no bad quarter of an hour you are a mercantile old brick with money and a daughter i am a jeunesse doréegilded by blood and fashion though so utterly impecunious let us know your terms how much is it to be and then i can say whether we can afford to live upon it the old brick surrenders himself more readily and speedily to the latter than to the former mannerbut he hardly surrenders himself quite at once frank houston when inquired into declared at once without blushing that he had no income at all to speak of in reference to matrimonial life as to family prospects he had none his elder brother had four blooming boys and was likely to have more as for occupation he was very fond of painting very fond of art all round could shoot a little and was never in want of anything to do as long as he had a book but for the earning of money he had no turn whatever he was quite sure of himself that he could never earn a shilling but then on the other hand he was not extravagantwhich was almost as good as earning it was almost incredible but with his means limited as they were to a few hundreds he did not owe above a thousand poundsa fact which he thought would weigh much with sir thomas in regard to his daughters future happiness  sir thomas gave him a flat refusal i think that i may boast that your daughters happiness is in my charge said frank houston  then she must be unhappy said sir thomas houston shrugged his shoulders a fool like that has no right to be happy  there isnt another man in the world by whom i would allow her to be spoken of like that said houston  bother  i regard her as all that is perfect in woman and you must forgive me if i say that i shall not abandon my suit i may be allowed at any rate to call at the house  certainly not  that is a kind of thing that is never done nowadaysnever said houston shaking his head  i suppose my own house is my own  yours and lady tringles and your daughters no doubt at any rate sir thomas you will think of this again i am sure you will think of it again if you find that your daughters happiness depends upon it  i shall find nothing of the kind good morning  good morning sir thomas then mr houston bowing graciously left the little back room in lombard street and jumping into a cab had himself taken straight away to queens gate  papa is always like that said gertrude on that day mrs traffick with all the boots had taken herself away to the small house in mayfair and gertrude with her mother had the house to herself at the present moment lady tringle was elsewhere so that the young lady was alone with her lover  but he comes round i suppose  if he doesnt have too much to eatwhich disagrees with himhe does hes always better down at glenbogie because hes out of doors a good deal and then he can digest things  then take him down to glenbogie and let him digest it at once  of course we cant go till the 12th perhaps we shall start on the 10th because the 11th is sunday what will you do frank there had been a whisper of franks going to the tyrol in august there to join the mudbury docimers who were his faraway cousins imogene docimer was a young lady of marvellous beautynot possessed indeed of £120000of whom gertrude had heard and was already anxious that her frank should not go to the tyrol this year she was already aware that her frank hadjust an artists eye for feminine beauty in its various shapes and thought that in the present condition of things he would be better at glenbogie than in the tyrol  i am thinking of wandering away somewhereperhaps to the tyrol the mudbury docimers are there hes a pal of mine besides being a cousin mrs docimer is a very nice woman  and her sister  a lovely creature such a turn of the neck ive promised to make a study of her back head  come down to glenbogie said gertrude sternly  how can i do that when your governor wont let me enter his housedoor even in london  but youre here  wellyesi am here but he told me not i dont see how im to drive in at the gate at glenbogie with all my traps and ask to be shown my room i have cheek enough for a good deal my pet  i believe you have sircheek enough for anything but mamma must manage itmamma and me between us only keep yourself disengaged you wont go to the tyroleh then frank houston promised that he would not go to the tyrol as long as there was a chance open that he might be invited to glenbogie  i wont hear of it said sir thomas to his wife on that occasion his digestion had perhaps failed him a little he only wants to get my money  but gertrude has set her heart on it and nothing will turn her away  why cant she set her heart on some one who has got a decent income that man hasnt a shilling  nor yet has mr traffick  mr traffick has at any rate got an occupation were it to do again mr traffick would never see a shilling of my money by  those fellows who havent got a pound belonging to them think that theyre to live on the fat of the land out of the sweat of the brow of such men as me  what is your money for tom but for the children  i know what its for id sooner build a hospital than give it to an idle fellow like that houston when i asked him what he did he said he was fond of picters sir thomas would fall back from his usual modes of expression when he was a little excited  of course he hasnt been brought up to work but he is a gentleman and i do think he would make our girl happy  my money would make him happytill he had spent it  tie it up  you dont know what youre talking about how are you to prevent a man from spending his wifes income  at any rate if you have him down at glenbogie you can see what sort of a man he is you dont know him now  as much as i wish to  that isnt fair to the poor girl you neednt give your consent to a marriage because he comes to glenbogie you have only to say that you wont give the money and then it must be off they cant take the money from you his digestion could not have been very bad for he allowed himself to be persuaded that houston should be asked to glenbogie for ten days this was the letter of invitation      my dear mr houston     we shall start for glenbogie on the 10th of next month    sir thomas wishes you to join us on the 20th if you can    and stay till the end of the month we shall be a little    crowded at first and therefore cannot name an earlier    day     i am particularly to warn you that this means nothing more    than a simple invitation i know what passed between you    and sir thomas and he hasnt at all changed his mind i    think it right to tell you this if you like to speak to    him again when you are at glenbogie of course you can     very sincerely yours     emmeline tringle   at the same time or within a post of it he got another letter which was as follows      dearest f     papa you see hasnt cut up so very rough after all you    are to be allowed to come and help to slaughter grouse    which will be better than going to that stupid tyrol    if you want to draw somebodys back head you can do it    there isnt it a joke papas giving way like that all in    a moment he gets so fierce sometimes that we think hes    going to eat everybody then he has to come down and he    gets eaten worse than anybody else     of course as youre asked to glenbogie you can come    here as often as you like i shall ride on thursday and    friday i shall expect you exactly at six just under the    memorial you cant come home to dinner you know because    he might flare up but you can turn in at lunch every day    you please except saturday and sunday i intend to be so    jolly down at glenbogie you mustnt be shooting always     ever your own     g   frank houston as he read this threw himself back on the sofa and gave way to a soft sigh he knew he was doing his dutyjust as another man does who goes forth from his pleasant home to earn his bread and win his fortune in some dry comfortless climate far from the delights to which he has been always accustomed he must do his duty he could not live always adding a hundred or two of debt to the burden already round his neck he must do his duty as he thought of this he praised himself mightily how beautiful was his faraway cousin imogene docimer as she would twist her head round so as to show the turn of her neck how delightful it would be to talk love to imogene as to marrying imogene who hadnt quite so many hundreds as himself that he knew to be impossible as for marriage he wasnt quite sure that he wanted to marry any one marriage to his thinking was a sort of grind at the best a man would have to get up and go to bed with some regularity his wife might want him to come down in a frock coat to breakfast his wife would certainly object to his drawing the back heads of other young women then he thought of the provocation he had received to draw gertrudes back head gertrude hadnt got any turn of a neck to speak of gertrude was a stout healthy girl and having £120000 was entitled to such a husband as himself if he waited longer he might be driven to worse before he found the money which was so essentially necessary he was grateful to gertrude for not being worse and was determined to treat her well but as for love romance poetry artall that must for the future be out of the question of course there would now be no difficulty with sir thomas and therefore he must at once make up his mind he decided that morning with many soft regrets that he would go to glenbogie and let those dreams of wanderings in the mountains of the tyrol pass away from him dear dearest imogene he could have loved imogene dearly had fates been more propitious then he got up and shook himself made his resolution like a man ate a large allowance of curried salmon for his breakfastand then wrote the following letter duty first he said to himself as he sat down to the table like a hero      letter no 1     dear lady tringle     so many thanks nothing could suit my book so well as a    few days at glenbogie just at the end of august i will be    there like a book on the 20th of course i understand    all that you say fathers cant be expected to yield all    at once especially when suitors havent got very much of    their own i shouldnt have dared to ask hadnt i known    myself to be a most moderate man of course i shall ask    again if you will help me no doubt i shall succeed i    really do think that i am the man to make gertrude happy     yours dear lady tringle ever so much     f houston      letter no 2     my own one     your governor is a brick of course glenbogie will be    better than the tyrol as you are to be there not but    what the tyrol is a very jolly place and well go and see    it together some day ask tom to let me know whether one    can wear heavy boots in the glenbogie mountains they are    much the best for the heather but i have shot generally    in yorkshire and there they are too hot what number does    he shoot with generally i fancy the birds are wilder with    you than with us     as for riding i dont dare to sit upon a horse this    weather nobody but a woman can stand it indeed now i    think of it i sold my horse last week to pay the fellow    i buy paints from ive got the saddle and bridle and if    i stick them up upon a rail under the trees it would be    better than any horse while the thermometer is near 80    all the ladies could come round and talk to one so nicely     i hate lunch because it makes me red in the face and    nobody will give me my breakfast before eleven at the    earliest but ill come in about three as often as you    like to have me i think i perhaps shall run over to the    tyrol after glenbogie a man must go somewhere when he has    been turned out in that fashion there are so many babies    at buncombe hall   buncombe hall is the family seat of the houstons      and i dont like to see my own fate typified before the    time     can i do anything for you except riding or eating    lunchwhich are simply feminine exercises always your    own     frank      letter no 3     dear cousin im     how pleasant it is that a little strain of thin blood    should make the use of that pretty name allowable what    a stupid world it is when the people who like each other    best cannot get together because of proprieties and    marriages and such balderdash as we call love i do not    in the least want to be in love with youbut i do want    to sit near you and listen to you and look at you and    to know that the whole air around is impregnated by the    mysterious odour of your presence when one is thoroughly    satisfied with a woman there comes a scent as of sweet    flowers which does not reach the senses of those whose    feelings are not so awakened     and now for my news i suppose that g t will in a    tremendously short period become mistress f h a long    day my lord but if you are to be hung better be hung    at once père tringle has not consentedhas done just    the reversehas turned me out of his house morally    that is out of his london house he asked of my house    and my home as they did of allanadale        queens gate and glenbogie stand fair on the hill       my home quoth bold houston shows gallanter still       tis the garret up three pair     then he told me roughly to get me gone but i had laughed    on the lass with my bonny black eye so the next day i    got an invite to glenbogie and at the appropriate time in    august        shell go to the mountains to hear a love tale       and the youth     it will be told by is to be your poor unfortunate coz    frank houston whos going to whimper havent i known    all along what was to come it has not been my lot in    life to see a flower and pick it because i love it but    a good head of cabbage when youre hungry is wholesome    foodyour loving cousin but not loving as he oughtnt    to love     frank houston     i shall still make a dash for the tyrol when this episode    at glenbogie is over     chapter xv  ayala with her friends   some few days after lady tringle had been at kingsbury crescent two visitors who knew little or nothing of each other came to see ayala one was a lady and the other a gentleman and the lady came first the gentleman however arrived before the lady had gone mrs dosett was present while the lady remained but when the gentleman came she was invited to leave him alone with her nieceas shall be told  the lady was the marchesa baldoni can the reader go so far back as to remember the marchesa baldoni it was she who rather instigated ayala to be naughty to the tringles in rome and would have ayala at her parties when she did not want the tringles the marchesa was herself an englishwoman though she had lived at rome all her life and had married an italian nobleman she was now in london for a few weeks and still bore in mind her friendship for ayala and a certain promise she had once made her in rome lady tringle actuated by augusta who at the moment was very angry with everybody including her own lover had quarrelled with the marchesa the marchesa had then told ayala that she ayala must stay with her auntmust in fact cease for the time to come to the marchesas apartments because of the quarrel but that a time would come in which they might again be friends soon afterwards the marchesa had heard that the tringle family had discarded poor ayalathat her own quarrel had in fact extended itself to ayala and that ayala had been shunted off to a poor relation far away from all the wealth and luxuries which she had been allowed to enjoy for so short a time therefore soon after her arrival in london the marchesa had made herself acquainted with the address of the dosetts and now was in kingsbury crescent in fulfilment of her promise made at rome  so now you have got our friend ayala said the marchesa with a smile to mrs dosett  yes we have her now there has been a change her sister lucy has gone to my husbands sister lady tringle  the marchesa made a pleasant little bow at each word she seemed to mrs dosett to be very gorgeously dressed she was thoroughly well dressed and looked like a marchesaor perhaps even like a marchioness she was a tall handsome woman with a smile perhaps a little too continuously sweet but with a look conscious of her own position behind it she had seen in a moment of what nature was ayala how charming how attractive how pretty how cleverhow completely the very opposite of the tringles ayala learned italian so readily that she could talk it almost at once she could sing and play and draw the marchesa had been quite willing that her own daughter nina should find a friend in ayala then had come the quarrel now she was quite willing to renew the friendship though ayalas position was so sadly altered mrs dosett was almost frightened as the grand lady sat holding ayalas hand and patting it we used to know her so well in romedid we not ayala  you were very kind to me  nina couldnt come because her father would make her go with him to the pictures but now my dear you must come to us just for a little time we have a furnished house in brook street near the park till the end of the season and we have one small spare room which will just do for you i hope you will let her come to us for we really are old friends said the marchesa turning to mrs dosett  mrs dosett looked black there are people who always look black when such applications are made to themwho look black at any allusions to pleasures and then there came across her mind serious thoughts as to flowers and ribbonsand then more serious thoughts as to boots dresses and hats ayala no doubt had come there less than six months since with good store of everything but mrs dosett knew that such a house as would be that of this lady would require a girl to show herself with the newest sheen on everything and ayala knew it too the marchesa turned from the blackness of mrs dosetts face with her sweetest smile to ayala cant we manage it said the marchesa  i dont think we can said ayala with a deep sigh  and why not  ayala looked furtively round to her aunt i suppose i may tell aunt margaret she said  you may tell everything my dear said mrs dosett  because we are poor said ayala  what does that matter said the marchesa brightening up we want you because you are rich in good gifts and pretty ways  but i cant get new frocks now as i used to do in rome aunt emmeline was cruel to me and said things which i could not bear but they let me have everything uncle reginald gives me all that he has and i am much happier here but we cannot go out and buy thingscan we aunt margaret  no my dear we cannot  it does not signify said the marchesa we are quite quiet and what you have got will do very well frocks the frocks you had in rome are good enough for london i wont have a word of all that nina has set her heart upon it and so has my husband and so have i mrs dosett when we are at home we are the most homely people in the world we think nothing of dressing not to come and see your old friends because of your frocks we shall send for you the day after tomorrow dont you know mrs dosett it will do her good to be with her young friend for a few days mrs dosett had not succeeded in her remonstrances when sir thomas tringle was shown into the room and then the marchesa took her leave for sir thomas tringle was the other visitor who came on that morning to see ayala  if you wouldnt mind mrs dosett said sir thomas before he sat down i should like to see ayala alone mrs dosett had not a word to say against such a request and at once took her leave  my dear he began coming and sitting opposite to ayala with his knees almost touching her i have got something very particular to say to you ayala was at once much frightened her uncle had never before spoken to her in this wayhad never in truth said a word to her seriously he had always been kind to her making her presents and allowing himself to be kissed graciously morning and evening he had never scolded her and better than all had never said a word to her one way or the other about tom she had always liked her uncle because he had never caused her trouble when all the others in his house had been troublesome to her but now she was afraid of him he did not frown but he looked very seriously at her as he might look perhaps when he was counting out all his millions in lombard street i hope you think that i have always wished to be kind to you ayala  i am sure you have uncle tom  when you had come to us i always wished you to stay i dont like changes of this sort i suppose you didnt hit it off with augusta but shes gone now  aunt emmeline said something that accusation as to encouragement so rankled in her heart that when she looked back at her grievances among the tringles that always loomed the largest  i dont want to hear anything about it said sir thomas let bygones be bygones your aunt i am sure never meant unkindly by you now i want you to listen to me  i will uncle tom  listen to me to the end like a good girl  i will  your cousin tom ayala gave a visible shudder and uttered an audible groan but as yet she did not say a word sir thomas having seen the shudder and heard the groan did frown as he began again your cousin tom is most truly attached to you  why wont he leave me alone then  ayala you promised to listen to me without speaking  i will uncle tom only  listen to me and then i will hear anything you have to say  i will said ayala screwing up her lips so that no words should come out of them let the provocation be what it might  sir thomas began again your cousin tom is most truly attached to you for some time i and his mother disapproved of this we thought you were both too young and there were other reasons which i need not now mention but when i came to see how thoroughly he was in earnest how he put his heart into it how the very fact that he loved you had made a man of him then how the fact that you would not return his love unmanned himwhen i saw all that i gave my permission here he paused almost as though expecting a word but ayala gave an additional turn to the screw on her lips and remained quite silent yes we gave our permissioni and your aunt of course our sons happiness is all in all to us and i do believe that you are so good that you would make him a good wife  but  listen till i have done ayala then there was another squeeze i suppose you are what they call romantic romance my dear wont buy bread and butter tom is a very good young man and he loves you most dearly if you will consent to be his i will make a rich man of him he will then be a respectable man of business and will become a partner in the house you and he can choose a place to live in almost where you please you can have your own establishment and your carriage and will be able to do a deal of good you will make him happy and you will be my dear child i have come here to tell you that i will make you welcome into the family and to promise that i will do everything i can to make you happy now you may say what you like but ayala think a little before you speak  ayala thought a littlenot as to what she should say but as to the words in which she might say it she was conscious that a great compliment was paid to her and there was a certain pride in her heart as she thought that this invitation into the family had come to her after that ignominious accusation of encouragement had been made augusta had snubbed her about tom and her aunt but now she was asked to come among them and be one of them with full observances she was aware of all this and aware also that such treatment required from her a gracious return but not on that account could she give herself to the beast not on that account could she be untrue to her image not on that account could she rob her bosom of that idea of love which was seated there not on that account could she look upon the marriage proposed to her with aught but a shuddering abhorrence she sat silent for a minute or two while her heavy eyes were fixed upon his then falling on her knees before him she put up her little hands to pray to him uncle tom i cant she said and then the tears came running down her cheeks  why cant you ayala why cannot you be sensible as other girls are said sir thomas lifting her up and putting her on his knee  i cant she said i dont know how to tell you  do you love some other man  no no no to uncle tom at any rate she need say nothing of the image  then why is it  because i cant i dont know what to say but i cant i know how very very very good you are  i would love you as my daughter  but i cant uncle tom pray tell him and make him get somebody else he would be quite happy if he could get somebody else  it is you that he loves  but whats the use of it when i cant dear dear uncle tom do have it all settled for me nothing on earth could ever make me do it i should die if i were to try  thats nonsense  i do so want not to make you angry uncle tom and i do so wish he would be happy with someone else nobody ought to be made to marry unless they like itought they  there is no talk of making said sir thomas frowning  at any rate i cant said ayala releasing herself from her uncles embrace  it was in vain that even after this he continued his request begging her to come down to glenbogie so that she might make herself used to tom and his ways if she could only once more he thought be introduced to the luxuries of a rich house then she would give way but she would not go to glenbogie she would not go to merle park she would not consent to see tom anywhere her uncle told her that she was romantic and foolish endeavouring to explain to her over and over again that the good things of the world were too good to be thrown away for a dream at last there was a touch of dignity in the final repetition of her refusal i am sorry to make you angry but i cant uncle tom then he frowned with all his power of frowning and taking his hat left the room and the house almost without a word  at the time fixed the marchesas carriage came and ayala with her boxes was taken away to brook street uncle reginald had offered to do something for her in the way of buying a frock but this she refused declaring that she would not allow herself to become an expense merely because her friends in rome had been kind to her so she had packed up the best of what she had and started with her heart in her mouth fearing the grandeur of the marchesas house on her arrival she was received by nina who at once threw herself into all her old intimacy oh ayala she said this is so nice to have you again i have been looking forward to this ever since we left rome  yes said ayala it is nice  but why did you tell mamma you would not come what nonsense to talk to her about frocks why not come and tell me you used to have everything at rome much more than i had  then ayala began to explain the great difference between uncle tom and uncle reginaldhow uncle tom had so many thousands that nobody could count them how uncle reginald was so shorn in his hundreds that there was hardly enough to supply the necessaries of life you see she said when papa died lucy and i were divided i got the rich uncle and lucy got the poor one but i made myself disagreeable and didnt suit and so we have been changed  but why did you make yourself disagreeable said nina opening her eyes i remember when we were at rome your cousin augusta was always quarrelling with you i never quite knew what it was all about  it wasnt only that said ayala whispering  did you do anything very bad  then it occurred to ayala that she might tell the whole story to her friend and she told it she explained the nature of that great persecution as to tom and that was the real reason why we were changed said ayala as she completed her story  i remember seeing the young man said nina  he is such a lout  but was he very much in love asked nina  well i dont know i suppose he was after his way i dont think louts like that can be very much in love to signify young men when they look like that would do with one girl as well as another  i dont see that at all said nina  i am sure he would if hed only try at any rate whats the good of his going on they cant make a girl marry unless she chooses  wont he be rich  awfully rich said ayala  then i should think about it again said the young lady from rome  never said ayala with an impressive whisper i will never think about it again if he were made of diamonds i would not think about it again  and is that why you were changed said nina  well yes no it is very hard to explain aunt emmeline told me thatthat i encouraged him i thought i should have rushed out of the house when she said that then i had to be changed i dont know whether they could forgive me but i could not forgive her  and how is it now  it is different now said ayala softly only that it cant make any real difference  how different  theyd let me come if i would i suppose but i shall never never go to them any more  i suppose you wont tell me everything said nina after a pause  what everything  you wont be angry if i ask  no i will not be angry  i suppose there is someone else you really care for  there is no one said ayala escaping a little from her friends embrace  then why should you be so determined against that poor young man  because he is a lout and a beast said ayala jumping up i wonder you should ask meas if that had anything to do with it would you fall in love with a lout because you had no one else i would rather live for ever all alone even in kingsbury crescent than have to think of becoming the wife of my cousin tom at this nina shrugged her shoulders showing that her education in italy had been less romantic than that accorded to ayala in london     chapter xvi  jonathan stubbs   but though nina differed somewhat from ayala as to their ideas as to life in general they were close friends and everything was done both by the marchesa and by her daughter to make ayala happy there was not very much of going into grand society and that difficulty about the dresses solved itself as do other difficulties there came a few presents with entreaties from ayala that presents of that kind might not be made but the presents were of course accepted and our girl was as prettily arrayed if not as richly as the best around her at first there was an evening at the opera and then a theatrediversions which are easy ayala after her six dull months in kingsbury crescent found herself well pleased to be taken to easy amusements the carriage in the park was delightful to her and delightful a visit which was made to her by lucy for the tringle carriage could be spared for a visit in brook street even though there was still a remembrance in the bosom of aunt emmeline of the evil things which had been done by the marchesa in rome then there came a dancewhich was not so easy the marchesa and nina were going to a dance at lady putneys and arrangements were made that ayala should be taken ayala begged that there might be no arrangements declared that she would be quite happy to see nina go forth in her finery but the marchesa was a woman who always had her way and ayala was taken to lady putneys dance without a suspicion on the part of any who saw her that her ballroom apparatus was not all that it ought to be  ayala when she entered the room was certainly a little bashful when in rome even in the old days at the bijou when she did not consider herself to be quite out she had not been at all bashful she had been able to enjoy herself entirely being very fond of dancing conscious that she could dance well and always having plenty to say for herself but now there had settled upon her something of the tedium something of the silence of kingsbury crescent and she almost felt that she would not know how to behave herself if she were asked to stand up and dance before all lady putneys world in her first attempt she certainly was not successful an elderly gentleman was brought up to hera gentleman whom she afterwards declared to be a hundred and who was in truth over forty and with him she manoeuvred gently through a quadrille he asked her two or three questions to which she was able to answer only in monosyllables then he ceased his questions and the manoeuvres were carried on in perfect silence poor ayala did not attribute any blame to the man it was all because she had been six months in kingsbury crescent of course this aged gentleman if he wanted to dance would have a partner chosen for him out of kingsbury crescent conversation was not to be expected from a gentleman who was made to stand up with kingsbury crescent any powers of talking that had ever belonged to herself had of course evaporated amidst the gloom of kingsbury crescent after this she was returned speedily to the wings of the marchesa and during the next dance sat in undisturbed peace then suddenly when the marchesa had for a moment left her and when nina had just been taken away to join a set she saw the man of silence coming to her from a distance with an evident intention of asking her to stand up again it was in his eye in his toe as he came bowing forward he had evidently learned to suppose that they two outcasts might lessen their miseries by joining them together she was to dance with him because no one else would ask her she had plucked up her spirit and resolved that desolate as she might be she would not descend so far as that when in a moment another gentleman sprang in as it were between her and her enemy and addressed her with free and easy speech as though he had known her all her life you are ayala dormer i am sure said he she looked up into his face and nodded her head at him in her own peculiar way she was quite sure that she had never set her eyes on him before he was so ugly that she could not have forgotten him so at least she told herself he was very very ugly but his voice was very pleasant i knew you were and i am jonathan stubbs so now we are introduced and you are to come and dance with me  she had heard the name of jonathan stubbs she was sure of that although she could not at the moment join any facts with the name but i dont know you she said hesitating though he was so ugly he could not but be better than that ancient dancer whom she saw standing at a distance looking like a dog that has been deprived of his bone  yes you do said jonathan stubbs and if youll come and dance ill tell you about it the marchesa told me to take you  did she said ayala getting up and putting her little hand upon his arm  ill go and fetch her if you like only shes a long way off and we shall lose our place shes my aunt  oh said ayala quite satisfiedremembering now that she had heard her friend nina boast of a colonel cousin who was supposed to be the youngest colonel in the british army who had done some wonderful thingtaken a new province in india or marched across africa or defended the turksor perhaps conquered them she knew that he was very bravebut why was he so very ugly his hair was ruby red and very short and he had a thick red beard not silky but bristly with each bristle almost a daggerand his mouth was enormous his eyes were very bright and there was a smile about him partly of fun partly of good humour but his mouth and then that bristling beard ayala was half inclined to like him because he was so completely master of himself so unlike the unhappy ancient gentleman who was still hovering at a distance but why was he so ugly and why was he called jonathan stubbs  there now he said we cant get in at any of the sets thats your fault  no it isnt said ayala  yes it is you wouldnt stand up till you had heard all about me  i dont know anything about you now  then come and walk about and ill tell you then we shall be ready for a waltz do you waltz well  do you  ill back myself against any englishman frenchman german or italian for a large sum of money i cant come quite up to the poles the fact is the honester the man is the worse he always dances yes i see what you mean i must be a rogue perhaps i amperhaps im only an exception i knew your father  papa  yes i did he was down at stalham with the alburys once that was five years ago and he told me he had a daughter named ayala i didnt quite believe him  why not  it is such an outoftheway name  its as good as jonathan at any rate and ayala again nodded her head  theres a prejudice about jonathan as there is about jacob and jonah i never could quite tell why i was going to marry a girl once with a hundred thousand pounds and she wouldnt have me at last because she couldnt bring her lips to say jonathan do you think she was right  did she love you said ayala looking up into his face  awfully but she couldnt bear the name so within three months she gave herself and all her money to mr montgomery talbot de montpellier he got drunk and threw her out of the window before a month was over thats what comes of going in for sweet names  i dont believe a word of it said ayala  very well didnt septimus traffick marry your cousin  of course he did about a month ago  he is another friend of mine why didnt you go to your cousins marriage  there were reasons said ayala  i know all about it said the colonel you quarreled with augusta down in scotland and you dont like poor traffick because he has got a bald head  i believe youre a conjuror said ayala  and then your cousin was jealous because you went to the top of st peters and because you would walk with mr traffick on the pincian i was in rome and saw all about it  i wont have anything more to do with you said ayala  and then you quarreled with one set of uncles and aunts and now you live with another  your aunt told you that  and i know your cousin tom tringle  you know tom asked ayala  yes he was ever so good to me in rome about a horse i like tom tringle in spite of his chains dont you think upon the whole if that young lady had put up with jonathan she would have done better than marry montpellier but now theyre going to waltz come along  thereupon ayala got up and danced with him for the next ten minutes again and again before the evening was over she danced with him and although in the course of the night many other partners had offered themselves and many had been accepted she felt that colonel jonathan stubbs had certainly been the partner of the evening why should he be so hideously ugly said ayala to herself as she wished him good night before she left the room with the marchesa and nina  what do you think of my nephew said the marchesa when they were in the carriage together  do tell us what you think of jonathan asked nina  i thought he was very goodnatured  and very handsome  nina dont be foolish jonathan is one of the most rising officers in the british service and luckily he can be that without being beautiful to look at  i declare said nina sometimes when he is talking i think him perfectly lovely the fire comes out of his eyes and he rubs his old red hairs about till they sparkle then he shines all over like a carbuncle and every word he says makes me die of laughter  i laughed too said ayala  but you didnt think him beautiful said nina  no i did not said ayala i liked him very much but i thought him very ugly was it true about the young lady who married mr montgomery de montpellier and was thrown out of window a week afterwards  there is one other thing i must tell you about jonathan said nina you must not believe a word that he says  that i deny said the marchesa but here we are and now girls get out of the carriage and go up to bed at once  ayala before she went to sleep and again when she woke in the morning thought a great deal about her new friend as to shining like a carbuncleperhaps he did but that was not her idea of manly beauty and hair ought not to sparkle she was sure that colonel stubbs was very very ugly she was almost disposed to think that he was the ugliest man she had ever seen he certainly was a great deal worse than her cousin tom who after all was not particularly ugly but nevertheless she would very much rather dance with colonel stubbs she was sure of that even without reference to toms objectionable lovemaking upon the whole she liked dancing with colonel stubbs ugly as he was indeed she liked him very much she had spent a very pleasant evening because he had been there it all depends upon whether any one has anything to say that was the determination to which she came when she endeavoured to explain to herself how it had come to pass that she had liked dancing with anybody so very hideous the angel of light would of course have plenty to say for himself and would be something altogether different in appearance he would be handsomeor rather intensely interesting and his talk would be of other things he would not say of himself that he danced as well as though he were a rogue or declare that a lady had been thrown out of a window the week after she was married nothing could be more unlike an angel of light than colonel stubbsunless perhaps it were tom tringle colonel stubbs however was completely unangelicso much so that the marvel was that he should yet be so pleasant she had no horror of colonel stubbs at all she would go anywhere with colonel stubbs and feel herself to be quite safe she hoped she might meet him again very often he was as it were the genius of comedy without a touch of which life would be very dull but the angel of light must have something tragic in his compositionmust verge at any rate on tragedy ayala did not know that beautiful description of a sallow sublime sort of wertherfaced man but i fear that in creating her angel of light she drew a picture in her imagination of a man of that kind  days went on till the last day of ayalas visit had come and it was necessary that she should go back to kingsbury crescent it was now august and everybody was leaving town the marchesa and nina were going to their relations the alburys at stalham and could not of course take ayala with them the dosetts would remain in town for another month with a distant hope of being able to run down to pegwell bay for a fortnight in september but even that had not yet been promised colonel stubbs had been more than once at the house in brook street and ayala had come to know him almost as she might some great tame dog it was now the afternoon of the last day and she was sorry because she would not be able to see him again she was to be taken to the theatre that nightand then to kingsbury crescent and the realms of lethe early on the following morning  it was very hot and they were sitting with the shutters nearly closed having resolved not to go out in order that they might be ready for the theatrewhen the door was opened and tom tringle was announced tom tringle had come to call on his cousin  lady baldoni he said i hope you wont think me intrusive but i thought id come and see my cousin once whilst she is staying here the marchesa bowed and assured him that he was very welcome its tremendously hot said tom  very hot indeed said the marchesa  i dont think its ever so hot as this in rome said nina fanning herself  i find it quite impossible to walk a yard said tom and therefore ive hired a hansom cab all to myself the man goes home and changes his horse regularly when i go to dinner then he comes for me at ten and sticks to me till i go to bed i call that a very good plan nina asked him why he didnt drive the cab himself that would be a grind said he because it would be so hot all day and there might be rain at night have you read what my brotherinlaw traffick said in the house last night my lady  im afraid i passed it over said the marchesa indeed i am not very good at the debates  they are dull said tom but when its ones brotherinlaw one does like to look at it i thought he made that very clear about the malt tax the marchesa smiled and bowed  what ismalt tax asked nina  well it means beer said tom the question is whether the poor man pays it who drinks the beer or the farmer who grows the malt it is very interesting when you come to think of it  but i fear i never have come to think of it said the marchesa  during all this time ayala never said a word but sat looking at her cousin and remembering how much better colonel jonathan stubbs would have talked if he had been there then after a pause tom got up and took his leave having to content himself with simply squeezing his cousins hand as he left the room  he is a lout said ayala as soon as she knew that the door was closed behind him  i dont see anything loutish at all said the marchesa  hes just like most other young men said nina  hes not at all like colonel stubbs said ayala  then the marchesa preached a little sermon colonel stubbs my dear she said happens to have been thrown a good deal about the world and has thus been able to pick up that easy mode of talking which young ladies like perhaps because it means nothing your cousin is a man of business and will probably have amassed a large fortune when my poor nephew will be a donothing old general on halfpay his chatter will not then have availed him quite so much as your cousins habits of business  mamma said nina jonathan will have money of his own  never mind my dear i do not like to hear a young man called a lout because hes more like a man of business than a man of pleasure ayala felt herself to be snubbed but was not a whit the less sure that tom was a lout and the colonel an agreeable partner to dance with but at the same time she remembered that neither the one nor the other was to be spoken of in the same breath or thought of in the same spirit as the angel of light  when they were dressed and just going to dinner the ugly man with the red head was announced and declared his purpose of going with them to the theatre ive been to the office said he and got a stall next to yours and have managed it all it now only remains that you should give me some dinner and a seat in the carriage of course he was told that there was no dinner sufficient for a man to eat but he put up with a feminine repast and spent the whole of the evening sitting next to his aunt on a back tier while the two girls were placed in front in this way leaning forward with his ugly head between them he acted as a running chorus to the play during the whole performance ayala thoroughly enjoyed herself and thought that in all her experience no play shed seen had ever been so delightful on their return home the two girls were both told to go to bed in the marchesas goodnatured authoritative tone but nevertheless ayala did manage to say a word before she finally adjusted herself on her pillow it is all very well nina for your mamma to say that a young man of business is the best but i do know a lout when i see him and i am quite sure that my cousin tom is a lout and that colonel jonathan is not  i believe you are falling in love with colonel jonathan said nina  i should as soon think of falling in love with a wild bearbut hes not a lout and therefore i like him     chapter xvii  lucy is very firm   it was just before the tringles had returned from rome during the winter that lucy dormer had met mr hamel in kensington gardens for the second time had walked there with him perhaps for halfanhour and had then returned home with a conviction that she had done a wicked thing but she had other convictions also which were perhaps stronger now that we have met am i to lose you again he had said what could he mean by losing except that she was the one thing which he desired to find but she had not seen him since or heard a word of his whereabouts although as she so well remembered she had given him an address at her aunt emmelinesnot knowing then that it would be her fate to become a resident in her aunt emmelines house she had told him that ayala would live there and that perhaps she might sometimes be found visiting ayala now she was herself filling ayalas place and might so easily have been found but she knew nothing of the man who had once asked whether he was to lose her again  her own feelings about isadore hamel were clear enough to herself now ayala in her hot humour had asked her whether she could give her hand and her heart to such a one as their cousin tom and she had found herself constrained to say that she could not do so because she was not freenot quite freeto do as she pleased with her hand and her heart she had striven hard not to acknowledge anything even to ayalaeven to herself but the words had been forced from her and now she was conscious terribly conscious that the words were true there could be no one else now whether tom or anotherwhether such as tom or such as any other it was just that little word that had won her am i to lose you again a girl loves most often because she is lovednot from choice on her part she is won by the flattery of the mans desire am i to lose you again he had seemed to throw all his soul into his voice and into his eyes as he had asked the question a sudden thrill had filled her and for his sakefor his sakeshe had hoped that she might not be lost to him now she began to fear that he was lost to her  something has been told of the relations between isadore hamel and his father they were both sculptors the father having become a successful artist the father was liberal but he was essentially autocratic if he supplied to his son the means of livingand he was willing to supply the means of very comfortable lifehe expected that his son should live to some extent in accordance with his fancies the father wished his son to live in rome and to live after the manner of romans isadore would prefer to live in london and after the manner of londoners for a time he had been allowed to do so and had achieved a moderate success but a young artist may achieve a moderate success with a pecuniary result that shall be almost less than moderate after a while the sculptor in rome had told his son that if he intended to remain in london he ought to do so on the independent proceeds of his own profession isadore if he would return to rome would be made welcome to join his affairs to those of his father in other words he was to be turned adrift if he remained in london and petted with every luxury if he would consent to follow his art in italy but in rome the father lived after a fashion which was distasteful to the son old mr hamel had repudiated all conventions conventions are apt to go very quickly one after another when the first has been thrown aside the man who ceases to dress for dinner soon finds it to be a trouble to wash his hands a house is a bore calling is a bore church is a great bore a family is a bore a wife is an unendurable bore all laws are bores except those by which inferiors can be constrained to do their work mr hamel had got rid of a great many bores and had a strong opinion that bores prevailed more mightily in london than in rome isadore was not a bore to him he was always willing to have isadore near to him but if isadore chose to enter the conventional mode of life he must do it at his own expense it may be said at once that isadores present view of life was very much influenced by lucy dormer and by a feeling that she certainly was conventional a small house very prettily furnished somewhat near the fulham road or perhaps verging a little towards south kensington with two maids and perhaps an additional one as nurse in the process of some months with a pleasant english breakfast and a pleasant english teapot in the evening afforded certainly a very conventional aspect of life but at the present moment it was his aspect and therefore he could not go upon all fours with his father in this state of things there had during the last twelvemonth been more than one journey made to rome and back ayala had seen him at rome and lady tringle remembering that the man had been intimate with her brother was afraid of him they had made inquiry about him and had fully resolved that he should not be allowed into the house if he came after ayala he had no motherto speak of and he had little brothers and sisters who also had no motherto speak of mr hamel the father entertained friends on sunday with the express object of playing cards that a papist should do so was to be bornebut mr hamel was not a papist and therefore would certainly be  all this and much more had been learned at rome and therefore lucy though she herself never mentioned mr hamels name in queens gate heard evil things said of the man who was so dear to her  it was the custom of her life to be driven out every day with her aunt and gertrude not to be taken two or three times round the park would be to lady tringle to rob her of the best appreciated of all those gifts of fortune which had come to her by reason of the bankers wealth it was a stern lawand as stern a law that lucy should accompany her gertrude as being an absolute daughter of the house and as having an almost acknowledged lover of her own was allowed some choice but for lucy there was no alternative why should she not go and be driven two days before they left town she was being driven while her aunt was sitting almost in a slumber beside her when suddenly a young man leaning over the railings took off his hat so close to lucy that she could almost have put out her hand to him he was standing there all alone and seemed simply to be watching the carriages as they passed she felt that she blushed as she bowed to him and saw also that the colour had risen to his face then she turned gently round to her aunt whom she hoped to find still sleeping but aunt emmeline could slumber with one eye open who was that young man my dear said aunt emmeline  it was mr hamel  mr isadore hamel said aunt emmeline horrified is that the young man at rome who has got the horrible father  i do not know his father said lucy but he does live at rome  of course its the mr hamel i mean he scraped some acquaintance with ayala but i would not have it for a moment he is not at all the sort of person any young girl ought to know his father is a horrible man i hope he is no friend of yours lucy  he is a friend of mine lucy said this in a tone of voice which was very seldom heard from her but which when heard was evidence that beneath the softness of her general manner there lay a will of her own  then my dear i hope that such friendship may be discontinued as long as you remain with us  he was a friend of papas said lucy  thats all very well i suppose artists must know artists even though they are disreputable  mr hamel is not disreputable  aunt emmeline as she heard this could almost fancy that she was renewing one of her difficulties with ayala my dear she saidand she intended to be very impressive as she spokein a matter such as this i must beg you to be guided by me you must acknowledge that i know the world better than you do mr hamel is not a fit person to be acquainted with a young lady who occupies the place of my daughter i am sure that will be sufficient then she leant back in the carriage and seemed again to slumber but she still had one eye open so that if mr hamel should appear again at any corner and venture to raise his hand she might be aware of the impropriety but on that day mr hamel did not appear again  lucy did not speak another word during the drive and on reaching the house went at once to her bedroom while she had been out with her aunt close to her and while it had been possible that the man she loved should appear again she had been unable to collect her thoughts or to make up her mind what she would do or say one thing simply was certain to her that if mr hamel should present himself again to her she would not desert him all that her aunt had said to her as to improprieties and the like had no effect at all upon her the man had been welcomed at her fathers house had been allowed there to be intimate with her and was now as she was well aware much dearer to her than any other human being not for all the aunt emmelines in the world would she regard him otherwise than as her dearest friend  when she was alone she discussed the matter with herself it was repugnant to her that there should be any secret on the subject between herself and her aunt after what had been saidmuch more that there should be any deceit mr hamel is not fit to be acquainted with a lady who occupies the position of my daughter it was thus that her aunt had spoken to this the proper answer seemed to beseemed at least to lucyin that case my dear aunt i cannot for a moment longer occupy the position of your daughter as i certainly am acquainted and shall remain acquainted with mr hamel but to such speech as this on her own part there were two impediments in the first place it would imply that mr hamel was her loverfor implying which mr hamel had given her no authority and then what should she immediately do when she had thus obstinately declared herself to be unfit for that daughters position which she was supposed now to occupy with all her firmness of determination she could not bring herself to tell her aunt that mr hamel was her lover not because it was not as yet true she would have been quite willing that her aunt should know the exact truth if the exact truth could be explained but how could she convey to such a one as aunt emmeline the meaning of those wordsam i to lose you again how could she make her aunt understand that she held herself to be absolutely bound as by a marriage vow by such words as thosewords in which there was no promise even had they come from some fitting suitor but which would be regarded by aunt emmeline as being simply impertinent coming as they did from such a one as isadore hamel it was quite out of the question to tell all that to aunt emmeline but yet it was necessary that something should be told she had been ordered to drop her acquaintance with isadore and it was essential that she should declare that she would do nothing of the kind she would not recognise such obedience as a duty on her part the friendship had been created by her father to whom her earlier obedience had been due it might be that refusing to render such obedience her aunt and her uncle might tell her that there could be no longer shelter for her in that house they could not cherish and foster a disobedient child if it must be so it must though there should be no home left to her in all the wide world she would not accept an order which should separate her from the man she loved she must simply tell her aunt that she could not drop mr hamels acquaintancebecause mr hamel was a friend  early on the next morning she did so are you aware said aunt emmeline with a severe face that he isillegitimate lucy blushed but made no answer is heis heengaged to you  no said lucy sharply  has he asked you to marry him  no said lucy  then what is it asked lady tringle in a tone which was intended to signify that as nothing of that kind had taken place such a friendship could be a matter of no consequence  he was papas friend  my dear what can that matter your poor papa has gone and you are in my charge and your uncles surely you cannot object to choose your friends as we should wish mr hamel is a gentleman of whom we do not approve you cannot have seen very much of him and it would be very easy for you should he bow to you again in the park to let him see that you do not like it  but i do like it said lucy with energy  lucy  i do like to see mr hamel and i feel almost sure that he will come and call here now that he has seen me last winter he asked me my address and i gave him this house  when you were living with your aunt dosett  yes i did aunt emmeline i thought aunt margaret would not like him to come to kingsbury crescent and as ayala was to be here i told him he might call at queens gate  then lady tringle was really angry it was not only that her house should have been selected for so improper a use but that lucy should have shown a fear and a respect for mrs dosett which had not been accorded to herself it was shocking to her pride that that should have appeared to be easy of achievement at queens gate which was too wicked to be attempted at kingsbury crescent and then the thing which had been done seemed in itself to her to be so horrible this girl when living under the care of her aunt had made an appointment with an improper young man at the house of another aunt any appointment made by a young lady with a young man must as she thought be wrong she began to be aghast at the very nature of the girl who could do such a thing and on reflecting that that girl was at present under her charge as an adopted daughter lucy she said very impressively there must be an end of this  there cannot be an end of it said lucy  do you mean to say that he is to come here to this house whether i and your uncle like it or not  he will come said lucy i am sure he will come now he has seen me he will come at once  why should he do that if he is not your lover  because said lucyand then she paused because it is very hard to tell you aunt emmeline  why should he come so quickly demanded aunt emmeline again  because though he has said nothing to me such as that you mean stammered out lucy determined to tell the whole truth i believe that he will  and you  if he did i should accept him  has he any means  i do not know  have you any  certainly not  and you would consent to be his wife after what ive told you  yes said lucy i should  then it must not be in this house that is all i will not have him here on any pretence whatsoever  i thought not aunt emmeline and therefore i have told you  do you mean that you will make an appointment with him elsewhere  certainly not i have not in fact ever made an appointment with him i do not know his address till yesterday i thought that he was in rome i never had a line from him in my life and of course have never written to him upon hearing all this lady tringle sat in silence not quite knowing how to carry on the conversation the condition of lucys mind was so strange to her that she felt herself to be incompetent to dictate she could only resolve that under no circumstances should the objectionable man be allowed into her house now aunt emmeline said lucy i have told you everything of course you have a right to order but i also have some right you told me i was to drop mr hamel but i cannot drop him if he comes in my way i certainly shall not drop him if he comes here i shall see him if i can if you and uncle tom choose to turn me out of course you can do so  i shall tell your uncle all about it said aunt emmeline angrily and then you will hear what he says and so the conversation was ended  at that moment sir thomas was of course in the city managing his millions and as lucy herself had suggested that mr hamel might not improbably call on that very day and as she was quite determined that mr hamel should not enter the doors of the house in queens gate it was necessary that steps should be taken at once some hours afterwards mr hamel did call and asked for miss dormer the door was opened by a wellappointed footman who with lugubrious facewith a face which spoke much more eloquently than his wordsdeclared that miss dormer was not at home in answer to further inquiries he went on to express an opinion that miss dormer never would be at homefrom all which it may be seen that aunt emmeline had taken strong measures to carry out her purpose hamel when he heard his fate thus plainly spoken from the mans mouth turned away not doubting its meaning he had seen lucys face in the park and had seen also lady tringles gesture after his greeting that lady tringle should not be disposed to receive him at her house was not matter of surprise to him  when lucy went to bed that night she did not doubt that mr hamel had called and that he had been turned away from the door     chapter xviii  down in scotland   when the time came all the tringles together with the honourable mrs traffick started for glenbogie aunt emmeline had told sir thomas all lucys sins but sir thomas had not made so much of them as his wife had expected it wouldnt be a bad thing to have a husband for lucy said sir thomas  but the man hasnt got a sixpence  he has a profession  i dont know that he makes anything and then think of his father he isillegitimate sir thomas seemed rather to sneer at this and if you knew the way the old man lives in rome he plays cards all sunday again sir thomas sneered sir thomas was fairly submissive to the conventionalities himself but did not think that they ought to stand in the way of a provision for a young lady who had no provision of her own you wouldnt wish to have him at queens gate asked lady tringle  certainly not if he makes nothing by his profession a good deal i think depends upon that then nothing further was said but lucy was not told her uncles opinion on the matter as had been promised when she went down to glenbogie she only knew that mr hamel was considered to be by far too black a sheep to be admitted into her aunts presence and that she must regard herself as separated from the man as far as any separation could be effected by her present protectors but if he would be true to her as to a girl whom he had a short time since so keenly rejoiced in finding again she was quite sure that she could be true to him  on the day fixed the 20th of august mr houston arrived at glenbogie with boots and stockings and ammunition such as tom had recommended when interrogated on those matters by his sister gertrude i travelled down with a man i think you know he said to lucyat any rate your sister does because i saw him with her at rome the man turned out to be isadore hamel i didnt like to ask him whether he was coming here said frank houston  no he is not coming here said aunt emmeline  certainly not said gertrude who was quite prepared to take up the cudgels on her mothers behalf against mr hamel  he said something about another man he used to know at rome before you came he was a nephew of that marchesa baldoni  she was a lady we didnt like a bit too well said gertrude  a very stuckup sort of person who did all she could to spoil ayala said aunt emmeline  ayala has just been staying with her said lucy she has been very kind to ayala  we have nothing to do with that now said aunt emmeline ayala can stay with whom she and her aunt pleases is this mr hamel whom you saw a friend of the marchesas  he seemed to be a friend of the marchesas nephew continued houstonone colonel stubbs we used to see him at rome and a most curious man he is his name is jonathan and i dont suppose that any man was ever seen so red before he is shooting somewhere and hamel seems to be going to join him i thought he might have been coming here afterwards as you all were in rome together  certainly he is not coming here said aunt emmeline and as for colonel stubbs i never heard of him before  a week of the time allotted to frank houston had gone before he had repeated a word of his suit to sir thomas but with gertrude every opportunity had been allowed him and by the rest of the family they had been regarded as though they were engaged mr traffick who was now at glenbogie in accordance with the compact made with him did not at first approve of frank houston he had insinuated to lady tringle and had said very plainly to augusta that he regarded a young man without any employment and without any income as being quite unfit to marry if he had a seat in the house it would be quite a different thing he had said to augusta but his wife had snubbed him telling him almost in so many words that if gertrude was determined to have her way in opposition to her father she certainly would not be deterred by her brotherinlaw its nothing to me mr traffick had then said the money wont come out of my pocket but when a man has nothing else to do he is sure to spend all that he can lay his hands upon after that however he withdrew his opposition and allowed it to be supposed that he was ready to receive frank houston as his brotherinlaw should it be so decided  the time was running by both with houston the expectant soninlaw and with mr traffick who had achieved his position and both were aware that no grace would be allowed to them beyond that which had been promised frank had fully considered the matter and was quite resolved that it would be unmanly in him to run after his cousin imogene in the tyrol before he had performed his business one day therefore after having returned from the daily allowance of slaughter he contrived to find sir thomas in the solitude of his own room and again began to act the part of allanadale i thought mr houston said sir thomas that we had settled that matter before  not quite said houston  i dont know why you should say so i intended to be understood as expressing my mind  but you have been good enough to ask me down here  i may ask a man to my house i suppose without intending to give him my daughters hand then he again asked the important question to which allanadales answer was so unreasonable and so successful have you an income on which to maintain my daughter  i cannot just say that i have sir thomas said houston apologetically  then you mean to ask me to furnish you with an income  you can do as you please about that sir thomas  you can hardly marry her without it  well no not altogether no doubt it is true that i should not have proposed myself had i not thought that the young lady would have something of her own  but she has nothing of her own said sir thomas and then that interview was over  you wont throw us over lady tringle houston said to gertrudes mother that evening  sir thomas likes to have his own way said lady tringle  somebody got round him about septimus traffick  that was different said lady tringle mr traffick is in parliament and that gives him an employment he is a son of lord boardotrade and some of these days he will be in office  of course you know that if gertrude sticks to it she will have her own way when a girl sticks to it her father has to give way what does it matter to him whether i have any business or not the money would be the same in one case as the other only it does seem such an unnecessary trouble to have it put off  all this lady tringle seemed to take in good part and half acknowledged that if frank houston were constant in the matter he would succeed at last gertrude when the time for his departure had come expressed herself as thoroughly disgusted by her fathers sternness its all bosh she said to her lover who is lord boardotrade that that should make a difference i have as much right to please myself as augusta but there was the stern fact that the money had not been promised and even frank had not proposed to marry the girl of his heart without the concomitant thousands  before he left glenbogie on the evening of his departure he wrote a second letter to miss docimer as follows      dear cousin im     here i am at glenbogie and here i have been for a week    without doing a stroke of work the father still asks of    his house and his home and does not seem to be at all    affected by my reference to the romantic grandeur of my    own peculiar residence perhaps i may boast so far as to    say that i have laughed on the lass as successfully as did    allanadale but whats the good of laughing on a lass    when one has got nothing to eat allanadale could pick    a pocket or cut a purse accomplishments in which i am    altogether deficient i suppose i shall succeed sooner or    later but when i put my neck into the collar i had no    idea that there would be so much uphill work before me    it is all very well joking but it is not nice to be asked    of your house and your home by a gentleman who knows    very well youve got none and is conscious of inhabiting    three or four palaces himself such treatment must be    described as being decidedly vulgar and then he must know    that it can be of no possible permanent use the ladies    are all on my side but i am told by tringle mère that    i am less acceptable than old traffick who married the    other girl because im not the son of lord boardotrade    nothing astonishes me so much as the bad taste of some    people now it must all be put off till christmas and    the cruel part is that one doesnt see how im to go on    living     in the meantime i have a little time in which to amuse    myself and i shall turn up in about three weeks at merle    park i wish chiefly to beg that you will not dissuade me    from what i see clearly to be a duty i know exactly your    line of argument following a girl for her money is you    will say mercenary so as far as i can see is every    transaction in the world by which men live the judges    the bishops the poets the royal academicians and the    prime ministers are all mercenaryas is also the man    who breaks stones for 2s 6d aday how shall a man    live without being mercenary unless he be born to fortune    are not girls always mercenary will she marry me knowing    that i have nothing will you not marry some one whom    you will probably like much less simply because he will    have something for you to eat and drink of course i    am mercenary and i dont even pretend to old tringle    that i am not so i feel a little tired of this special    effortbut if i were to abandon it i should simply have    to begin again elsewhere i have sighted my stag and    i must go on following him trying to get on the right    side of the wind till i bring him down it is not nice    but it is to me manifestly my dutyand i shall do it    therefore do not let there be any blowing up i hate to    be scolded     yours always affectionately     f h   gertrude when he was gone did not take the matter quite so quietly as he did feeling that as she had made up her mind and as all her world would know that she had made up her mind it behoved her to carry her purpose to its desired end a girl who is known to be engaged but whose engagement is not allowed is always in a disagreeable plight  mamma she said i think that papa is not treating me well  my dear your papa has always had his own way  that is all very wellbut why am i to be worse used than augusta it turns out now that mr traffick has not got a shilling of his own  your papa likes his being in parliament  all the girls cant marry members of parliament  and he likes his being the son of lord boardotrade  lord boardotrade i call that very mean mr houston is a gentleman and the buncombe property has been for ever so many hundreds of years in the family i think more of frank as to birth and all that than i do of lord boardotrade and his mushroom peerage cant you tell papa that i mean to marry mr houston at last and that he is making very little of me to let me be talked about as i shall be  i dont think i can gertrude  then i shall what would he say if i were to run away with frank  i dont think frank houston would do that  he would if i told himin a moment there miss tringle was probably in error and unless papa consents i shall tell him i am not going to be made miserable for ever  this was at glenbogie in invernessshire on the southeastern side of loch ness where sir thomas tringle possessed a beautiful mansion with a deerforest and a waterfall of his own and any amount of moors which the minds of sportmen could conceive nothing in scotland could be more excellent unless there might be some truth in the remarks of those who said that the grouse were scarce and that the deer were almost nonexistent on the other side of the lake four miles up from the gates on the edge of a ravine down which rushed a little stream called the caller was an inconvenient ricketty cottage built piecemeal at two or three different times called drumcaller from one room you went into another and from that into a third to get from the sittingroom which was called the parlour into another which was called the den you had to pass through the kitchen or else to make communication by a covered passage out of doors which seemed to hang over the margin of the ravine pinetrees enveloped the place looking at the house from the outside any one would declare it to be wet through it certainly could not with truth be described as a comfortable family residence but you might perhaps travel through all scotland without finding a more beautifully romantic spot in which to reside from that passage which seemed to totter suspended over the rocks whence the tumbling rushing waters could always be heard like music close at hand the view down over the little twisting river was such as filled the mind with a conviction of realised poetry behind the house across the little garden there was a high rock where a little path had been formed from which could be seen the whole valley of the caller and the broad shining expanse of the lake beyond those who knew the cottage of drumcaller were apt to say that no man in scotland had a more picturesque abode or one more inconvenient even bread had to be carried up from callerfoot as was called the little village down on the lake side and other provisions such even as meat had to be fetched twenty miles from the town of inverness  a few days after the departure of houston from glenbogie two men were seated with pipes in their mouths on the landing outside the room called the den to which the passage from the parlour ran here a square platform had been constructed capable of containing two armchairs and here the owner of the cottage was accustomed to sit when he was disposed as he called it to loaf away his time at drumcaller this man was colonel jonathan stubbs and his companion at the present moment was isadore hamel  i never knew them in rome said the colonel i never even saw ayala there though she was so much at my aunts house i was in sicily part of the time and did not get back till they had all quarrelled i did know the nephew who was a goodnatured but a vulgar young man they are vulgar people i should say  you could hardly have found ayala vulgar asked hamel  indeed no but uncles and aunts and nephews and nieces are not at all bound to run together ayala is the daintiest little darling i ever saw  i knew their father and mother and certainly no one would have called them vulgar  sisters when they marry of course go off according to their husbands and the children follow in this case one sister became tringlish after sir tringle and the other dormerish after that most improvident of human beings your late friend the artist i dont suppose any amount of experience will teach ayala how many shillings there are in a pound no doubt the honourable mrs traffick knows all about it  i dont think a girl is much improved by knowing how many shillings there are in a pound said hamel  it is useful sometimes  so it might be to kill a sheep and skin it or to milk a cow and make cheese but here as in other things one acquirement will drive out others a woman if she cannot be beautiful should at any rate be graceful and if she cannot soar to poetry should at least be soft and unworldly  thats all very well in its way but i go in for roasting baking and boiling     i can bake and i can brew    i can make an irish stew    wash a shirt and iron it too  thats the sort of girl i mean to go in for if ever i marry and when youve got six children and a small income its apt to turn out better than grace and poetry  a little of both perhaps said hamel  well yes i dont mind a little byron now and again so there is no nonsense as to glenbogie its right over there across the lake you can get a boat at callerfoot and a fellow to take you across and wait for you wont cost you more than three halfcrowns i suppose glenbogie is as far from the lake on that side as my cottage is on this how youll get up except by walking i cannot say unless you will write a note to sir thomas and ask him to send a horse down for you  sir thomas would not accommodate me  you think he will frown if you come after his niece  i simply want to call on miss dormer said hamel blushing because her father was always kind to me  i dont mean to ask any questions said the colonel  it is just so as i say i do not like being in the neighbourhood without calling on miss dormer  i daresay not  but i doubt whether sir thomas or lady tringle would be at all inclined to make me welcome as to the distance i can walk that easily enough and if the door is slammed in my face i can walk back again  thus it was resolved that early on the following morning after breakfast isadore hamel should go across the lake and make his way up to glenbogie     chapter xix  isadore hamel is asked to lunch   on the following morning the morning of monday 2nd september isadore hamel started on his journey he had thought much about the journey before he made it no doubt the door had been slammed in his face in london he felt quite conscious of that and conscious also that a man should not renew his attempt to enter a door when it has been once slammed in his face but he understood the circumstances nearly as they had happenedexcept that he was not aware how far the door had been slammed by lady tringle without any concurrence on the part of sir thomas but the door had at any rate not been slammed by lucy the only person he had really wished to see within that house had been lucy dormer and he had hitherto no reason for supposing that she would be unwilling to receive him her face had been sweet and gracious when she saw him in the park was he to deny himself all hope of any future intercourse with her because lady tringle had chosen to despise him he must make some attempt it was more than probable no doubt that this attempt would be futile the servant at glenbogie would probably be as well instructed as the servant in queens gate but still a man has to go on and do something if he means to do anything there could be no good in sitting up at drumcaller at one side of the lake and thinking of lucy dormer far away at the other side he had not at all made up his mind that he would ask lucy to be his wife his professional income was still poor and she as he was aware had nothing but he felt it to be incumbent upon him to get nearer to her if it were possible and to say something to her if the privilege of speech should be accorded to him  he walked down to callerfoot refusing the loan of the colonels pony carriage and thence had himself carried across the lake in a hired boat to a place called sandys quay that he was assured was the spot on the other side from whence the nearest road would be found to glenbogie but nobody on the callerfoot side could tell him what would be the distance at sandys quay he was assured that it was twelve miles to glenbogie house but he soon found that the man who told him had a pony for hire yell nae get there under twalve mileor maybe saxteen if ye attampt to walk up the glin so said the owner of the pony but milder information came to him speedily a little boy would show him the way up the glen for sixpence and engage to bring him to the house in an hour and a half so he started with the little boy and after a hot scramble for about two hours he found himself within the demesne poking their way up through thick bushes from a ravine they showed their two headsfirst the boy and then the sculptorclose by the side of the private roadjust as sir thomas was passing mounted on his cob its his ain sell said the boy dropping his head again amongst the bushes  hamel when he had made good his footing had first to turn round so that the lad might not lose his wages a dirty little hand came up for the sixpence but the head never appeared again it was well known in the neighbourhoodespecially at sandys quay where boats were used to landthat sir thomas was not partial to visitors who made their way into glenbogie by any but the authorised road while hamel was paying his debt he stood still on his steed waiting to see who might be the trespasser thats not a high road said sir thomas as the young man approached him as the last quarter of an hour from the bottom of the ravine had been occupied in very stiff climbing among the rocks the information conveyed appeared to hamel to have been almost unnecessary your way up to the house if you are going there would have been through the lodge down there  perhaps you are sir thomas tringle said hamel  that is my name  then i have to ask your pardon for my mode of ingress i am going up to the house but having crossed the lake from callerfoot i did not know my way on this side and so i have clambered up the ravine sir thomas bowed and then waited for further tidings i believe miss dormer is at the house  my niece is there  my name is hamelisadore hamel i am a sculptor and used to be acquainted with her father i have had great kindness from the whole family and so i was going to call upon her if you do not object i will go on to the house  sir thomas sat upon his horse speechless for a minute he had to consider whether he did not object or not he was well aware that his wife objectedaware also that he had declined to coincide with his wifes objection when it had been pressed upon him why should not his niece have the advantage of a lover if a proper sort of a lover came in her way as to the fathers morals or the sons birth those matters to sir thomas were nothing the young man he was told was good at making busts would any one buy the busts when they were made that was the question his wife would certainly be prejudicedwould think it necessary to reject for lucy any suitor she would reject for her own girls and then as sir thomas felt she had not shown great judgment in selecting suitors for her own girls oh mr hamel are you he said at last  isadore hamel  you called at queens gate once not long ago  i did said hamel but saw no one  no you didnt i heard that well you can go on to the house if you like but you had better ask for lady tringle after coming over from callerfoot youll want some lunch stop a moment i dont mind if i ride back with you and so the two started towards the house and hamel listened whilst sir thomas expatiated on the beauties of glenbogie  they had passed through one gate and were approaching another when away among the trees there was a young lady seen walking alone there is miss dormer said hamel i suppose i may join her sir thomas could not quite make up his mind whether the meeting was to be allowed or not but he could not bring himself at the spur of the moment to refuse his sanction so hamel made his way across to lucy while sir thomas rode on alone to the house  lucy had seen her uncle on the cob and being accustomed to see him on the cob knew of course who he was she had also seen another man with him but not in the least expecting that hamel was in those parts had never dreamt that he was her uncles companion it was not till hamel was near to her that she understood that the man was coming to join herself and then when she did recognise the man she was lost in amazement you hardly expected to see me here said he  indeed no  nor did i expect that i should find you in this way  my uncle knows it is you asked lucy  oh yes i met him as i came up from the ravine and he has asked me to go on to the house to lunch then there was silence for a few moments as they walked on together i hope you do not think that i am persecuting you in making my way over here  oh no not persecuting lucy when she heard the sound of what she herself had said was angry with herself feeling that she had almost declared him guilty of some wrong in having come thither of course i am glad to see you she added for papas sake but im afraid  afraid of what miss dormer  she looked him full in the face as she answered him collecting her courage to make the declaration which seemed to be necessary my aunt emmeline does not want you to come  why should she not want me  that i cannot tell perhaps if i did know i should not tell but it is so you called at queens gate and i know that you were not admitted though i was at home of course aunt emmeline has a right to choose who shall come it is not as though i had a house of my own  but sir thomas asked me in  then you had better go in after what aunt emmeline said i do not think that you ought to remain with me  your uncle knows i am with you said hamel then they walked on towards the house together in silence for a while do you mean to say he continued that because your aunt objects you are never to see me again  i hope i shall see you again you were papas friend and i should be so very sorry not to see you again  i suppose he said slowly i can never be more than your papas friend  you are mine also  i would be more than that then he paused as if waiting for a reply but she of course had none to make i would be so much more than that lucy still she had no answer to give him but there comes a time when no answer is as excellent eloquence as any words that can be spoken hamel who had probably not thought much of this was nevertheless at once informed by his instincts that it was so oh lucy he said if you can love me say so  mr hamel she whispered  lucy  mr hamel i told you about aunt emmeline she will not allow it i ought not to have let you speak to me like this while i am staying here  but your uncle knows i am with you  my aunt does not know we must go to the house she expressly desired that i would not speak to you  and you will obey heralways  no not always i did not say that i should obey her always some day perhaps i shall do as i think fit myself  and then you will speak to me  then i will speak to you she said  and love me  and love you she answered again looking him full in the face but now pray pray let us go on for he had stopped her awhile amidst the trees and had put out his hand as though to take hers and had opened his arms as though he would embrace her but she passed on quickly and hardly answered his further questions till they found themselves together in the hall of the house  then they met lady tringle who was just passing into the room where the lunch was laid and following her were augusta gertrude and the honourable septimus traffick for though frank houston had found himself compelled to go at the day named the honourable septimus had contrived to squeeze out another week augusta was indeed still not without hope that the paternal hospitality of glenbogie might be prolonged till dear merle park should once again open her portals sir thomas had already passed into the diningroom having in gruff voice informed his wife that he had invited mr hamel to come in to lunch mr hamel she had exclaimed yes mr hamel i could not see the man starving when he had come all this way i dont know anything against him then he had turned away and had gone into the diningroom and was now standing with his back to the empty fireplace determined to take mr hamels part if any want of courtesy were shown to him  it certainly was hard upon lady tringle she frowned and was going to walk on without any acknowledgment when lucy timidly went through a form of introduction aunt emmeline this is mr hamel uncle tom met him somewhere in the grounds and has asked him to come to luncheon then lady tringle curtseyed and made a bow the curtsey and the bow together were sufficient to have crushed the heart of any young man who had not been comforted and exalted by such words as isadore had heard from lucys lips not five minutes since and love you she had said after that lady tringle might curtsey and bow as she would and he could still live uncrushed after the curtsey and the bow lady tringle passed on lucy fell into the rank behind gertrude and then hamel afterwards took his place behind the honourable septimus if you will sit there mr hamel said lady tringle pointing to a chair across the table obliquely at the greatest possible distance from that occupied by lucy there he was stationed between mr traffick and sir thomas but now in his present frame of mind his position at the table made very little difference to him  the lunch was eaten in grim silence sir thomas was not a man profuse with conversation at his meals and at this moment was illinclined for any words except what he might use in scolding his wife for being uncivil to his guest lady tringle sat with her head erect hardly opening her mouth sufficiently to allow the food to enter it it was her purpose to show her displeasure at mr hamel and she showed it augusta took her mothers part thoroughly despising the two dormer girls and any lover that they might have poor gertrude had on that morning been violently persecuted by a lecture as to frank houstons impecuniosity lucy of course would not speak the honourable septimus was anxious chiefly about his lunchsomewhat anxious also to offend neither the master nor the mistress of merle park hamel made one or two little efforts to extract answers from sir thomas but soon found that sir thomas would prefer to be left in silence what did it signify to him he had done all that he wanted and much more than he had expected  the rising and getting away from luncheon is always a difficultyso great a difficulty when there are guests that lunch should never be much a company festival there is no provision for leaving the table as there is at dinner but on this occasion lady tringle extemporised provision the first moment in which they had all ceased to eat mr hamel she said very loudly would you like some cheese mr hamel with a little start declared that he wanted no cheese then my dears i think we will go into my room lucy will you come with me upon this the four ladies all went out in procession but her ladyship was careful that lucy should go first so that there might be no possibility of escape augusta and gertrude followed her the minds of all the four were somewhat perturbed but among the four lucys heart was by far the lightest  are you staying over with stubbs at that cottage asked the honourable septimus a very queer fellow is stubbs  a very good fellow said hamel  i dare say he hasnt got any shooting  i think not  not a head glentower wouldnt let an acre of shooting over there for any money this was the earl of glentower to whom belonged an enormous tract of country on the other side of the lake what on earth does he do with himself stuck up on the top of those rocks  he does shoot sometimes i believe when lord glentower is there  thats a poor kind of fun waiting to be asked for a day said the honourable septimus who rarely waited for anything till he was asked does he get any fishing  he catches a few trout sometimes in the tarns above but i fancy that stubbs isnt much devoted to shooting and fishing  then what the d does he do with himself in such a country as this hamel shrugged his shoulders not caring to say that what with walking what with reading and writing his friend could be as happy as the day was long in such a place as drumcaller  is he a liberal  a what asked hamel oh a liberal upon my word i dont know what he is he is chiefly given to poetry tobacco and military matters then the honourable septimus turned up his nose in disgust and ceased his crossexamination as to the character and pursuits of colonel jonathan stubbs  sir thomas i am very much obliged to you for your kindness said hamel getting up suddenly as it is a long way over to drumcaller i think i will make a start i know my way down the glen and should be sure to miss it by any other route perhaps youll let me go back as i came sir thomas offered him the loan of a horse but this was refused and hamel started on his return journey across the lake  when he had gone a few steps from the portal he turned to look at the house which contained one whom he now regarded as belonging exclusively to himself perhaps he thought that he might catch some final view of lucy or not quite thinking it fancied that some such chance might at least be possible but he saw nothing but the uninteresting facade of the grand mansion lucy was employed quite otherwise she was listening to a lecture in which her aunt was describing to her how very badly mr hamel had behaved in obtruding himself on the shades of glenbogie the lecture was somewhat long as aunt emmeline found it necessary to repeat all the arguments which she had before used as to the miscreants birth as to his want of adequate means and as to the general iniquities of the miscreants father all this she repeated more than once with an energy that was quite unusual to her the flood of her eloquence was so great that lucy found no moment for an interposing word till all these evils had been denunciated twice and thrice but then she spoke aunt emmeline she said i am engaged to mr hamel now  what  he has asked me to be his wife and i have promised  and that after all that i had said to you  aunt emmeline i told you that i should not drop him i did not bid him come here uncle tom brought him when i saw him i would have avoided him if i could i told him he ought not to be here because you did not wish it and then he answered that my uncle knew that he was with me of course when he told me that heloved me i could not make him any other answer then aunt emmeline expressed the magnitude of her indignation simply by silence and lucy was left to think of her lover in solitude                                          and how have you fared on your days journey said the colonel when hamel found him still seated on the platform with a book in his hand  much better than i thought sir thomas gave me luncheon  and the young lady  the young lady was gracious also but i am afraid that i cannot carry my praises of the family at glenbogie any further the three tringle ladies looked at me as i was sitting at table as though i certainly had no business in their august society     chapter xx  stubbs upon matrimony   before that evening was overor in the course of the night it might be better said as the two men sat up late with their pipeshamel told his friend the colonel exactly what had taken place that morning over at glenbogie you went for the purpose of course asked the colonel  for an off chance  i know that well enough i never heard of a mans walking twelve miles to call upon a young lady merely because he knew her father and when there was to be a second call within a few weeks the first having not been taken in very good part by the young ladys friends my inquiring mind told me that there was something more than old family friendship  your inquiring mind saw into the truth  and now looks forward to further events can she bake and can she brew  i do not doubt that she could if she tried  and can she wash a shirt for a man dont suppose my dear fellow that i intend to say that your wife will have to wash yours washing a shirt as read in the poem from which i am quoting is presumed to be simply emblematic of household duties in general  i take all you say in good partas coming from a friend  i regard matrimony said the colonel as being altogether the happiest state of life for a manunless to be engaged to some lovely creature in whom one can have perfect confidence may be a thought happier one can enjoy all the ecstatic mental reflection all the delights of conceit which come from being loved that feeling of superiority to all the world around which illumines the bosom of the favoured lover without having to put ones hand into ones pocket or having ones pipe put out either morally or physically the next to this is matrimony itself which is the only remedy for that consciousness of disreputable debauchery a savour of which always clings more or less strongly to unmarried men in our rank of life the chimes must be heard at midnight let a young man be ever so well given to the proprieties and he must have just a touch of the swingebuckler about him or he will seem to himself to be deficient in virility there is no getting out of it until a man marry but then  well then  do you know the man whose longpreserved hat is always brushed carefully whose coat is the pattern of neatness but still a little threadbare when you look at itin the colour of whose cheek there is still some touch of juvenility but whose step is ever heavy and whose brow is always sad the seriousness of life has pressed the smiles out of him he has learned hardly to want anything for himself but outward decency and the common necessaries of life such little personal indulgences as are common to you and to me are as strange to him as ortolans or diamonds  i do not think i do know him  i dowell i have seen him in the regiment i have met him on the steps of a public office i have watched him as he entered his parsonage house you shall find him coming out of a lawyers office where he has sat for the last nine hours having supported nature with two penny biscuits he has always those few thin hairs over his forehead he has always that wellbrushed hat he has always that load of care on his brow he is generally thinking whether he shall endeavour to extend his credit with the butcher or resolve that the supply of meat may be again curtailed without injury to the health of his five daughters  that is an ugly picture  but is it true  in some cases of course it is  and yet not ugly all round said the meditative colonel who had just replenished his pipe there are on the other side the five daughters and the partner of this load of cares he knows it is well to have the five daughters rather than to live with plenty of beef and muttoneven with the ortolans if you willand with no one to care whether his body may be racked in this world or his spirit in the next i do not say whether the balance of good or evil be on one side or the other but when a man is going to do a thing he should know what it is he is going to do  the reading of all this said hamel is that if i succeed in marrying miss dormer i must have thin locks and a bad hat and a butchers bill  other men do  some instead have balances at their bankers and die worth thirty forty or fifty thousand pounds to the great consolation of the five daughters  or a hundred thousand pounds there is of course no end to the amount of thousands which a successful professional man may accumulate you may be the man but the question is whether you should not have reasonable ground to suppose yourself the man before you encumber yourself with the five daughters  it seems to me said hamel that the need of such assurance is cowardly  that is just the question which i am always debating with myself i also want to rid myself of that swingebuckler flavour i feel that for me like adam it is not good that i should be alone i would fain ask the first girl that i could love well enough to wish to make myself one with her to be my wife regardless of hats butchers and daughters it is a plucky and a fine thing for a man to feel that he can make his back broad enough for all burdens but yet what is the good of thinking that you can carry a sack of wheat when you are sure that you have not in truth strength to raise it from the ground  strength will come said hamel  yes and the bad hat and worse than the bad hat the soiled gown and perhaps with the soiled gown the altered heartand perhaps with the altered heart an absence of all that tenderness which it is a womans special right to expect from a man  i should have thought you would have been the last to be so selfdiffident  to be so thoughtful you mean said the colonel i am unattached now and having had no special duty for the last three months i have given myself over to thinking in a nasty morbid manner it comes i daresay partly from tobacco but there is comfort in thisthat no such reflections falling out of one mans mouth ever had the slightest effect in influencing another mans conduct  hamel had told his friend with great triumph of his engagement with lucy dormer but the friend did not return the confidence by informing the sculptor that during the whole of this conversation and for many days previous to it his mind had been concerned with the image of lucys sister he was aware that ayala had been as it were turned out from her rich uncles house and given over to the comparative poverty of kingsbury crescent he himself at the present moment was possessed of what might be considered a comfortable income for a bachelor he had been accustomed to live almost more than comfortably but having so lived was aware of himself that he had not adapted himself for straitened circumstances in spite of that advice of his as to the brewing baking and washing capabilities of a female candidate for marriage he knew himself well enough to be aware that a wife red with a face from a kitchen fire would be distasteful to him he had often told himself that to look for a woman with money would be still more distasteful therefore he had thought that for the present at least it would be well for him to remain as he was but now he had come across ayala and though in the pursuance of his philosophy he had assured himself that ayala should be nothing to him still he found himself so often reverting to this resolution that ayala instead of being nothing was very much indeed to him  three days after this hamel was preparing himself for his departure immediately after breakfast what a beast you are to go said the colonel when there can be no possible reason for your going  the five daughters and the bad hat make it necessary that a fellow should do a little work sometimes  why cant you make your images down here  with you for a model and mud out of the caller for clay  i shouldnt have the slightest objection in your art you cannot perpetuate the atrocity of my colour as the fellow did who painted my portrait last winter if you will go go and make busts at unheardof prices so that the five daughters may live for ever on the fat of the land can i do any good for you by going over to glenbogie  if you could snub that mr traffick who is of all men the most atrocious  the power doesnt exist said the colonel which could snub the honourable septimus that man is possessed of a strength which i thoroughly envywhich is perhaps more enviable than any other gift the gods can give words cannot penetrate that skin of his satire flows off him like water from a duck ridicule does not touch him the fellest abuse does not succeed in inflicting the slightest wound he has learnt the great secret that a man cannot be cut who will not be cut as it is worth no mans while to protract an enmity with such a one as he he suffers from no prolonged enmities he walks unassailable by any darts and is i should say the happiest man in london  then i fear you can do nothing for me at glenbogie to mollify aunt emmeline would i fear be beyond your power sir thomas as far as i can see does not require much mollifying  sir thomas might give the young woman a thousand or two  that is not the way in which i desire to keep a good hat on my head said hamel as he seated himself in the little carriage which was to take him down to callerfoot  the colonel remained at drumcaller till the end of september when his presence was required at aldershotduring which time he shot a good deal in obedience to the goodnatured behests of lord glentower and in spite of the upturned nose of mr traffick he read much and smoked muchso that as to the passing of his time there was not need to pity him and he consumed a portion of his spare hours in a correspondence with his aunt the marchesa and with his cousin nina one of his letters from each shall be givenand also one of the letters written to each in reply      nina to her cousin the colonel     my dear jonathan     lady albury says that you ought to be here and so you    ought it is ever so nice there is a mr ponsonby here    and he and i can beat any other couple at lawn tennis    there is an awning over the ground which is such a    lounge playing lawn tennis with a parasol as those    melcombe girls did is stupid they were here but have    gone one i am quite sure was over head and ears in love    with mr ponsonby these sort of things are always all    on one side you know he isnt very much of a man but    he does play lawn tennis divinely take it altogether i    dont think there is anything out to beat lawn tennis i    dont know about huntingand i dont suppose i ever    shall     we tried to have ayala here but i fear it will not come    off lady albury was goodnatured but at last she did not    quite like writing to mrs dosett so mamma wrote but the    ladys answer was very stiff she thought it better for    ayala to remain among her own friends poor ayala it is    clear that a knight will be wanted to go in armour and    get her out of prison i will leave it to you to say who    must be the knight     i hope you will come for a day or two before you go to    aldershot we stay till the 1st of october you will be a    beast if you dont lady albury says she never means to    ask you again oh stubbs said sir harry stubbs is    one of those fellows who never come if theyre asked of    course we all sat upon him then he declared that you were    the dearest friend he had in the world but that he never    dared to dream that you would ever come to stalham again    perhaps if we can hit it off at last with ayala then you    would come mamma means to try againyour affectionate    cousin     nina      the marchesa baldoni to her nephew colonel stubbs     my dear jonathan     i did my best for my protégé but i am afraid it will not    succeed her aunt mrs dosett seems to think that as    ayala is fated to live with her ayala had better take    her fate as she finds it the meaning of that is that if    a girl is doomed to have a dull life she had better not    begin it with a little pleasure there is a good deal to    be said for the argument but if i were the girl i should    like to begin with the pleasure and take my chance for    the reaction i should perhaps be vain enough to think    that during the preliminary course i might solve all the    difficulty by my beaux yeux i saw mrs dosett once and    now i have had a letter from her upon the whole i am    inclined to pity poor ayala     we are very happy here the marchese has gone to como    to look after some property he has there do not be    illnatured enough to say that the two things go    togetherbut in truth he is never comfortable out of    italy he had a slice of red meat put before him the other    day and that decided him to start at once     on the first of october we go back to london and shall    remain till the end of november they have asked nina to    come again in november in order that she may see a hunt i    know that means that she will try to jump over something    and have her leg broken you must be here and not allow    it if she does come here i shall perhaps go down to    brighton for a fortnight     yesi do think ayala dormer is a very pretty girl and i    do think also that she is clever i quite agree that she    is ladylike but i do not therefore think that she is just    such a girl as such a man as colonel jonathan stubbs ought    to marry she is one of those human beings who seem to    have been removed out of this world and brought up in    another though she knows ever so much that nobody else    knows she is ignorant of ever so much that everybody    ought to know wandering through a grove or seated by a    brook or shivering with you on the top of a mountain she    would be charming i doubt whether she would be equally    good at the top of your table or looking after your    children or keeping the weeks accounts she would tease    you with poetry and not even pretend to be instructed    when you told her how an army ought to be moved i say    nothing as to the fact that she hasnt got a penny though    you are just in that position which makes it necessary    for a man to get some money with his wife i therefore am    altogether indisposed to any matrimonial outlook in that    directionyour affectionate aunt     beatrice baldoni      colonel stubbs to his cousin nina     dear nina     lady albury is wrong i ought not to be at stalham what    should i do at stalham at this time of year who never    shoot partridges and what would be the use of attempting    lawn tennis when i know i should be cut out by mr    ponsonby if that day in november is to come off then ill    come and coach you across the country you tell sir harry    that i say so and that i will bring three horses for one    week i think it very hard about poor ayala dormer but    what can any knight do in such a case when a young lady    is handed over to the custody of an uncle or an aunt    she becomes that uncles and aunts individual property    mrs dosett may be the most noxious dragon that ever was    created for the mortification and general misery of an    imprisoned damsel but still she is omnipotent the only    knight who can be of any service is one who will go with a    ring in his hand and absolutely carry the prisoner away    by force of the marriage service your unfortunate cousin    is so exclusively devoted to the duty of fighting his    countrys battles that he has not even time to think of a    step so momentous as that     poor ayala do not be stupid enough to accuse me of    pitying her because i cannot be the knight to release her    but i cannot but think how happy she would be at stalham    struggling to beat you and mr ponsonby at lawn tennis    and then risking a cropper when the happy days of november    should come roundyour loving cousin     j s      colonel stubbs to the marchesa baldoni     my dear aunt     your letter is worthy of the queen of sheba if as was no    doubt the case she corresponded with king solomon as for    ayalas fate if it be her fate to live with mrs dosett    she can only submit to it you cannot carry her over to    italy nor would the marchese allow her to divide his    italian good things with nina poor little bird she had    her chance of living amidst diamonds and banknotes with    the tringle millionaires but threw it away after some    fashion that i do not understand no doubt she was a fool    but i cannot but like her the better for it i hardly    think that a fortnight at stalham with all sir harrys    luxuries around her would do her much service     as for myself and the top of my table and the future    companion who is to be doomed to listen to my military    lucubrations i am altogether inclined to agree with you    seeing that you write in a pure spirit of worldly good    sense no doubt the queen of sheba gave advice of the    same sort to king solomon i never knew a woman to speak    confidentially of matrimony otherwise than as a matter of    pounds shillings and pence in counsels so given no    word of love has ever been known to creep in why should    it seeing that love cannot put a leg of mutton into the    pot dont imagine that i say this in a spirit either of    censure or satire your ideas are my own and should i    ever marry i shall do so in strict accordance with your    tenets thinking altogether of the weekly accounts and    determined to eschew any sitting by the sides of brooks     i have told nina about my plans i will be at stalham in    november to see that she does not break her neckyours    always     j s     chapter xxi  ayalas indignation   perhaps mrs dosett had some just cause for refusing her sanction for the proposed visit to albury if fate did require that ayala should live permanently in kingsbury crescent the gaiety of a very gay house and the wealth of a very wealthy house would hardly be good preparation for such a life up to the time of her going to the marchesa in brook street ayala had certainly done her best to suit herself to her aunts mannersthough she had done it with pain and suffering she had hemmed the towels and mended the sheets and had made the rounds to the shops she had endeavoured to attend to the pounds of meat and to sympathise with her aunt in the interest taken in the relics of the joints as they escaped from the hungry treatment of the two maidens in the kitchen ayala had been clever enough to understand that her aunt had been wounded by lucys indifference not so much because she had desired to avail herself of lucys labours as from a feeling that that indifference had seemed to declare that her own pursuits were mean and vulgar understanding this she had struggled to make those pursuits her ownand had in part succeeded her aunt could talk to her about the butter and the washing matters as to which her lips had been closed in any conversation with lucy that ayala was struggling mrs dosett had been awarebut she had thought that such struggles were good and had not been hopeless then came the visit to brook street and ayala returned quite an altered young woman it seemed as though she neither could nor would struggle any longer i hate muttonbones she said to her aunt one morning soon after her return  no doubt we would all like meat joints the best said her aunt frowning  i hate joints too  you have i dare say been cockered up at the marchesas with made dishes  i hate dishes said ayala petulantly  you dont hate eating  yes i do it is ignoble nature should have managed it differently we ought to have sucked it in from the atmosphere through our fingers and hairs as the trees do by their leaves there should have been no butchers and no grease and no nasty smells from the kitchenand no gin  this was worse than allthis allusion to the mild but unfashionable stimulant to which mr dosett had been reduced by his good nature you are flying in the face of the creator miss said aunt margaret in her most angry voicein the face of the creator who made everything and ordained what his creatures should eat and drink by his infinite wisdom  nevertheless said ayala i think we might have done without boiled mutton then she turned to some articles of domestic needlework which were in her lap so as to show that in spite of the wickedness of her opinions she did not mean to be idle but mrs dosett in her wrath snatched the work from her nieces hands and carried it out of the room thus declaring that not even a pillowcase in her house should owe a stitch to the hands of a girl so ungrateful and so blasphemous  the wrath wore off soon ayala though not contrite was meek and walked home with her aunt on the following morning patiently carrying a pound of butter six eggs and a small lump of bacon in a basket after that the pillowcase was recommitted to her but there still was left evidence enough that the girls mind had been upset by the luxuries of brook streetevidence to which aunt margaret paid very much attention insisting upon it in her colloquies with her husband i think that a little amusement is good for young people said uncle reginald weakly  and for old people too no doubt about it if they can get it so as not to do them any harm at the same time nothing can be good for a young woman which unfits her for that state of life to which it has pleased god to call her ayala has to live with us no doubt there was a struggle when she first came from your sister lady tringle but she made it gallantly and i gave her great credit she was just falling into a quiet mode of life when there came this invitation from the marchesa baldoni now she has come back quite an altered person and the struggle has to be made all over again uncle reginald again expressed his opinion that young people ought to have a little amusement but he was not strong enough to insist very much upon his theory it certainly however was true that ayala though she still struggled had been very much disturbed by the visit  then came the invitation to stalham there was a very pretty note from lady albury to ayala herself saying how much pleasure she would have in seeing miss dormer at her house where ayalas old friends the marchesa and nina were then staying this was accompanied by a long letter from nina herself in which all the charms of stalham including mr ponsonby and lawn tennis were set forth at full length ayala had already heard much about stalham and the alburys from her friend nina who had hinted in a whisper that such an invitation as this might perhaps be forthcoming she was ready enough for the visit having looked through her wardrobe and resolved that things which had been good enough for brook street would still be good enough for stalham but the same post had brought a letter for mrs dosett and ayala could see that as the letter was read a frown came upon her aunts brow and that the look on her aunts face was decidedly averse to stalham this took place soon after breakfast when uncle reginald had just started for his office and neither of them for awhile said a word to the other of the letter that had been received it was not till after lunch that ayala spoke aunt she said you have had a letter from lady albury  yes said mrs dosett grimly i have had a letter from lady albury  then there was another silence till ayala whose mind was full of promised delights could not refrain herself longer aunt margaret she said i hope you mean to let me go for a minute or two there was no reply and ayala again pressed her question lady albury wants me to go to stalham  she has written to me to say that she would receive you  and i may go  i am strongly of opinion that you had better not said mrs dosett confirming her decree by a nod which might have suited jupiter  oh aunt margaret why not  i think it would be most prudent to decline  but whywhywhy aunt margaret  there must be expense  i have money enough for the journey left of my own from what uncle tom gave me said ayala pleading her cause with all her eloquence  it is not only the money there are other reasonsvery strong reasons  what reasons aunt margaret  my dear it is your lot to have to live with us and not with such people as the marchesa baldoni and lady albury  i am sure i do not complain  but you would complain after having for a time been used to the luxuries of albury park i do not say that as finding fault ayala it is human nature that it should be so  but i wont complain have i ever complained  yes my dear you told me the other day that you did not like bones of mutton and you were disgusted because things were greasy i do not say this by way of scolding you ayala but only that you may understand what must be the effect of your going from such a house as this to such a house as stalham and then returning back from stalham to such a house as this you had better be contented with your position  i am contented with my position sobbed ayala  and allow me to write to lady albury refusing the invitation  but ayala could not be brought to look at the matter with her aunts eyes when her aunt pressed her for an answer which should convey her consent she would give none and at last left the room bitterly sobbing turning the matter over in her own bosom upstairs she determined to be mutinous no doubt she owed a certain amount of obedience to her aunt but had she not been obedient had she not worked hard and lugged about that basket of provisions and endeavoured to take an interest in all her aunts concerns was she so absolutely the property of her aunt that she was bound to do everything her aunt desired to the utter annihilation of all her hopes to the extermination of her promised joys she felt that she had succeeded in brook street she had met no angel of light but she was associated with people whom she had liked and had been talked to by those to whom it had been a pleasure to listen that colonel with the quaint name and the ugly face was still present to her memory as he had leaned over her shoulder at the theatre making her now laugh by his drollery and now filling her mind with interest by his description of the scenes which she was seeing she was sure that all this or something of the same nature would be renewed for her delight at stalham and was she to be robbed of thisthe only pleasure which seemed to remain to her in this worldmerely because her aunt chose to entertain severe notions as to duty and pleasure other girls went out when they were asked at rome when that question of the dance at the marchesas had been discussed she had had her own way in opposition to her aunt emmeline and her cousin augusta no doubt she had in consequence partly of her conduct on that occasion been turned out of her uncle toms house but of that she did not think at the present moment she would be mutinous and would appeal to her uncle reginald for assistance  but the letter which contained the real invitation had been addressed to her aunt and her aunt could in truth answer it as she pleased the answer might at this moment be in the act of being written and should it be averse ayala knew very well that she could not go in opposition to it and yet her aunt came to her in the afternoon consulting her again quite unconquered as to her own opinion but still evidently unwilling to write the fatal letter without ayalas permission then ayala assured herself that she had rights of her own which her aunt did not care to contravene i think i ought to be allowed to go she said when her aunt came to her during the afternoon  when i think it will be bad for you  it wont be bad they are very good people i think that i ought to be allowed to go  have you no reliance on those who are your natural guardians  uncle reginald is my natural guardian said ayala through her tears  very well if you refuse to be guided by me as though i were not your aunt and as you will pay no attention to what i tell you is proper for you and best the question must be left till your uncle comes home i cannot but be very much hurt that you should think so little of me i have always endeavoured to do the best i could for you just as though i were your mother  i think that i ought to be allowed to go repeated ayala  as the first consequence of this the replies to all the three letters were delayed for the next days post ayala had considered much with what pretty words she might best answer lady alburys kind note and she had settled upon a form of words which she had felt to be very pretty unless her uncle would support her that would be of no avail and another form must be chosen to nina she would tell the whole truth either how full of joy she wasor else how cruelly used and how thoroughly brokenhearted but she could not think that her uncle would be unkind to her her uncle had been uniformly gentle her uncle when he should know how much her heart was set upon it would surely let her go  the poor girl when she tacitly agreed that her uncle should be the arbiter in the matter thus pledging herself to abide by her uncles decision let it be what it might did not think what great advantage her aunt would have over her in that discussion which would be held upstairs while the master of the house was washing his hands before dinner nor did she know of how much stronger will was her aunt margaret than her uncle reginald while he was washing his hands and putting on his slippers the matter was settled in a manner quite destructive of poor ayalas hopes i wont have it said mrs dosett in reply to the old argument that young people ought to have some amusement if i am to be responsible for the girl i must be allowed my own way with her it is trouble enough and very little thanks i get for it of course she hates me nevertheless i can endeavour to do my duty and i will it is not thanks nor love nor even gratitude that i look for i am bound to do the best i can by her because she is your niece and because she has no other real friends i knew what would come of it when she went to that house in brook street i was soft then and gave way the girl has moped about like a miserable creature ever since if i am not to have my way now i will have done with her altogether having heard this very powerful speech uncle reginald was obliged to give way and it was settled that after dinner he should convey to ayala the decision to which they had come  ayala as she sat at the dinnertable was all expectation but she asked no question she asked no question after dinner while her uncle slowly solemnly and sadly sipped his one beaker of cold ginandwater he sipped it very slowly no doubt because he was anxious to postpone the evil moment in which he must communicate her fate to his niece but at last the melancholy glass was drained and then according to the custom of the family mrs dosett led the way up into the drawingroom followed by ayala and her husband he when he was on the stairs and when the eyes of his wife were not upon him tremulously put out his hand and laid it on ayalas shoulder as though to embrace her the poor girl knew well that mark of affection there would have been no need for such embracing had the offered joys of stalham been in store for her the tears were already in her eyes when she seated herself in the drawingroom as far removed as possible from the armchair which was occupied by her aunt  then her uncle pronounced his judgment in a vacillating voicewith a vacillation which was ineffectual of any good to ayala ayala he said your aunt and i have been talking over this invitation to stalham and we are of opinion my dear that you had better not accept it  why not uncle reginald  there would be expense  i can pay for my own ticket  there would be many expenses which i need not explain to you more fully the truth is my dear that poor people cannot afford to live with rich people and had better not attempt it  i dont want to live with them  visiting them is living with them for a time i am sorry ayala that we are not able to put you in a position in which you might enjoy more of the pleasures incidental to your age but you must take the things as they are looking at the matter all round i am sure that your aunt is right in advising that you should stay at home  it isnt advice at all said ayala  ayala exclaimed her aunt in a tone of indignation  it isnt advice repeated ayala of course if you wont let me go i cant  you are a very wicked girl said mrs dosett to speak to your uncle like that after all that he has done for you  not wicked said the uncle  i say wicked but it doesnt matter i shall at once write to lady albury as you desire and of course there will be no further question as to her going soon after that mrs dosett sat down to her desk and wrote that letter to which the marchesa had alluded in hers to her nephew no doubt it was stern and hard and of a nature to make such a woman as the marchesa feel that mrs dosett would not be a pleasant companion for a girl like ayala but it was written with a full conviction that duty required it and the words though hard and stiff had been chosen with the purpose of showing that the doing of this disagreeable duty had been felt to be imperative  when the matter had been thus decided ayala soon retreated to her own room her very soul was burning with indignation at the tyranny to which she thought herself subjected the use of that weak word advice had angered her more than anything it had not been advice it had not been given as advice a command had been laid upon her a most cruel and unjust command which she was forced to obey because she lacked the power of escaping from her condition of slavery advice indeed advice is a thing with which the advised one may or may not comply as that advised one may choose a slave must obey an order her own papa and her own mamma had always advised her and the advice had always been followed even when read only in the glance of an eye in a smile or a nod then she had known what it was to be advised now she was orderedas slaves are ordered and there was no escape from her slavery  she too must write her letter but there was no need now of that pretty studied phrase in which she had hoped to thank lady albury fitly for her great kindness she found after a vain attempt or two that it was hopeless to endeavour to write to lady albury the words would not come to her pen but she did write to nina      dear dearest nina     they wont let me go oh my darling i am so miserable    why should they not let me go when people are so kind so    very kind as lady albury and your dear mamma i feel as    though i should like to run from the house and never come    back even though i had to die in the streets i was so    happy when i got your letter and lady alburys and now i    am so wretched i cannot write to lady albury you must    just tell her with many thanks from me that they will    not let me go     your unhappy but affectionate friend     ayala     chapter xxii  ayalas gratitude   there was much pity felt for ayala among the folk at stalham the sympathies of them all should have been with mrs dosett they ought to have felt that the poor aunt was simply performing an unpleasant duty and that the girl was impracticable if not disobedient but ayala was known to be very pretty and mrs dosett was supposed to be plain ayala was interesting while mrs dosett from the nature of her circumstances was most uninteresting it was agreed on all sides at stalham that so pretty a bird as ayala should not be imprisoned for ever in so ugly a cage such a bird ought at least to be allowed its chance of captivating some fitting mate by its song and its plumage that was lady alburys argumenta woman very goodnatured a little given to matchmaking a great friend to pretty girlsand whose eldest son was as yet only nine so that there could be no danger to herself or her own flock there was much ridicule thrown on mrs dosett at stalham and many pretty things said of the bird who was so unworthily imprisoned in kingsbury crescent at last there was something like a conspiracy the purport of which was to get the bird out of its cage in november  in this conspiracy it can hardly be said that the marchesa took an active part much as she liked ayala she was less prone than lady albury to think that the girl was illused she was more keenly alive than her cousinor rather her cousins wifeto the hard necessities of the world ayala must be said to have made her own bed at any rate there was the bed and she must lie on it it was not the dosetts fault that they were poor according to their means they were doing the best they could for their niece and were entitled to praise rather than abuse and then the marchesa was afraid for her nephew colonel stubbs in his letter to her had declared that he quite agreed with her views as to matrimony but she was quite alive to her nephews sarcasm her nephew though he might in truth agree with her nevertheless was sarcastic though he was sarcastic still he might be made to accede to her views because he did in truth agree with her she was eminently an intelligent woman seeing far into character and she knew pretty well the real condition of her nephews mind and could foresee his conduct he would marry before long and might not improbably marry a girl with some money if one could be made to come in his way who would at the same time suit his somewhat fastidious taste but ayala suited his taste ayala who had not a shilling and the marchesa thought it only too likely that if ayala were released from her cage and brought to albury ayala might become mrs jonathan stubbs that ayala should refuse to become mrs jonathan stubbs did not present itself as a possibility to the marchesa  so the matters were when the marchesa and nina returned from stalham to london a promise having been given that nina should go back to stalham in november and be allowed to see the glories of a hunt she was not to ride to hounds that was a matter of course but she was to be permitted to see what a pack of hounds was like and of what like were the men in their scarlet coats and how the huntsmans horn would sound when it should be heard among the woods and fields it was already decided that the colonel should be there to meet her and the conspiracy was formed with the object of getting ayala out of her cage at the same time stalham was a handsome country seat in the county of rufford and sir harry albury had lately taken upon himself the duties of master of the rufford and ufford united pack colonel stubbs was to be there with his horses in november but had in the meantime been seen by lady albury and had been instigated to do something for the release of ayala but what could he do it was at first suggested that he should call at kingsbury crescent and endeavour to mollify the stony heart of aunt dosett but as he had said himself he would be the worst person in the world to perform such an embassy i am not an adonis i know he said nor do i look like a lothario but still i am in some sort a young man and therefore certain to be regarded as pernicious as dangerous and damnable by such a dragon of virtue as aunt dosett i dont see how i could expect to have a chance this interview took place in london during the latter end of october and it was at last decided that the mission should be made by lady albury herself and made not to mrs dosett at kingsbury crescent but to mr dosett at his office in somerset house i dont think i could stand mrs d said lady albury  lady albury was a handsome fashionable woman rather tall always excellently dressed and possessed of a personal assurance which nothing could daunt she had the reputation of an affectionate wife and a good mother but was nevertheless declared by some of her friends to be a little fast she certainly was fond of comedythose who did not like her were apt to say that her comedy was only funand was much disposed to have her own way when she could get it she was now bent upon liberating ayala from her cage and for this purpose had herself driven into the huge court belonging to somerset house  mr dosett was dignified at his office with the use of a room to himself a small room looking out upon the river in which he spent six hours on six days of the week in arranging the indexes of a voluminous library of manuscript letterbooks it was rarely indeed that he was disturbed by the presence of any visitor when therefore his door was opened by one of the messengers and he was informed that lady albury desired to see him he was for the moment a good deal disturbed no option however was given to him as to refusing admission to lady albury she was in the room before the messenger had completed his announcement and had seated herself in one of the two spare chairs which the room afforded as soon as the door was closed mr dosett she said i have taken the great liberty of calling to say a few words about your niece miss ayala dormer  when the lady was first announced mr dosett in his confusion had failed to connect the name which he had heard with that of the lady who had invited ayala to her house but now he recognised it and knew who it was that had come to him you were kind enough he said to invite my little girl to your house some weeks ago  and now i have come to invite her again  mr dosett was now more disturbed than ever with what words was he to refuse the request which this kind but very grand lady was about to make how could he explain to her all those details as to his own poverty and as to ayalas fate in having to share that poverty with him how could he explain the unfitness of ayalas temporary sojourn with people so wealthy and luxurious and yet were he to yield in the least how could he face his wife on his return home to the crescent you are very kind lady albury he said  we particularly wish to have her about the end of the first week in november said the lady her friend nina baldoni will be there and one or two others whom she knows we shall try to be a little gay for a week or two  i have no doubt it would be gay and we at home are very dull  do you not think a little gaiety good for young people said her ladyship using the very argument which poor mr dosett had so often attempted to employ on ayalas behalf  yes a little gaiety he said as though deprecating the excessive amount of hilarity which he imagined to prevail at stalham  of course you do said lady albury poor little girl i have heard so much about her and of all your goodness to her mrs dosett i know is another mother to her but still a little country air could not but be beneficial do say that she shall come to us mr dosett  then mr dosett felt that disagreeable as it was he must preach the sermon which his wife had preached to him and he did preach it he spoke timidly of his own poverty and the need which there was that ayala should share it he spoke a word of the danger which might come from luxury and of the discontent which would be felt when the girl returned to her own home something he added of the propriety of like living with like and ended by praying that ayala might be excused the words came from him with none of that energy which his wife could have usedwere uttered in a low melancholy drone but still they were words hard to answer and called upon lady albury for all her ingenuity in finding an argument against them  but lady albury was strongminded and did find an argument you musnt be angry with me she said if i dont quite agree with you of course you wish to do the best you can for this dear child  indeed i do lady albury  how is anything then to be done for her if she remains shut up in your house you do not if i understand see much company yourselves  none at all  you wont be angry with me for my impertinence in alluding to it  not in the least it is the fact that we live altogether to ourselves  and the happiest kind of life too for married people said lady albury who was accustomed to fill her house in the country with a constant succession of visitors and to have engagements for every night of the week in town but for young people it is not quite so good how is a young lady to get herself settled in life  settled asked mr dosett vaguely  married suggested lady albury more plainly mr dosett shook his head no idea on the subject had ever flashed across his mind to provide bread and meat a bed and clothes for his sisters child he had felt to be a dutybut not a husband husbands came or did notas the heavens might be propitious that ayala should go to stalham for the sake of finding a husband was certainly beyond the extent of his providing care in fact how is a girl to have a chance at all unless she is allowed to see some one of course i dont say this with reference to our house there will be no young men there or anything of that kind but taking a broad view unless you let a girl like that have what chances come in her way how is she to get on i think you have hardly a right to do it  we have done it for the best  i am sure of that mr dosett and i hope you will tell mrs dosett with my compliments how thoroughly i appreciate her goodness i should have called upon her instead of coming here only that i cannot very well get into that part of the town  i will tell her what you are good enough to say  poor ayala i am afraid that her other aunt aunt tringle was not as good to her as your wife i have heard about how all that occurred in rome she was very much admired there i am told that she is perfectly lovely  pretty well  a sort of beauty that we hardly ever see nowand very very clever  ayala is clever i think  she ought to have her chance she ought indeed i dont think you quite do your duty by such a girl as that unless you let her have a chance she is sure to get to know people and to be asked from one house to another i speak plainly for i really think you ought to let her come  all this sank deeply into the heart of uncle reginald whether it was for good or evil it seemed to him at the moment to be unanswerable if there was a chance of any good thing for ayala surely it could not be his duty to bar her from that chance a whole vista of new views in reference to the treatment of young ladies was opened to him by the words of his visitor ayala certainly was pretty certainly she was clever a husband with an income would certainly be a good thing embryo husbands with incomes do occasionally fall in love with pretty girls but how can any pretty girl be fallen in love with unless some one be permitted to see her at kingsbury crescent there was not a man to be seen from one end of the year to another it occurred to him now for the first time that ayala by her present life was shut out from any chance of marriage it was manifestly true that he had no right to seclude her in that fashion at last he made a promise rashly as he felt at the very moment of making it that he would ask his wife to allow ayala to go to stalham lady albury of course accepted this as an undertaking that ayala should come and went away triumphant  mr dosett walked home across the parks with a troubled mind thinking much of all that had passed between him and the lady of fashion it was with great difficulty that he could quite make up his mind which was rightthe lady of fashion or his wife if ayala was to live always as they lived at kingsbury crescent if it should in process of time be her fate to marry some man in the same class as themselves if continued care as to small pecuniary needs was to be her future lot then certainly her comfort would only be disturbed by such a visit as that now proposed and was it not probable that such would be the destiny in store for her mr dosett knew the world well enough to be aware that all pretty girls such as ayala cannot find rich husbands merely by exhibiting their prettiness kingsbury crescent unalloyed by the dangers of stalham would certainly be the most secure but then he had been told that ayala now had special chances offered to her and that he had no right to rob her of those chances he felt this the more strongly because she was not his daughteronly his niece with a daughter he and his wife might have used their own judgment without check but now he had been told that he had no right to rob ayala of her chances and he felt that he had not the right by the time that he reached kingsbury crescent he had with many misgivings decided in favour of stalham  it was now some weeks since the first invitation had been refused and during those weeks life had not been pleasant at the crescent ayala moped and pined as though some great misfortune had fallen upon her when she had first come to the crescent she had borne herself bravely as a man bears a trouble when he is conscious that he has brought it on himself by his own act and is proud of the act which has done it but when that excitement has gone and the trouble still remains the pride wears off and the man is simply alive to his suffering so it had been with ayala then had come the visit to brook street when soon after that she was invited to stalham it seemed as though a new world was being opened to her there came a moment when she could again rejoice that she had quarrelled with her aunt emmeline this new world would be a much better world than the tringle world then had come the great blow and it had seemed to her as though there was nothing but kingsbury crescent before her for the rest of her wretched life  there was not a detail of all this hidden from the eyes of aunt margaret stalham had decided that aunt margaret was ugly and uninteresting stalham according to its own views was right nevertheless the lady in kingsbury crescent had both eyes to see and a heart to feel she was hot of temper but she was forgiving she liked her own way but she was affectionate she considered it right to teach her niece the unsavoury mysteries of economy but she was aware that such mysteries must be distasteful to one brought up as ayala even when she had been loudest in denouncing ayalas mutiny her heart had melted in ruth because ayala had been so unhappy she too had questioned herself again and again as to the justness of her decision was she entitled to rob ayala of her chances in her frequent discussions with her husband she still persisted in declaring that kingsbury crescent was safe and that stalham would be dangerous but nevertheless in her own bosom she had misgivings as she saw the poor girl mope and weary through one day after another she could not but have misgivings  i have had that lady albury with me at the office today and have almost promised that ayala shall go to her on the 8th of november it was thus that mr dosett rushed at once into his difficulty as soon as he found himself upstairs with his wife  you have  well my dear i almost did she said a great deal and i could not but agree with much of it ayala ought to have her chances  what chances demanded mrs dosett who did not at all like the expression  well seeing people she never sees anybody here  nobody is better than some people said mrs dosett meaning to be severe on lady alburys probable guests  but if a girl sees nobody said mr dosett she can have nonono chances  she has the chance of wholesome victuals said mrs dosett and i dont know what other chances you or i can give her  she might seea young man this mr dosett said very timidly  a young fiddlestick a young man young men should be waited for till they come naturally and never thought about if they dont come at all i hate this looking after young men if there wasnt a young man for the next dozen years we should do betterso as just to get out of the way of thinking about them for a time this was mrs dosetts philosophy but in spite of her philosophy she did yield and on that night it was decided that ayala after all was to be allowed to go to stalham                                          to mr dosett was deputed the agreeable task of telling ayala on the next evening what was to befall her if anything agreeable was to be done in that sombre house it was always deputed to the master  what said ayala jumping from her chair  on the eighth of november said mr dosett  to stalham  lady albury was with me yesterday at the office and your aunt has consented  oh uncle reginald said ayala falling on her knees and hiding her face on his lap heaven had been once more opened to her  ill never forget it said ayala when she went to thank her auntnever  i only hope it may not do you a mischief  and i beg your pardon aunt margaret because i wasi wasbecause i was she could not find the word which would express her own delinquency without admitting more than she intended to admittoo selfasserting considering that i am only a young girl that would have been her meaning could she have found appropriate words  we need not go back to that now said aunt margaret   end of vol

an envelope from her uncle sir thomas enclosing a cheque for £20 the tringle women had heard that ayala had been asked to stalham and had mentioned the visit disparagingly before sir thomas i think it very wrong of my poor brother said lady tringle she cant have a shilling even to get herself gloves this had an effect which had not been intended and sir thomas sent the cheque for £20 then ayala felt not only that the heavens were opened to her but that the sweetest zephyrs were blowing her on upon her course thoughts as to gloves had disturbed her and as to some shoes which were wanting and especially as to a pretty hat for winter wear now she could get hat and shoes and gloves and pay her fare and go down to stalham with money in her pocket before going she wrote a very pretty note to her uncle tom  on her arrival she was made much of by everyone lady albury called her the caged bird and congratulated her on her escape from the bars sir harry asked her whether she could ride to hounds nina gave her a thousand kisses but perhaps her greatest delight was in finding that jonathan stubbs was at albury she had become so intimate with the colonel that she regarded him quite like an old friend and when a girl has a male friend though he may be much less loved or not loved at all he is always more pleasant or at any rate more piquant than a female friend as for love with colonel stubbs that was quite out of the question she was sure that he would never fall in love with herself his manner to her was altogether unlike that of a lover a lover would be smooth soft poetic and flattering he was always a little rough to hersometimes almost scolding her but then he scolded her as she liked to be scoldedwith a dash of fun and a greatly predominating admixture of goodnature he was like a bearbut a bear who would always behave himself pleasantly she was delighted when colonel stubbs congratulated her on her escape from kingsbury crescent and felt that he was justified by his intimacy when he called mrs dosett a mollified shecerberus  are you going to make one of my team said the colonel to her on the morning after her arrival it was a nonhunting morning and the gentlemen were vacant about the house till they went out for a little shooting later on in the day  what team said ayala feeling that she had suddenly received a check to her happiness she knew that the colonel was alluding to those hunting joys which were to be prepared for nina and which were far beyond her own reach that question of riding gear is terrible to young ladies who are not properly supplied even had time admitted she would not have dared to use her uncles money for such a purpose in the hope that a horse might be lent to her she had told herself that it was out of the question and had declared to herself that she was too thankful for her visit to allow any regret on such a matter to cross her mind but when the colonel spoke of his team there was something of a pang how she would have liked to be one of such a team  my pony team i mean to drive too you mustnt think that i am taking a liberty when i say that they are to be called nina and ayala  there was no liberty at all had he called her simply ayala she would have felt it to be no more than pleasant friendship coming from him he was so big and so red and so ugly and so friendly why should he not call her ayala but as to that teamit could not be if its riding she said demurely i cant be one of the ponies  it is ridingof course now the marchesa is not here we mean to call it hunting in a mild way  i cant she said  but youve got to do it miss dormer  i havent got anything to do it with of course i dont mind telling you  you are to ride the sweetest little horse that ever was foaledjust bigger than a pony it belongs to sir harrys sister who is away and weve settled it all there never was a safer little beast and he can climb through a fence without letting you know that its there  but i meanclothes said ayala then she whispered i havent got a habit or anything else anybody ought to have  ah said the colonel i dont know anything about that i should say that nina must have managed that the horse department was left to me and i have done my part you will find that you will have to go out next tuesday and friday the hounds will be here on tuesday and they will be at rufford on friday rufford is only nine miles from here and its all settled  before the day was over the difficulty had vanished miss alburys horse was not only called into requisition but miss alburys habit also ayala had a little black hat of her own which lady albury assured her would do excellently well for the hunting field there was some fitting and some trying on and perhaps a few moments of preliminary despair but on the tuesday morning she rode away from the hall door at eleven oclock mounted on sprite as the little horse was called and felt herself from head to foot to be one of colonel stubbss team when at glenbogie she had ridden a little and again in italy and being fearless by nature had no trepidation to impair the fulness of her delight  hunting from home coverts rarely exacts much jumping from ladies the woods are big and the gates are numerous it is when the faraway homes of wild foxes are drawnthose secluded brakes and gorses where the nobler animal is wont to live at a distance from carriageroads and other weak refuges of civilizationthat the riding capacities of ladies must be equal to those of their husbands and brothers this present moment was an occasion for great delightat least so it was found by both nina and ayala but it was not an opportunity for great glory till it was time for lunch one fox after another ran about the big woods of albury in a fashion that seemed perfect to the two girls but which nearly broke the heart of old tony who was still huntsman to the ufford and rufford united hunt darm their nasty ways said tony to mr larry twentyman who was one of the popular habitues of the hunt they runs one a top of anothers brushes till there aint a ound living knows tother from which theres always a many on em at albury but i never knew an albury fox worth his grub yet but there was galloping along roads and through gates and long strings of horsemen followed each other up and down the rides and an easy coming back to the places from which they started which made the girls think that the whole thing was divine once or twice there was a little bank and once or twice a little ditchjust sufficient to make ayala feel that no possible fence would be a difficulty to sprite she soon learnt that mode of governing her body which leaping requires and when she was brought into lunch at about two she was sure that she could do anything which the art of hunting required but at lunch an edict went forth as to the two girls against further hunting for that day nina strove to rebel and ayala attempted to be eloquent by a supplicating glance at the colonel but they were told that as the horses would be wanted again on friday they had done enough in truth tony had already trotted off with the hounds to pringles gorse a distance of five miles and the gentlemen who had lingered over their lunch had to follow him at their best pace pringles gorse is not just the place for young ladies sir harry said and so the matter had been decided against nina and ayala  at about six sir harry colonel stubbs and the other gentlemen returned declaring that nothing quicker than their run from pringles gorse had ever been known in that country about six miles straight on end in forty minutes said the colonel and then a kill in the open  he was laid up under a bank said young gosling  he was so beat he couldnt carry on a field farther said captain batsby who was staying in the house  i call that the open said stubbs  i always think i kill a fox in the open said sir harry when the hounds run into him because he cannot run another yard with the country there before him then there was a long discussion as they stood drinking tea before the fire as to what the open meant from which they went to other hunting matters to all this ayala listened with attentive ears and was aware that she had spent a great day oh what a difference was there between stalham and kingsbury crescent  the next two days were almost equally full of delight she was taken into the stables to see her horse and as she patted his glossy coat she felt that she loved sprite with all her heart oh what a world of joy was thishow infinitely superior even to queens gate and glenbogie the gaudy magnificence of the tringles had been altogether unlike the luxurious comfort of stalham where everybody was at his ease where everybody was goodnatured where everybody seemed to acknowledge that pleasure was the one object of life on the evening before the friday she was taken out to dinner by captain batsby she was not sure that she liked captain batsby who made little complimentary speeches to her but her neighbour on the other side was colonel stubbs and she was quite sure that she liked colonel stubbs  i know youll go like a bird tomorrow said captain batsby  i shouldnt like that because there would be no jumping said ayala  but youd be such a beautiful bird the captain as he drawled out his words made an eye at her and she was sure that she did not like the captain  at what time are we to start tomorrow she said turning to the colonel  ten sharp mind youre ready sir harry takes us on the drag and wouldnt wait for venus though she wanted five minutes more for her back hair  i dont suppose she ever wants any time for her back hair i wouldnt if i were a goddess  then youd be a very untidy goddess thats all i wonder whether you are untidy  wellyessometimes  i hate untidy girls  thank you colonel stubbs  what i like is a nice prim little woman who never had a pin in the wrong place in her life her cuffs and collars are always as stiff as steel and she never rubs the sleeves of her dresses by leaning about like some young ladies  thats what i do  my young woman never sits down lest she should crease her dress my young woman never lets her ribbons get tangled my young woman can dress upon £40 ayear and always look as though she came out of a bandbox  i dont believe youve got a young woman colonel stubbs  well no i haventexcept in my imagination  if so he too must have his angel of light do you ever dream about her  oh dear yes i dream that she does scold so awfully when i have her to myself in my dreams you know im married to her and she always wants me to eat hashed mutton now if there is one thing that makes me more sick than another it is hashed mutton of course i shall marry her in some of my waking moments and then i shall have to eat hashed mutton for ever  then captain batsby put in another word i should so like to be allowed to give you a lead tomorrow  oh thank youbut id rather not have it said ayala who was altogether in the dark thinking that a lead might be some present which she would not wish to accept from captain batsby  i mean that i should like to show you a line if we get a run  what is a line asked ayala  a line why a line is just a leadkeep your eye on me and ill take the fences where you can follow without coming to grief  oh said ayala thats a lead is it colonel stubbs is going to give my friend and me a lead as long as we stay here  no man ever ought to coach more than one lady at once said the captain showing his erudition youre sure to come on top of one another if there are two  but colonel stubbs is especially told by the marchesa to look after both of us said ayala almost angrily then she turned her shoulder to him and was soon intent upon further instructions from the colonel  the following morning was fine and all the ladies in the house were packed on to the top of sir harrys drag the colonel sat behind sir harry on the plea that he was wanted to take care of the two girls captain batsby and three other gentlemen were put inside where they consoled themselves with unlimited tobacco in this way they were driven to a spot called rufford cross roads where they found tony tappett sitting perfectly quiescent on his old mare while the hounds were seated around him on the grassy sides of the roads with him was talking a stout almost middleaged gentleman in a scarlet coat and natty pinktop boots who was the owner of all the country around this was lord rufford who a few years since was known as one of the hardest riders in those parts but he had degenerated into matrimony was now the happy father of halfadozen babies and was hardly ever seen to jump over a fence but he still came out when the meets were not too distant and carefully performed that first duty of an english country gentlemanthe preservation of foxes though he did not ride much no one liked a little hunting gossip better than lord rufford it was however observed that even in regard to hunting he was apt to quote the authority of his wife  oh yes my lord said tony therell sure to be a fox at dillsborough but well find one afore we get to rufford my lord  lady rufford says there hasnt been a fox seen in the home woods this week  her ladyship will be sure to know said tony  do you remember that fence where poor major caneback got his fall six years ago asked the lord  seven years next christmas my lord said tony he never put a leg across a saddle again poor fellow i remember him well my lord a man who could andle a orse wonderful though he didnt know ow to ride to ounds not according to my idea to get your animal to carry you through never mind ow long the thing is thats my idea of riding to ounds my lord the major was for always making a orse jump over everything i never wants em to jump over nothing i cant helpi dont my lord  thats just what her ladyship is always saying to me said lord rufford and i do pretty much what her ladyship tells me  on this occasion lady rufford had been quite right about the home covers no doubt she generally was right in any assertion she made as to her husbands affairs after drawing them tony trotted on towards dillsborough running his hounds through a few little springs which lay near his way as they went colonel stubbs rode between the two girls whenever i see rufford said the colonel he does me a world of good  what good can a fat man like that do to you said nina  he is a continual sermon against marriage if i could see rufford once a week i know that i should be safe  he seems to me to be a very comfortable old gentleman said ayala  old seven years ago he was acknowledged to be the one undisputed paragon of a young man in this county no one else dreamed of looking at a young lady if he chose to turn his eyes in that direction he was handsome as apollo  he an apollo said nina  the best apollo there then was in these parts and every one knew that he had forty thousand ayear to spend now he is supposed to be the best hand in the house at rocking the cradle  do you mean to say that he nurses the babies asked ayala  he looks as if he did at any rate he never goes ten miles away from his door without having lady rufford with him and is always tucked up at night just at halfpast ten by her ladyships own maid ten years ago he would generally have been found at midnight with cards in his hand and a cigar in his mouth now he is allowed two cigarettes aday well mr twentyman how are you getting on this he said to a good looking better sort of farmer who came up riding a remarkably strong horse and dressed in pink and white cords  thank ye colonel pretty well considering how hard the times are a man who owns a few acres and tries to farm them must be on the road to ruin nowadays thats what im always telling my wife so that she may know what she has got to expect mr twentyman had been married just twelve months  she isnt much frightened i daresay said the colonel  shes young you see continued the farmer and hasnt settled herself down yet to the sorrows of life this was that mr lawrence twentyman who married kate masters the youngest daughter of old masters the attorney at dillsborough and sister of mrs morton wife of the squire of bragton by the holy said twentyman suddenly the hounds have put a fox out of that little spinney     chapter xxiv  rufford crossroads   ayala who had been listening attentively to the conversation of mr twentyman and been feeling that she was being initiated every moment into a new phase of lifewho had been endeavouring to make some connection in her mind between the new charms of the world around her and that world of her dreams that was ever present to her and had as yet simply determined that neither could lord rufford or mr twentyman have ever been an angel of lightat once straightened herself in her saddle and prepared herself for the doing of something memorable it was evident to her that mr twentyman considered that the moment for action had come he did not gallop off wildly as did four or five others but stood still for a moment looking intently at a few hounds who with their tails feathering in the air and with their noses down seemed at the same time to be irresolute and determined knowing that the scent was there but not yet quite fixed as to its line half a moment colonel he said standing up in his stirrups with his left hand raised while his right held his reins and his whip close down on his horses neck half a moment he only whispered and then shook his head angrily as he heard the illtimed shouting of one or two men who had already reached the other side of the little skirting of trees i wish fred botseys tongue were tied to his teeth he said still whispering now colonel they have it theres a little lane to the right and a gate after that the countrys open and theres nothing which the ladies nags cant do i know the country so well youd perhaps better come with me for a bit  he knows all about it said the colonel to ayala do as he tells you  ayala and nina both were quick enough to obey twentyman dashed along the lane while the girls followed him with the colonel after them when they were at the huntinggate already spoken of old tony tappett was with them trotting impatient to get to the hounds courteously giving place to the ladieswhom however in his heart he wished at home in bedand then thrusting himself through the gate in front of the colonel d their pigheaded folly he said as he came up to his friend twentymanthey knows no more about it than if theyd just come from beind a counterolloaing olloaing olloaingas if olloaingd make a fox break owsomever es off now and theyve got cranbury brook between them and his line this he said in a squeaking little voice intended to be jocose and satirical shaking his head as he rode this last idea seemed to give him great consolation  it was the consideration deep and wellfounded as to the cranbury which had induced larry twentyman to pause on the road when he had paused and then to make for the lane and the gate the direction had hardly seemed to be that of the hounds but larry knew the spinney knew the brookknew the fox perhapsand was aware of the spot at which the brute would cross the water if he did cross it the brute did cross the water and therefore there was cranbury brook between many of the forward riders and his line  sir harry was then with them and two or three other farmers but larry had a lead and the two girls were with him tony tappett though he had got up to his hounds did not endeavour to ride straight to them as did larry twentyman he was old and unambitious very anxious to know where his hounds were so that he might be with them should they want the assistance of his voice and counsel anxious to be near enough to take their fox from them should they run into him but taking no glory in jumping over a fence if he could avoid it creeping about here and there knowing from experience nearly every turn in the animals mind aware of every impediment which would delay him riding fast only when the impediments were far between taking no amusement to himself out of the riding but with his heart cruelly bloodily ruthlessly set upon killing the animal before him to kill his fox he would imperil his neck but for the glory of riding he would not soil his boots if he could help it after the girls came the colonel somewhat shorn of his honour in that he was no longer giving them a lead but doing his best to maintain the pace which twentyman was making very good now young ladies said twentyman give them their heads and let them do it just as they pleasealongside of each other and not too near to me it was a brooka confluent of cranbury brook and was wide enough to require a good deal of jumping it may be supposed that the two young ladies did not understand much of the instructions given to them to hold their breath and be brave was the only idea present to them the rest must come from instinct and chance the other side of the brook was heaventhis would be purgatory larry fearing perhaps that the order as to their not being too near might not be obeyed added a little to his own pace so as to be clear of them nevertheless they were only a few strides behind and had larrys horse missed his footing there would have been a mess as it was they took the brook side by side close to each other and landed full of delight and glory on the opposite bank bravo young ladies shouted twentyman  oh nina that is divine said ayala nina was a little too much out of breath for answering but simply threw up her eyes to heaven and made a flourish with her whip intended to be expressive of her perfect joy  away went larry and away went the girls with him quite unconscious that the colonels horse had balked the brook and then jumped into itquite unconscious that sir harry seeing the colonels catastrophe had followed tony a quarter of a mile up the brook to a ford even in the soft bosoms of young ladies the devil take the hindmost will be the motto most appropriate for hunting larry twentyman of whom they had never heard before was now the god of their idolatry where larry twentyman might go it was manifestly their duty to follow even though they should never see the poor colonel again they recked nothing of the fox or of the hounds or of the master or even of the huntsman they had a man before them to show them the way and as long as they could keep him in sight each was determined to be at any rate as good as the other to give larry his due it must be acknowledged that he was thoroughly thoughtful of them at every fence encountered he studied the spot at which they would be least likely to fall he had to remember also that there were two of them together and that he had made himself in a way responsible for the safety of both all this he did and did well because he knew his business with the exception of the waterjump the country over which they passed was not difficult for a time there was a run of gates each of which their guide was able to open for them and as they came near to dillsborough wood there were gaps in most of the fences but it seemed to the girls that they had galloped over monstrous hedges and leapt over walls which it would almost take a strong man to climb the brook howeverthe river as it seemed to themhad been the crowning glory ayala was sure that that brook would never be forgotten by her even the angel of light was hardly more heavenly than the brook  that the fox was running for dillsborough wood was a fact well known both to tony tappett and mr larry twentyman a fox crossing the brook from the rufford side would be sure to run to dillsborough wood when larry with the two girls were just about to enter the ride there was old tony standing up on his horse at the corner looking into the covert and now also a crowd of horsemen came rushing up who had made their way along the road and had passed up to the wood through mr twentymans farmyardfor as it happened here it was that mr twentyman lived and farmed his own land then came sir harry colonel stubbs and some others who had followed the line throughoutthe colonel with his boots full of water as he had been forced to get off his horse in the bed of the brook sir harry himself was not in the best of humoursas will sometimes be the case with masters when they fail to see the cream of a run i never saw such riding in my life said sir harry as though some great sin had been committed by those to whom he was addressing himself larry turned round and winked at the two girls knowing that if sin had been committed they three were the sinners the girls understood nothing about it but still thought that larry twentyman was divine  while they were standing about on the rides tony was still at his work the riding was over but the fox had to be killed and dillsborough wood was a covert in which a fox will often require a large amount of killing no happier home for the vulpine deity exists among the shires of england there are earths there deep capacious full of nurseries but these on the present occasion were debarred from the poor stranger by the wicked ingenuity of man but there were deep dells in which the brambles and bracken were so thick that no hound careful of his snout would penetrate them the undergrowth of the wood was so interwoven that no huntsman could see through its depths there were dark nooks so impervious that any fox ignorant of the theory of his own scent must have wondered why a hound should have been induced to creep into spaces so narrow from one side to another of the wood the hunted brute would traverse and always seem to have at last succeeded in putting his persecutors at fault so it was on this occasion the run while it lasted had occupied perhaps threequarters of an hour and during a time equally long poor old tony was to be seen scurrying from one side of the wood to another and was to be heard loudly swearing at his attendant whips because the hounds did not follow his footsteps as quickly as his soul desired  i never mean to put on a pair of topboots again as long as i live said the colonel at this time a little knot of horsemen was stationed in a knoll in the centre of the wood waiting till they should hear the fatal whoop among them were nina ayala the colonel larry twentyman and captain batsby  give up topboots said larry you dont mean to say youll ride in black  topboots black boots spurs breeches and red coat i renounce them all from this moment if ever im seen in a hunting field again it will be in a pair of trousers with overalls  now youre joking colonel said larry  why wont you wear a red coat any more said ayala  because im disgraced for ever i came out to coach two young women and give them a lead and all ive done was to tumble into a brook while a better man has taken my charge away from me  oh jonathan i am so sorry said nina particularly about your getting into the water  oh colonel stubbs we ought to have stopped said ayala  it was my only comfort to see how very little i was wanted said the colonel if i had broke my neck instead of wetting my feet it would have been just the same to some people  oh jonathan said nina really shocked  we ought to have stopped i know we ought to have stopped said ayala almost crying  nobody ever stops for any one out hunting said twentyman laying down a great law  i should think not said captain batsby who had hardly been off the road all the time  i am sure the colonel will not be angry with me because i took the young ladies on said larry  the colonel is such a muff said the colonel himself that he will never presume to be angry with anybody again but if my cousin and miss dormer are not very much obliged to you for what you have done for them there will be nothing of gratitude left in the female british bosom you have probably given to them the most triumphant moment of their existence  it was their own riding colonel i had nothing to do with it  i am so much obliged to you sir said nina  and so am i said ayala though it was such a pity that colonel stubbs got into the water  at that moment came the long expected call tony tappett had killed his fox after crossing and recrossing through the wood half a score of times is it all over asked ayala as they hurried down the knoll and scurried down the line to get to the spot outside the wood to which tony was dragging the carcase of his defeated enemy  its all over for him said larry a good fox he was but hell never run again he is one of them bred at littlecotes the foxes bred at littlecotes always run  and is he dead asked nina poor fellow i wish it wasnt necessary to kill them then they stood by till they saw the body of the victim thrown up into the air and fall amongst the bloodsmirched upturned noses of the expectant pack  i call that a pretty little run sir harry said larry twentyman  pretty well said sir harry the pace wasnt very great or that pony of mine which miss dormer is riding could not have lived with it  horses sir harry dont want so much pace if they are allowed to go straight its when a man doesnt get well away or has made a mess with his fences that he needs an extra allowance of pace to catch the hounds if youre once with them and can go straight you may keep your place without such a deal of legs to this sir harry replied only by a grunt as on the present occasion he had made a mess with his fences as larry twentyman had called it  and now young ladies said larry i hope youll come in and see my missus and her baby and have a little bit of lunch such as it is  nina asked anxiously whether there would not be another fox ayala also was anxious lest in accepting the proffered hospitality she should lose any of the delights of the day but it was at length arranged that a quarter of an hour should be allowed before tony took his hounds over to the bragton coverts immediately larry was off his horse rushing into the house and ordering everyone about it to come forth with bread and cheese and sherry and beer in spite of what he had said of his ruin it was known that larry twentyman was a warm man and that no man in rufford gave what he had to give with a fuller heart his house was in the middle of the rufford and ufford hunting country and the consumption there during the hunting months of bread and cheese sherry and beer must have been immense everyone seemed to be intimate with him and all called for what they wanted as if they were on their own premises on such occasions as these larry was a proud man for no one in those parts carried a lighter heart or was more fond of popularity  the parlour inside was by no means big enough to hold the crowding guests who therefore munched their bread and cheese and drank their beer round the front door without dismounting from their horses but nina and ayala with their friend the colonel were taken inside to see mrs twentyman and her baby now larry what sort of a run was it said the young mother where did you find him and what line did he take  ill tell you all about it when i come back there are two young ladies for you now to look after then he introduced his wife and the baby which was in her arms the little fellow is only six weeks old and yet she wanted to come to the meet shed have been riding to hounds if id let her  why not said mrs twentyman at any rate i might have gone in the pony carriage and had baby with me  only six weeks old said nina stooping down and kissing the child  he is a darling said ayala i hope hell go out hunting some day  hell want to go six times a week if hes anything like his father said mrs twentyman  and seven times if hes like his mother said larry then again they mounted their nags and trotted off across the high roads to the bragton coverts mrs twentyman with her baby in her arms walked down to the gate at the high road and watched them with longing eyes till tony and the hounds were out of sight  nothing further in the way of hunting was done that day which requires to be recorded they drew various coverts and found a fox or two but the scent which had been so strong in the morning seemed to have gone and the glory of the day was over the two girls and the colonel remained companions during the afternoon and succeeded in making themselves merry over the incident of the brook the colonel was in truth well pleased that larry twentyman should have taken his place though he probably would not have been gratified had he seen captain batsby assume his duties it had been his delight to see the two girls ride and he had been near enough to see them he was one of those men who though fond of hunting take no special glory in it and are devoid of the jealousy of riding not to have a good place in a run was no worse to him than to lose a game of billiards or a rubber of whist let the reader understand that this trait in his character is not mentioned with approbation always to excel and to go ahead of everybody should the present writer thinks be in the heart of every man who rides to hounds there was in our colonel a philosophical way of looking into the thing which perhaps became him as a man but was deleterious to his character as a sportsman  i do so hope youve enjoyed yourself ayala he said as he lifted her from her horse  indeedindeed i have said ayala not noticing the use of her christian name i have been so happy and i am so much obliged to you     chapter xxv  you are not he   ayala had been a week at stalham and according to the understanding which had existed she should now have returned to kingsbury crescent she had come for a week and she had had her week oh what a week it had been so thoroughly happy without a cloud filled full with ecstatic pleasures jonathan stubbs had become to her the pleasantest of friends lady albury had covered her with caresses and little presents nina was the most perfect of friends sir harry had never been cross except for that one moment in the wood and as for spritesprite had nearly realised her idea of an angel of light oh how happy she had been she was to return on the monday having thus comprised two sundays within her elongated week she knew that her heaven was to be at an end but she was grateful and was determined in her gratitude to be happy and cheerful to the close but early on this sunday morning colonel stubbs spoke a word to lady albury that little girl is so thoroughly happy here cannot you prolong it for her just for another three days  is it to be for heror for colonel stubbs who is enamoured of the little girl asked lady albury  for both said the colonel rather gravely  are you in earnest  what do you call earnest i do love to see a pretty creature enjoy herself thoroughly as she does if you will make her stay till thursday albury will let her ride the little horse again at star cross on wednesday  of course she shall stayall the season if you wish it she is indeed a happy girl if you are in earnest  then it was settled and lady albury in her happiest manner informed ayala that she was not to be allowed to take her departure till after she had ridden sprite once again sir harry says that you have given the little horse quite a name and that you must finish off his character for him at star cross as was the heart of the peri when the gate of paradise was opened for her so was the heart of ayala there were to be four days with the fourth as a huntingday before she need think of going there was an eternity of bliss before her  but aunt margaret she said not however doubting for a moment that she would stay who cares for a frowning aunt at the distance of an eternity i fear that in the ecstacy of her joy she had forgotten the promise made that she would always remember her aunts goodness to her i will write a note to mrs dosett and make it all straight said lady albury the note was written and whether matters were straight or crooked at kingsbury crescent ayala remained at albury  colonel stubbs had thought about the matter and determined that he was quite in earnest he had he told himself enough for modest livingfor modest living without poverty more would come to him when old general stubbs his uncle should die the general was already past seventy what was the use of independence if he could not allow himself to have the girl whom he really loved had any human being so perfectly lovely as ayala ever flashed before his eyes before was there ever a sweeter voice heard from a womans mouth and then all her little ways and motionsher very trickshow full of charm they were when she would open her eyes and nod her head and pout with her lips he would declare to himself that he could no longer live without her and then every word that fell from her lips seemed to have something in it of pretty humour in fact the colonel was in love and had now resolved that he would give way to his love in spite of his aunt the marchesa and in spite of his own philosophy  he felt by no means sure of success but yet he thought that he might succeed from the moment in which as the reader may remember he had accosted her at the ball and desired her to dance with him in obedience to his aunts behests it had been understood by everyone around him that ayala had liked him they had become fast friends ayala allowed him to do many little things which by some feminine instinct of her own would have been put altogether beyond the reach of captain batsby the colonel knew all this and knew at the same time that he should not trust to it only but still he could not but trust to it in some degree lady albury had told him that ayala would be a happy girl if he were in earnest and he himself was well aware of ayalas dependent position and of the discomforts of kingsbury crescent ayala had spoken quite openly to him of kingsbury crescent as to a confidential friend but on all that he did not lean much as being in his favour he could understand that such a girl as ayala would not accept a husband merely with the object of avoiding domestic poverty little qualms of doubt came upon him as he remembered the nature of the girl so that he confessed to himself that lady albury knew nothing about it but nevertheless he hoped his red hair and his ugly face had never yet stood against him among the women with whom he had lived he had been taught by popularity to think himself a popular manand then ayala had shown so many signs of her friendship  there was shooting on saturday and he went out with the shooters saying nothing to any one of an intended early return but at three oclock he was back at the house then he found that ayala was out in the carriage and he waited he sat in the library pretending to read till he heard the sounds of the carriagewheels and then he met the ladies in the hall are they all home from shooting asked lady albury the colonel explained that no one was home but himself he had missed three cockpheasants running and had then come away in disgust i am the most ignominious creature in existence he said laughing one day i tumble into a ditch three feet wide  it was ten yards at least said nina jealous as to the glory of her jump  and today i cannot hit a bird i shall take to writing a book and leave the severer pursuit of sport to more enterprising persons then suddenly turning round he said to ayala are you goodnatured enough to come and take a walk with me in the shrubbery  ayala taken somewhat by surprise at the request looked up into lady alburys face go with him my dear if you are not tired said lady albury he deserves consolation after all his good deeds to you ayala still doubted though she was on terms of pleasant friendship with the man yet she felt almost awestruck at this sudden request that she should walk alone with him but not to do so especially after lady alburys injunction would have been peculiar she certainly was not tired and had such a walk come naturally it would have been an additional pleasure to her but now though she went she hesitated and showed her hesitation  are you afraid to come with me he said as soon as they were out on the gravel together  afraid oh dear no i should not be afraid to go anywhere with you i think only it seemed odd that you did not ask nina too  shall i tell you why  why was it  because i have something to say to you which i do not want nina to hear just at this moment and then i thought that we were such friends that you would not mind coming with me  of course we are said ayala  i dont know why it should be so but i seem to have known you years instead of days  perhaps that is because you knew papa  more likely because i have learnt to know your papas daughter  do you mean lucy  i mean ayala  that is saying the same thing twice over you know me because you know me  just that how long do you suppose i have known that mrs gregory who sat opposite to us yesterday  how can i tell  just fifteen years i was going to harrow when she came as a young girl to stay with my mother her people and my people had known each other for the last fifty years since that i have seen her constantly and of course we are very intimate  i suppose so  i know as much about her after all that as if we had lived in two different hemispheres and couldnt speak a word of each others language there isnt a thought or a feeling in common between us i ask after her husband and her children and then tell her its going to rain she says something about the old generals health and then there is an end of everything between us when next we meet we do it all over again  how very uninteresting said ayala  very uninteresting it is because there are so many mrs gregorys about that i like to go down to drumcaller and live by myself perhaps youre a mrs gregory to somebody  why should i be a mrs gregory i dont think i am at all like mrs gregory  not to me ayala now she heard the ayala and felt something of what it meant there had been moments at which she had almost disliked to hear him call her miss dormer but nownow she wished that he had not called her ayala she strove to assume a serious expression of face but having done so she could not dare to turn it up towards him the glance of her little anger if there was any fell only upon the ground it is because you are to me a creature so essentially different from mrs gregory that i seem to know you so well i never want to go to drumcaller if you are near meor if i think of drumcaller it is that i might be there with you  i am sure the place is very pretty but i dont suppose i shall ever see it  do you know about your sister and mr hamel  yes said ayala surprised she has told me all about it how do you know  he was staying at drumcallerhe and i together with no one elsewhen he went over to ask her i never saw a man so happy as when he came back from glenbogie he had got all that he wanted in the world  i do so love him because he loves her  and i love herbecause she loves you  it is not the same you know said ayala trying to think it all out  may i not love her  he is to be my brother thats why i love him she cant be your sister the poor girl though she had tried to think it all out had not thought very far  can she not he said  of course not lucy is to marry mr hamel  and whom am i to marry then she saw it all ayalaayalawho is to be my wife  i do not know she saidspeaking with a gruff voice but still in a whisper with a manner altogether differentthinking how well it would be that she should be taken at once back into the house  do you not know whom i would fain have as my wife then he felt that it behoved him to speak out plainly he was already sure that she would not at once tell him that it should be as he would have itthat she would not instantly throw herself into his arms but he must speak plainly to her and then fight his cause as best he might ayala i have asked you to come out with me that i might ask you to be my wife it is that that i did not wish nina to hear at once if you will put out your hand and say that it shall be so nina and all the world shall know it i shall be as proud then as hamel and as happyhappier i think it seems to me that no one can love as i do now ayala it has grown upon me from hour to hour as i have seen you when i first took you away to that dance it was so already do you remember that night at the theatrewhen i had come away from everything and striven so hard that i might be near to you before you went back to your home ayala i loved you then so dearlybut not as i love you now when i saw you riding away from me yesterday when i could not get over the brook i told myself that unless i might catch you at last and have you all to myself i could never again be happy do you remember when you stooped down and kissed that mans baby at the farmhouse oh ayala i thought then that if you would not be my wifeif you would not be my wifei should never have wife never should have baby never should have home of my own she walked on by his side listening but she had not a word to say to him it had been easy enough to her to reject and to rebuke and to scorn tom tringle when he had persisted in his suit but she knew not with what words to reject this man who stood so high in her estimation who was in many respects so perfect whom she so thoroughly likedbut whom nevertheless she must reject he was not the angel of lightcould never be the angel of light there was nothing there of the azure wings upon which should soar the all but celestial being to whom she could condescend to give herself and her love he was pleasant good friendly kindheartedall that a friend or a brother should be but he was not the angel of light she was sure of that she told herself that she was quite sure of it as she walked beside him in silence along the path you know what i mean ayala when i tell you that i love you he continued but still she made no answer i have seen at last the one human being with whom i feel that i can be happy to spend my life and having seen her i ask her to be my wife the hope has been dwelling with me and growing since i first met you shall it be a vain hope ayala may i still hope  no she said abruptly  is that all  it is all that i can say  is that one no to be the end of everything between us  i dont know what else i ought to say to you colonel stubbs  do you mean that you can never love me  never she said  that is a hard wordand hardly friendly is there to be no more than one hard word between you and me though i did not venture to think that you could tell me that you loved me i looked for something kinder something gentler than that      from such a sharp and waspish word as no     to pluck the sting   ayala did not know the lines i have quoted but the idea conveyed in them was present clearly to her mind she would fain have told him had she known how to do so that her heart was very gentle towards him was very kind gentle and kind as a sistersbut that she could not love him so as to become his wife you are not henot he not that angel of light which must come to me radiant with poetry beautiful to the eye full of all excellences of art lifted above the earth by the qualities of his mindsuch a one as must come to me if it be that i am ever to confess that i love you are not he and i cannot love you but you shall be the next to him in my estimation and you are already so dear to me that i would be tender to you would be gentleif only i knew how it was all there clear enough in her mind but she had not the words i dont know what it is that i ought to say she exclaimed through her sobs  the truth at any rate he answered sternly but not the truth half and half after the fashion of some young ladies do not think that you should palter with the truth either because it may not be palatable to me or seem decorous to yourself to my happiness this matter is all important and you are something to my happiness if only because i have risked it on your love tell mewhy cannot you love me  the altered tone of his voice which now had in it something of severity seemed to give her more power  it is because then she paused  because why out with it whatever it is if it be something that a man may remedy i will remedy it do not fear to hurt me is it because i am ugly that i cannot remedy she did not dare to tell him that it was so but she looked up at him not dissenting by any motion of her head then god help me for ugly i must remain  it is not that only  is it because my name is stubbsjonathan stubbs now she did assent nodding her head at him he had bade her tell him the truth and she was so anxious to do as he bade her if it be so ayala i must tell you that you are wrongwrong and foolish that you are carried away by a feeling of romance which is a false romance far be it from me to say that i could make you happy but i am sure that your happiness cannot be made and cannot be marred by such accidents as that do you think that my means are not sufficient  nono she cried i know nothing of your means if i could love you i would not condescend to askeven to hear  there is no other man i think  there is no other man  but your imagination has depicted to you something grander than i amthen she assented quickly turning round and nodding her head to himsome one who shall better respond to that spirit of poetry which is within you again she nodded her head approvingly as though to assure him that now he knew the whole truth then ayala i must strive to soar till i can approach your dreams but if you dare to desire things which are really grand do not allow yourself to be mean at the same time do not let the sound of a name move you or i shall not believe in your aspirations now shall i take you back to the house  back to the house they went and there was not another word spoken between them by those last words of his she had felt herself to be rebuked if it were possible that he could ask her again whether that sound jonathan stubbs had anything to do with it she would let him know now by some signal that she no longer found a barrier in the name but there were other barriersbarriers which he himself had not pretended to call vain as to his ugliness that he had confessed he could not remedy calling on god to pity him because he was so and as for that something grander which he had described and for which her soul sighed he had simply said that he would seek for it she was sure that he would not find it it was not to such as he that the something granderwhich was to be the peculiar attribute of the angel of lightcould be accorded but he had owned that the something grander might exist     chapter xxvi  the finest hero that i ever knew   the colonel and ayala returned to the house without a word when they were passing through the hall she turned to go at once up the stairs to her own room as she did so he put out his hand to her and she took it but she passed on without speaking and when she was alone she considered it over all in her own mind there could be no doubt that she was right of that she was quite sure it was certainly a fixed law that a girl should not marry a man unless she loved him she did not love this man and therefore she ought not to marry him but there were some qualms at her heart as to the possible reality of the image which she had created for her own idolatry and she had been wounded when he told her that she should not allow herself to be mean amidst her soarings she had been wounded and yet she knew that he had been right he had intended to teach her the same lesson when he told her the absurd story of the woman who had been flung out of the window she could not love him but that name of his should never again be a reason for not doing so let the angel of light come to her with his necessary angelic qualities and no want of euphony in a sound should be a barrier to him nor in truth could any outside appearance be an attribute of angelic light the angel of light might be there even with red hair something as to the truth of this also came across her though the colonel had not rebuked her on that head  but how should she carry herself now during the four days which remained to her at stalham park all the loveliness seemed to depart from her prospect she would hardly know how to open her mouth before her late friend she suspected that lady albury knew with what purpose the colonel had taken her out into the shrubbery and she would not dare to look lady albury in the face how should she answer nina if nina were to ask her questions about the walk the hunt for next wednesday was no longer a delight to which she could look forward how would it be possible that colonel stubbs should direct her now as to her riding and instruct her as to her conduct in the huntingfield it would be better for her that she should return at once to kingsbury crescent  as she thought of this there did come upon her a reflection that had she been able to accept colonel stubbss offer there would have been an end for ever to the miseries of her aunts house she would have been lifted at once into the mode of life in which the man lived instead of being a stranger admitted by special grace into such an elysium as that of stalham park she would become one of those to whom such an elysium belonged almost of right by her own gifts she would have won her way into that upper and brighter life which seemed to her to be all smiles and all joy as to his income she thought nothing and cared nothing he lived with men who had horses and carriages and who spent their time in pleasurable pursuits and she would live amidst ladies who were always arrayed in bright garments who too had horses and carriages at their command and were never troubled by those sordid cares which made life at kingsbury crescent so sad and tedious one little word would have done it all for her would have enabled her to take the step by which she would be placed among the bright ones of the earth  but the remembrance of all this only made her firmer in her resolution if there was any law of right and wrong fixed absolutely in her bosom it was thisthat no question of happiness or unhappiness of suffering or joy would affect her duty to the angel of light she owed herself to him should he come to seek her she owed herself to him no less even should he fail to come and she owed herself equally whether he should be rich or poor as she was fortifying herself with these assurances nina came to ask her whether she would not come down to tea ayala pleaded headache and said that she would rest till dinner has anything happened asked nina ayala simply begged that she might be asked no questions then because her head was aching if you do not tell me everything i shall think you are no true friend said nina as she left the room  as evening drew on she dressed for dinner and went down into the drawingroom in doing so it was necessary to pass through the billiardroom and there she found colonel stubbs knocking about the balls are you dressed for dinner he exclaimed i havent begun to think of it yet and sir harry hates a man when he comes in late that wretch batsby has beaten me four games with that he rushed off putting down the cue with a rattle and seeming to ayala to have recovered altogether from the late prostration of his spirits  in the drawingroom ayala was for a few minutes alone and then as she was glad to see three or four ladies all came in at once so that no question could be asked her by lady albury they went into dinner without the colonel who was in truth late and she was taken in by mr gosling whose pretty little wife was just opposite to her on the other side of her sat lord rufford who had come to stalham with his wife for a day or two and who immediately began to congratulate her on the performance of the day before i am told you jumped the cranbury brook he said i should as soon think of jumping the serpentine  i did it because somebody told me  ah said lord rufford with a sigh there is nothing like ignorance innocence and youth combined but why didnt colonel stubbs get over after you  because colonel stubbs couldnt said that gentleman as he took his seat in the vacant chair  it may be possible said sir harry that a gentleman should not be able to jump over cranbury brook but any gentleman if he will take a little trouble may come down in time for dinner  now that i have been duly snubbed right and left said the colonel perhaps i may eat my soup  ayala who had expected she hardly knew what further troubles and who had almost feared that nobody would speak to her because she had misbehaved herself endeavoured to take heart of grace when she found that all around her including the colonel himself were as pleasant as ever she had fancied that lady albury had looked at her specially when colonel stubbs took his seat and she had specially noticed the fact that his chair had not been next her own these little matters she was aware lady albury managed herself and was aware also that in accordance with the due rotation of things she and the colonel should have been placed together she was glad that it was not so but at the same time she was confident that lady albury knew something of what had passed between herself and her suitor the evening however went off easily and nothing occurred to disturb her except that the colonel had called her by her christian name when as usual he brought to her a cup of tea in the drawingroom oh that he would continue to do so and yet not demand from her more than their old friendship  the next morning was sunday and they all went to church it was a law at stalham that everyone should go to church on sunday morning sir harry himself who was not supposed to be a peculiarly religious man was always angry when any male guest did not show himself in the enormous family pew i call it d indecent he has been heard to say but nobody was expected to go twiceand consequently nobody ever did go twice lunch was protracted later than usual the men would roam about the grounds with cigars in their mouths and ladies would take to reading in their own rooms in following which occupation they would spend a considerable part of the afternoon asleep on this afternoon lady albury did not go to sleep but contrived to get ayala alone upstairs into her little sittingroom ayala she said with something between a smile and a frown i am afraid i am going to be angry with you  please dont be angry lady albury  if i am right in what i surmise you had an offer made to you yesterday which ought to satisfy the heart of almost any girl in england here she paused but ayala had not a word to say for herself if it was so the best man i know asked you to share his fortune with him  has he told you  but he did  i shall not tell said ayala proudly  i know he did i knew that it was his intention before are you aware what kind of man is my cousin jonathan stubbs has it occurred to you that in truth and gallantry in honour honesty courage and real tenderness he is so perfect as to be quite unlike to the crowd of men you see  i do know that he is good said ayala  good where will you find any one good like him compare him to the other men around him and then say whether he is good can it be possible that you should refuse the love of such a man as that  i dont think i ought to be made to talk about it said ayala hesitating  my dear it is for your own sake and for his when you go away from here it may be so difficult for him to see you again  i dont suppose he will ever want said ayala  it is sufficient that he wants it now what better can you expect for yourself  i expect nothing said ayala proudly i have got nothing and i expect nothing  he will give you everything simply because he loves you my dear i should not take the trouble to tell you all this did i not know that he is a man who ought to be accepted when he asks such a request as that your happiness would be safe in his hands she paused but ayala had not a word to say and he is not a man likely to renew such a request he is too proud for that i can conceive no possible reason for such a refusal unless it be that you are engaged if there be some one else then of course there must be an end of it  there is no one else  then my dear with your prospects it is sheer folly when the general dies he will have over two thousand a year  as if that had anything to do with it said ayala holding herself aloft in her wrath and throwing angry glances at the lady  it is what i call romance said lady albury romance can never make you happy  at any rate it is not riches what you call romance may be what i like best at any rate if i do not love colonel stubbs i am sure i ought not to marry himand i wont  after this there was nothing further to be said ayala thought that she would be turned out of the roomalmost out of the house in disgrace but lady albury who was simply playing her part was not in the least angry well my dear she said praypray think better of it i am in earnest of course because of my cousinbecause he seems to have put his heart upon it he is just the man to be absolutely in love when he is in love but i would not speak as i do unless i were sure that he would make you happy my cousin jonathan is to me the finest hero that i know when a man is a hero he shouldnt be brokenhearted for want of a womans smilesshould he  she ought not to smile unless she loves him said ayala as she left the room  the monday and tuesday went very quietly lady albury said nothing more on the great subject and the colonel behaved himself exactly as though there had been no word of love at all there was nothing special said about the wednesdays hunt through the two days till ayala almost thought that there would be no hunt for her nor indeed did she much wish for it it had been the colonel who had instigated her to deeds of daring and under his sanction that she had ventured to ride she would hardly know how to go through the wednesdaywhether still to trust him or whether to hold herself aloof from him when nothing was said on the subject till late on the evening of the tuesday she had almost resolved that she would not put on her habit when the morning came but just as she was about to leave the drawingroom with her bedcandle colonel stubbs came to her most of us ride to the meet tomorrow he said but you and nina shall be taken in the waggonette so as to save you a little it is all arranged she bowed and thanked him going to bed almost sorry that it should have been so settled when the morning came nina could not ride she had hurt her foot and coming early into ayalas room declared with tears that she could not go then neither shall i said ayala who was at that moment preparing to put on her habit  but you must it is all settled and sir harry would be offended if you did not go what has jonathan done that you should refuse to ride with him because i am lame  nothing said ayala  oh ayala do tell me i should tell you everything of course you must hunt whatever it is even though he should have offered and you refused him of course you must go  must i said ayala  then you have refused him  i have oh nina pray do not speak of it do not think of it if you can help it why should everything be disturbed because i have been a fool  then you think you have been a fool  other people think so but if so i shall at any rate be constant to my folly what i mean is that it has been done and should be passed over as done with i am quite sure that i ought not to be scolded but lady albury did scold me then they went down together to breakfast ayala having prepared herself properly for the huntingfield  in the waggonette there were with her lady albury mrs gosling and nina who was not prevented by her lameness from going to the meet the gentlemen all rode so that there was no immediate difficulty as to colonel stubbs but when she had been put on her horse by his assistance and found herself compelled to ride away from the carriage apparently under his especial guidance her heart misgave her and she thoroughly wished that she was at home in the crescent though she was specially under his guidance there were at first others close around her and while they were on the road going to the covert which they were to draw conversation was kept up so that it was not necessary for her to speakbut what should she do when she should find herself alone with him as would certainly soon be the case it soon was the case the hounds were at work in a large wood in which she was told they might possibly pass the best part of the day and it was not long before the men had dispersed themselves some on this side some on that and she found herself with no one near her but the colonel ayala he said of course you know that it is my duty to look after you and to do it better if i can than i did on friday  i understand she said  do not let any remembrance of that walk on saturday interfere with your happiness today who knows when you may be out hunting again  never she said i dont suppose i shall ever hunt again  carpe diem he said laughing do you know what carpe diem means  it is latin perhaps  yes and therefore you are not supposed to understand it this is what it means as an hour for joy has come do not let any trouble interfere with it let it all be for this day at least as though there had been no walk in the stalham woods there is larry twentyman if i break down as i did on friday you may always trust to him larry and you are old friends now  carpe diem she said to herself oh yes if it were only possible how is one to carpe diem with ones heart full of troubles and it was the less possible because this man whom she had rejected was so anxious to do everything for her happiness lady albury had told her that he was a herothat he was perfect in honour honesty and gallantry and she felt inclined to own that lady albury was almost right yetyet how far was he from that image of manly perfection which her daily thoughts had created for her could she have found an appropriate word with which to thank him she would have done so but there was no such word and larry twentyman was now with them taking off his hat and overflowing with compliments oh miss dormer i am so delighted to see you out again  how is the baby mr twentyman  brisk as a bee and hungry as a hunter  and how is mrs twentyman  brisker and hungrier than the baby what do you think of the day colonel  a very good sort of day twentyman if we were anywhere out of these big woods larry shook his head solemnly the mudcombe woods in which they were now at work had been known to occupy tony tappett and his whole pack from eleven oclock till the dusk of evening weve got to draw them of course continued the colonel then mr twentyman discoursed at some length on the excellence of mudcombe woods what would any county be without a nursery for young foxes gorsecoverts hedgerows and little spinneys would be of no avail unless there were some grandly wild domain in which maternal and paternal foxes could roam in comparative security all this was just as ayala would have it because it enabled her to ask questions and saved her from subjects which might be painful to her  the day in truth was not propitious to hunting even foxes were found in plenty and two of them were killed within the recesses of the wood but on no occasion did they run a mile into the open for ayala it was very well because she was galloping hither and thither and because before the day was over she found herself able to talk to the colonel in her wonted manner but there was no great glory for her as had been the glory of little cranbury brook  on the next morning she was taken back to london and handed over to her aunt in kingsbury crescent without another word having been spoken by colonel stubbs in reference to his love     chapter xxvii  lady alburys letter   i have had a letter from lady albury said aunt margaret almost as soon as ayala had taken off her hat and cloak  yes i know aunt margaret she wrote to ask that i might stay for four more days i hope it was not wrong  i have had another letter since that on monday about it i have determined to show it you there it is you had better read it by yourself and i will come to you again in half an hour then very solemnly but with no trace of illhumour mrs dosett left the room there was something in her tone and gait so exceedingly solemn that ayala was almost frightened of course the letter must be about colonel stubbs and of course the writer of it would find fault with her she was conscious that she was adding one to her terribly long list of sins in not consenting to marry colonel stubbs it was her misfortune that all her friends found fault with everything that she did among them there was not one not even nina who fully sympathised with her not even to lucy could she expatiate with a certainty of sympathy in regard to the angel of light and now though her aunt was apparently not angryonly solemnshe felt already sure that she was to be told that it was her duty to marry colonel stubbs it was only the other day that her aunt was preaching to her as to the propriety of marrying her cousin tom it seemed she said to herself that people thought that a girl was bound to marry any man who could provide a house for her and bread to eat and clothes to wear all this passed through her mind as she slowly drew lady alburys letter from the envelope and prepared to read it the letter was as follows      stalham monday 18th november 18     dear madam     your niece will return to you as you request on    thursday but before she reaches you i think it my duty    to inform you of a little circumstance which has occurred    here my cousin colonel jonathan stubbs who is also    the nephew of the marchesa baldoni has made miss dormer    an offer i am bound to add that i did not think it    improbable that it would be so when i called on your    husband and begged him to allow your niece to come to    us i did not then know my cousins intention as a fact    i doubt whether he knew it himself but from what i had    heard i thought it probable and as i conceive that any    young lady would be fortunate in becoming my cousins    wife i had no scruple     he has proposed to her and she has rejected him he has    set his heart upon the matter and i am most anxious that    he should succeed because i know him to be a man who    will not easily brook disappointment where he has set his    heart of all men i know he is the most steadfast in his    purpose     i took the liberty of speaking to your niece on the    subject and am disposed to think that she is deferred    by some feeling of foolish romance partly because she    does not like the name partly because my cousin is not a    handsome man in a girls eyesmore probably however    she has built up to herself some poetic fiction and    dreams of she knows not what if it be so it is a pity    that she should lose an opportunity of settling herself    well and happily in life she gave as a reason that she    did not love him my experience is not so long as yours    perhaps but such as i have has taught me to think that    a wife will love her husband when she finds herself used    well at all points mercenary marriages are of course    bad but it is a pity i think that a girl such as your    niece should lose the chance of so much happiness by a    freak of romance     colonel stubbs who is only twentyeight years of age has    a staff appointment at aldershot he has private means of    his own on which alone he would be justified in marrying    on the death of his uncle general stubbs he will inherit    a considerable accession of fortune he is not of course    a rich man but he has ample for the wants of a family    in all other good gifts temper manliness truth and    tenderness i know no one to excel him i should trust any    young friend of my own into his hands with perfect safety     i have thought it right to tell you this you will use    your own judgment in saying what you think fit to your    niece should she be made to understand that her own    immediate friends approve of the offer she would probably    be induced to accept it i have not heard my cousin say    what may be his future plans i think it possible that    as he is quite in earnest he will not take one repulse    should he ask again i hope that your niece may receive    him with altered views     pray believe me to be my dear madam    yours sincerely     rosaline albury   ayala read the letter twice over before her aunt returned to her and as she read it felt something of a feeling of renewed kindness come upon her in reference to the writer of itnot that she was in the least changed in her own resolution but that she liked lady albury for wishing to change her the reasons given however were altogether impotent with her colonel stubbs had the means of keeping a wife if that were a reason then also ought she to marry her cousin tom tringle colonel stubbs was good and true but so also very probably was tom tringle she would not compare the two men she knew that her cousin tom was altogether distasteful to her while she took delight in the companionship of the colonel but the reasons for marrying one were to her thinking as strong as for marrying the other there could be only one valid excuse for marriagethat of adoring the manand she was quite sure that she did not adore colonel jonathan stubbs lady albury had said in her letter that a girl would be sure to love a man who treated her well after marriage but that would not suffice for her were she to marry at all it would be necessary that she should love the man before her marriage  have you read the letter my dear said mrs dosett as she entered the room and closed the door carefully behind her she spoke almost in a whisper and seemed to be altogether changed by the magnitude of the occasion  yes aunt margaret i have read it  i suppose it is true  true it is true in part  you did meet this colonel stubbs  oh yes i met him  and you had met him before  yes aunt margaret he used to come to brook street he is the marchesas nephew  did he this question aunt margaret asked in a very low whisper and her most solemn voice did he make love to you in brook street  no said ayala sharply  not at all  not at all i never thought of such a thing i never dreamed of such a thing when he began talking to me out in the woods at stalham on saturday  had you beenbeen on friendly terms with him  very friendly terms we were quite friends and used to talk about all manner of things i was very fond of him and never afraid of anything that he said to me he was ninas cousin and seemed almost to be my cousin too  then you do like him  of course i do everybody must like him but that is no reason why i should want to marry him  upon this mrs dosett sat silent for awhile turning the great matter over in her thoughts it was quite clear to her that every word which ayala had spoken was true and probable also that lady alburys words were true in her inmost thoughts she regarded ayala as a fool here was a girl who had not a shilling of her own who was simply a burden on relatives whom she did not especially love who was doomed to a life which was essentially distasteful to herfor all this in respect to herself and her house mrs dosett had sense enough to acknowledgewho seemed devoted to the society of rich and gay people and yet would not take the opportunities that were offered her of escaping what she disliked and going to that which she loved two offers had now been made to her both of them thoroughly eligible to neither of which would objection have been made by any of the persons concerned sir thomas had shown himself to be absolutely anxious for the success of his son and now it seemed that the grand relations of this colonel stubbs were in favour of the match what it was in ayala that entitled her to such promotion mrs dosett did not quite perceive to her eyes her niece was a fantastic girl pretty indeed but not endowed with that regular tranquil beauty which she thought to be of all feminine graces the most attractive why tom tringle should have been so deeply smitten with ayala had been a marvel to her and now this story of colonel stubbs was a greater marvel ayala she said you ought to think better of it  think better of what aunt margaret  you have seen what this lady albury says about her cousin colonel stubbs  what has that to do with it  you believe what she says if so why should you not accept him  because i cant said ayala  have you any idea what is to become of your future life said mrs dosett very gravely  not in the least said ayala but that was a fib because she had an idea that in the fullness of time it would be her heavenly fate to put her hand into that of the angel of light  gentlemen wont come running after you always my dear  this was almost as bad as being told by her aunt emmeline that she had encouraged her cousin tom its a great shame to say that i dont want anybody to run after me i never did  no my dear no i dont think that you ever did mrs dosett who was justice itself did acknowledge to herself that of any such fault as that suggested ayala was innocent her fault was quite in the other direction and consisted of an unwillingness to settle herself and to free her relations of the burden of maintaining her when proper opportunities arose for doing so i only want to explain to you that people mustmustmust make their hay while the sun shines you are young now  i am not oneandtwenty yet said ayala proudly  oneandtwenty is a very good time for a girl to marrythat is to say if a proper sort of gentleman asks her  i dont think i ought to be scolded because they dont seem to me to be the proper sort i dont want anybody to come nobody ought to be talked to about it at all if i cared about any one that you or uncle reginald did not approve then you might talk to me but i dont think that anything ought to be said about anybody unless i like him myself so the conversation was over and mrs dosett felt that she had been entirely vanquished  lady alburys letter was shown to mr dosett but he refused to say a word to his niece on the subject in the argument which followed between him and his wife he took his nieces part opposing altogether that idea that hay should be made while the sun shines it simply means selling herself said mr dosett  that is nonsense reginald of course such a girl as ayala has to do the best she can with her good looks what else has she to depend upon  my brotherinlaw will do something for her  i hope he willthough i do not think that a very safe reed to depend upon as she has twice offended him but of course a girl thinks of marrying ayala would be very much disgusted if she were told that she was to be an old maid and live upon £100 a year supplied by sir thomass bounty it might have been that she would have to do itbut now that chances are open she ought to take them she should choose between her cousin tom and this colonel stubbs and you should tell her that if she will not you will no longer be responsible for her  to this mr dosett turned altogether a deaf ear he was quite sure that his responsibility must be continued till ayala should marry or till he should die and he would not make a threat which he would certainly be unable to carry out he would be very glad if ayala could bring herself to marry either of the young men it was a pity that she should feel herself compelled to refuse offers so excellent but it was a matter for her own judgment and one in which he would not interfere for two days this almost led to a coldness between the man and his wife during which the sufferings of poor mrs dosett were heartrending  not many days after ayalas return her sister lucy came to see her certain reasons had caused lady tringle to stay at glenbogie longer than usual and the family was now passing through london on their way to merle park perhaps it was the fact that the trafficks had been effectually extruded from glenbogie but would doubtless turn up at merle park should lady tringle take up her residence there before the autumn was over that they should spend their christmas at merle park was an acknowledged thingto mamma tringle an acknowledged benefit because she liked to have her daughter with her to papa tringle an acknowledged evil because he could not endure to be made to give more than he intended to give that they should remain there afterwards through january and till the meeting of parliament was to be expected but it was hoped that they might be driven to find some home for themselves if they were left homeless by sir thomas for awhile the little plan was hardly successful as mr traffick had put his wife into lodgings at hastings ready to pounce down on merle park as soon as lady tringle should have occupied the house a few days lady tringle was now going there with the rest of the family sir thomas having been in town for the last six weeks  lucy took advantage of the day which they passed in london and succeeded in getting across to the crescent at this time she had heard nothing of colonel stubbs and was full indeed of her own troubles  you havent seen him she said to her sister  seen who asked ayala who had two hims to her bowand thought at the moment rather of her own two hims than of lucys one  isadore he said that he would call here ayala explained that she had not seen him having been absent from town during the last ten daysduring which mr hamel had in fact called at the house ayala continued lucy what am i to do  stick to him said ayala firmly  of course i shall but aunt emmeline thinks that i ought to give him up or  or what  or go away said lucy very gravely  where would you go to  oh where indeed of course he would have me but it would be ruin to him to marry a wife without a penny when he earns only enough for his own wants his father has quarrelled with him altogether he says that nobody can prevent our being married if we please and that he is quite ready to make a home for me instantly but i know that last year he hardly earned more than two hundred pounds after paying all his expenses and were i to take him at his word i should ruin him  would uncle tom turn you out  he has been away almost ever since mr hamel came to glenbogie and i do not know what he will say aunt emmeline declares that i can only stay with them just as though i were her daughter and that a daughter would be bound to obey her  does gertrude obey her about mr houston  gertrude has her own way with her mother altogether and of course a daughter cannot really be turned out if she tells me to go i suppose i must go  i should ask uncle tom said ayala she could not make you go out into the street when she had to get rid of me she could send me here in exchange but she cant say now that you dont suit and have me back again  oh ayala it is so miserable i feel that i do not know what to do with myself  nor do i said ayala jumping up from the bed on which she was sitting it does seem to be so crossgrained nobody will let you marry and everybody will make me  do they still trouble you about tom  it is not tom now lucy another man has come up  as a lover  oh yes quite so his name issuch a name lucyhis name is colonel jonathan stubbs  that is isadores friendthe man who lives at drumcaller  exactly he told me that mr hamel was at drumcaller with him and now he wants me to be his wife  do you not like him  that is the worst part of it all lucy if i did not like him i should not mind it half so much it is just because i like him so very much that i am so very unhappy his hair is just the colour of aunt emmelines big shawl  what does that signify  and his mouth stretches almost from ear to ear  i shouldnt care a bit for his mouth  i dont think i do much because he does look so goodnatured when he laughs indeed he is always the most goodnatured man that ever lived  has he got an income enough for marriage asked lucy whose sorrows were already springing from that most fertile source of sorrowing  plenty they tell methough i do not in the least know what plenty means  then ayala why should you not have him  because i cant said ayala how is a girl to love a man if she does not love him liking has nothing to do with it you dont think liking ought to have anything to do with it  this question had not been answered when aunt margaret came into the room declaring that the tringle manservant who had walked across the park with miss dormer was waxing impatient the sisters therefore were separated and lucy returned to queens gate     chapter xxviii  miss docimer   i tell you fairly that i think you altogether wrongthat it is cowardly unmanly and disgraceful i dont mean you see to put what you call a fine point upon it  no you dont  it is one of those matters on which a person must speak the truth or not speak at all i should not have spoken unless you forced it upon me you dont care for her in the least  thats true i do not know that i am especially quick at what you call caring for young ladies if i care for anybody it is for you  i suppose so but that may as well be dropped for the present you mean to marry this girl simply because she has got a lot of money  exactly thatas you before long will marry some gentleman only because he has got money  you have no right to say so because i am engaged to no man but if i were so it is quite different unless i marry i can be nobody i can have no existence that i can call my own i have no other way of pushing myself into the worlds notice you are a man  you mean to say that i could become a merchant or a lawyerbe a lord chancellor in time or perhaps an archbishop of canterbury  you can live and eat and drink and go where you wish without being dependent on any one if i had your freedom and your means do you think that i would marry for money  in this dialogue the main part was taken by mr frank houston whose ambition it was to marry miss gertrude tringle and the ladys part by his cousin and intimate friend miss imogene docimer the scene was a walk through a pineforest on the southern slopes of the tyrolean alps and the occasion had been made a little more exhilarating than usual by the fact that imogene had been strongly advised both by her brother mr mudbury docimer and by her sisterin law mrs mudbury docimer not to take any more distant rambles with her faraway cousin frank houston in the teeth of that advice this walk was taken and the conversation in the pinewood had at the present moment arrived at the point above given  i do not know that any two persons were ever further asunder in an argument than you and i in this said frank not in the least disconcerted by the severe epithets which had been applied to him i conceive that you are led away by a desire to deceive yourself whereas hypocrisy should only be used with the object of deceiving others  how do i deceive myself  in making believe that men are generally different from what they arein trying to suppose that i ought to be if i am not a hero you shall not find a man whose main object is not that of securing an income the clergyman who preaches against gold licks the ground beneath the ministers feet in order that he may become a bishop the barrister cares not with what case he may foul his hands so long as he may become rich the man in trade is so aware of his own daily dishonesty that he makes two separate existences for himself and endeavours to atone for his rascality in the city by his performance of all duties at the west end i regard myself to be so infinitely cleaner in my conscience than other men that i could not bring myself to be a bishop an attorneygeneral or a great merchant of all the ways open to me this seems to me to be the least sordid i give her the only two things which she desiresmyself and a position she will give me the only thing i desire which is some money when you marry youll make an equally fine bargainonly your wares will be your beauty  you will not give her yourselfnot your heart  yes i shall i shall make the most of her and shall do so by becoming as fond of her as i can of course i like breeding of course i like beauty of course i like that aroma of feminine charm which can only be produced by a mixture of intellect loveliness taste and early association i dont pretend to say that my future would not be much sweeter before me with you as my wifeif only either of us had a sufficiency of income i acknowledge that but then i acknowledge also that i prefer miss tringle with £100000 to you with nothing and i do not think that i ought to be called unmanly disgraceful and a coward because i have courage enough to speak the truth openly to a friend whom i trust my theory of life shocks you not because it is uncommon but because it is not commonly declared  they were silent for a while as they went on through the path and then miss docimer spoke to him in an altered voice i must ask you not to speak to me again as one who by any possibility could have been your wife  very well you will not wish me to abandon the privilege of thinking of past possibilities  i wouldif it were possible  quite impossible ones thoughts i imagine are always supposed to be ones own  you know what i mean a gentleman will always spare a woman if he can do so and there are cases such as have been ours in which it is a most imperative duty to do so you should not have followed us when you had made up your mind about this young lady  i took care to let you know beforehand that i intended it  you should not have thrown the weight upon me you should not even have written to me  i wonder what you would have said thenhow loudly you would have abused mehad i not written would you not have told me then that i had not the courage to be open with you he paused for an answer but she made none but i do recognise the necessity of my becoming subject to abuse in this state of affairs i have been in no respect false nor in any way wanting in affection when i suggested to you that £600 ayear between us with an increasing family and lodgings in marylebone would be uncomfortable you shuddered at the prospect when i explained to you that you would have the worst of it because my club would be open to me you were almost angry with me because i seemed to imply that there could be any other than one decision  there could only be one decisionunless you were man enough to earn your bread  but i wasnt but i aint you might as well let that accident pass sans dire was there ever a moment in which you thought that i should earn my bread  never for a moment did i endow you with the power of doing anything so manly  then why throw it in my teeth now that is not fair however i do own that i have to be abused i dont see any way in which you and i are to part without it but you need not descend to billingsgate  i have not descended to billingsgate mr houston  upperworld billingsgate cowardice as an accusation from a woman to a man is upperworld billingsgate but it doesnt matter of course i know what it means do you think your brother wants me to go away at once  at once she said  that would be disagreeable and absurd you mean to sit to me for that head  certainly not  i cannot in the least understand why not what has a question of art to do with marriage or giving in marriage and why should mrs docimer be so angry with me when she has known the truth all along  there are questions which it is of no avail to answer i have come out with you now because i thought it well that we should have a final opportunity of understanding each other you understand me at any rate  perfectly he said you have taken especial care on this occasion to make yourself intelligible  so i intended and as you do understand me and know how far i am from approving your philosophy you can hardly wish to remain with us longer then they walked on together in absolute silence for above a mile they had come out of the wood and were descending by a steep and narrow path to the village in which stood the hotel at which the party was staying another ten minutes would take them down to the high road the path here ran by the side of a rivulet the course of which was so steep that the waters made their way down in a succession of little cataracts from the other side of the path was a fence so close to it that on this particular spot there was room only for one to walk here frank houston stepped in front of his companion so as to stop her imogene he said if it is intended that i am to start by the diligence for innspruck this evening you had better bid me farewell at once  i have bidden you farewell she said  then you have done it in so bitter a mood that you had better try your hand at it again heaven only knows in what manner you or i may meet again  what does it matter she asked  i have always felt that the hearts of men are softer than the hearts of women a womans hand is soft but she can steel her heart when she thinks it necessary as no man can do does it occur to you at this moment that there has been some true affection between you and me in former days  i wish it did not  it may be so that i wish it also but there is the fact no wishing will enable me to get rid of it no wishing will save me from the memory of early dreams and sweet longings and vain triumphs there is the remembrance of bright glory made very sad to me by the meanness of the existing truth i do not say but that i would obliterate it if i could but it is not to be obliterated the past will not be made more pleasant to me by any pretence of present indignation i should have thought that it would have been the same with you  there has been no glory she said though i quite acknowledge the meanness  there has been at any rate some love  misplaced you had better let me pass on i have as you say steeled myself i will not condescend to any tenderness in my brothers presence and my sisters i will wish you goodbye and express a hope that you may be successful in your enterprises here by the brookside out upon the mountainpath where there is no one to hear us but our two selves i will bid you no farewell softer than that already spoken go and do as you propose you have my leave when it shall have been done there shall never be a word spoken by me against it but when you ask me whether you are right i will only say that i think you to be wrong it may be that you owe nothing to me but you owe something to her and something also to yourself now mr houston i shall be glad to pass on  he shrugged his shoulders and then stepped out of the path thinking as he did so how ignorant he had been after all that had passed of much of the character of imogene docimer it could not be he had thought but that she would melt into softness at last i will not condescend to any tenderness she had said and it seemed that she would be as good as her word he then walked down before her in silence and in silence they reached the inn  mr houston said mrs docimer before they sat down to dinner together i thought it was understood that you and imogene should not go out alone together again  i have taken my place to innspruck by the diligence this evening he answered  perhaps it will be better so though both mudbury and i will be sorry to lose your company  yes mrs docimer i have taken my place your sister seemed to think that there would be great danger if i waited till tomorrow morning when i could have got a pleasant lift in a return carriage i hate travelling at night and i hate diligences i was quite prepared to post all the way though it would have ruined meonly for this accursed diligence  i am sorry you should be inconvenienced  it does not signify what a man without a wife may suffer in that way never does signify its just fourteen hours you wouldnt like docimer to come with me  thats nonsense you neednt go the whole way unless you like you could sleep at brunecken  brunecken is only twelve miles and it might be dangerous  of course you choose to turn everything into ridicule  better that than tears mrs docimer whats the good of crying i cant make myself an elder son i cant endow imogene with a hundred thousand pounds she told me just now that i might earn my bread but she knows that i cant its very sad but what can be got by being melancholy  at any rate you had better be away from her  i am goingthis evening shall i walk on half a stage at once without any dinner i wish you had heard the kind of things she said to me you would not have thought that i had gone to walk with her for my own pleasure  have you not deserved them  i think notbut nevertheless i bore them a woman of course can say what she pleases theres docimeri hope he wont call me a coward  mr docimer came out on the terrace on which the two were standing looking as sour as death he is going by the diligence to innspruck this afternoon said mrs docimer  why did he come a man with a grain of feeling would have remained away  now docimer said frank pray do not make yourself unpleasant your sister has been abusing me all the morning like a pickpocket and your wife looks at me as though she would say just as much if she dared after all what is it i have done that you think so wicked  what will everybody think at home said mrs docimer when they know that youre with us again what chance is she to have if you follow her about in this way  i shall not follow her very long said frank my wings will soon be cut and then i shall never fly again they were at this time walking up and down the terrace together and it seemed for awhile that neither of them had another word to say in the matter of the dispute between them then houston went on again in his own defence of course it is all bad he said of course we have all been fools you knew it and allowed it and have no right to say a word to me  we thought that when your uncle died there would have been money said docimer with a subdued growl  exactly and so did i you do not mean to say that i deceived either you or her  there should have been an end of it when that hope was over  of course there should there should never have been a dream that she or i could marry on six hundred a year had not all of us been fools we should have taken our hats off and bade each other farewell for ever when the state of the old mans affairs was known we were fools but we were fools together and none of us have a right to abuse the others when i became acquainted with this young lady at rome it had been settled among us that imogene and i must seek our fortunes apart  then why did you come after her again asked mr docimer  at this moment imogene herself joined them on the terrace mary she said to her sisterinlaw i hope you are not carrying on this battle with mr houston i have said what there was to be said  you should have held your tongue and said nothing growled her brother  be that as it may i have said it and he quite understands what i think about it let us eat our dinner in peace and quietness and then let him go on his travels he has the world free before him which he no doubt will open like an oyster though he does not carry a sword soon after this they did dine and contented themselves with abusing the meat and the wine and finding fault with tyrolese cookery just as though they had no deeper cares near their hearts precisely at six the heavy diligence stopped before the hotel door and houston who was then smoking with docimer on the terrace got up to bid them adieu mrs docimer was kind and almost affectionate with a tear in her eye well old fellow said docimer take care of yourself perhaps everything will turn up right some of these days goodbye mr houston said imogene just giving him her hand to touch in the lightest manner possible god bless you imogene said he and there was a tear also in his eye but there was none in hers as she stood looking at him while he prepared himself for his departure nor did she say another word to him as he went and now said she when the three of them were left upon the terrace i will ask a great favour of you both i will beg you not to let there be another word about mr houston among us after that she rambled out by herself and was not seen again by either of them that evening  when she was alone she too shed her tears though she felt impatient and vexed with herself as they came into her eyes it was not perhaps only for her lost love that she wept had no one known that her love had been given and then lost she might have borne it without weeping but now in carrying on this vain affair of hers in devoting herself to a lover who had with her own consent passed away from her she had spent the sweet fresh years of her youth and all those who knew her would know that it had been so he had told her that it would be her fate to purchase for herself a husband with her beauty it might be so at any rate she did not doubt her own beauty but if it were to be so then the romance and the charm of her life were gone she had quite agreed that six hundred a year and lodgings in marylebone would be quite unendurable but what was there left for her that would be endurable he could be happy with the prospect of gertrude tringles money she could not be happy looking forward to that unloved husband who was to be purchased by her beauty     chapter xxix  at merle park no 1   sir thomas took the real holiday of the year at glenbogiewhere he was too far removed from lombard street to be drawn daily into the vortex of his millions he would stay usually six weeks at glenbogiewhich were by no means the happiest weeks of the year of all the grand things of the world which his energy and industry had produced for him he loved his millions the best it was not because they were hisas indeed they were not a considerable filing off themwhat he regarded as his percentageannually became his own but it was not this that he loved in describing a mans character it is the authors duty to give the man his due sir thomas liked his own wealth well enough where is the rich man who does notor where is the poor man who does not wish that he had it to like but what he loved were the millions with which travers and treason dealt he was travers and treason though his name did not even appear in the firm and he dealt with the millions he could affect the rate of money throughout europe and emissaries from national treasuries would listen to his words he had been governor and deputygovernor of the bank of england all the city respected him not so much because he was rich as that he was one who thoroughly understood millions if russia required to borrow some infinite number of roubles he knew how to arrange it and could tell to a rouble at what rate money could be made by it and at what rate money would certainly be lost he liked his millions and was therefore never quite comfortable at glenbogie but at merle park he was within easy reach of london at merle park he was not obliged to live from weeks end to weeks end without a sight of lombard street the family might be at merle park while he might come down on a friday and remain till tuesday morning that was the plan proposed for merle park as a fact he would spend four days in town and only two down in the country therefore though he spent his sonamed holiday at glenbogie merle park was the residence which he loved  in this autumn he went up to london long before his family and then found them at merle park on the saturday after their arrival there they had gone down on the previous wednesday on the saturday when he entered the house the first thing he saw was mr trafficks hat in the hall this was saturday 23rd november and there would be three months before parliament would meet a curse was not muttered but just formed between his teeth as he saw the hat sir thomas in his angriest mood never went so far as quite to mutter his curses will one have to expiate the anathemas which are well kept within the barrier of the teeth or only those which have achieved some amount of utterance sir thomas went on with a servant at his heels chucking about the doors rather violently till he found mr traffick alone in the drawingroom mr traffick had had a glass of sherry and bitters brought in for his refreshment and sir thomas saw the glass on the mantelpiece he never took sherry and bitters himself one glass of wine with his two oclock mutton chop sufficed him till dinner it was all very well to be a member of parliament but after all members of parliament never do anything men who work dont take sherry and bitters men who work dont put their hats in other peoples halls without leave from the master of the house wheres your mistress said sir thomas to the man without taking any notice of his soninlaw the ladies had only just come in from driving were very cold and had gone up to dress sir thomas went out of the room again banging the door and again taking no notice of mr traffick mr traffick put his hand up to the mantelpiece and finished his sherry and bitters  my dear said mr traffick to his wife up in her bedroom your father has come down in one of his tantrums  i knew he would said augusta  but it does not signify the least give him a kiss when you see him and dont seem to notice it there is not a man in the world has a higher regard for me than your father but if any one were to see him in one of his tantrums they would suppose he meant to be uncivil  i hope he wont be downright unkind septimus said his wife  never fear the kindesthearted man in the world is your father  so hes here that was the first word of greeting which sir thomas addressed to his wife in her bedroom  yes tomtheyre here  when did they come  wellto tell the truth we found them here  the  but sir thomas restrained the word on the right or inside of the teeth  they thought we were to be here a day sooner and so they came on the wednesday morning they were to come you know  i wish i knew when they were to go  you dont want to turn your own daughter out of your own house  why doesnt he get a house of his own for her for her sake why doesnt he do it he has the spending of £6000 a year of my money and yet i am to keep him noi dont want to turn my daughter out of my house but itll end in my turning him out  when a week had passed by mr traffick had not been as yet turned out sir thomas when he came back to merle park on the following friday condescended to speak to his soninlaw and to say something to him as to the news of the day but this he did in an evident spirit of preconceived hostility everything is down again he said  fluctuations are always common at this time of the year said traffick but i observe that trade always becomes brisk a little before christmas  to a man with a fixed income like you it doesnt much matter said sir thomas  i was looking at it in a public light  exactly a man who has an income and never spends it need not trouble himself with private views as to the money market mr traffick rubbed his hands and asked whether the new buildings at the back of the lombard street premises were nearly finished  mr trafficks economy had a deleterious effect upon gertrude which she poor girl did not deserve sir thomas deeply resolving in his mind that he would at some not very distant date find means by which he would rid himself of mr traffick declared to himself that he would not at any rate burden himself with another soninlaw of the same kind frank houston was to his thinking of the same kind and therefore he hardened his heart against frank houston now frank houston could he have got his wife with £6000 a yearas mr traffick had donewould certainly not have troubled the tringle mansions with too much of his presence it would have been his object to remove himself as far as possible from the tringles and to have enjoyed his life luxuriously with the proceeds of his wifes fortune but his hopes in this respect were unjustly impeded by mr trafficks parsimony soon after leaving the hotel in the tyrol at which we lately saw him frank houston wrote to his ladylove declaring the impatience of his ardour and suggesting that it would be convenient if everything could be settled before christmas in his letter he declared to gertrude how very uncomfortable it was to him to have to discuss money matters with her father it was so disagreeable that he did not think that he could bring himself to do it again but if she would only be urgent with her father she would of course prevail acting upon this gertrude determined to be urgent with her father on his second coming to merle park when as has been explained sir thomas was in a frame of mind very much opposed to impecunious sonsinlaw previous to attacking her father gertrude had tried her hand again upon her mother but lady tringle had declined if anything is to be done you must do it yourself lady tringle had said  papa said gertrude having followed him into a little sittingroom where he digested and arranged his telegrams when at merle park i wish something could be settled about mr houston  sir thomas at this moment was very angry mr traffick had not only asked for the loan of a carriage to take him into hastings but had expressed a wish that there might be a peculiar kind of claret served at dinner with which he was conversant and to which he was much attached then said he you may as well have it all settled at once  how papa  you may understand for good and all that i will have nothing to do with mr houston  papa that would be very cruel  my dear if you call me cruel i will not allow you to come and talk to me at all cruel indeed what is your idea of cruelty  everybody knows that we are attached to each other  everybody knows nothing of the kind i know nothing of the kind and you are only making a fool of yourself mr houston is a penniless adventurer and is only attached to my money he shall never see a penny of it  he is not an adventurer papa he is much less like an adventurer than mr traffick he has an income of his own only it is not much  about as much as would pay his bill at the club for cigars and champagne you may make your mind at rest for i will not give mr houston a shilling why should a man expect to live out of my earnings who never did a days work in his life  gertrude left the room despondently as there was nothing more to be done on the occasion but it seemed to her as though she were being used with the utmost cruelty augusta had been allowed to marry her man without a shilling and had been enriched with £120000 why should she be treated worse than augusta she was very strongly of opinion that frank houston was very much better than septimus traffick mr trafficks aptitude for saving his money was already known to the whole household frank would never wish to save frank would spend her income for her like a gentleman frank would not hang about glenbogie or merle park till he should be turned out everybody was fond of frank but she gertrude had already learnt to despise mr traffick member of parliament though he was she had already begun to think that having been chosen by frank houston who was decidedly a man of fashion she had proved herself to be of higher calibre than her sister augusta but her fathers refusal to her had been not only very rough but very decided she would not abandon her frank such an idea never for a moment crossed her mind but what step should she next take thinking over it during the whole of the day she did at last form a plan but she greatly feared that the plan would not recommend itself to mr frank houston she was not timid but he might be so in spite of her fathers anger and roughness she would not doubt his ultimate generosity but frank might doubt it if frank could be induced to come and carry her off from merle park and marry her in some manner approved for such occasions she would stand the risk of getting the money afterwards but she was greatly afraid that the risk would be too much for frank she did not however see any other scheme before her as to waiting patiently till her fathers obdurate heart should be softened by the greater obduracy of her own love there was a tedium and a prolonged dulness in such a prospect which were anything but attractive to her had it been possible she would have made a bargain with her father if you wont give us £120000 let us begin with £60000 but even this she feared would not altogether be agreeable to frank let her think of it how she would that plan of being run away with seemed alone to be feasibleand not altogether disagreeable  it was necessary that she should answer her lovers letter no embargo had as yet been put upon her correspondence and therefore she could send her reply without external difficulty  dear frank she said      i quite agree with you about christmas it ought to be    settled but i have very bad news to send to you i have    been to papa as you told me but he was very unkind    nothing could be worse he said that you ought to earn    your bread which is of course all humbug he didnt    understand that there ought to be some gentlemen who never    earn their bread i am sure if you had been earning your    bread by going to lombard street every day i shouldnt    have ever cared for you     he says that he will not give a single shilling i think    he is angry because augustas husband will come and live    here always that is disgusting of course but it isnt    my fault it is either that or else some money has gone    wrongor perhaps he had a very bad fit of indigestion    he was however so savage that i really do not know how    to go to him again mamma is quite afraid of him and does    not dare say a word because it was she who managed about    mr traffick     what ought to be done of course i dont like to think    that you should be kept waiting i am not sure that i    quite like it myself i will do anything you propose and    am not afraid of running a little risk if we could get    married without his knowing anything about it i am sure    he would give the money afterwardsbecause he is always    so goodnatured in the long run and so generous he can    be very savage but he would be sure to forgive     how would it be if i were to go away i am of age and    i believe that no one could stop me if you could manage    that we should get married in that way i would do my    best i know people can get themselves married at ostend    i do not see what else is to be done you can write    to me at present here and nothing wrong will come of    it but augusta says that if papa were to begin to    suspect anything about my going away he would stop my    lettersdear frank i am yours always and always most    lovingly     gertrude     you neednt be a bit afraid but that i should be quite up    to going off if you could arrange it   i believe papa said mrs traffick on the afternoon of the day on which this was written that gertrude is thinking of doing something wrong and therefore i feel it to be my duty to bring you this letter augusta had not been enabled to read the letter but had discussed with her sister the propriety of eloping i wont advise it she had said but if you do mr houston should arrange to be married at ostend i know that can be done some second thought had perhaps told her that any such arrangement would be injurious to the noble blood of the traffick family and she had therefore felt it to be her duty to extract the letter from the family letterbox and to give it to her father a daughter who could so excellently do her duty would surely not be turned out before parliament met  sir thomas took the letter and said not a word to his elder child when he was alone he doubted he was halfminded to send the letter on what harm could the two fools do by writing to each other while he held the strings of the purse there could be no marriage then he bethought himself of his paternal authority of the right he had to know all that his daughter didand he opened the letter there ought to be gentlemen who dont earn their bread ought there said he to himself if so these gentlemen ought not to come to him for bread he was already supporting one such and that was quite enough mamma is quite afraid of him and doesnt dare say a word that he rather liked i am sure he would give the money afterwards i am sure he would do no such thing he said to himself and he reflected that in such a condition he should rather be delighted than otherwise in watching the impecunious importunities of his baffled soninlaw the next sentence reconciled his girl to him almost entirely he is always so goodnatured in the long run and so generous for goodnatured he did not care much but he liked to be thought generous then he calmly tore the letter in little bits and threw them into the wastepaper basket  he sat for ten minutes thinking what he had better do finding the task thus imposed upon him to be much more difficult than the distribution of a loan at last he determined that if he did nothing things would probably settle themselves mr houston when he received no reply from his ladylove would certainly be quiescent and gertrude without any assent from her lover could hardly arrange her journey to ostend perhaps it might be well that he should say a word of caution to his wife but as to that he did not at present quite make up his mind as he was grievously disturbed while he was considering the subject  if you please sir thomas said the coachman hurrying into the room almost without the ceremony of knockingif you please phoebe mare has been brought home with both her knees cut down to the bone  what exclaimed sir thomas who indulged himself in a taste for horseflesh and pretended to know one animal from another  yes indeed sir thomas down to the bone said the coachman who entertained all that animosity against mr traffick which domestics feel for habitual guests who omit the ceremony of tipping mr traffick brought her down on windover hill sir thomas and shell never be worth a feed of oats again i didnt think a man was born who could throw that mare off her feet sir thomas now mr traffick when he had borrowed the phaeton and pair of horses that morning to go into hastings had dispensed with the services of a coachman and had insisted on driving himself     chapter xxx  at merle park no 2   has any irascible readerany reader who thoroughly enjoys the pleasure of being in a rageencountered suddenly some grievance which heavy as it may be has been more than compensated by the privilege it has afforded of blowingup the offender such was the feeling of sir thomas as he quickly followed his coachman out of the room he had been very proud of his phoebe mare who could trot with him from the station to the house at the rate of twelve miles an hour but in his present frame of mind he had liked the mare less than he disliked his soninlaw mr traffick had done him this injury and he now had mr traffick on the hip there are some injuries for which a host cannot abuse his guest if your best venetian decanter be broken at table you are bound to look as though you liked it but if a horse be damaged a similar amount of courtesy is hardly required the wellnurtured gentleman even in that case will only look unhappy and say not a word sir thomas was hardly to be called a well nurtured gentleman and then it must be remembered that the offender was his soninlaw good heavens he exclaimed hurrying into the yard what is this  the mare was standing out on the pavement with three men around her of whom one was holding her head another was down on his knees washing her wounds and the third was describing the fatal nature of the wounds which she had received traffick was standing at a little distance listening in silence to the implied rebukes of the groom good heavens what is this repeated sir thomas as he joined the conclave  there are a lot of loose stones on that hill said traffick and she tripped on one and came down all in a lump before you could look at her im awfully sorry but it might have happened to any one  sir thomas knew how to fix his darts better than by throwing them direct at his enemy she has utterly destroyed herself said he addressing himself to the headgroom who was busily employed with the sponge in his hand  im afraid she has sir thomas the jointoil will be sure to run on both knees the gashes is so mortal deep  ive driven that mare hundreds of times down that hill said sir thomas and i never knew her to trip before  never sir thomas said the groom  shed have come down with you today said mr traffick defending himself  it was my own fault bunsum thats all that can be said about it bunsum the groom kneeling as he was expressed by his grimaces his complete agreement with this last opinion of his master of course i ought to have known that he couldnt drive said sir thomas  a horse may fall down with anybody said mr traffick  youd better take her and shoot her said sir thomas still addressing the groom she was the best thing we had in the stable but now she is done for with that he turned away from the yard without having as yet addressed a word to his soninlaw  this was so intolerable that even mr traffick could not bear it in silence i have told you that i am very sorry said he following sir thomas closely and i dont know what a man can do more  nothingunless it be not to borrow a horse again  you may be sure i will never do that  im not sure of it at all if you wanted another tomorrow youd ask for him if you thought you could get him  i call that very uncivil sir thomasand very unkind  bother said sir thomas it is no good in being kind to a fellow like you did you ever hear what the cabman did who had a sovereign given to him for driving a mile he asked the fool who gave it him to make it a guinea i am the fool and by george you are the cabman with this sir thomas turned into the house by a small door leaving his soninlaw to wander round to the front by himself  your father has insulted me horribly he said to his wife whom he found up in her bedroom  what is the matter now septimus  that little mare of his which i have no doubt has come down half a score of times before fell with me and cut her knees  thats phoebe said augusta she was his favourite  its a kind of thing that might happen to anyone and no gentleman thinks of mentioning it he said such things to me that upon my word i dont think i can stop in the house any longer  oh yes you will said the wife  of course it is a difference coming from ones fatherinlaw its almost the same as from ones father  he didnt mean it septimus  i suppose not if he had i really couldnt have borne it he does become very rough sometimes but i know that at bottom he has a thorough respect for me it is only that induces me to bear it then it was settled between husband and wife that they should remain in their present quarters and that not a word further should be said at any rate by them about the phoebe mare nor did sir thomas say another word about the mare but he added a note to those already written in the tablets of his memory as to his soninlaw and the note declared that no hint let it be ever so broad would be effectual with mr traffick  the next day was a sunday and then another trouble awaited sir thomas at this time it was not customary with tom to come often to merle park he had his own lodgings in london and his own club and did not care much for the rural charms of merle park but on this occasion he had condescended to appear and on the sunday afternoon informed his father that there was a matter which he desired to discuss with him father said he i am getting confoundedly sick of all this  confounded said sir thomas is a stupid foolish word and it means nothing  there is a sort of comfort in it sir said tom but if its objectionable ill drop it  it is objectionable  ill drop it sir but nevertheless i am very sick of it  what are you sick of tom  all this affair with my cousin  then if you take my advice youll drop that too  i couldnt do that father a word is all very well a man can drop a word but a girl is a different sort of thing one cant drop a girl even if one tries  have you tried tom  yes i have ive done my best to try i put it out of my mind for a fortnight and wouldnt think of her i had a bottle of champagne every day at dinner and then went to the theatre but it was all of no use i have set my heart on it and i cant give her up ill tell you what id like to do id like to give her a diamond necklace  it wouldnt be the slightest use said sir thomas shaking his head  why not its what other men do i mean it to be something handsomeabout three hundred pounds  thats a large sum of money for a necklace  some of them cost a deal more than that  and youd only throw away your money  if she took it shed take me too if she didntwhy i should still have the diamonds i mean to try any way  then its of no use your coming to me  i thought youd let me have the money its no good running into debt for them and then if youd add something of your owna locket or something of that kindi think it would have an effect i have seen a necklace at ricolays and if i could pay ready money for it i could have 20 per cent off it the price named is three hundred guineas that would make it £254 5s £250 would buy it if the cheque was offered  there was a spirit about the son which was not displeasing to the father that idea that the gift if accepted would be efficacious or if not that it would be rejectedso that tom would not lose his hopes and his diamonds togetherseemed to be sound sir thomas therefore promised the money with the distinct understanding that if the gift were not accepted by ayala it should be consigned to his own hands but as for any present from himself he felt that this would not be the time for it he had called upon his niece and solicited her himself and she had been deaf to his words after that he could not condescend to send her gifts should she become my promised daughterinlaw then i would send her presents said sir thomas  the poor man certainly received less pleasure from his wealth than was credited to him by those who knew his circumstances yet he endeavoured to be good to those around him and especially good to his children there had been present to him ever since the beginning of his successesever since his marriagea fixed resolution that he would not be a curmudgeon with his money that he would endeavour to make those happy who depended on him and that he would be liberal in such settlements for his children as might be conducive to their happiness and fortunes in life in this way he had been very generous to mr traffick the man was a member of parliament the son of a peer and laborious why should he expect more money was wanting but he could supply the money so he had supplied it and had been content to think that a good man should be propped up in the world by his means what that had come to the reader knows he thoroughly detested his soninlaw and would have given much to have had his money back againso that mr traffick should have had no share in it  then there was his second daughter what should be done with gertrude the money should be forthcoming for her too if the fitting man could be found but he would have nothing further to do with a penniless lover let his position in the world of fashion or even in the world of politics be what it might the man should either have wealth of his own or should be satisfied to work for it houston had been unfortunate in the moment of his approaches sir thomas had been driven by his angry feelings to use hard sharp words and now was forced to act up to his words he declared roughly that mr houston should not have a shilling of his moneyas he had certainly been justified for doing and his daughter who had always been indulged in every kind of luxury had at once concocted a plot for running away from her home as he thought of the plot it seemed to be wonderful to him that she should be willing to incur such a dangerto be ready without a penny to marry a penniless mantill he confessed to himself that were she to do so she would certainly have the money sooner or later he was capable of passion capable of flying out and saying a very severe thing to septimus traffick or another when his temper was hot but he was incapable of sustained wrath he was already aware that if mr traffick chose to stay he would staythat if mr houston were brave enough to be persistent he might have both the money and the girl as he thought of it all he was angry with himself wishing that he were less generous less soft less forgiving  and now here was tomwhom at the present moment he liked the best of all his children who of the three was the least inclined to run counter to himready to break his heart because he could not get a little chit of a girl of whom he would probably be tired in twelve months after he possessed her remembering what tom had been he was at a loss to understand how such a lad should be so thoroughly in love at the present moment had ayala been purchaseable he would have been willing to buy her at a great price because he would fain have pleased tom had it been possible but ayala who had not a penny in the worldwho never would have a penny unless he should give it herwould not be purchased and would have nothing to do with tom the world was running counter to him so that he had no pleasure in his home no pleasure in his money no pleasure in his children the little backparlour in lombard street was sweeter to him than merle park with all its charms his daughter gertrude wanted to run away from him while by no inducement could he get mr traffick to leave the house  while he was in this humour he met his niece lucy roaming about the garden he knew the whole story of lucys love and had been induced by his wife to acknowledge that her marriage with the sculptor was not to be sanctioned he had merely expressed his scorn when the unfortunate circumstances of hamels birth had been explained to him again and again he had ridiculed the horror felt by his wife at the equally illborn brothers and sisters in rome he had merely shaken his head when he was told that hamels father never went inside of any place of worship but when it was explained to him that the young man had so to say no income at all then he was forced to acknowledge that the young man ought not to be allowed to marry his niece  to lucy herself he had as yet said nothing on the subject since he had asked the lover in to lunch at glenbogie he heard bad accounts of her he had been told by his wife on different occasionsnot in the mere way of conversation but with a premeditated energy of faultfindingthat lucy was a disobedient girl she was worse than ayala she persisted in saying that she would marry the penniless artist as soon as he should profess himself to be ready it had been different she had tried to explain to her aunt before she had been engaged to him now she considered herself to be altogether at his disposal this had been her plea but her plea had been altogether unacceptable to aunt emmeline she can do as she pleases of course sir thomas had said that might be all very well but aunt emmeline was strongly of opinion that an adopted daughter of queens gate of glenbogie and merle park ought not to be allowed to do as she pleased with herself a girl ought not to be allowed to have the luxuries of palatial residences and the luxuries of free liberty of choice at the same time more than once it had occurred to sir thomas that he would put an end to all these miseries by a mere scratch of his pen it need not be £120000 or £100000 as with a daughter a few modest thousands would do it and then this man hamel though the circumstances of his birth had been unfortunate was not an idler like frank houston as far as sir thomas could learn the man did work and was willing to work the present small income earned would gradually become more he had a kindly feeling towards lucy although he had been inclined to own that her marriage with hamel was out of the question my dear he said to her why are you walking about alone she did not like to say that she was walking alone because she had no one to walk with herno such companion as isadore would be if isadore were allowed to come to merle park so she simply smiled and went on by her uncles side do you like this place as well as glenbogie he asked  oh yes  perhaps you will be glad to get back to london again  oh no  which do you like best then  they are all so nice if  if what lucy  cælum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt lucy might have said had she known the passage as it was she put the same feeling into simpler words i should like one as well as the other uncle tom if things went comfortably  theres a great deal in that he said i suppose the meaning is that you do not get on well with your aunt  i am afraid she is angry with me uncle tom  why do you make her angry lucy when she tells you what is your duty why do you not endeavour to do it  i cannot do what she tells me said lucy and as i cannot i think i ought not to be here  have you anywhere else to go to to this she made no reply but walked on in silence when you say you ought not to be here what idea have you formed in your own mind as to the future  that i shall marry mr hamel some day  do you think it would be well to marry any man without an income to live upon would it be a comfort to him seeing that he had just enough to maintain himself and no more these were terrible questions to herquestions which she could not answer but yet as to which her mind entertained an easy answer a little help from him who was willing to indulge her with so many luxuries while she was under his roof would enable her to be an assistance rather than a burden to her lover but of this she could not utter a word love is all very well continued sir thomas in his gruffest voice but love should be regulated by good sense it is a crime when two beggars think of marrying each othertwo beggars who are not prepared to live as beggars do  he is not a beggar said lucy indignantly he has begged nothing nor have i  pshaw said sir thomas i was laying down a general rule i did not mean to call anybody a beggar you shouldnt take me up like that  i beg your pardon uncle tom she said piteously  very well very well that will do but still he went on walking with her and she felt she could not leave him till he gave her some signal that she was to go they continued in this way till they had come nearly round the large garden when he stopped as he was walking and addressed her again i suppose you write to him sometimes  yes said lucy boldly  write to him at once and tell him to come and see me in lombard street on tuesday at two oclock give me the letter and i will take care it is sent to him directly i get to town now you had better go in for it is getting very cold     chapter xxxi  the diamond necklace   tom went up to london intent upon his diamonds to tell the truth he had already made the purchase subject to some question of ready money he now paid for it after considerable chaffering as to the odd pounds which he succeeded in bringing to a successful termination then he carried the necklace away with him revolving in his mind the different means of presentation he thought that a letter might be best if only he was master of the language in which such a letter should properly be written but he entirely doubted his own powers of composition he was so modest in this respect that he would not even make an attempt he knew himself well enough to be aware that he was in many respects ignorant he would have endeavoured to take the bracelet personally to ayala had he not been conscious that he could not recommend his present with such romantic phrases and touches of poetry as would be gratifying to her fine sense were he to find himself in her presence with the necklace he must depend on himself for his words but a letter might be sent in his own handwriting the poetry and romance of which might be supplied by another  now it had happened that tom had formed a marvellous friendship in rome with colonel stubbs they had been hunting together in the campagna and tom had been enabled to accommodate the colonel with the loan of a horse when his own had been injured they had since met in london and stubbs had declared to more than one of his friends that tom in spite of his rings and his jewelry was a very good fellow at bottom tom had been greatly flattered by the intimacy and had lately been gratified by an invitation to aldershot in order that the military glories of the camp might be shown to him he had accepted the invitation and a day in the present week had been fixed then it occurred to him suddenly that he knew no one so fitted to write such a letter as that demanded as his friend colonel jonathan stubbs he had an idea that the colonel in spite of his red hair and in spite of a certain aptitude for drollery which pervaded him had a romantic side to his character and he felt confident that as to the use of language the colonel was very great indeed he therefore when he went to aldershot carefully put the bracelet in his breastpocket and determined to reveal his secret and to ask for aid  the day of his arrival was devoted to the ordinary pursuits of aldershot and the evening to festivities which were prolonged too late into the night to enable him to carry out his purpose before he went to bed he arranged to leave on the next morning by a train between ten and eleven and was told that three or four men would come in to breakfast at halfpast nine his project then seemed to be all but hopeless but at last with great courage he made an effort colonel said he just as they were going to bed i wonder if you could give me halfanhour before breakfast it is a matter of great importance tom as he said this assumed a most solemn face  an hour if you like my dear boy i am generally up soon after six and am always out on horseback before breakfast as soon as the light serves  then if youll have me called at halfpast seven i shall be ever so much obliged to you  the next morning at eight the two were closeted together and tom immediately extracted the parcel from his pocket and opened the diamonds to view upon my word that is a pretty little trinket said the colonel taking the necklace in his hand  three hundred guineas said tom opening his eyes very wide  i daresay  that is it would have been three hundred guineas unless i had come down with the ready i made the fellow give me twenty per cent off you should always remember this when you are buying jewelry  and what is to be done with this pretty thing i suppose it is intended for some fair ladys neck  oh of course  and why has it been brought down to aldershot there are plenty of fellows about this place who will get their hands into your pocket if they know that you have such a trinket as that about you  i will tell you why i brought it said tom very gravely it is as you say for a young lady i intend to make that young lady my wife of course this is a secret you know  it shall be sacred as the popes toe said stubbs  dont joke about it colonel if you please its life and death to me  ill keep your secret and will not joke now what can i do for you  i must send this as a present with a letter i must first tell you that she haswell refused me  that never means much the first time old boy  she has refused me halfadozen times but i mean to go on with it if she refuses me two dozen times ill try her a third dozen  then you are quite in earnest  i am its a kind of thing i know that men laugh about but i dont mind telling you that i am downright in love with her the governor approves of it  she has got money probably  not a shillingnot as much as would buy a pair of gloves but i dont love her a bit the less for that as to income the governor will stump up like a brick now i want you to write the letter  its a kind of thing a third person cant do said the colonel when he had considered the request for a moment  why not yes you can  do it yourself and say just the simplest words as they come up they are sure to go further with any girl than what another man may write it is impossible that another man should be natural on such a task as that  natural i dont know about natural said tom who was anxious now to explain the character of the lady in question i dont know that a letter that was particularly natural would please her a touch of poetry and romance would go further than anything natural  who is the lady asked the colonel who certainly was by this time entitled to be so far inquisitive  she is my cousinayala dormer  who  ayala dormermy cousin she was at rome but i do not think you ever saw her there  i have seen her since said the colonel  have you i didnt know  she was with my aunt the marchesa baldoni  dear me so she was i never put the two things together dont you admire her  certainly i do my dear fellow i cant write this letter for you then he put down the pen which he had taken up as though he had intended to comply with his friends request you may take it as settled that i cannot write it  no  impossible one man should never write such a letter for another man you had better give the thing in personthat is if you mean to go on with the matter  i shall certainly go on with it said tom stoutly  after a certain time you know reiterated offers do you knowdodopartake of the nature of persecution  reiterated refusals are the sort of persecution i dont like  it seems to me that ayalamiss dormer i meanshould be protected by a sort of feelingfeeling ofof what i may perhaps call her dependent position she is peculiarlypeculiarly situated  if she married me she would be much better situated i could give her everything she wants  it isnt an affair of money mr tringle  tom felt from the use of the word mister that he was in some way giving offence but felt also that there was no true cause for offence when a man offers everything he said and asks for nothing i dont think he should be said to persecute  after a time it becomes persecution i am sure ayala would feel it so  my cousin cant suppose that i am illusing her said tom who disliked the ayala quite as much as he did the mister  miss dormer i meant i can have nothing further to say about it i cant write the letter and i should not imagine that ayalamiss dormerwould be moved in the least by any present that could possibly be made to her i must go out now if you dont mind for halfanhour but i shall be back in time for breakfast  then tom was left alone with the necklace lying on the table before him he knew that something was wrong with the colonel but could not in the least guess what it might be he was quite aware that early in the interview the colonel had encouraged him to persevere with the lady and had then suddenly not only advised him to desist but had told him in so many words that he was bound to desist out of consideration for the lady and the colonel had spoken of his cousin in a manner that was distasteful to him he could not analyse his feelings he did not exactly know why he was displeased but he was displeased the colonel when asked for his assistance was of course bound to talk about the ladywould be compelled by the nature of the confidence to mention the ladys namewould even have been called on to write her christian name but this he should have done with a delicacyalmost with a blush instead of that ayalas name had been common on his tongue tom felt himself to be offended but hardly knew why and then why had he been called mister tringle the breakfast which was eaten shortly afterwards in the company of three or four other men was not eaten in comfortand then tom hurried back to london and to lombard street  after this failure tom felt it to be impossible to go to another friend for assistance there had been annoyance in describing his love to colonel stubbs and pain in the treatment he had received even had there been another friend to whom he could have confided the task he could not have brought himself to encounter the repetition of such treatment he was as firmly fixed as ever in his conviction that he could not write the letter himself and as he thought of the words with which he should accompany a personal presentation of the necklace he reflected that in all probability he might not be able to force his way into ayalas presence then a happy thought struck him mrs dosett was altogether on his side everybody was on his side except ayala herself and that pigheaded colonel would it not be an excellent thing to entrust the necklace to the hands of his aunt dosett in order that she might give it over to ayala with all the eloquence in her power satisfied with this project he at once wrote a note to mrs dosett      my dear aunt     i want to see you on most important business if i shall    not be troubling you i will call upon you tomorrow at    ten oclock before i go to my place of business     yours affectionately     t tringle junior   on the following morning he apparelled himself with all his rings he was a goodhearted wellintentioned young man with excellent qualities but he must have been slow of intellect when he had not as yet learnt the deleterious effect of all those rings on this occasion he put on his rings his chains and his bright waistcoat and made himself a thing disgusting to be looked at by any welltrained female as far as his aunt was concerned he would have been altogether indifferent as to his appearance but there was present to his mind some small hope that he might be allowed to see ayala as the immediate result of the necklace should he see ayala then how unfortunate it would be that he should present himself before the eyes of his mistress without those adornments which he did not doubt would be grateful to her he had heard from ayalas own lips that all things ought to be pretty therefore he endeavoured to make himself pretty of course he failedas do all men who endeavour to make themselves prettybut it was out of the question that he should understand the cause of his failure  aunt dosett i want you to do me a very great favour he began with a solemn voice  are you going to a party tom she said  a party nowho gives a party in london at this time of the day oh you mean because i have just got a few things on when i call anywhere i always do i have got another lady to see a lady of rank and so i just made a change but this was a fib  what can i do for you tom  i want you to look at that then he brought out the necklace and taking it out of the case displayed the gems tastefully upon the table  i do believe they are diamonds said mrs dosett  yes they are diamonds i am not the sort of fellow to get anything sham what do you think that little thing cost aunt dosett  i havent an idea sixty pounds perhaps  sixty pounds do you go into a jewellers shop and see what you could do among diamonds with sixty pounds  i never do go into jewellers shops tom  nor i very often its a sort of place where a fellow can drop a lot of money but i did go into one after this it dont look much does it  it is very pretty  i think it is pretty well aunt dosett the price for that little trifle was threehundredguineas as he said this he looked into his aunts face for increased admiration  you gave three hundred guineas for it  i went with ready money in my hand when i tempted the man with a cheque to let me have it for two hundred and fifty pounds in buying jewelry you should always do that  i never buy jewelry said mrs dosett crossly  if you should i mean now ill tell you what i want you to do this is for ayala  for ayala  yes indeed i am not the fellow to stick at a trifle when i want to carry my purpose i bought this the other day and gave ready money for ittwo hundred and fifty poundson purpose to give it to ayala in naming the valueof course youll do that when you give it heryou might as well say three hundred guineas that was the price on the ticket i saw it myselfso there wont be any untruth you know  am i to give it her  thats just what i want when i talk to her she flares up and as likely as not shed fling the necklace at my head  she wouldnt do that i hope  it would depend upon how the thing went when i do talk to her it always seems that nothing i say can be right now if you will give it her you can put in all manner of pretty things  this itself will be the prettiest thing said mrs dosett  thats just what i was thinking everybody agrees that diamonds will go further with a girl than anything else when i told the governor he quite jumped at the idea  sir thomas knows you are giving it  oh dear yes i had to get the rhino from him i dont go about with two hundred and fifty pounds always in my own pocket  if he had sent the money to ayala how much better it would have been said poor mrs dosett  i dont think that at all who ever heard of making a present to a young lady in money ayala is romantic and that would have been the most unromantic thing out that would not have done me the least good in the world it would simply have gone to buy boots and petticoats and such like a girl would never be brought to think of her lover merely by putting on a pair of boots when she fastens such a necklace as this round her throat he ought to have a chance dont you think so aunt dosett  tom shall i tell you something said the aunt  what is it aunt dosett  i dont believe that you have a chance  do you mean that he asked sorrowfully  i do  you think that the necklace will do no good  not the least of course i will offer it to her if you wish it because her uncle and i quite approve of you as a husband for ayala but i am bound to tell you the truth i do not think the necklace will do you any good then he sat silent for a time meditating upon his condition it might be imprudentit might be a wrong done to his father to jeopardise the necklace how could it be if ayala were to take the necklace and not to take him am i to give it she asked  yes said he bravely but with a sigh give it her all the same  from you or from sir thomas  oh from mefrom me if she were told it came from the governor shed keep it whether or no i am sure i hope she will keep it he said trying to remove the bad impression which his former words might perhaps have left  you may be sure she will not keep it said mrs dosett unless she should intend to accept your hand of that i can hold out no hope to you there is a matter tom which i think i should tell you as you are so straightforward in your offer another gentleman has asked her to marry him  she has accepted him exclaimed tom  no she has not accepted him she has refused him  then im just where i was said tom  she has refused him but i think that she is in a sort of way attached to him and though he too has been refused i imagine that his chance is better than yours  and who the d is he said tom jumping up from his seat in great excitement  tom exclaimed mrs dosett  i beg your pardon but you see this is very important who is the fellow  he is one colonel jonathan stubbs  who  colonel jonathan stubbs  impossible it cant be colonel stubbs i know colonel stubbs  i can assure you it is true tom i have had a letter from a ladya relative of colonel stubbstelling me the whole story  colonel stubbs he said that passes anything i ever heard she has refused him  yes she has refused him  and has not accepted him since  she certainly has not accepted him yet  you may give her the bracelet all the same said tom hurrying out of the room that colonel stubbs should have made an offer to ayala and yet have accepted his tom tringles confidence     chapter xxxii  toms despair   the reader will understand that the fate of the necklace was very soon decided ayala declared that it was very beautiful she had indeed a pretty taste for diamonds and would have been proud enough to call this necklace her own but as she declared to her aunt she would not accept tom though he were made of diamonds from head to foot accept tom when she could not even bring herself to think of becoming the wife of jonathan stubbs if colonel stubbs could not be received by her imagination as an angel of light how immeasurably distant from anything angelic must be tom tringle of course it must go back she said when the question had to be decided as to the future fate of the necklace as a consequence poor mr dosett was compelled to make a special journey into the city and to deposit a wellsealed parcel in the hands of tom tringle himself your cousin sends her kind regards he said but cannot bring herself to accept your magnificent present  tom had been very much put about since his visit to the crescent had his aunt merely told him that his present would be inefficacious he would have taken that assurance as being simply her opinion and would have still entertained some hopes in the diamonds but these tidings as to another lover crushed him altogether and such a lover the very man whom he had asked to write his letter for him why had not colonel stubbs told him the truth when thus his own secret had become revealed by an accident he understood it all nowthe ayala and the mister and the reason why the colonel could not write the letter then he became very angry with the colonel whom he bitterly accused of falsehood and treason what right had the colonel to meddle with his cousin at all and how false he had been to say nothing of what he himself had done when his rival had told him everything in this way he made up his mind that it was his duty to hate colonel stubbs and if possible to inflict some personal punishment upon him he was reckless of himself now and if he could only get one good blow at the colonels head with a thick stick would be indifferent as to what the law might do with him afterwards or perhaps he might be able to provoke colonel stubbs to fight with him he had an idea that duels at present were not in fashion but nevertheless in such a case as this a man ought to fight he could at any rate have the gratification of calling the colonel a coward if he should refuse to fight  he was the more wretched because his spirit within him was cowed by the idea of the colonel he did acknowledge to himself that his chance could be but bad while such a rival as colonel stubbs stood in his way he tried to argue with himself that it was not so as far as he knew colonel stubbs was and would remain a very much less rich man than himself he doubted very much whether colonel stubbs could keep a carriage in london for his wife while it had been already arranged that he was to be allowed to do so should he succeed in marrying ayala to be a partner in the house of travers and treason was a much greater thing than to be a colonel but though he assured himself of all this again and again still he was cowed there was something about the colonel which did more than redeem his red hair and ugly mouth and of this something poor tom was sensible nevertheless if occasion should arise he thought that he could punch the colonels headnot without evil consequence to himselfbut still that he could punch the colonels head not minding the consequences  such had been his condition of mind when he left the crescent and it was not improved by the receipt of the parcel he hardly said a word when his uncle put it into his hands merely muttering something and consigning the diamonds to his desk he did not tell himself that ayala must now be abandoned it would have been better for him if he could have done so but all real springing hopeful hope departed from his bosom this came from the colonel rather than from the rejected necklace  did you send that jewelry his father asked him some days afterwards  yes i sent it  and what has now become of it  it is in my desk there  did she send it back again  it came back my uncle dosett brought it i do not want to say anything more about it if you please  i am sorry for that tomvery sorry as you had set your heart upon it i wish it could have been as you would have it but the necklace should not be left there tom shook his head in despair  you had better let me have the necklace it is not that i should grudge it to you tom if it could do you any good  you shall have it sir  it will be better so that was the understanding then the necklace was transferred to some receptacle belonging to sir thomas himself the lock of which might probably be more secure than that of toms desk and there it remained in its case still folded in the various papers in which mrs dosett had encased it  then tom found it necessary to adopt some other mode of life for his own consolation and support he had told his father on one occasion that he had devoted himself for a fortnight to champagne and the theatres but this had been taken as a joke he had been fairly punctual at his place of business and had shown no symptoms of fast living but now it occurred to him that fast living would be the only thing for him he had been quite willing to apply himself to marriage and a steady life but fortune had not favoured him if he drank too much now and lay in bed and became idle it was not his fault there came into his head an idea that ayala and colonel stubbs between them must look to that could he meet ayala he would explain to her how his character as a moral man had been altogether destroyed by her conductand should he meet colonel stubbs he would explain something to him also  a new club had been established in london lately called the mountaineers which had secured for itself handsome lodgings in piccadilly and considered itself to be among clubs rather a comfortable institution than otherwise it did not as yet affect much fashion having hitherto secured among its members only two lordsand they were lords by courtesy but it was a pleasant jovial place in which the delights of young men were not impeded by the austerity of their elders its name would be excused only on the plea that all other names available for a club had already been appropriated in the metropolis there was certainly nothing in the club peculiarly applicable to mountains but then there are other clubs in london with names which might be open to similar criticism it was the case that many young men engaged in the city had been enrolled among its members and it was from this cause no doubt that tom tringle was regarded as being a leading light among the mountaineers it was here that the champagne had been drunk to which tom had alluded when talking of his love to his father now in his despair it seemed good to him to pass a considerable portion of his time among the mountaineers  youll dine here faddle he said one evening to a special friend of his a gentleman also from the city with whom he had been dining a good deal during the last week  i suppose i shall said faddle but aint we coming it a little strong they want to know at the gardens what the deuce it is im about the gardens was a new row of houses latterly christened badminton gardens in which resided the father and mother of faddle  ive given up all that kind of thing said tom  your people are not in london  it will make no difference when they do come up i call an evening in the bosom of ones family about the slowest thing there is the bosom must do without me for the future  wont your governor cut up rough  he must cut up as he pleases but i rather fancy he knows all about it i shant spend half as much money this way as if i had a house and wife and familyand what we may call a bosom of ones own then they had dinner and went to the theatre and played billiards and had supper and spent the night in a manner very delightful no doubt to themselves but of which their elder friends could hardly have approved  there was a good deal of this following upon the episode of the necklace and it must be told with regret that our young hero fell into certain exploits which were by no means creditable to him more than one goodhumoured policeman had helped him home to his lodgings but alas on christmas eve he fell into the hands of some guardian of the peace who was not quite sufficiently goodnatured and tom passed the night and the greater part of the following morning recumbent he in one cell and his friend faddle in the next with an intimation that they would certainly be taken before a magistrate on the day after christmas day  oh ayala ayala it must be acknowledged that you were in a measure responsibleand not only for the lamentable condition of your lover but also of that of his friend for in his softer moments tom had told every thing to faddle and faddle had declared that he would be true to the death to a friend suffering such unmerited misfortune perhaps the fidelity of faddle may have owed something to the fact that toms pecuniary allowances were more generous than those accorded to himself to ayala must be attributed the occurrence of these misfortunes but tom in his more fiery momentsthose moments which would come between the subsidence of actual sobriety and the commencement of intoxicationattributed all his misfortunes to the colonel faddle he would say in these moments of course i know that im a ruined man of course im aware that all this is only a prelude to some ignominious end i have not sunk to this kind of thing without feeling it youll be right enough some day old fellow faddle would reply i shall live to be godfather to the first boy never faddle tom replied all those hopes have vanished youll never live to see any child of mine and i know well where to look for my enemy stubbs indeed ill stubbs him if i can only live to be revenged on that traitor then i shall die contented though he shot me through the heart i should die contented  this had happened a little before that unfortunate christmas eve up to this time sir thomas though he had known well that his son had not been living as he should do had been mild in his remonstrances and had said nothing at merle park to frighten lady tringle but the affair of christmas eve came to his ears with all its horrors a policeman whom tom had struck with his fist in the pit of the stomach had not been civil enough to accept this mark of familiarity with good humour he had been much inconvenienced by the blow and had insisted upon giving testimony to this effect before the magistrate there had been halfanhour he said in which he had hung dubious between this world and the next so great had been the violence of the blow and so deadly its direction the magistrate was one of those just men who find a pleasure and a duty in protecting the police of the metropolis it was no case he declared for a fine what would be a fine to such a one as thomas tringle junior and tomtom tringle the only son of sir thomas tringle the senior partner in the great house of travers and treasonwas ignominiously locked up for a week faddle who had not struck the blow was allowed to depart with a fine and a warning oh ayala ayala this was thy doing  when the sentence was known sir thomas used all his influence to extricate his unfortunate son but in vain tom went through his penalty and having no help from champagne doubtless had a bad time of it ayala stubbs the policeman and the magistrate seemed to have conspired to destroy him but the week at last dragged itself out and then tom found himself confronted with his father in the backparlour of the house in queens gate tom he said this is very bad  it is bad sir said tom  you have disgraced me and your mother and yourself you have disgraced travers and treason poor tom shook his head it will be necessary i fear that you should leave the house altogether tom stood silent without a word a young man who has been locked up in prison for a week for maltreating a policeman can hardly expect to be entrusted with such concerns as those of travers and treason i and your poor mother cannot get rid of you and the disgrace which you have entailed upon us travers and treason can easily get rid of you tom knew very well that his father was in fact travers and treason but he did not yet feel that an opportunity had come in which he could wisely speak a word what have you got to say for yourself sir demanded sir thomas  of course im very sorry muttered tom  sorry tom a young man holding your position in travers and treason ought not to have to be sorry for having been locked up in prison for a week for maltreating a policeman what do you think must be done yourself  the man had been hauling me about in the street  you were drunk no doubt  i had been drinking i am not going to tell a lie about it but he neednt have done as he did faddle knows that and can tell you  what can have driven you to associate with such a young man as faddle that is the worst part of it do you know what faddle and company arestock jobbers who ten years ago hadnt a thousand pounds in the way of capital among them theyve been connected with a dozen companies none of which are floating now and have made money out of them all do you think that travers and treason will accept a young man as a partner who associates with such people as that  i have seen old faddles name and yours on the same prospectus together sir  what has that to do with it you never saw him inside our counter what a name to appear along with yours in such an affair as this if it hadnt been for that you might have got over it young men will be young men faddle i think you will have to go abroad for a time till it has been forgotten  i should like to stay just at present sir said tom  what good can you do  all the same i should like to stay sir  i was thinking that if you were to take a tour through the united states go across to san francisco then up to japan and from thence through some of the chinese cities down to calcutta and bombay you might come back by the euphrates valley to constantinople see something of bulgaria and those countries and so home by vienna and paris the euphrates valley railway will be finished by that time perhaps and bulgaria will be as settled as hertfordshire youd see something of the world and i could let it be understood that you were travelling on behalf of travers and treason by the time that you were back people in the city would have forgotten the policeman and if you could manage to write home three or four letters about our trade with japan and china they would be willing to forget faddle  but sir  shouldnt you like a tour of that kind  very much indeed sironly  only what tom  ayala said tom hardly able to suppress a sob as he uttered the fatal name  tom dont be a fool you cant make a young woman have you if she doesnt choose i have done all that i could for you because i saw that youd set your heart upon it i went to her myself and then i gave two hundred and fifty pounds for that bauble i am told i shall have to lose a third of the sum in getting rid of it  ricolay told me that hed take it back at two hundred and twenty said tom whose mind prostrate as it was was still alive to consideration of profit and loss  never mind that for the present said sir thomas dont you remember the old songif she will she will you may depend ont and if she wont she wont and theres an end ont you ought to be a man and pluck up your spirits are you going to allow a little girl to knock you about in that way tom only shook his head and looked as if he was very ill in truth the champagne and the imprisonment and ayala together had altogether altered his appearance weve done what we could about it and now it is time to give it over let me hear you say that you will give it over tom stood speechless before his father speak the word and the thing will be done continued sir thomas endeavouring to encourage the young man  i cant said tom sighing  nonsense  i have tried and i cant  tom do you mean to say that you are going to lose everything because a chit of a girl like that turns up her nose at you  its no use my going while things are like this said tom if i were to get to new york i should come back by the next ship as for letters about business i couldnt settle my mind to anything of the kind  then youre not the man i took you to be said the father  i could be man enough said tom clenching his fist if i could get hold of colonel stubbs  colonel who  stubbs jonathan stubbs i know what im talking about im not going to america nor china nor anything else till ive polished him off its all very well your abusing me but you dont know what it is i have suffered as for being called a man i dont care about it what i should like best would be to get ayala on one side and stubbs on the other and then all three to go off the duke of yorks column together its no good talking about travers and treason i dont care for travers and treason as i am now if youll get ayala to say that shell have me ill go to the shop every morning at eight and stay till nine and as for the mountaineers it may all go to the d for me then he rushed out of the room banging the door after him  sir thomas when he was thus left stood for awhile with his hands in his trousers pockets contemplating the condition of his son it was wonderful to him that a boy of his should be afflicted in this manner when he had been struck by the juvenile beauties of emmeline dosett he had at once asked the young lady to share his fortunes with him and the young lady had speedily acceded to his request then he had been married and that was all he had ever known of the troubles of love he could not but think looking back at it as he did now from a distance that had emmeline been hardhearted he would have endured the repulse and have passed on speedily to some other charmer but tom had been wounded after a fashion which seemed to him to have been very uncommon it might be possible that he should recover in time but while undergoing recovery he would be ruinedso great were the young mans sufferings now sir thomas though he had spoken to tom with all the severity which he had been able to assume though he had abused faddle and had vindicated the injured dignity of travers and treason with all his eloquence though he had told tom it was unmanly to give way to his love yet of living creatures tom was at this moment the dearest to his heart he had never for an instant entertained the idea of expelling tom from travers and treason because of the policeman or because of faddle what should he do for the poor boy now was there any argument any means of persuasion by which he could induce that foolish little girl to accept all the good things which he was ready to do for her could he try yet once again himself with any chance of success  thinking of all this he stood there for an hour alone with his hands in his trousers pockets     chapter xxxiii  isadore hamel in lombard street   in following the results of toms presentation of the necklace we have got beyond the period which our story is presumed to have reached tom was in durance during the christmas week but we must go back to the promise which had been made by her uncle sir thomas to lucy about six weeks before that time the promise had extended only to an undertaking on the part of sir thomas to see isadore hamel if he would call at the house in lombard street at a certain hour on a certain day lucy was overwhelmed with gratitude when the promise was made a few moments previously she had been indignant because her uncle had appeared to speak of her and her lover as two beggarsbut sir thomas had explained and in some sort apologised and then had come the promise which to lucy seemed to contain an assurance of effectual aid sir thomas would not have asked to see the lover had he intended to be hostile to the lover something would be done to solve the difficulty which had seemed to lucy to be so grave she would not any longer be made to think that she should give up either her lover or her home under her uncles roof this had been terribly distressing to her because she had been well aware that on leaving her uncles house she could be taken in only by her lover to whom an immediate marriage would be ruinous and yet she could not undertake to give up her lover therefore her uncles promise had made her very happy and she forgave the ungenerous allusion to the two beggars  the letter was written to isadore in high spirits i do not know what uncle tom intends but he means to be kind of course you must go to him and if i were you i would tell him everything about everything he is not strict and hard like aunt emmeline she means to be good too but she is sometimes so very hard i am happier now because i think something will be done to relieve you from the terrible weight which i am to you i sometimes wish that you had never come to me in kensington gardens because i have become such a burden to you  there was much more in which lucy no doubt went on to declare that burden as she was she intended to be persistent hamel when he received this letter was resolved to keep the appointment made for him but his hopes were not very high he had been angry with lady tringlein the first place because of her treatment of himself at glenbogie and then much more strongly because she had been cruel to lucy nor did he conceive himself to be under any strong debt of gratitude to sir thomas though he had been invited to lunch he was aware that the tringles had despised him and he repaid the compliment with all his heart by despising the tringles they were to him samples of the sort of people which he thought to be of all the most despicable they were not only vulgar and rich but purseproud and conceited as well to his thinking there was nothing of which such people were entitled to be proud of course they make moneymoney out of money an employment which he regarded as vilecreating nothing either useful or beautiful to create something useful was to his thinking very good to create something beautiful was almost divine to manipulate millions till they should breed other millions was the meanest occupation for a lifes energy it was thus i fear that mr hamel looked at the business carried on in lombard street being as yet very young in the world and seeing many things with distorted eyes  he was aware that some plan would be proposed to him which might probably accelerate his marriage but was aware also that he would be very unwilling to take advice from sir thomas sir thomas no doubt would be coarse and rough and might perhaps offer him pecuniary assistance in a manner which would make it impossible for him to accept it he had told himself a score of times that poor as he was he did not want any of the tringle money his fathers arbitrary conduct towards him had caused him great misery he had been brought up in luxury and had felt it hard enough to be deprived of his fathers means because he would not abandon the mode of life that was congenial to him but having been thus as it were cast off by his father he had resolved that it behoved him to depend only on himself in the matter of his love he was specially prone to be indignant and independent no one had a right to dictate to him and he would follow the dictation of none to lucy alone did he acknowledge any debt and to her he owed everything but even for her sake he could not condescend to accept sir thomass money and with his money his advice lucy had begged him in her letter to tell everything to her uncle he would tell sir thomas everything as to his income his prospects and his intentions because sir thomas as lucys uncle would be entitled to such information but he thought it very improbable that he should accept any counsel from sir thomas  such being the condition of hamels mind it was to be feared that but little good would come from his visit to lombard street lucy had simply thought that her uncle out of his enormous stores would provide an adequate income hamel thought that sir thomas out of his enormous impudence would desire to dictate everything sir thomas was in truth anxious to be goodnatured and to do a kindness to his niece but was not willing to give his money without being sure that he was putting it into good hands  oh youre hamel said a young man to him speaking to him across the counter in the lombard street office this was tom who as the reader will remember had not yet got into his trouble on account of the policeman  tom and hamel had never met but once before for a few moments in the coliseum at rome and the artist not remembering him did not know by whom he was accosted in this familiar manner that is my name sir said hamel here is my card perhaps you will do me the kindness to take it to sir thomas tringle  all right old fellow i know all about it he has got puxley with him from the bank of england just at this moment come through into this room hell soon have polished off old puxley tom was no more to hamel than any other clerk and he felt himself to be aggrieved but he followed tom into the room as he was told and then prepared to wait in patience for the convenience of the great man so you and lucy are going to make a match of it said tom  this was terrible to hamel could it be possible that all the clerks in lombard street talked of his lucy in this way because she was the niece of their senior partner were all the clerks as a matter of course instructed in the most private affairs of the tringle family i am here in obedience to directions from sir thomas said hamel ignoring altogether the impudent allusion which the young man had made  of course you are perhaps you dont know who i am  not in the least said hamel  i am thomas tringle junior said tom with a little accession of dignity  i beg your pardon i did not know said hamel  you and i ought to be thick rejoined tom because im going in for ayala perhaps youve heard that before  hamel had heard it and was well aware that tom was to ayala an intolerable burden like the old man of the sea he had heard of tom as poor ayalas pet aversionas a lover not to be shaken off though he had been refused a score of times ayala was to the sculptor only second in sacredness to lucy and now he was told by tom himself that he wasgoing in for ayala the expression was so distressing to his feelings that he shuddered when he heard it was it possible that any one should say of him that he was going in for lucy at that moment sir thomas opened the door and grasping hamel by the hand led him away into his own sanctum  and now mr hamel said sir thomas in his cheeriest voice how are you hamel declared that he was very well and expressed a hope that sir thomas was the same i am not so young as i was mr hamel my years are heavier and so is my work thats the worst of it when one is young and strong one very often hasnt enough to do i daresay you find it so sometimes  in our profession said hamel we go on working though very often we do not sell what we do  thats bad said sir thomas  it is the case always with an artist before he has made a name for himself it is the case with many up to the last day of a life of labour an artist has to look for that sir thomas  dear me that seems very sad you are a sculptor i believe  yes sir thomas  and the things you make must take a deal of room and be very heavy at this mr hamel only smiled dont you think if you were to call an auction youd get something for them at this suggestion the sculptor frowned but condescended to make no reply sir thomas went on with his suggestion if you and halfadozen other beginners made a sort of gallery among you people would buy them as they do those things in the marylebone road and stick them up somewhere about their grounds it would be better than keeping them and getting nothing hamel had in his studio at home an allegorical figure of italia united and another of a prostrate roman catholic church which in his minds eye he saw for a moment stuck here or there about the gardens of some such place as glenbogie into them had been infused all the poetry of his nature and all the conviction of his intelligence he had never dreamed of selling them he had never dared to think that any lover of art would encourage him to put into marble those conceptions of his genius which now adorned his studio standing there in plaster of paris but to him they were so valuable they contained so much of his thoughts so many of his aspirations that even had the marble counterparts been ordered and paid for nothing would have induced him to part with the originals now he was advised to sell them by auction in order that he might rival those grotesque tradesmen whose business it is to populate the gardens of wealthy but tasteless britons it was thus that the idea represented itself to him he simply smiled but sir thomas did not fail to appreciate the smile  and now about this young lady said sir thomas not altogether in so good a humour as he had been when he began his suggestion its a bad look out for her when as you say you cannot sell your work when youve done it  i think you do not quite understand the matter sir thomas  perhaps not it certainly does seem unintelligible that a man should lumber himself up with a lot of things which he cannot sell a tradesman would know that he must get into the bankruptcy court if he were to go on like that and what is sauce for the goose will be sauce for the gander also mr hamel again smiled but held his tongue if you cant sell your wares how can you keep a wife  my wares as you call them are of two kinds one though no doubt made for sale is hardly saleable the other is done to order such income as i make comes from the latter  heads suggested sir thomas  busts they are generally called  well busts i call them heads they are heads a bust i take it iswell never mind sir thomas found a difficulty in defining his idea of a bust a man wants to have something more or less like some one to put up in a church and then he pays you  or perhaps in his library but he can put it where he likes when he has bought it  just so but there aint many of those come in your way if i understand right  not as many as i would wish  what can you net at the end of the year thats the question  lucy had recommended him to tell sir thomas everything and he had come there determined to tell at any rate everything referring to money he had not the slightest desire to keep the amount of his income from sir thomas but the questions were put to him in so distasteful a way that he could not bring himself to be confidential it varies with various circumstances but it is very small  very small five hundred a year this was illnatured because sir thomas knew that mr hamel did not earn five hundred a year but he was becoming acerbated by the young mans manner  oh dear no said hamel  four hundred  nor four hundrednor three i have never netted three hundred in one year after paying the incidental expenses  that seems to me to be uncommonly little for a young man who is thinking of marrying dont you think you had better give it up  i certainly think nothing of the kind  does your father do anything for you  nothing at all  he also makes heads  headsand other things  and sells them when he has made them  yes sir thomas he sells them he had a hard time once but now he is run after he refuses more orders than he can accept  and he wont do anything for you  nothing he has quarreled with me  that is very bad well now mr hamel would you mind telling me what your ideas are sir thomas when he asked the question still intended to give assistance was still minded that the young people should by his assistance be enabled to marry but he was strongly of opinion that it was his duty as a rich and protecting uncle to say something about imprudence and to magnify difficulties it certainly would be wrong for an uncle merely because he was rich to give away his money to dependent relatives without any reference to those hard principles which a possessor of money always feels it to be his business to inculcate and up to this point hamel had done nothing to ingratiate himself sir thomas was beginning to think that the sculptor was an impudent prig and to declare to himself that should the marriage ever take place the young couple would not be made welcome at glenbogie or merle park but still he intended to go on with his purpose for lucys sake therefore he asked the sculptor as to his ideas generally  my idea is that i shall marry miss dormer and support her on the earnings of my profession my idea is that i shall do so before long in comfort my idea also is that she will be the last to complain of any discomfort which may arise from my straitened circumstances at present my idea is that i am preparing for myself a happy and independent life my idea also isand i assure you that of all my ideas this is the one to which i cling with the fondest assurancethat i will do my very best to make her life happy when she comes to grace my home  there was a manliness in this which would have touched sir thomas had he been in a better humour but as it was he had been so much irritated by the young mans manner that he could not bring himself to be just am i to understand that you intend to marry on something under three hundred a year  hamel paused a moment before he made his reply how am i to answer such a question he said at last seeing that miss dormer is in your hands and that you are unlikely to be influenced by anything that i may say  i shall be very much influenced said sir thomas  were her father still alive i think we should have put our heads together and between us decided on what might have been best for lucys happiness  do you think that im indifferent to her happiness demanded sir thomas  i should have suggested to him continued hamel not noticing the last question that she should remain in her own home till i could make one for her worthy of her acceptance and then we should have arranged among us what would have been best for her happiness i cannot do this with you if you tell her tomorrow that she must give up either your protection or her engagement with me then she must come to me and make the best of all the little that i can do for her  who says that im going to turn her out said sir thomas rising angrily from his chair  i do not think that any one has said this of you  then why do you throw it in my teeth  because your wife has threatened it  then sir thomas boiled over in his anger no one has threatened it it is untrue you are guilty both of impertinence and untruth in saying so here hamel rose from his chair and took up his hat stop young man and hear what i have to say to you i have done nothing but good to my niece  nevertheless it is true sir thomas that she has been told by your wife that she must either abandon me or the protection of your roof i find no fault with lady tringle for saying so it may have been the natural expression of a judicious opinion but when you ask after my intentions in reference to your niece i am bound to tell you that i propose to subject her to the undoubted inconveniences of my poor home simply because i find her to be threatened with the loss of another  she has not been threatened sir  you had better ask your wife sir thomas and if you find that what i have said is true i think you will own that i have been obliged to explain myself as i have done as you have told me to my face that i have been guilty of untruth i shall now leave you with this he walked out of the room and the words which sir thomas threw after him had no effect in recalling him  it must be acknowledged that hamel had been very foolish in referring to aunt emmelines threat who does not know that words are constantly used which are intended to have no real effect who does not know that an angry woman will often talk after this fashion but it was certainly the fact that aunt emmeline had more than once declared to lucy that she could not be allowed to remain one of that family unless she would give up her lover lucy in her loyal endeavours to explain to her lover her own position had told him of the threat and he from that moment had held himself prepared to find a home for his future wife should that threat be carried into execution sir thomas was well aware that such words had been spoken but he knew his wife and knew how little such words signified his wife without his consent would not have the power to turn a dog from merle park the threat had simply been an argument intended to dissuade lucy from her choice and now it had been thrown in his teeth just when he had intended to make provision for this girl who was not in truth related to him in order that he might ratify her choice he was very angry with the young prig who had thus rushed out of his presence he was angry too with his wife who had brought him into his difficulty by her foolish threat but he was angry also with himself knowing that he had been wrong to accuse the man of a falsehood     chapter xxxiv  i never threatened to turn you out   then there were written the following letters which were sent and received before sir thomas went to merle park and therefore also before he again saw lucy      dearest dearest love     i have been as desired to lombard street but i fear    that my embassy has not led to any good i know myself    to be about as bad an ambassador as any one can send an    ambassador should be soft and gentlewilling to make    the best of everything and never prone to take offence    nor should he be addicted specially to independence i    am ungentle and apt to be suspiciousespecially if    anything be said derogatory to my art i am proud of being    an artist but i am often ashamed of myself because i    exhibit my pride i may say the same of my spirit of    independence i am determined to be independent if i    livebut i find my independence sometimes kicking up its    heels till i hate it myself     from this you will perceive that i have not had a success    in lombard street i was quite willing to answer your    uncle any questions he could ask about money indeed    i had no secret from him on any subject but when he    subjected me to crossexamination forcing me into a    bathos of poverty as he thought i broke down not five    hundred ayear not four not three oh heavens    and you propose to take a wife you will understand how i    writhed and wriggled under the scorn     and then there came something worse than thisor rather    if i remember rightly the worst thing came first you    were over in my studio and will remember perhaps    some of my own abortive treasures those melancholy but    soulinspiring creations of which i have thought so much    and others have thought so little that no one else should    value them is natural but to me it seems unnatural    almost cruel that any one should tell me to my face that    they were valueless your uncle of course had never seen    them but he knew that sculptors are generally burdened    with these wares as he called them and he suggested    that i should sell them by auction for what they might    fetchin order that the corners which they occupy might    be vacant he thought that perhaps they might do for    country gentlemen to stick about among their shrubs    you knowing my foolish soreness on the subject will    understand how well i must have been prepared by this to    endure your uncles crossexamination     then he asked me as to my ideasnot art ideas but ideas    as to bread and cheese for the future i told him as    exactly as i could i explained to him that if you were    left in possession of a comfortable home such as would    have been that of your father i should think it best for    your sake to delay our marriage till i should be prepared    to do something better for you than i can at present    but that i hold myself ready to give you all that i have    to give at a moments notice should you be required to    leave his house and lucy speaking in your name i said    something further and declared my belief that you for    my sake would bear the inconveniences of so poor a home    without complaining     then there arose anger both on his side and on mine and i    must say insult on his he told me that i had no business    to suggest that you would be expelled from his house i    replied that the threat had come if not from him then    from lady tringle upon this he accused me of positive    falsehood asserting that your aunt had said nothing of    the kind i then referred him to lady tringle herself but    refused to stay any longer in the room with him because    he had insulted me     so you will see that i did less than nothing by my    embassy i told myself that it would be so as i descended    into the underground cavern at the gloucester road    station you are not to suppose that i blame him more or    indeed so much as i do myself it was not to be expected    that he should behave as a gentleman of fine feeling but    perhaps it ought to have been expected that i should    behave as a man of common sense i ought to have taken    his advice about the auction apparently in good part    i ought not to have writhed when he scorned my poor    earnings when he asked as to my ideas i should not have    alluded to your aunts threat as to turning you out i    should have been placid and humble and then his want of    generous feeling would have mattered nothing but spilt    milk and broken eggs are past saving whatever good things    may have come from your uncles generosity had i brushed    his hair for him aright are now clean gone seeing that i    scrubbed him altogether the wrong way     for myself i do not know that i should regret it very    much i have an idea that no money should be sweet to a    man except that which he earns and i have enough belief    in myself to be confident that sooner or later i shall    earn a sufficiency but dearest i own that i feel    disgusted with myself when i think that i have diminished    your present comfort or perhaps lessened for the future    resources which would have been yours rather than mine    but the milk has been spilt and now we must only think    what we can best do without it it seems to me that only    two homes are possible for youone with sir thomas    as his niece and the other with me as my wife i am    conceited enough to think that you will prefer the latter    even with many inconveniences neither can your uncle    or your aunt prevent you from marrying at a very early    day should you choose to do so there would be some    preliminary ceremony of the nature of which i am    thoroughly ignorant but which could i suppose be    achieved in a month i would advise you to ask your aunt    boldly whether she wishes you to go or to stay with her    explaining of course that you intend to hold to your    engagement and explaining at the same time that you are    quite ready to be married at once if she is anxious to be    quit of you that is my advice     and now dear one word of something softer for did any    lover ever write to the lady of his heart so long a letter    so abominably stuffed with matters of business how shall    i best tell you how dearly i love you perhaps i may do it    by showing you that as far as i myself am concerned i long    to hear that your aunt emmeline and your uncle tom are    more hardhearted and obdurate than were ever uncle and    aunt before them i long to hear that you have been turned    out into the cold because i know that then you must come    to me though it be even less than three hundred ayear    i wish you could have seen your uncles face as those    terribly mean figures reached his ears i do not for a    moment fear that we should want orders come slow enough    but they come a little quicker than they did i have never    for a moment doubted my own ultimate success and if    you were with me i should be more confident than ever    nevertheless should your aunt bid you to stay and should    you think it right to comply with her desire i will not    complain     adieu this comes from one who is altogether happy in his    confidence that at any rate before long you will have    become his wife     isadore hamel     i quite expect to be scolded for my awkwardness indeed i    shall be disappointed if i am not   the same post which brought hamels long letter to lucy brought also a short but very angry scrawl from sir thomas to his wife no eyes but those of lady tringle saw this epistle and no other eyes shall see it but the few words which it contained were full of marital wrath why had she threatened to turn her own niece out of his doors why had she subjected him to the necessity of defending her by a false assertion those dormer nieces of hers were giving him an amount of trouble and annoyance which he certainly had not deserved lucy though not a word was said to her of this angry letter was conscious that something had been added to her aunts acerbity indeed for the last day or two her aunts acerbity towards her had been much diminished lady tringle had known that her husband intended to do something by which the hamel marriage would be rendered possible and she though she altogether disapproved of the hamel marriage would be obliged to accede to it if sir thomas acceded to it and encouraged it by his money let them be married and then as far as the tringles were concerned let there be an end of these dormer troubles for ever to that idea lady tringle had reconciled herself as soon as sir thomas had declared his purpose but nowas she declared to herselfall the fat was again in the fire she received lucys salutations on that morning with a very bad grace  but she had been desired to give no message and therefore she was silent on the subject to lucy to the honourable mrs traffick she said a few words after all ayala was not half as bad as lucy said lady tringle  there mamma i think you are wrong said the honourable mrs traffick of all the upsetting things i ever knew ayala was the worst think of her conduct with septimus lady tringle made a little grimace which however her daughter did not see and then with that marchesa  that was the marchesas fault  and with tom  i dont think she was so much to blame with tom if she were why doesnt she take him now she can have him he is just as foolish about her as ever upon my word i think tom will make himself ill about it  you havent heard it all mamma  what havent i heard  ayala has been down with the alburys at stalham  i did hear that  and another man has turned up what on earth they see in her is what i cant understand  another man has offered to her who is he  there was a colonel stubbs down there septimus heard it all from young batsby at the club she got this man to ride about the country with her everywhere going to the meets with him and coming home and in this way she got him to propose to her i dont suppose he means anything but that is why she wont have anything to do with tom now do you mean to say she didnt do all she could to catch tom down at glenbogie and then at rome everybody saw it i dont think lucy has ever been so bad as that  its quite different my dear  she has come from a low father said the honourable mrs traffick proudly and therefore she has naturally attached herself to a low young man there is nothing to be wondered at in that i suppose they are fond of each other and the sooner they are married the better  but he cant marry her because he has got nothing  papa will do something  thats just what your papa wont the man has been to your father in the city and there has been ever such a row he spoke ill of me because i endeavoured to do my duty by the ungrateful girl i am sure i have got a lesson as to taking up other peoples children i endeavoured to do an act of charity and see what has come of it i dont believe in charity  that is wicked mamma faith hope and charity but youve got to be charitable before you begin the others  i dont think it is wicked people would do best if they were made to go along on what theyve got of their own this seemed to augusta to be a direct blow at septimus and herself of course i know what you mean mamma  i didnt mean anything  but if people cant stay for a few weeks in their own parents houses i dont know where they are to stay  it isnt weeks augusta its months and as to parents lord boardotrade is mr trafficks parent why doesnt he go and stay with lord boardotrade then augusta got up and marched with stately step out of the room after this it was not possible that lucy would find much immediate grace in her aunts eyes  from the moment that lucy had received her letter there came upon her the great burden of answering it she was very anxious to do exactly as hamel had counselled her she was quite alive to the fact that hamel had been imprudent in lombard street but not the less was she desirous to do as he bade herthinking it right that a woman should obey some one and that her obedience could be due only to him but in order to obey him she must consult her aunt aunt emmeline she said that afternoon i want to ask you something  what is it now said aunt emmeline crossly  about mr hamel  i dont want to hear any more about mr hamel i have heard quite enough of mr hamel  of course i am engaged to him aunt emmeline  so i hear you say i do not think it very dutiful of you to come and talk to me about him knowing as you do what i think about him  what i want to ask is this ought i to stay here or ought i to go away  i never heard such a girl where are you to go to what makes you ask the question  because you said that i ought to go if i did not give him up  you ought to give him up  i cannot do that aunt  then you had better hold your tongue and say nothing further about it i dont believe he earns enough to give you bread to eat and decent clothes to wear what would you do if children were to come year after year if you really love him i wonder how you can think of being such a millstone round a mans neck  this was very hard to bear it was so different from the delicious comfort of his letter i do not for a moment believe that we should want i have never for one moment doubted my own ultimate success but after all was there not more of truth in her aunts words hard and cruel as they were and on these words such as they were she must found her answer to her lover for he had bade her ask her aunt what she was to do as to staying or preparing herself for an immediate marriage then before the afternoon was over she wrote to hamel as follows      dear isadore     i have got ever so much to say but i shall begin by doing    as you told me in your postscript i wont quite scold    you but i do think you might have been a little gentler    with poor uncle tom i do not say this because i at all    regret anything which perhaps he might have done for us    if you do not want assistance from him certainly i do    not but i do think that he meant to be kind and though    he may not be quite what you call a gentleman of fine    feeling yet he has taken me into his house when i had no    other to go to and in many respects has been generous to    me when he said that you were to go to him in lombard    street i am sure that he meant to be generous and    though it has not ended well yet he meant to be kind to    both of us     there is what you will call my scolding though indeed    dearest i do not intend to scold at all nor am i in the    least disappointed except in regard to you this morning    i have been to aunt emmeline as you desired and i must    say that she was very cross of course i know that it is    because she is my own aunt that uncle tom has me here at    all and i feel that i ought to be very grateful to her    but in spite of all that you say laughing at uncle tom    because he wants you to sell your grand work by auction    he is much more goodnatured than aunt emmeline i am    quite sure my aunt never liked me and that she will    not be comfortable till i am gone but when i asked her    whether i ought to stay or to go she told me to hold my    tongue and say nothing further about it of course by    this she meant that i was to remain at any rate for the    present     my own dearest i do think this will be best though i    need not tell you how i look forward to leaving this and    being always with you for myself i am not a bit afraid    though aunt emmeline said dreadful things about food    and clothes and all the rest of it but i believe much    more in what you say that success will be sure to come    but still will it not be wise to wait a little longer    whatever i may have to bear here i shall think that i am    bearing it for your dear sake and then i shall be happy     believe me to be always and always your own     lucy   this was written and sent on a wednesday and nothing further was said either by lucy herself or by her aunt as to the lover till sir thomas came down to merle park on the saturday evening on his arrival he seemed inclined to be gracious to the whole household even including mr traffick who received any attention of that kind exactly as though the most amicable arrangements were always existing between him and his fatherinlaw aunt emmeline when it seemed that she was to encounter no further anger on account of the revelation which hamel had made in lombard street also recovered her temper and the evening was spent as though there were no causes for serious family discord in this spirit on the following morning they all went to church and it was delightful to hear the flattering words with which mr traffick praised merle park and everything belonging to it during the hour of lunch he went so far as to make some delicately laudatory hints in praise of hospitality in general and especially as to that so nobly exercised by london merchantprinces sir thomas smiled as he heard him and as he smiled he resolved that as soon as the christmas festivities should be over the honourable septimus traffick should certainly be turned out of that house  after lunch there came a message to lucy by a pageboy who was supposed to attend generally to the personal wants of aunt emmeline saying that her uncle would be glad of her attendance for a walk my dear said he have you got your thick boots on then go and put em on we will go down to the lodge and then come home round by windover hill she did as she was bade and then they started i want to tell you said he that this mr hamel of yours came to me in lombard street  i know that uncle tom  he has written to you then and told you all about it  he has written to me certainly and i have answered him  no doubt well lucy i had intended to be kind to your mr hamel but as you are probably aware i was not enabled to carry out my intentions he seems to be a very independent sort of young man  he is independent i think  i have not a word to say against it if a man can be independent it is so much the better if a man can do everything for himself so as to require neither to beg nor to borrow it will be much better for him but my dear you must understand that a man cannot be independent with one hand and accept assistance with the other at one and the same time  that is not his character i am sure said lucy striving to hide her indignation while she defended her lovers character  i do not think it is therefore he must remain independent and i can do nothing for him  he knows that uncle tom  very well then theres an end of it i only want to make you understand that i was willing to assist him but that he was unwilling to be assisted i like him all the better for it but there must be an end of it  i quite understand uncle tom  then theres one other thing ive got to say he accused me of having threatened to turn you out of my house now my dear hereupon lucy struggled to say a word hardly knowing what word she ought to say but he interrupted herjust hear me out till ive done and then there need not be another word about it i never threatened to turn you out  not you uncle tom she said endeavouring to press his arm with her hand  if your aunt said a word in her anger you should not have made enough of it to write and tell him  i thought she meant me to go and then i didnt know whom else to ask  neither i nor she nor anybody else ever intended to turn you out i have meant to be kind to you bothto you and ayala and if things have gone wrong i cannot say that it has been my fault now you had better stay here and not say a word more about it till he is ready to take you that cant be yet for a long time he is making at present not more than two hundred a year and i am sure it must be quite as much as he can do to keep a coat on his back with such an income as that you must make up your mind to waitprobably for some years as i told you before if a man chooses to have the glory of independence he must also bear the inconvenience now my dear let there be an end of this and never say again that i want to turn you out of my house     chapter xxxv  tom tringle sends a challenge   the next six weeks went on tranquilly at merle park without a word spoken about hamel sir thomas who was in the country as little as possible showed his scorn to his soninlaw simply by the paucity of his words speaking to him when he did speak to him with a deliberate courtesy which mr traffick perfectly understood it was that dangerous serenity which so often presages a storm there is something going to be up with your father he said to augusta augusta replied that she had never seen her father so civil before it would be a great convenience continued the member of parliament if he could be made to hold his tongue till parliament meets but im afraid thats too good to expect in other respects things were comfortable at merle park though they were not always comfortable up in london tom as the reader knows was misbehaving himself sadly at the mountaineers this was the period of unlimited champagne and of almost total absence from lombard street it was seldom that sir thomas could get hold of his son and when he did that brokenhearted youth would reply to his expostulations simply by asserting that if his father would induce ayala to marry him everything should go straight in lombard street then came the final blow tom was of course expected at merle park on christmas eve but did not make his appearance either then or on christmas day christmas fell on a wednesday and it was intended that the family should remain in the country till the following monday on the thursday sir thomas went up to town to make inquiries respecting his heir as to whom lady tringle had then become absolutely unhappy in london he heard the disastrous truth tom in his sportive mood had caused serious inconvenience to a most respectable policeman and was destined to remain another week in the hands of the philistines then for a time all the other tringle troubles were buried and forgotten in this great trouble respecting tom lady tringle was unable to leave her room during the period of incarceration mr traffick promised to have the victim liberated by the direct interference of the secretary of state but failed to get anything of the kind accomplished the girls were completely cowed by the enormity of the misfortune so that toms name was hardly mentioned except in sad and confidential whispers but of all the sufferers sir thomas suffered the most to him it was a positive disgrace weighing down every moment of his life at travers and treason he could not hold up his head boldly and open his mouth loudly as had always been his wont at travers and treason there was not a clerk who did not know that the governor was an altered man since this misfortune had happened to the hope of the firm what passed between sir thomas and his son on the occasion has already been told in a previous chapter that sir thomas on the whole behaved with indulgence must be acknowledged but he felt that his son must in truth absent himself from lombard street for a time  tom had been advised by his father to go forth and see the world a prolonged tour had been proposed to him which to most young men might seem to have great attraction to him it would have had attraction enough had it not been for ayala there would have been hardly any limit to the allowance made to him and he would have gone forth armed with introductions which would have made every port a happy home to him but as soon as the tour was suggested he resolved at once that he could not move himself to a distance from ayala what he expectedwhat he even hopedhe could not tell himself but while ayala was in london and ayala was unmarried he could not be made to take himself far away  he was thoroughly ashamed of himself he was not at all the man who could bear a week of imprisonment and not think himself disgraced for a day or two he shut himself up altogether in his lodgings and never once showed himself at the mountaineers faddle came to him but he snubbed faddle at first remembering all the severe things his father had said about the faddles in general but he soon allowed that feeling to die away when the choice seemed to be between faddle and solitude then he crept out in the dark and ate his dinners with faddle at some tavern generally paying the bill for both of them after dinner he would play halfadozen games of billiards with his friend at some unknown billiardroom and then creep home to his lodgingsa blighted human being  at last about the end of the first week in january he was induced to go down to merle park there mr and mrs traffick were still sojourning the real grief which had afflicted sir thomas having caused him to postpone his intention in regard to his soninlaw at merle park tom was cosseted and spoilt by the women very injudiciously it was not perhaps the fact that they regarded him as a hero simply because he had punched a policeman in the stomach and then been locked up in vindication of the injured laws of his country but that incident in combination with his unhappy love did seem to make him heroic even lucy regarded him with favour because of his constancy to her sister whereas the other ladies measured their admiration for his persistency by the warmth of their anger against the silly girl who was causing so much trouble his mother told him over and over again that his cousin was not worth his regard but then when he would throw himself on the sofa in an agony of despairweakened perhaps as much by the course of champagne as by the course of his lovethen she too would bid him hope and at last promised that she herself would endeavour to persuade ayala to look at the matter in a more favourable light it would all be right if it were not for that accursed stubbs poor tom would say to his mother the man whom i called my friend the man i lent a horse to when he couldnt get one anywhere else the man to whom i confided everything even about the necklace if it hadnt been for stubbs i never should have hurt that policeman when i was striking him i thought that it was stubbs then the mother would heap feminine maledictions on the poor colonels head and so together they would weep and think of revenge  from the moment tom had heard colonel stubbss name mentioned as that of his rival he had meditated revenge it was quite true when he said that he had been thinking of stubbs when he struck the policeman he had consumed the period of his confinement in gnashing his teeth all in regard to our poor friend jonathan he told his father that he could not go upon his long tour because of ayala but in truth his love was now so mixed up with ideas of vengeance that he did not himself know which prevailed if he could first have slaughtered stubbs then perhaps he might have started but how was he to slaughter stubbs various ideas occurred to his mind at first he thought that he would go down to aldershot with the biggest cuttingwhip he could find in any shop in piccadilly but then it occurred to him that at aldershot he would have all the british army against him and that the british army might do something to him worse even than the london magistrate then he would wait till the colonel could be met elsewhere he ascertained that the colonel was still at stalham where he had passed the christmas and he thought how it might be if he were to attack the colonel in the presence of his friends the alburys he assured himself that as far as personal injury went he feared nothing he had no disinclination to be hit over the head himself if he could be sure of hitting the colonel over the head if it could be managed that they two should fly at each other with their fists and be allowed to do the worst they could to each other for an hour without interference he would be quite satisfied but down at stalham that would not be allowed all the world would be against him and nobody there to see that he got fair play if he could encounter the man in the streets of london it would be better but were he to seek the man down at stalham he would probably find himself in the county lunatic asylum what must he do for his revenge he was surely entitled to it by all the laws of chivalry as to which he had his own ideas he had a right to inflict an injury upon a successfuleven upon an unsuccessfulrival was it not a shame that so excellent an institution as duelling should have been stamped out wandering about the lawns and shrubberies at merle park he thought of all this and at last he came to a resolution  the institution had been stamped out as far as great britain was concerned he was aware of that but it seemed to him that it had not been stamped out in other more generous countries he had happened to notice that a certain enthusiastic politician in france had enjoyed many duels and had never been severely repressed by the laws of his country newspaper writers were always fighting in france and were never guillotined the idea of being hanged was horrible to himso distasteful that he saw at a glance that a duel in england was out of the question but to have his head cut off even if it should come to that would be a much less affair but in belgium in italy in germany they never did cut off the heads of the very numerous gentlemen who fought duels and there were the southern states of the american union where he fancied that men might fight duels just as they pleased he would be ready to go even to new orleans at a days notice if only he could induce colonel stubbs to meet him there and he thought that if colonel stubbs really possessed half the spirit which seemed to be attributed to him by the british army generally he would come if properly invoked and fight such a duel as this whether at new orleans or at some other wellchosen bloodallowing spot on the worlds surface tom was prepared to go anywhere for blood  but the invocation must be properly made when he had wanted another letter of another kind to be written for him the colonel himself was the man to whom he had gone for assistance and had his present enemy been any other than the colonel himself he would have gone to the colonel in preference to any one else for aid in this matter there was no one in truth in whom he believed so thoroughly as in the colonel but that was out of the question then he reflected what friend might now stand him in stead he would have gone to houston who wanted to marry his sister but houston seemed to have disappeared and he did not know where he might be found there was his brotherinlaw traffickbut he feared lest traffick might give him over once more into the hands of the police he thought of hamel as being in a way connected with the family but he had seen so little of hamel and had so much disliked what he had seen that he was obliged to let that hope go by there was no one left but faddle whom he could trust faddle would do anything he was told to do faddle would carry the letter no doubt or allow himself to be named as a proposed second but faddle could not write the letter he felt that he could write the letter himself better than faddle  he went up to town having sent a mysterious letter to faddle bidding his friend attend him in his lodgings he did not yet dare to go to the mountaineers where faddle would have been found but faddle came true to the appointment what is it now said the faithful friend i hope you are going back to travers and treasons that is what i should do and walk in just as though nothing had happened  not if you were me you wouldnt  that does make a difference of course  there is something else to be done before i can again darken the doors of travers and treasonif i should ever do so  something particular  something very particular faddle i do think you are a true friend  you may say that i have stuck to you alwaysthough you dont know the kind of things my people say to me about it they say i am going to ruin myself because of you the governor threatened to put me out of the business altogether but im a man who will be true to my friend whatever happens i think you have been a little cool to me lately but even that dont matter  cool if you knew the state that im in you wouldnt talk of a fellow being cool im so knocked about it all that i dont know what im doing  i do take that into consideration  now ill tell you what i am going to do then he stood still and looked faddle full in the face faddle sitting awestruck on his chair returned the gaze he knew that a moment of supreme importance was at hand faddle ill shoot that fellow down like a dog  will you indeed  like a dogif i can get at him i should have no more compunction in taking his life than a mere worm why should i when i know that he has sapped the very juice of my existence  do you meando you meanthat you wouldmurder him  it would not be murder of course it might be that he would shoot me instead upon the whole i think i should like that best  oh a duel said faddle  thats what i mean murder him certainly not though i should like nothing half so well as to thrash him within an inch of his life i would not murder him my plan is thisi shall write to him a letter inviting him to meet me in any corner of the globe that he may select torrid zone or arctic circle will be all the same to me you will have to accompany me as my second faddle shivered with excitement and dread of coming events among other ideas there came the thought that it might be difficult to get back from the arctic circle without money if his friend tom should happen to be shot dead in that locality but first of all continued tom you will have to carry a letter  to the colonel suggested faddle  of course the man is now staying with friends of his named albury at a place called stalham from what i hear they are howling swells sir harry albury is master of the hounds and lady albury when she is up in london has all the royal family constantly at her parties stubbs is a cousin of his but you must go right away up to him among em all and deliver the letter into his hands without minding em a bit  couldnt it go by post  no this kind of letter musnt go by post you have to be able to swear that you delivered it yourself into his own hands and then you must wait for an answer even though he should want a day to think of it you must wait  where am i to stay tom  well it may be theyll ask you to the house because though you carry the letter for me you are not supposed to be his enemy if so put a jolly face on it and enjoy yourself as well as you can you must seem you know to be just as big a swell as anybody there but if they dont ask you you must go to the nearest inn ill pay the bill  shall i go today asked faddle  ive got to write the letter first itll take a little time so that youd better put it off till tomorrow if you will leave me now ill write it and if you will come back at six well go and have a bit of dinner at bolivias this was an eatinghouse in the neighbourhood of leicester square to which the friends had become partial during this troubled period of their existence  why not come to the mountaineers old boy tom shook his head showing that he was not yet up to such festivity as that and then faddle took his departure  tom at once got out his pen and paper and began to write his letter it may be imagined that it was not written offhand or without many struggles when it was written it ran as follows      sir     you will not i think be surprised to hear from me in    anything but a friendly spirit i went down to you at    aldershot as to a friend whom i could trust with my    bosoms dearest secret and you have betrayed me i told    you of my love a love which has long burned in my heart    and you received my confidence with a smile knowing all    the time that you were my rival i leave it to you to    say what reply you can make as to conduct so damning so    unmanly so dastardlyand so very unlike a friend as    this     however there is no place here for words you have    offered me the greatest insult and the greatest injury    which one man can inflict upon another there is no    possibility of an apology unless you are inclined to    say that you will renounce for ever your claim upon the    hand of miss ayala dormer this i do not expect and    therefore i call upon you to give me that satisfaction    which is all that one gentleman can offer to another    after the injury you have done me i think it quite    impossible that you should refuse     of course i know that duels cannot be fought in england    because of the law i am sorry that the law should have    been altered because it allows so many cowards to escape    the punishment they deserve   tom as he wrote this was very proud of the keenness of the allusion i am quite sure however that a man who bears the colours of a colonel in the british army will not try to get off by such a pretext he was proud too about the colours      france belgium italy the united states and all the    world are open i will meet you wherever you may choose    to arrange a meeting i presume that you will prefer    pistols     i send this by the hands of my friend mr faddle who    will be prepared to make arrangements with you or with    any friend on your behalf he will bring back your reply    which no doubt will be satisfactoryi am sir your most    obedient servant     thomas tringle junior   when after making various copies tom at last read the letter as finally prepared he was much pleased with it doubting whether the colonel himself could have written it better had the task been confided to his hands when faddle came he read it to him with much pride and then committed it to his custody after that they went out and ate their dinner at bolivias with much satisfaction but still with a bearing of deep melancholy as was proper on such an occasion     chapter xxxvi  tom tringle gets an answer   faddle as he went down into the country made up his mind that the law which required such letters to be delivered by hand was an absurd law the post would have done just as well and would have saved a great deal of trouble these gloomy thoughts were occasioned by a conviction that he could not carry himself easily or make himself happy among such howling swells as these alburys if they should invite him to the house the matter would be worse that way than the other he had no confidence in his dress coat which he was aware had been damaged by nocturnal orgies it is all very well to tell a fellow to be as big a swell as anybody else as tom had told him but faddle acknowledged to himself the difficulty of acting up to such advice even the eyes of colonel stubbs turned upon him after receipt of the letter would oppress him  nevertheless he must do his best and he took a gig at the station nearest to albury he was careful to carry his bag with him but still he lived in hope that he would be able to return to london the same day when he found himself within the lodges of stalham park he could hardly keep himself from shivering and when he asked the footman at the door whether colonel stubbs were there he longed to be told that colonel stubbs had gone away on the previous day to somehe did not care whatdistant part of the globe but colonel stubbs had not gone away colonel stubbs was in the house  our friend the colonel had not suffered as tom had suffered since his rejectionbut nevertheless he had been much concerned he had set his heart upon ayala before he had asked her and could not bring himself to change his heart because she had refused him he had gone down to aldershot and had performed his duties abstaining for the present from repeating his offer the offer of course must be repeated but as to the when the where and the how he had not as yet made up his mind then tom tringle had come to him at aldershot communicating to him the fact that he had a rivaland also the other fact that the other rival like himself had hitherto been unsuccessful it seemed improbable to him that such a girl as ayala should attach herself to such a man as her cousin tom but nevertheless he was uneasy he regarded tom tringle as a miracle of wealth and felt certain that the united efforts of the whole family would be used to arrange the match ayala had refused him also and therefore up to the present moment the chances of the other man were no better than his own when tom left him at aldershot he hardly remembered that tom knew nothing of his secret whereas tom had communicated to him his own it never for a moment occurred to him that tom would quarrel with him although he had seen that the poor fellow had been disgusted because he had refused to write the letter  on christmas eve he had gone down to stalham and there he had remained discussing the matter of his love with lady albury to no one else in the house had the affair been mentioned and by sir harry he was supposed to remain there only for the sake of the hunting with sir harry he was of all guests the most popular and thus it came to pass that his prolonged presence at stalham was not matter of special remark much of his time he did devote to hunting but there were half hours devoted in company with lady albury to ayalas perfection and ayalas obstinacy  lady albury was almost inclined to think that ayala should be given up married ladies seldom estimate even the girls they like best at their full value it seems to such a one as lady albury almost a pity that such a one as colonel stubbs should waste his energy upon anything so insignificant as ayala dormer the speciality of the attraction is of course absent to the woman and unless she has considered the matter so far as to be able to clothe her thoughts in male vestments as some women do she cannot understand the longing that is felt for so small a treasure lady albury thought that young ladies were very well and that ayala was very well among young ladies but ayala in getting colonel stubbs for a husband would as lady albury thought have received so much more than her desert that she was now almost inclined to be angry with the colonel my dear friend he said to her one day you might as well take it for granted i shall go after my princess with all the energy which a princess merits  the question is whether she be a princess said lady albury  allow me to say that that is a point on which i cannot admit a doubt she is a princess to me and just at present i must be regarded as the only judge in the matter  she shall be a goddess if you please said lady albury  goddess princess pink or pearlany name you please supposed to convey perfection shall be the same to me it may be that she is in truth no better or more lovely or divine than many another young lady who is at the present moment exercising the heart of many another gentleman you know enough of the world to be aware that every jack has his gill she is my gill and thats an end of it  i hope then that she may be your gill  and in order that she may you must have her here again i should absolutely not know how to go to work were i to find myself in the presence of aunt dosett in kingsbury crescent in answer to this lady albury assured him that she would be quite willing to have the girl again at stalham if it could be managed she was reminding him however how difficult it had been on a previous occasion to overcome the scruples of mrs dosett when a servant brought in word to colonel stubbs that there was a man in the hall desirous of seeing him immediately on particular business then the servant presented our friend faddles card      mr samuel faddle    1 badminton gardens   yes sir said the servant he says he has a letter which he must put into your own particular hands  that looks like a bailiff said lady albury laughing colonel stubbs declaring that he had no special reason to be afraid of any bailiff left the room and went down into the hall  at stalham the real hall of the house was used as a billiardroom and here leaning against the billiard table the colonel found poor faddle when a man is compelled by some chance circumstance to address another man whom he does not know and whom by inspection he feels he shall never wish to know he always hardens his face and sometimes also his voice so it was with the colonel when he looked at faddle a word he did say not in words absolutely uncivil as to the nature of the business in hand then faddle showing his emotion by a quaver in his voice suggested that as the matter was one of extreme delicacy some more private apartment might be provided upon this stubbs led the way into a little room which was for the most part filled with huntinggear and offered the stranger one of the three chairs which it contained faddle sat down finding himself so compelled though the colonel still remained standing and then extracted the fatal epistle from his pocket colonel stubbs said he handing up the missive i am directed by my friend mr thomas tringle junior to put this letter into your own hand when you have read it i shall be ready to consult with you as to its contents these few words he had learnt by heart on his journey down having practised them continually  the colonel took the letter and turning to the window read it with his back to the visitor he read it twice from beginning to end in order that he might have time to resolve whether he would laugh aloud at both faddle and tringle or whether it might not be better to endeavour to soften the anger of poor tom by a message which should be at any rate kindly worded this is from my friend tom tringle he said  from mr thomas tringle junior said faddle proudly  so i perceive i am sorry to think that he should be in so much trouble he is one of the best fellows i know and i am really grieved that he should be unhappy this you know is all nonsense  it is not nonsense at all colonel stubbs  you must allow me to be the judge of that mr faddle it is at any rate nonsense to me he wants me to go somewhere and fight a duelwhich i should not do with any man under any circumstances here there is no possible ground for any quarrel whatsoeveras i will endeavour to explain myself to my friend mr tringle i shall be sure to write to him at onceand so i will bid you good afternoon  but this did not at all suit poor faddle after so long a journey i thought it probable that you would write colonel stubbs and therefore i am prepared to wait if i cannot be accommodated here i will waitwill wait elsewhere  that will not be at all necessary we have a post to london twice a day  you must be aware colonel stubbs that letters of this sort should not be sent by post  the kind of letter i shall write may be sent by post very well it will not be bellicose and therefore there can be no objection  i really think colonel stubbs that you are making very little of a very serious matter  mr faddle i really must manage my own affairs after my own way would you like a glass of sherry if not i need hardly ask you to stay here any longer upon that he went out into the billiardroom and rang the bell poor faddle would have liked the glass of sherry but he felt that it would be incompatible with the angry dignity which he assumed and he left the house without another word or even a gesture of courtesy then he returned to london having taken his bag and dress coat all the way to stalham for nothing  toms letter was almost too good to be lost but there was no one to whom the joke could be made known except lady albury she he was sure would keep poor toms secret as well as his own and to her he showed the letter i pity him from the bottom of my heart he said lady albury declared that the writer of such a letter was too absurd for pity not at all unless he really loved her he wouldnt have been so enraged i suppose he does think that i injured him he did tell me his story and i didnt tell him mine i can understand it all though i didnt imagine he was such a fool as to invite me to travel all round the world because of the harsh laws of great britain nevertheless i shall write to him quite an affectionate letter remembering that should i succeed myself he will be my first cousin by marriage  before he went to bed that night he wrote his letter and the reader may as well see the whole correspondence      my dear tringle     if you will think of it all round you will see that you    have got no cause of quarrel with me any more than i have    with you if it be the case that we are both attached to    your cousin we must abide her decision whether it be in    favour of either of us or as may be too probably the    case equally adverse to both of us if i understand your    letter rightly you think that i behaved unfairly when i    did not tell you of my own affairs upon hearing yours from    your own lips why should i why should i have been held    to be constrained to tell my secret because you for    your own sake had told me yours had i been engaged to    your cousinwhich i regret to say is very far from the    casei should have told you naturally i should have    regarded the matter as settled and should have acquainted    you with a fact which would have concerned you but as    such was not a fact i was by no means bound to tell you    how my affairs stood this ought to be clear to you and i    hope will be when you have read what i say     i may as well go on to declare that under no circumstances    should i fight a duel with you if i thought i had done    wrong in the matter i would beg your pardon i cant    do that as it isthough i am most anxious to appease    youbecause i have done you no wrong     pray forget your animositywhich is in truth    unfoundedand let us be friends as we were before     yours very sincerely     jonathan stubbs   faddle reached london the evening before the colonels letter and again dined with his friend at bolivias at first they were both extremely angry acerbating each others wrath now that he was safe back in london faddle thought that he would have enjoyed an evening among the swells of stalham and felt himself to be injured by the inhospitable treatment he had receivedafter going all the way down there hardly to be asked to sit down  not asked to sit down  well yes i wason a miserable canebottomed chair in a sort of cupboard and he didnt sit down you may call them swells but i think your colonel stubbs is a very vulgar sort of fellow when i told him the post isnt the proper thing for such a letter he only laughed i suppose he doesnt know what is the kind of thing among gentlemen  i should think he does know said tom  then why doesnt he act accordingly would you believe it he never so much as asked me whether i had a mouth on it was just luncheon time too  i suppose they lunch late  they might have asked me i shouldnt have taken it he did say something about a glass of sherry but it was in that sort of tone which tells a fellow that he is expected not to take it and then he pretended to laugh i could see that he was shaking in his shoes at the idea of having to fight he go to the torrid zone he would much rather go to a police office if he thought that there was any fighting on hand i should dust his jacket with a stick if i were you  later on in the evening tom declared that this was what he would do but before he came to that a third bottle of signor bolivias champagne had been made to appear the evening passed between them not without much enjoyment on the opening of that third cork the wine was declared to be less excellent than what had gone before and signor bolivia was evoked in person a gentleman named walker who looked after the establishment made his appearance and with many smiles having been induced to swallow a bumper of the compound himself declared with a knowing shake of the head and an astute twinkle of the eye that the wine was not equal to the last he took a great deal of trouble he assured them to import an article which could not be surpassed if it could be equalled in london always visiting epernay himself once ayear for the purpose of going through the winevaults let him do what he would an inferior bottleor rather a bottle somewhat inferiorwould sometimes make its way into his cellar would mr tringle let him have the honour of drawing another cork so that the exact amount of difference might be ascertained tom gave his sanction the fourth cork was drawn and mr walker sitting down and consuming the wine with his customers was enabled to point out to a hairs breadth the nature and the extent of the variation tringle still thought that the difference was considerable faddle was on the whole inclined to agree with signor bolivia it need hardly be said that the four bottles were paid foror rather scored against tringle who at the present time had a little account at the establishment  show a fellar fellars letters morrer such or something like it was faddles last request to his friend as they bade each other farewell for the night in pall mall but faddle was never destined to see the colonels epistle on his attempting to let himself in at badminton gardens he was kidnapped by his father in his nightshirt and dressinggown and was sent out of london on the following morning by long sea down to aberdeen whither he was intrusted to the charge of a stern uncle our friend tom saw nothing more of his faithful friend till years had rolled over both their heads  by the morning post while tom was still lying sick with headachefor even with signor bolivias wine the pulling of many corks is apt to be dangerousthere came the letter from the colonel bad as tom was he felt himself constrained to read it at once and learned that neither the torrid zone or arctic circle would require his immediate attendance he was very sick and perhaps therefore less high in courage than on the few previous days partly perhaps from that cause but partly also from the colonels logic he did find that his wrath was somewhat abated not but what it was still present to his mind that if two men loved the same girl as ardently as desperately as eternally as he loved ayala the best thing for them would be to be put together like the kilkenny cats till whatever remnant should be left of one might have its chance with the young lady he still thought that it would be well that they should fight to the death but a glimmering of light fell upon his mind as to the colonels abnegation of all treason in the matter i suppose it wasnt to be expected that he should tell he said to himself perhaps i shouldnt have told in the same place but as to forgetting animosity that is out of the question how is a man to forget his animosity when two men want to marry the same girl  about three oclock on that day he dressed himself and sat waiting for faddle to come to him he knew how anxious his friend would be to see the colonels letter but faddle by this time had passed the nore and had added seasickness to his other maladies faddle came to him no more and the tedious hours of the afternoon wore themselves away in his lodgings till he found his solitude to be almost more unbearable than his previous misfortunes at last came the time when he must go out for his dinner he did not dare to attempt the mountaineers and as for bolivia bolivia with his corks and his eatinghouse and his vintages was abominable to him about eight oclock he slunk into a quiet little house on the north side of oxford street and there had two mutton chops some buttered toast and some tea as he drank his tea he told himself that on the morrow he would go back to his mother at merle park and get from her such consolation as might be possible     chapter xxxvii  gertrude is unsuccessful   it was now the middle of january and gertrude tringle had received no reply from her lover to the overture which she had made him nor indeed had she received any letter from him since that to which this overture had been a reply it was now two months since her proposition had been made and during that time her anger had waxed very hot against mr houston after all it might be a question whether mr houston was worth all the trouble which she with her hundred thousand pounds was taking on his behalf she did not like the idea of abandoning him because by doing so she would seem to yield to her father having had a young man of her own it behoved her to stick to her young man in spite of her parents but what is a girl to do with a lover who at the end of two months has made no reply to an offer from herself that he should run away with her and take her to ostend she was in this frame of mind when lo and behold she found her own letter still inclosed in her own envelopebut opened and thrust in amongst some of her fathers papers it was evident enough that the letter had never passed from out of the house there had been treachery on the part of some servantor perhaps her father might have condescended to search the little boxor more probable still augusta had betrayed her then she reflected that she had communicated her purpose to her sister that her sister had abstained from any questions since the letter had been written and that her sister therefore no doubt was the culprit there however was the letter which had never reached her lovers hands and as a matter of course her affections returned with all their full ardour to the unfortunate illused man that her conduct was now watched would she thought be a matter of course her father knew her purpose and like stern parents in general would use all his energies to thwart it sir thomas had in truth thought but little about the matter since he had first thrust the letter away toms troubles and the disgrace brought by them upon travers and treason generally had so occupied his mind that he cared but little for gertrude and her lover but gertrude had no doubt that she was closely watched and in these circumstances was driven to think how she could best use her wits so as to countermine her father to run away from queens gate would she thought be more difficult and more uncomfortable than to perform the same operation at merle park it was intended that the family should remain in the country at any rate till easter and gertrude resolved that there might yet be time for another effort before easter should be past if only she could avoid those hundred argus eyes which were no doubt fixed upon her from all sides  she prepared another letter to her lover which she addressed to him at his club in london in this she told him nothing of her former project except that a letter written by her in november had fallen into the hands of enemies then she gave him to understand that there was need of the utmost caution but that if adequate caution were used she did not doubt they might succeed she said nothing about her great project but suggested to him that he should run down into sussex and meet her at a certain spot indicated outside the parkpalings halfanhour after dusk it might be she said impossible that the meeting should be effected but she thought that she could so manage as to leave the house unwatched at the appointed hour with the object of being especially safe she began and concluded her letter without any names and then managed to deposit it herself in the box of the village postoffice  houston when he received this letter at once made up his mind that he would not be found on the outer side of the parkpalings on the evening named he told himself that he was too old for the romance of lovemaking and that should he be received when hanging about in the dark by some custodian with a cudgel he would have nothing to thank but his own folly he wrote back therefore to say that he regarded the outside of the parkpalings as indiscreet but that he would walk up through the lodgegate to the house at three oclock in the afternoon of the day named and he would take it as an additional mark of her favour if she would meet him on the road gertrude had sent him a mysterious address he was to direct the letter to o p q post office hastings and she was prepared to hire a country boy to act as loves messenger on the occasion but of this instruction frank took no notice addressing the letter to merle park in the usual way  gertrude received her letter without notice from any one on that occasion argus with all his eyes was by chance asleep she was very angry with her loveralmost determined to reject him altogether almost disposed to yield to her angry parents and look out for some other lover who might be accepted in better part but still when the day came she put on her hat and walked down the road towards the lodge  as fortune had itfortune altogether unfavourable to those perils for which her soul was longingno one watched her no one dogged her steps no one took any notice of her till she met frank houston when he had passed about a hundred yards on through the gates and so you have come she said  oh yes i have come i was sure to come when i said so no man is more punctual than i am in these matters i should have come beforeonly i did not get your letter  oh frank  well my darling you are looking uncommonly well and i am so glad to see you how are they all  frank  what is it  oh frank what are we to do  the governor will give way at last i should say  neverthat is while we are as we are now if we were married  ahi wish we were wouldnt it be nice  do you really think so  of course i do im ready tomorrow for the matter of that  but could you do something great  something great as to earning my bread you mean i do not think i could do that i didnt turn my hand to it early enough  i wasnt thinking ofyour bread  you saidcould i do something great  frank i wrote you a letter and described it all how i got the courage to do it i do not know i feel as though i could not bring myself to say it now i wonder whether you would have the courage  i should say so i dont know quite what sort of thing it is but i generally have pluck enough for anything in a common way  this is something in an uncommon way  i couldnt break open travers and treason and get at the safe or anything in that way  it is another sort of safe of which you must break the lock frank another treasure you must steal do you not understand me  not in the least  there is tom said gertrude he is always wandering about the place now like a ghost let us go back to the gate then frank turned you heard i suppose of that dreadful affair about the policeman  there was a row i was told  did you feel that the family were disgraced  not in the least he had to pay five shillingshadnt hefor telling a policeman to go about his business  he waslocked up said gertrude solemnly  its just the same nobody thinks anything about that kind of thing now what is it i have got to do we had better turn back again as soon as we can because i must go up to the house before i go  you will  certainly i will not leave it to your father to say that i came skulking about the place and was ashamed to show my face that would not be the way to make him give you your money  i am sure hed give itif we were once married  if we were married without having it assured before hand we should look very blue if things went wrong afterwards  i asked you whether you had courage  courage enough i think when my body is concerned but i am an awful coward in regard to money i wouldnt mind hashed mutton and baked potatoes for myself but i shouldnt like to see you eating them dearest after all the luxuries to which you have been accustomed  i should think nothing of it  did you ever try i never came absolutely to hashed mutton but ive known how very uncomfortable it is not to be able to pay for the hot joints im willing to own honestly that married life without an income would not have attractions for me  but if it was sure to come  ah then indeedwith you i have just said how nice it would be  have you ever been at ostend she asked suddenly  ostend oh yes there was a man there who used to cheat horribly at écarté he did me out of nearly a hundred pounds one night  but theres a clergyman there im told  i dont think this man was in orders but he might have been parsons come out in so many shapes this man called himself a count it was seven years ago  i am speaking of today  ive not been there since  would you like to go therewith me  it isnt a nice sort of place i should say for a honeymoon but you shall choose when we are married you shall go where you like  to be married she exclaimed  married at ostend would your mother like that  mother oh dear  ill be shot if i know what youre after gertrude if youve got anything to say youd better speak out i want to go up to the house now  they had now taken one or two turns between the lodge and a point in the road from which the house could be observed and at which tom could still be seen wandering about thinking no doubt of ayala here frank stopped as though determined not to turn to the lodge again it was wonderful to gertrude that he should not have understood what she had already said when he talked of her mother going with them to the ostend marriage she was almost beside herself this lover of hers was a man of the world and must have heard of elopements but now had come a time in which she must be plain unless she made up her mind to abandon her plan altogether frank she said if you were to run away with me then we could be married at ostend  run away with you  it wouldnt be the first time that such a thing has been done  the commonest thing in the world my dear when a girl has got her money in her own hands nothing i should like so much  money its always money its nothing but the money i believe  thats unkind gertrude  aint you unkind you wont do anything i ask  my darling that hashed mutton and those baked potatoes are too clear before my eyes  you think of nothing i believe but your dinner  i think unfortunately of a great many other things hashed mutton is simply symbolical under the head of hashed mutton i include poor lodgings growlers when we get ourselves asked to eat a dinner at somebodys table limited washingbills tablenapkins rolled up in their dirt every day for a week antimacassars to save the backs of the chairs a picture of you darning my socks while i am reading a newspaper hired at a halfpenny from the publichouse round the corner a pint of beer in the pewter between usand perhaps two babies in one cradle because we cant afford to buy a second  dont sir  in such an emergency i am bound to give you the advantage both of my experience and imagination  experience  not about the cradles that is imagination my darling it wont do you and i have not been brought up to make ourselves happy on a very limited income  papa would be sure to give us the money she said eagerly  in such a matter as this where your happiness is concerned my dear i will trust no one  my happiness  yes my dear your happiness i am quite willing to own the truth i am not fitted to make you happy if i were put upon the hashed mutton regime as i have described to you i will not run the riskfor your sake  for your own you mean she said  nor for my own if you wish me to add that also  then they walked up towards the house for some little way in silence what is it you intend then she asked  i will ask your father once again  he will simply turn you out of the house she said upon this he shrugged his shoulders and they walked on to the halldoor in silence  sir thomas was not at merle park nor was he expected home that evening frank houston could only therefore ask for lady tringle and her he saw together with mr and mrs traffick in presence of them all nothing could be said of love affairs and after sitting for halfanhour during which he was not entertained with much cordiality he took his leave saying that he would do himself the honour of calling on sir thomas in the city while he was in the drawingroom gertrude did not appear she had retired to her room and was there resolving that frank houston was not such a lover as would justify a girl in breaking her heart for him  and frank as he went to town brought his mind to the same way of thinking the girl wanted something romantic to be done and he was not disposed to do anything romantic for her he was not in the least angry with her acknowledging to himself that she had quite as much a right to her way of looking at things as he had to his but he felt almost sure that the tringle alliance must be regarded as impossible if so should he look out for another heiress or endeavour to enjoy life stretching out his little income as far as might be possibleor should he assume altogether a new character make a hero of himself and ask imogene docimer to share with him a little cottage in whatever might be the cheapest spot to be found in the civilised parts of europe if it was to be hashed mutton and a united cradle he would prefer imogene docimer to gertrude tringle for his companion  but there was still open to him the one further chance with sir thomas and this chance he could try with the comfortable feeling that he might be almost indifferent as to what sir thomas might say to be prepared for either lot is very selfassuring when any matter of difficulty has to be taken in hand on arriving at the house in lombard street he soon found himself ushered once more into sir thomass presence well mr houston what can i do for you today asked the man of business with a pleasant smile  it is the old story sir thomas  dont you think mr houston that there is somethinga littleunmanly shall i call it in coming so often about the same thing  no sir thomas i do not i think my conduct has been manly throughout  weak perhaps would have been a better word i do not wish to be uncourteous and i will therefore withdraw unmanly is it not weak to encounter so many refusals on the same subject  i should feel myself to have been very strong if after so many refusals i were to be successful at last  there is not the least chance of it  why should there be no chance if your daughters happiness depends upon it  there is no chance because i do not believe that my daughters happiness does depend upon it she is foolish and has made a foolish proposition to you  what proposition asked houston in surprise having heard nothing of that intercepted letter  that journey to ostend with the prospect of finding a goodnatured clergyman in the town i hardly think you would be fool enough for that  no sir thomas i should not do that i should think it wrong this he said quite gravely asking no questions but was very much at a loss to know where sir thomas had got his information  i am sure you would think it foolish and it would be foolish i pledge you my word that were you to do such a thing i should not give you a shilling i should not let my girl starve but i should save her from suffering in such a manner as to let you have no share of the sustenance i provided for her  there is no question of that kind said frank angrily  i hope notonly as i know that the suggestion has been made i have thought it well to tell you what would be my conduct if it were carried out  it will not be carried out by me said frank  very well i am glad to hear it to tell the truth i never thought that you would run the risk a gentleman of your sort when he is looking for a wife with money likes to have the money quite certain  no doubt said frank determined not to be browbeaten  and now mr houston let me say one word more to you and then we may part as i hope good friends i do not mean my daughter gertrude to marry any man such as you areby that i mean an idle gentleman without means should she do so in my teeth she would have to bear the punishment of sharing that poor gentlemans idleness and poverty while i lived she would not be allowed absolutely to want and when i died there would be some trifle for her sufficient to keep the wolf from the door but i give you my solemn word and honour that she shall never be the means of supplying wealth and luxury to such a husband as you would be i have better purposes for my hardearned money now goodday with that he rose from his chair and put out his hand frank rose also from his chair took the hand that was offered him and stepped out of travers and treason into lombard street with no special desire to shake the dust off his feet as he did so he felt that sir thomas had been reasonableand he felt also that gertrude tringle would perhaps have been dear at the money  two or three days afterwards he despatched the following little note to poor gertrude at merle park      dear gertrude     i have seen your father again and found him to be    absolutely obdurate i am sure he is quite in earnest    when he tells me that he will not give his daughter to an    impoverished idle fellow such as i am who shall say that    he is wrong i did not dare to tell him so anxious as i    was that he should change his purpose     i feel myself bound in honour believing as i do that he    is quite resolved in his purpose to release you from your    promise i should feel that i was only doing you an injury    were i to ask you to be bound by an engagement which could    not at any rate for many years be brought to a happy    termination     as we may part as sincere friends i hope you will consent    to keep the little token of my regard which i gave you     frank houston     chapter xxxviii  frank houston is penitent   and now the adriatics free to wed another said houston to himself as he put himself into a cab and had himself carried to his club there he wrote that valedictory letter to gertrude which is given at the end of the last chapter had he reason to complain of his fate or to rejoice he had looked the question of an establishment full in the facean establishment to be created by sir thomas tringles money to be shared with sir thomas tringles daughter and had made up his mind to accept it although the prospects were not as he told himself altogether rosy when he first made up his mind to marry gertrudeon condition that gertrude should bring with her at any rate not less than three thousand ayearhe was quite aware that he would have to give up all his old ways of life and all his little pleasures he would become soninlaw to sir thomas tringle with a comfortable house to live in with plenty to eat and drink and probably a horse or two to ride if he could manage things at their best perhaps he might be able to settle himself at pau or some other place of the kind so as to be as far away as possible from tringle influences but his little dinners at one club his little rubbers of whist at the other club his evenings at the opera the pleasant smiles of the ladies whom he loved in a general waythese would be done with for ever earn his own bread why he was going to earn his bread and that in a most disagreeable manner he would set up an establishment not because such an establishment would have any charms for him but because he was compelled by lack of money to make some change in his present manner of life and yet the time had been when he had looked forward to a marriage as the happiest thing that could befall him as far as his nature could love he had loved imogene docimer there had come a glimpse upon him of something better than the little dinners and the little rubbers there had been a prospect of an incomenot ample as would have been that forthcoming from sir thomasbut sufficient for a sweet and modest home in which he thought that it would have sufficed for his happiness to paint a few pictures and read a few books and to love his wife and children even as to that there had been a doubt there was a regret as to the charms of london life but nevertheless he had made up his mindand she without any doubt had made up hers then that wicked uncle had died and was found to have expended on his own pursuits the money which was to have been left to his nephew upon that there was an explanation between frank and imogene and it was agreed that their engagement should be over while a doubtful and dangerous friendship was to be encouraged between them  such was the condition of things when frank first met gertrude tringle at rome now considerably more than twelve months since when gertrude had first received his proposition favourably he had written to imogene a letter in that drolling spirit common to him in which he declared his purposeor rather not his purpose but his untoward fate should the gods be unkind to him she had answered him after the same fashion saying that in regard to his future welfare she hoped that the gods would prove unkind but had he known how to read all that her letter expressed between the lines he would have perceived that her heart was more strongly moved than his own since that time he had learned the lesson there had been a letter or two and then there had been that walk in the wood on the italian side of the tyrolese alps the reader may remember how he was hurried away in the diligence for innspruck because it was considered that his further sojourn in the same house with imogene was dangerous he had gone and even as he went had attempted to make a joke of the whole affair but it had not been quite a joke to him even then there was imogenes love and imogenes angerand together with these an aversion towards the poor girl whom he intended to marrywhich became the stronger the more strongly he was convinced both of imogenes love and of her anger  nevertheless he perseverednot with the best success as has already been told now as he left the house in lombard street and wrote what was intended to be his last epistle to gertrude he was driven again to think of miss docimer indeed he had in his pocket as he sat at his club a little note which he had lately received from that lady which in truth had disturbed him much when he made his last futile efforts at merle park and in lombard street the little note was as follows      dear frank     one little friendly word in spite of our storm on    the tyrolese hillside if miss tringle is to be the    arbiter of your fatewhy then let there be an end of    everything between us i should not care to be called upon    to receive such a mrs frank houston as a dear friend    but if tringle père should at the last moment prove    hardhearted then let me see you againyours     i   with this letter in his pocket he had gone down to merle park determined to put an end to the tringle affair in one way or the other his duty as he had planned it to himself would not be altered by imogenes letter but if that duty should become impracticable why then it would be open to him to consider whatever imogene might have to say to him  the docimers were now in london where it was their custom to live during six months of the year but houston had not been at their house since he had parted from them in the tyrol he had spent but little of his time in london since the autumn and when there had not been anxious to see people who had at any rate treated him somewhat roughly but now it would be necessary that he should answer imogenes letter what should be the nature of such answer he certainly had not as yet decided nor could he have decided before those very convincing assurances of sir thomas tringle that matter was at any rate over and now the adriatic might wed anotherif the adriatic thought well to do so the matter however was one which required a good deal of consideration he gave to it ten minutes of intense thought during which he consumed a cup of coffee and a cigarette and then throwing away the burnt end of the paper he hurried into the morningroom and wrote to the lady as follows      dear imogene     you will not have to press to your bosom as my wife the    second daughter of sir thomas tringle bart the high    honour of that alliance has at last been refused by him in    very plain language had she become mrs frank houston i    do not doubt but you would have done your duty to your own    cousin that lot however has not been written for me in    the book of fates the father is persistent in looking    upon me as an idle profligate adventurer and though he    has been kind enough to hint more than once that it might    be possible for me to achieve the young lady he has    succeeded in convincing me that i never should achieve    anything beyond the barren possession of her beauty a    wife and family on my present very moderate income would    be burdensome and therefore with infinite regrets i    have bade adieu to miss tringle     i have not hitherto been to see either you or your brother    or mrs docimer because i have been altogether unaware    whether you or your brother or mrs docimer would be glad    to see me as you say yourself there was a storm on the    tyrolese hillsidein which there was more than one    wind blowing at the same time i do not find fault with    anybodyperhaps a storm was needed to clear the air but    i hate storms i do not pretend to be a very grand fellow    but i do endeavour not to be disagreeable your brother    if you remember was a little hard but in truth i say    this only to account for my apparent incivility     and perhaps with another objectto gain a little time    before i plunge into the stern necessity of answering all    that you say in your very comprehensive letter of five    lines the first four lines i have answered there will be    no such mrs frank houston as that suggested and then as    to the last line of course you will see me again and    that very speedily so it would seem that the whole letter    is answered     but yet it is not answered there is so much in it that    whole sheets would not answer it a quire of notepaper    stuffed full would hardly contain all that i might find    to say in answer to iton one side and the other nay    i might fill as many reams of folio as are required for a    threevolume novel and then i might call it by one of two    names the doubts of frank houston or the constancy of    imogene docimeras i should at last bring my story to    one ending or the other but the novel would contain that    fault which is so prevalent in the novels of the present    day the hero would be a very nambymamby sort of a    fellow whereas the heroine would be too perfect for human    nature     the hero would be always repeating to himself a certain    line out of a latin poet which of all lines is the most    heartbreaking        the better course i see and know       the worser one is where i go     but then in novels the most indifferent hero comes out    right at last some god comes out of a theatrical cloud    and leaves the poor devil ten thousand ayear and a title    he isnt much of a hero when he does go right under such    inducements but he suffices for the plot and everything    is rosecoloured i would be virtuous at a much cheaper    rateif only a young man with his family might have    enough to eat and drink what is your idea of the lowest    income at which a prudentsay not idioticallyquixotic    heromight safely venture to be heroic     now i have written to you a long letter and think    that i have indicated to you the true state of my    feelings whatever may turn up i do not think i shall go    fortunehunting again if halfamillion in female hands    were to throw itself at my head there is no saying    whether i might not yield but i do not think that i shall    again make inquiry as to the amount of booty supposed    to be within the walls of a city and then sit down to    besiege the city with regular lines of approach it is a    disgusting piece of work i do not say but what i can lie    and did lie foully on the last siege operation but i do    not like it and then to be told that one is unmanly by    the father and a coward by the young lady as occurred to    me in this affair is disheartening they were both right    though i repudiated their assertions this might be borne    as a prelude to success but as part of a failure it is    disgusting at the present moment i am considering what    economy might effect as to a future bachelor life and    am meditating to begin with a couple of mutton chops and    halfapint of sherry for my dinner today i know i shall    break down and have a woodcock and some champagne     i will come to you about three on sunday if you can    manage that your brother should go out and make his calls    and your sister attend divine service in the afternoon it    would be a comfort     yours always     f houston   it was a long rambling letter without a word in it of solid clearlyexpressed meaning but imogene as she read it understood very well its real purport she understood more than its purport for she could see by itmore clearly than the writer did himselfhow far her influence over the man had been restored and how far she might be able to restore it but was it well that she should regain her influence her influence regained would simply mean a renewed engagement no doubt the storm on the hillside had come from the violence of true love on her part no doubt her heart had been outraged by the idea that he should give himself up to another woman after all that had passed between them she had been devoted to him altogether but yet she had been taught by him to regard her love as a passion which of its nature contained something of the ridiculous he had never ceased gently to laugh at himself even in her presence because he had subjected himself to her attraction she had caught up the same spiritor at any rate the expression of spiritand deceived by that he had thought that to relieve herself from the burden of her love would be as easy to her as to him in making this mistake he had been ignorant of the intrinsic difference in the nature of a mans and of a womans heart and had been unaware that that which to a man at his best can only be a part of his interest in his lifes concerns will to a woman be everything she had attempted to follow his lead when it did not seem that by doing so she would lose anything but when the moment of trial came she had not in truth followed his lead at all she made the attempt and in making the attempt gave him her permission to go from her but when she realised the fact that he was goneor goingthen she broke down utterly then there came these contentions between her and her brother and that storm on the hillside  after that she passed some months of wretchedness there was no possibility for her to droll away her love she had taught herself to love the man whether he were good or whether he were badwhether he were stronghearted or whether he were fickleand the thing was there present to her either as a permanent blessing or much more probably a permanent curse as the months went on she learned though she never saw frank himself that his purpose of marrying gertrude tringle was not likely to be carried out then at last she wrote that comprehensive letter of five linesas houston had called it it had been intended to be comprehensive and did in fact contain much more than it seemed to say if you can bring yourself to return to me and to endure whatever inconveniences may be incidental to your doing so i hereby declare that i will do the same and i declare also that i can find for myself no other content in the world except what may come to me from such an agreement between us it was this that she said in that last line in which she had begged him to come to her if at the last moment tringle père should prove to be hardhearted all troubles of poverty all the lingering annoyance of waiting all her possible doubts as to his future want of persistency would be preferable to the great loss which she found herself unable to endure  yes it would be very well that both her brother and her sisterinlaw should be absent when he came to her to neither of them had she said a word of her last correspondenceto neither of them a word of her renewed hopes for the objections which might be raised by either of them would she care little if she could succeed with frank but while that success was still doubtful it would be well to get at any rate the assistance of her sisterinlaw on the sunday afternoon mr docimer would certainly be away from the house it was his custom to go off among his friends almost immediately after lunch and his absence might be counted on as assured but with his wife it was different that project of sending her to church was quite out of the question mrs docimer generally went to church of a sunday morning and then always considered herself to have performed the duties of the day nor did imogene like the idea of this appointment with her lover without a word spoken about it to her sisterinlaw mary she said frank houston is coming here on sunday  frank exclaimed mrs docimer i thought we were to consider ourselves as altogether separated from that fortunate youth  i dont see why  well he left us not with the kindest possible feelings in the tyrol and he has allowed ever so many months to pass by without coming to see us i asked mudbury whether we should have him to dinner one day last week and he said it would be better to let him go his own way  nevertheless he is coming here on sunday  has he written to you  yes he has written to mein answer to a line from me i told him that i wished to see him  was that wise  wise or not i did so  why should you wish to see him  am i to tell you the truth or a lie  not a lie certainly i will not ask for the truth if the truth be unpalatable to you  it is unpalatablebut yet i might as well tell it you i wrote to ask him to come and see me because i love him so dearly  oh imogene  it is the truth  did you tell him so  no i told him nothing i merely said that if this match was over between him and that girl of sir thomas tringle then he might come and see me again that was all that i said his letter was very much longer but yet it did not say much however he is to come and i am prepared to renew our engagement should he declare that he is willing to do so  what will mudbury say  i do not care very much what he says i do not know that i am bound to care if i have resolved to entangle myself with a long engagement and mr houston is willing to do the same i do not think that my brother should interfere i am my own mistress and am dealing altogether with my own happiness  imogene we have discussed this so often before  not a doubt and with such effect that with my permission frank was enabled to ask this young woman with a lot of money to marry him had it been arranged i should have had no right to find fault with him however sore of heart i might have been all that has fallen through and i consider myself quite entitled to renew my engagement again i shall not ask him you may be sure of that  it comes to the same thing imogene  very likely it often happens that ladies mean that to be expressed which it does not become them to say out loud so it may be with me on this occasion nevertheless the word if it have to be spoken will have to be spoken by him what i want you to do now is to let me have the drawingroom alone at three oclock on sunday if anything has to be said it will have to be said without witnesses  with some difficulty mrs docimer was induced to accede to the request and to promise that at any rate for the present nothing should be said to her husband on the subject     chapter xxxix  captain batsby   in the meantime poor ayala whose days were running on in a very melancholy manner under her aunts wings in kingsbury crescent was creating further havoc and disturbing the bosom of another lover at stalham she had met a certain captain batsby and had there attracted his attention captain batsby had begged her to ride with him on one of those huntingdays and had offered to give her a leadhaving been at the moment particularly jealous of colonel stubbs on that day both ayala and nina had achieved great honourbut this to the great satisfaction of captain batsby had not been achieved under the leadership of colonel stubbs larry twentyman long famous among the ridingmen of the ufford and rufford united hunt had been the hero of the hour thus captain batsbys feelings had been spared and after that he had imagined that any kindly feelings which ayala might have had for the colonel had sunk into abeyance then he had sought some opportunity to push himself into ayalas favour but hitherto his success in that direction had not been great  captain batsby was regarded by the inhabitants of stalham as a nuisancebut as a nuisance which could not be avoided he was halfbrother to sir harry whose mother had married as her second husband a certain opulent mr batsby out of lancashire they were both dead now and nothing of them remained but this captain he was goodnatured simple and rich and in the arrangement of the alburycumbatsby affairs which took place after the death of mrs batsby made himself pleasant to everybody concerned sir harry who certainly had no particular affection for his halfbrother always bore with him on this account and lady albury was equally gracious mindful of the wisdom of keeping on good terms with a rich relation it was as yet quite on the cards that the batsby money might come to some of the albury scions  but the captain was anxious to provide himself with a wife who might be the mother of scions of his own in fact he had fallen fearfully in love with ayala and was quite resolved to ask her to be his wife when he found that she was just on the point of flying from stalham he had intended to be quicker in his operations but had lacked opportunity on that last huntingday the colonel had always been still in his way and circumstances had never seemed to favour him when he endeavoured to have a few words in private with the young lady then she was gone and he could only learn respecting her that she lived with her aunt mrs dosett in kingsbury crescent  im blessed if benjamin isnt smitten with that girl benjamin was captain batsby and that girl was of course ayala dormer the man who blessed himself was sir harry albury and the observation was addressed to his wife this took place within an hour of ayalas departure from stalham  benjamin in love with ayala dormer i dont believe a word of it said lady albury it was not surprising that she should not believe it there was her special favourite colonel stubbs infatuated by the same girl and as she was aware tom tringle the heir of travers and treason was in the same melancholy condition and after all according to her thinking there was nothing in the girl to justify all this fury in her eyes ayala was pretty but no more she would have declared that ayala had neither bearing nor beauty nor figure a bright eye a changing colour and something of vivacity about her mouth was all of which ayala had to boast yet here were certainly the heir of the man of millions and that crichton of a colonel both knocked off their legs and now she was told that captain batsby who always professed himself hard to please in the matter of young ladies was in the same condition do you mean to say he told you she asked  no said sir harry he is not at all the man to do that in such a matter he is sure to have a great secret and be sure also to let his secret escape in every word that he speaks you will find that what i say is truth  before the day was out lady albury did find her husband to be correct captain batsby though he was very jealous of his secret acknowledged to himself the necessity of having one confidant he could hardly he thought follow ayala without some assistance he knew nothing of mrs dosett nothing of kingsbury crescent and very little as to ayala herself he regarded lady albury as his chosen friend and generally communicated to her whatever troubles he might have these had consisted chiefly of the persecutions to which he had been subjected by the mothers of portionless young ladies how not to get married off against his will had been the difficulty of his life his half sisterinlaw had hitherto preserved him and therefore to her he now went for assistance in this opposite affair rosalind he said in his gravest voice what do you think i have to tell you  lady albury knew what was coming but of course she hid her knowledge i hope mrs motherly has not written to you again she said mrs motherly was a lady who had been anxious that her daughter should grace captain batsbys table and had written to him letters asking him his intentions  oh dear nothing of that kind i do not care a straw for mrs motherly or the girl either i never said a word to her that any one could make a handle of but i want to say a word to somebody now  what sort of word is it to be ben  ah he groaned rosalind you must understand that i never was so much in earnest in my life  you are always in earnest  then he sighed very deeply i shall expect you to help me through this matter rosalind  do i not always help you  yes you do but you must stick to me now like wax what do you think of that young lady miss dormer  i think she is a pretty girl and the gentlemen tell me that she rides bravely  dont you consider her divine he asked  my dear ben one lady never considers another to be divine among ourselves we are terribly human if not worse do you mean to tell me that you are in love with ayala dormer  you have guessed it said he you always do guess everything  i generally do guess as much as that when young gentlemen find young ladies divine do you know anything about miss dormer  nothing but her beautynothing but her witnothing but her grace i know all that and i dont seem to want to know any more  then you must be in love in the first place she hasnt got a sixpence in the world  i dont want sixpences said the captain proudly  and in the next place i am not at all sure that you would like her people father and mother she has none  then i cannot dislike them  but she has uncles and aunts who are i am afraid objectionable she lives with a mr dosett who is a clerk in somerset housea respectable man no doubt but one whom you would not perhaps want at your house very often  i dont care about uncles and aunts said captain batsby uncles and aunts can always be dropped much easier than fathers and mothers at any rate i am determined to go on and i want you to put me in the way how must i find her  go to no 10 kingsbury crescent bayswater ask for mrs dosett and tell her what youve come about when she knows that you are well off she will not turn a deaf ear to you what the girl may do it is beyond me to say she is very peculiar  peculiar said the captain with another sigh  lady albury did in truth think ayala was very peculiar seeing that she had refused two such men as tom tringle in spite of his wealth and colonel stubbs in spite of his position this she had done though she had no prospects of her own before her and no comfortable home at the present might it not be more than probable that she would also refuse captain batsby who was less rich than the one and certainly less known to the world than the other but as to this it was not necessary that she should say anything to assist colonel stubbs she was bound by true affection for the man in regard to her husbands halfbrother she was only bound to seem to assist him i can write a line to mrs dosett if you wish it she said or to miss dormer  i wish you would it would be best to the aunt and just tell her that i am fairly well off shell tell ayala i could make quite a proper settlement on her that kind of thing does go a long way with young ladies  it ought to do at any rate said lady albury it certainly does with the old ladies then the matter was settled she was to write to mrs dosett and inform that lady that captain batsby intended to call in kingsbury crescent in the form of a suitor for miss ayala dormers hand she would go on to explain that captain batsby was quite in a position to marry and maintain a wife  and if she should accept me youll have her down here rosalind here was a difficulty as it was already understood that ayala was to be again brought down to stalham on the colonels account but lady albury could make the promise as should the captain be accepted no harm would in that case be done to the colonel she was however tolerably sure that the captain would not be accepted and if she shouldnt take me all at once still you might have her suggested the lover as to this which was so probable there would be a great difficulty ayala was to be seduced into coming again to stalham if possiblebut specially on the colonels behoof in such a case it must be done behind the captains back lady albury saw the troubles which were coming but nevertheless she promised that she would see what could be done all this having been settled captain batsby took his leave and went off to london  mrs dosett when she received lady alburys letter was very much surprised she too failed to understand what there was in ayala to produce such a multiplicity of suitors one after another when lucy came to her and had begun to be objectionable she had thought that she might some day be relieved from her troubles by the girls marriage lucy to her eyes was beautiful and mistress of a manner likely to be winning in a mans eyes though ungracious to herself but in regard to ayala she had expressed nothing of the kind ayala was little and flighty and like an elfas she had remarked to her husband but now within twelve months three lovers had appeared and each of them suitable for matrimonial purposes she could only tell her husband and then tell ayala  captain batsby i dont believe it said ayala almost crying if colonel stubbs could not be made to assume the garb of an angel of light what was she to think of captain batsby  you can read lady alburys letter  i dont want to read lady alburys letter i wont see him i dont care what my uncle says i dont care what anybody says yes i do know him i remember him very well i spoke to him once or twice and i did not like him at all  you said the same of colonel stubbs  i didnt say the same of colonel stubbs he is a great deal worse than colonel stubbs  and you said just the same of tom  he is the same as tomjust as bad it is no good going on about him aunt margaret i wont see him if i were locked up in a room with him i wouldnt speak a word to him he has no right to come  a gentleman my dear has always a right to ask a lady to be his wife if he has got means  you always say so aunt margaret but i dont believe it there should bethere should have beeni dont know what but i am quite sure the man has no right to come to me and i wont see him to this resolution ayala clung and as she was very firm about it mrs dosett after consultation with her husband at last gave way and consented to see captain batsby herself  in due time captain batsby came at any knock heard at the door during this period ayala flew out of the drawingroom into her own chamber and at the captains knock she flew with double haste feeling sure that this was the special knock the man was shown up and in a set speech declared his purpose to mrs dosett and expressed a hope that lady albury might have written on the subject might he be allowed to see the young lady  i fear that it would be of no service captain batsby  of no service  on receiving lady alburys letter i was of course obliged to tell my niece the honour you proposed to do her  i am quite in earnest you know said the captain  so i suppose as lady albury would not have written nor would you have come on such a mission but so is my niece in earnest  she will at any rate hear what i have got to say  she would rather not said mrs dosett she thinks that it would only be painful to both of you as she has quite made up her mind that she cannot accept the honour you propose to do her what good would it serve  is miss dormer at home asked the captain suddenly mrs dosett hesitated for a while anxious to tell a lie on the matter but fearing to do so i suppose she is at home continued the urgent lover  miss dormer is at present in her own chamber  then i think i ought to see her continued the captain she cant know at present what is my income  lady albury has told us that it is sufficient  but that means nothing your niece cannot be aware that i have a very pretty little place of my own down in berkshire  i dont think it would make a difference said mrs dosett  or that i shall be willing to settle upon her a third of my income it is not many gentlemen who will do as much as that for a young lady when the young lady has nothing of her own  i am sure you are very generous  yes i am i always was generous and i have no impediments to get rid of not a trouble of that kind in all the world and i dont owe a shilling very few young men who have lived as much in the world as i have can say that  i am sure your position is all that is desirable  thats just it no position could be more desirable i should give up the service immediately as soon as i was married at that mrs dosett bowed not knowing what words to find for further conversation after that continued the captain do you mean to say that i am not to be allowed to see the young lady  i cannot force her to come down captain batsby  i would if i were you  force a young lady  something ought to be done said he beginning almost to whine i have come here on purpose to see her and i am quite prepared to do what is handsome my halfsister lady albury had her down at stalham and is quite anxious to have her there again i suppose you have no objection to make to me mrs dosett  oh dear no  or mr dosett  i do not say that he has captain batsby but this is a matter in which a young ladys word must be paramount we cannot force her to marry you or even to speak to you the captain still went on with entreaties till mrs dosett found herself so far compelled to accede to him as to go up to ayalas room and beg her to come down and answer this third suitor with her own voice but ayala was immovable when her aunt came near her she took hold of the bed as though fearing an attempt would be made to drag her out of the room she again declared that if she were forced into the room below nothing could oblige her to speak even a word  as for thanking him she said you can do that yourself aunt margaret if you like i am not a bit obliged to him but if you choose to say so you may only pray do tell him to go awayand tell him never never to come back any more then mrs dosett returned to the drawingroom and declared that her embassy had been quite in vain  in all my life said captain batsby as he took his leave i never heard of such conduct before nevertheless as he went away he made up his mind that lady albury should get ayala again down to stalham he was very angry but his love remained as hot as ever  as i did not succeed in seeing her he said in a letter to his halfsister of course i do not know what she might have said to me herself i might probably have induced her to give me another hearing i put it all down to that abominable aunt who probably has some scheme of her own and would not let miss dormer come down to me if you will have her again at stalham everything may be made to go right                                          at home in kingsbury crescent when ayala had gone to bed both mr and mrs dosett expressed themselves as much troubled by the peculiarity of ayalas nature mrs dosett declared her conviction that that promised legacy from uncle tom would never be forthcoming because he had been so much offended by the rejection of his own son and even should the legacy remain written in sir thomass will where would ayala find a home if mr dosett were to die before the baronet this rejection of suitorsof fit welltodo unobjectionable suitorswas held by mrs dosett to be very wicked and a direct flying in the face of providence does she think said mrs dosett urging the matter with all her eloquence to her husband that young men with incomes are to be coming after her always like this mr dosett shook his head and scratched it at the same time which was always a sign with him that he was not at all convinced by the arguments used but that he did not wish to incur further hostility by answering them why shouldnt she see an eligible man when he comes recommended like this  i suppose my dear she didnt think him nice enough  nice pshaw i call it a direct flying in the face of providence if he were ever so nasty and twice as old she ought to think twice about it in her position there is poor tom they say absolutely ill the housekeeper was over here from queens gate the other day and she declares that that affair about the policeman all came from his being in love and now he has left the business and has gone to merle park because he is so knocked in a heap that he cannot hold up his head  i dont see why love should make a man punch a policemans breath out of him said mr dosett  of course tom was foolish but he would do very well if she would have him of course your sister and sir thomas and all of them will be very furious what right will she have to expect money after that  tom is an ass said mr dosett  i suppose colonel stubbs is an ass too what i want to know is what it is she looks for like any other girl she expects to get married some day i suppose but she has been reading poetry and novels and trash till she has got her head so full of nonsense that she doesnt know what it is she does want i should like to shake her till i shook all the romance out of her if there is anything i do hate it is romance while bread and meat and coals and washing are so dear with this mrs dosett took herself and her troubles up to her bedroom  mr dosett sat for a while gazing with speculative eyes at the embers of the fire he was conscious in his heart that some part of that attack upon romance in general was intended for himself though he did not look to be romantic especially when seated at his desk in somerset house with his big indexbook before him still there was left about him some touch of poetry and an appreciation of the finer feelings of our nature though he could have wished that ayala should have been able to take one of these three welltodo suitors who were so anxious to obtain her hand still he could not bring himself not to respect her still he was unable not to love her because she was steadfastly averse to accept as a husband a man for whom she had no affection as he looked at the embers he asked himself how it ought to be here was a girl whose only gift in life was her own personal charm that that charm must be powerful was evident from the fact that she could so attract such men as these of the good things of the world of a pleasant home of ample means and of all that absence of care which comes from money poor mr dosett had by no means a poor appreciation that men are justified in seeking these good things by their energy industry and talents he was quite confident how was it with a girl who had nothing else but her beautyor perhaps her witin lieu of energy and industry was she justified in carrying her wares also into the market and making the most of them the embers had burned so low and he had become so cold before he had settled the question in his own mind that he was obliged to go up to bed leaving it unsettled     chapter xl  aunt emmelines new proposition   a few days after this just as the bread and cheese had been put on the table for the modest midday meal at kingsbury crescent there came a most unwonted honour on mrs dosett it was a call from no less a person than lady tringle herself who had come all the way up from merle park on purpose it was a saturday she had travelled by herself and intended to go back on the same day with her husband this was an amount of trouble which she very seldom gave herself not often making a journey to london during the periods of her rural sojourn and when she began by assuring her sisterinlaw that she made the journey with no object but that of coming to kingsbury crescent mrs dosett was aware that something very important was to be communicated mrs dosett and ayala were together in the diningroom when lady tringle appeared and the embracings were very affectionate they were particularly affectionate towards ayala who was kissed as though nothing had ever happened to interfere with the perfect love existing between the aunt and the niece they were more than friendly almost sisterly towards mrs dosett whom in truth lady tringle met hardly more than once in a year it was very manifest that aunt emmeline wanted to have something done now my darling she said turning to ayala if you would not mind going away for ten minutes i could say a few words on very particular business to your aunt then she gave her niece a tender little squeeze and assumed her sweetest smile  it will be as well to go back a little and tell the cause which had produced this unexpected visit there had been very much of real trouble at merle park everything was troublesome gertrude had received her final letter from her lover had declared herself to be brokenhearted and was evincing her sorrow by lying in bed half the day abstaining from her meals and relieving herself from famine by sly visits to the larder it was supposed that her object was to bend the stony heart of her father but the process added an additional trouble to her mother then the trafficks were a sore vexation it was now nearly the end of january and they were still at merle park there had been a scene in which sir thomas had been very harsh my dear he had said to his wife i find that something must be done to the chimney of the north room the workmen must be in it by the first of february see and have all the furniture taken out before they come now the north room was the chamber in which the trafficks slept and the trafficks were present when the order was given no one believed the story of the chimney this was the mode of expulsion which sir thomas had chosen on the spur of the moment mr traffick said not a word but in the course of the morning augusta expostulated with her mother this was also disagreeable then the condition of tom was truly pitiable all his trust in champagne all his bellicose humour had deserted him he moped about the place the most miserable of human beings spending hour after hour in imploring his mothers assistance but lucy with her quiet determination and mute persistency in waiting was a source of almost greater annoyance to her aunt than even her own children that lucy should in any degree have had her way with mr hamel had gone against the grain with her mr hamel to her thinking was a person to be connected with whom would be a disgrace she was always speaking of his birth of his fathers life and of those roman iniquities she had given way for a time when she had understood that her husband intended to give the young people money enough to enable them to marry in that case lucy would at once be taken away from the house but now all that had come to an end sir thomas had given no money and had even refused to give any money nevertheless he was peacefully indulgent to lucy and was always scolding his wife because she was hostile to lucys lover  in this emergency she induced him to accede to a proposition by which one of her miseries would be brought to an end and another might perhaps be remedied a second exchange should be made lucy should be sent back to kingsbury crescent and ayala should once more be brought into favour at merle park queens gate and glenbogie your brother will never put up with it said sir thomas lady tringle was not afraid of her brother and thought that by soft words she might even talk over her sisterinlaw ayala she knew had been troublesome in kingsbury crescent she was sure she said ayalas whims would of their nature be more troublesome to such a woman as mrs dosett than lucys obstinacy ayala had no doubt been pert and disobedient at glenbogie and at rome but there had been an unbending obduracy about lucy which had been more distasteful to aunt emmeline than even ayalas pert disobedience it will be the only way she had said to sir thomas to put tom on his legs again if the girl comes back here she will be sure to have him at last there was much in this which to sir thomas was weak and absurd that prolonged journey round by san francisco japan and pekin was the remedy which recommended itself to him but he was less able to despatch tom at once to japan than the elder faddle had been to send off the younger faddle to the stern realities of life in aberdeen he was quite willing that tom should marry ayala if it could be arranged and therefore he gave his consent  so armed lady tringle had come up to kingsbury crescent and was now about to undertake a task which she acknowledged to herself to be difficult she in the first place had had her choice and had selected a niece then she had quarrelled with her own selection and had changed nieces this had been done to accommodate her own fancy and now she wanted to change the nieces back again she felt aware that her request was unreasonable and came therefore determined to wrap it up in her blandest smiles  when ayala had left the room mrs dosett sat mute in attention she was quite aware that something very much out of the ordinary way was to be asked of her in her ordinary way lady tringle never did smile when she came to kingsbury crescent she would be profuse in finery and would seem to throw off sparks of wealth at every word she spoke now even her dress had been toned down to her humbler manner and there was no touch of her husbands purse in her gait margaret she said i have a proposition of great importance to make to you mrs dosett opened her eyes wider and sat still mute that poor girl is notis notis not doing perhaps the very best for herself here at kingsbury crescent  why is she not doing the best for herself asked mrs dosett angrily  do not for a moment suppose that i am finding fault either with you or my brother  youd be very wrong if you did  no doubtbut i am not finding fault i know how very generous you have both been of course sir thomas is a rich man and what he gives to one of the girls comes to nothing of course it is different with you it is hard upon my brother to have any such burden put upon him and it is very good both in him and you to bear it  what is it you want us to do now emmeline  welli was going to explain i do think it a great pity that tom and ayala should not become man and wife if ever any young man ever did love a girl i believe that he loves her  i think he does  it is dreadful i never saw anything like it he is just for all the world like those young men we read of who do all manner of horrible things for lovesmothering themselves and their young women with charcoal or throwing them into the regents canal i am constantly afraid of something happening it was all because of ayala that he got into that terrible row at the police courtand then we were afraid he was going to take to drink he has given all that up now  i am very glad he has given drink up that wouldnt do him any good  he is quite different now the poor fellow hardly takes anything he will sit all the afternoon smoking cigarettes and sipping tea it is quite sad to see him then he comes and talks to me and is always asking me to make ayala have him  i dont think that anybody can ever make ayala do anything  not quite by talking to her i dare say not i did not mean to say a word to her about it just now  we can do nothing i fear said mrs dosett  i was going to suggest something but i wanted first to say a word or two about poor lucy they were just at present all poor to lady tringleayala lucy tom and gertrude even augusta was poor because she was to be turned out of her bedroom  is she in trouble  oh dear yes but she added thinking well to correct herself so that mrs dosett might not imagine that she would have to look forward to troubles with lucy she could arrange her affairs no doubt if she were not with us she is engaged to that mr isadore hamel the sculptor  so i have heard  he does not earn very much just at present i fear sir thomas did offer to help him but he was perhaps a little hoitytoity giving himself airs that however did not come off and there they are waiting i dont mean to say a word against poor lucy i think it a pity you know but perhaps it was natural enough he isnt what i should have liked for a niece who was living with me just as though she was my daughter but i couldnt help that  but what are we to do emmeline  let them just change places again  change again ayala go to you and lucy come back here  just that if ayala were with us she would be sure to get used to tom at last and then lucy could manage her affairs with mr hamel so much better if she were with you  why should she manage her affairs better if she were with us  lady tringle was aware that this was the weak part of her case on the poor ayala and poor tom side of the question there was a good deal which might be said then though she might not convince she might be eloquent but touching lucy she could say nothing which did not simply signify that she wanted to get rid of the girl now mrs dosett had also wanted to get rid of lucy when the former exchange had been made what i mean is that if she were away sir thomas would be more likely to do something for her this was an invention at the spur of the moment  do you not feel that the girls should not be chucked about like balls from a battledore asked mrs dosett  for their own good margaret i only propose it for their own good you cant but think it would be a good thing for ayala to be married to our tom  if she liked him  why shouldnt she like him you know what that means poor ayala is young and a little romantic she would be a great deal happier if all that could be knocked out of her she has to marry somebody and the sooner she settles down the better sir thomas will do anything for thema horse and carriage and anything she could set her heart upon there is nothing sir thomas would not do for tom so as to get him put upon his legs again  i dont think ayala would go  she must you know whispered lady tringle if we both tell her  and lucy  she must too again whispered lady tringle if they are told they are to go what else can they do why shouldnt ayala wish to come  there were quarrels before  yesbecause of augusta augusta is married now lady tringle could not quite say that augusta was gone  will you speak to ayala  perhaps it would come better from you margaret if you agree with me  i am not sure that i do i am quite sure that your brother would not force her to go whether she wished it or not no doubt we should be glad if the marriage could be arranged but we cannot force a girl to marry and her aversion in this case is so strong  aversion  aversion to being married i mean it is so strong that i do not think she will go of her own accord to any house where she is likely to meet her cousin i dare say she may be a fool i say nothing about that of course she shall be asked and if she wishes to go then lucy can be asked too but of course it must all depend upon what your brother says  then lady tringle took her leave without again seeing ayala herself and as she went declared her intention of calling at somerset house she would not think it right she said in a matter of such importance to leave london without consulting her brother it might be possible she thought that she would be able to talk her brother over whereas his wife if she had the first word might turn him the other way  is aunt emmeline gone asked ayala when she came down i am glad she has gone because i never know how to look when she calls me dear i know she hates me  i hope not ayala  i am sure she does because i hated augusta i do hate augusta and my aunt hates me the only one of the lot i like is uncle tom  then the proposition was made ayala sitting with her mouth wide open as the details one after another were opened out to her her aunt did it with exquisite fairness abstaining from opening out some of the details which might be clear enough to ayala without any explanation her aunt emmeline was very anxious to have her back againthe only reason for her former expulsion having been the enmity of augusta her uncle tom and her aunt and no doubt gertrude would be very glad to receive her not a word was said about tom then something was urged as to the material comforts of the tringle establishments and of the necessary poverty of kingsbury crescent  and lucy is to have the poverty said ayala indignantly  i think it probable my dear that before long lucy will become the wife of mr hamel  and you want to get rid of me demanded ayala  no my dear not so you must not think that for a moment the proposition has not originated with me at all i am endeavouring to do my duty by explaining to you the advantages which you would enjoy by going to your aunt emmeline and which you certainly cannot have if you remain here and i must tell you that if you return to sir thomas he will probably provide for you you know what i mean by providing for you  no i dont said ayala who had in her mind some dim idea that her cousin tom was supposed to be a provision she was quite aware that her aunt margaret in her explanation as hitherto given had not mentioned toms name and was sure that it had not been omitted without reason  by providing i mean that if you are living in his house he will leave you something in his willas would be natural that he should do for a child belonging to him your uncle reginaldthis she said in a low and very serious tonewill i fear have nothing to leave to you then there was silence for some minutes after which mrs dosett asked the important question well ayala what do you think about it  must i go said ayala may i stay  yes my dear you may certainly stay if you wish it  then i will stay said ayala jumping up on to her feet you do not want to turn me out aunt margaret then she went down on her knees and leaning on her aunts lap looked up into her face if you will keep me i will try to be good  my dear you are good i have nothing to complain of of course we will keep you nobody has thought for a moment of bidding you go but you should understand that when your aunt made the proposition i was bound to tell it you then there was great embracing and kissing and ayala felt that she was relieved from a terrible danger she had often declared that no one could make her marry her cousin tom but it had seemed to her for a moment that if she were given up bodily to the tringles no mode of escape would be open to her short of suicide there had been a moment almost of regret that she had never brought herself to regard jonathan stubbs as an angel of light  at somerset house lady tringle made her suggestion to her brother with even more flowery assurance of general happiness than she had used in endeavouring to persuade his wife ayala would of course be married to tom in the course of the next six months and during the same period lucy no doubt would be married to that very enterprising but somewhat obstinate young man mr hamel thus there would be an end to all the dormer troubles and you reginald she said will be relieved from a burden which never ought to have been laid upon your shoulder  we will think of it he said very gravely over and over again beyond that we will think of it he could not be induced to utter a word     chapter xli  a cold prospect   three days were allowed to frank houston to consider within his own mind what he would say for himself and what he would propose finally to do when he should see miss docimer on the appointed sunday he was called upon to decide whether after so many resolutions made to the contrary he would now at last bring himself to encounter poverty and a familygenteel poverty with about seven hundred and fifty pounds ayear between himself and his wife he had hitherto been very staunch on the subject and had unfortunately thought that imogene docimer had been as firmly fixed in her determination his theory had in itself been good if two people marry they are likely according to the laws of nature to have very soon more than two in the process of a dozen years they may not improbably become ever so many more than two funds which were barely enough if enough for two would certainly fail to be enough for halfadozen his means were certainly not enough for himself as he had hitherto found them imogenes means were less even than his own therefore it was clear that he and imogene ought not to marry and encounter the danger of all those embryo mouths there was a logic about it which had seemed to him to be unanswerable it was a logic which applied to his case above all others the man who had a hope of earning money need not be absolutely bound by it to him the money might come as quickly as the mouths with the cradles would arrive the means of buying the cradles and to the man who had much more than enough for himselfto such a man as he had expected to be while he was looking forward to the coffin of that iniquitous unclethe logic did not apply at all in defending himself both to himself and to imogene he was very strong upon that point a man who had plenty and would not divide his plenty with another might with truth be called selfish rich old bachelors might with propriety be called curmudgeons but was it right that a man should be abusedeven by a young lady to whom under more propitious circumstances he had offered his heartwhen he declared himself unwilling to multiply suffering by assisting to bring into the world human beings whom he would be unable to support he had felt himself to be very strong in his logic and had unfortunately made the mistake of supposing that it was as clear to imogene as to himself  then he had determined to rectify the inconvenience of his position it had become manifest to him whilst he was waiting for his uncles money that not only were his own means insufficient for married life but even for single comfort it would always come to pass that when he had resolved on two mutton chops and halfapint of sherry the humble little meal would spread itself into woodcock and champagne he regarded it as an unkindness in providence that he should not have been gifted with economy therefore he had to look about him for a remedy and as imogene was out of the question he found a remedy in gertrude tringle he had then believed that everything was settled for himnot indeed in a manner very pleasant but after a fashion that would make life possible to him sir thomas had given one of his daughters with a large sum of money to such a man as septimus trafficka man more impecunious than himself one whom frank did not hesitate to pronounce to be much less of a gentleman that seat in the house of commons was to him nothing there were many men in the house of commons to whom he would hardly condescend to speak to be the younger son of a latterday peer was to him nothing he considered himself in all respects to be a more eligible husband than septimus traffick therefore he had entertained but little doubt when he found himself accepted by gertrude herself and her mother then by degrees he had learnt to know something of the young lady to whom he intended to devote himself and it had come to pass that the better he had known the less he had liked her nevertheless he had persevered groaning in spirit as he thought of the burden with which he was about to inflict himself then had come the release sir thomas had explained to him that no money would be forthcoming and the young lady had made to him a foolish proposition which as he thought fully justified him in regarding the match as at an end  and then he had three days in which to make up his mind it may be a question whether three days are ever much better than three minutes for such a purpose a mans mind will very generally refuse to make itself up until it be driven and compelled by emergency the three days are passed not in forming but in postponing judgment in nothing is procrastination so tempting as in thought so it came to pass that through the thursday the friday and the saturday frank houston came to no conclusion though he believed that every hour of the time was devoted to forming one then as he ate his dinner on saturday night at his club a letter was brought to him the handwriting of which was familiar to him this letter assisted him little in thinking  the letter was from gertrude tringle and need not be given in its entirety there was a good deal of reproach in that he had been so fickle as to propose to abandon her at the first touch of adversity then she had gone on to say that knowing her father a great deal better than he could do she was quite satisfied that the money would be all right but the last paragraph of the letter shall be given papa has almost yielded already i have been very illhere the extent of her malady was shown by the strength of the underscoring with which the words were made significantvery ill indeed she went on to say as you will understand if you have ever really loved me i have kept my bed almost ever since i got your cruel letter bed and cruel were again strenuously underscored it has made papa very unhappy and though he has said nothing to myself he has told mamma that if i am really in earnest he will do something for us the letter was long but this is all the reader need see of it but it must be explained that the young lady had greatly exaggerated her mothers words and that her mother had exaggerated those which sir thomas had spoken she is a stupid idiot sir thomas had said to his wife if she is obedient and does her duty of course i shall do something for her some day this had been stretched to that promise of concession which gertrude communicated to her lover  this was the assistance which frank houston received in making up his mind on saturday night if what the girl said was true there was still open to him the manner of life which he had prepared for himself and he did believe the announcement to be true though sir thomas had been so persistent in his refusals his experience in life had taught him to believe that a parents sternness is never a match for a daughters obstinacy had there been a touch of tenderness in his heart to the young lady herself he would not have abandoned her so easily but he had found his consolation when giving up his hope of sir thomass money now should he again take to the girl and find his consolation in accepting the money should he resolve upon doing so this would materially affect any communication which he might make to imogene on the following day  while thus in doubt he went into the smokingroom and there he found any thinking to be out of the question a great question was being debated as to club law one man had made an assertion he had declared that another man had been seen playing cards in a third mans company a fourth man had thereupon put his hat on his head and had declared contumaciously that the assertion was not true having so declared he had contumaciously stalked out of the room and had banged the door after himvery contumaciously indeed the question was whether the contumacious gentleman had misbehaved himself in accordance with the rules of the club and if so what should be done to him not true is as bad as false false applied to a gentleman in a club must be matter either of an apology or expulsion the objectionable word had no doubt been said in defence of an absent man and need not perhaps have been taken up had the speaker not at once put on his hat and stalked out of the room and banged the door it was asserted that a lie may be given by the way in which a door is banged and yet no club punishes the putting on of hats or stalking off or the banging of doors it was a difficult question and occupied frank houston till two oclock in the morning to the exclusion of gertrude tringle and imogene docimer  on the sunday morning he was not up early nor did he go to church the contumacious gentleman was a friend of his whom he knew that no arguments would induce to apologise he believed also that gentleman no 3 might have been seen playing cards with gentleman no 2so that there was no valid excuse for the banging of the door he was much exercised by the points to be decided so that when he got into a cab to be taken to mrs docimers house he had hardly come to any other conclusion than that one which had arisen to him from a comparison between the two young ladies imogene was nearly perfect and gertrude was as nearly the reverse as a young lady could be with the proper number of eyes in her head and a nose between them the style of her letter was abominable to him very ill indeedas you will understand if you ever really loved me there was a mawkish claptrap about it which thoroughly disgusted him everything from imogene was straightforward and downright whether it were love or whether it were anger but then to be settled with an income of £3000 a year would relieve him from such a load of care  and so tringle père does not see the advantage of such a soninlaw said imogene after the first greetings were over between them the greetings had been very simplejust a touch of the hand just a civil wordcivil but not in the least tender just an inclination of the head and then two seats occupied with all the rug between them  yes indeed said frank the man is a fool because he will probably get somebody who will behave less well to his daughter and make a worse use of his money  just so one can only be astonished at his folly is there no hope left  a glimmer there is  oh indeed  i got a letter last night from my ladylove in which she tells me that she is very ill and that her sickness is working upon her fathers bowels  frank  it is the proper languageworking upon her fathers bowels of compassion fathers always have bowels of compassion at last  you will return then of course  what do you say  as for myselfor as for you  as a discreet and trusty counsellor to me you have always been a trusty counsellor  then i should put a few things into a bag go down to merle park and declare that in spite of all the edicts that ever came from a fathers mouth you cannot absent yourself while you know that your gertrude is ill  and so prepare a new cousin for you to press to your bosom  if you can endure her for always why should not i for an hour or two now and again  why not indeed in fact imogene this enduring and not enduringeven this living and not livingis after all but an affair of the imagination who can tell but that as years roll on she may be betterlooking even than you  certainly  and have as much to say for herself  a great deal more that is worth hearing  and behave herself as a mother of a family with quite as much propriety  in all that i do not doubt that she would be my superior  more obedient i am sure she would be  or she would be very disobedient  and then she can provide me and my children with ample comforts  which i take it is the real purpose for which a wife should be married  therefore said heand then he stopped  and therefore there should be no doubt  though i hate her he said clenching his fist with violence as he spoke with every fibre of my heartstill you think there should be no doubt  that frank is violent languageand foolish  and though i love you so intensely that whenever i see her the memory of you becomes an agony to me  such language is only more violent and more foolish  surely not if i have made up my mind at last that i never will willingly see miss tringle again here he got up and walking across the rug stood over her and waited as though expecting some word from her but she putting her two hands up to her head and brushing her hair away from her forehead looked up to him for what further words might come to him surely not he continued if i have made up my mind at last that nothing shall ever again serve to rob me of your loveif i may still hope to possess it  oh frank she said how mean i am to be a creature obedient to the whistle of such a master as you  but are you obedient  you know that well enough i have had no gertrude with whom i have vacillated whether for the sake of love or lucre whatever you may bewhether mean or nobleyou are the only man with whom i can endure to live for whom i would endure to die of course i had not expected that your love should be like mine how should it be so seeing that you are a man and that i am but a woman here he attempted to seat himself by her on the sofa which she occupied but she gently repulsed him motioning him towards the chair which he had occupied sit there frank she said so that we may look into each others faces and talk seriously is it to come to this then that i am to ruin you at last  there will be no ruin  but there will if we are married now shall i tell you the kind of life which would satisfy me  some little place abroad he asked  oh dear no no place to which you would be confined at all if i may remain as i am knowing that you intend to marry no one else feeling confident that there is a bond binding us together even though we should never become man and wife i should be if not happy at least contented  that is a cold prospect  coldbut not icecold as would have been the other cold but not wretchedly cold as would be the idea always present to me that i had reduced you to poverty frank i am so far selfish that i cannot bear to abandon the idea of your love but i am not so far selfish as to wish to possess it at the expense of your comfort shall it be so  be how said he speaking almost in anger  let us remain just as we are only you will promise me that as i cannot be your wife there shall be no other i need hardly promise you that there will be no other husband now he sat frowning at her while she still pressing back her hair with her hands looked eagerly into his face if this will be enough for you she said it shall be enough for me  no by gd  frank  it will certainly not be enough for me i will have nothing to do with so damnable a compact  damnable  yes that is what i call it that is what any man would call itand any woman too who would speak her mind  then sir perhaps you will be kind enough to make your proposition i have made mine such as it is and am sorry that it should not have been received at any rate with courtesy but as she said this there was a gleam of a bright spirit in her eyes such as he had not seen since first the name of gertrude had been mentioned to her  yes said he you have made your proposition and now it is only fair that i should make mine indeed i made it already when i suggested that little place abroad let it be abroad or at home or of what nature it mayso that you shall be there and i with you it shall be enough for me that is my proposition and if it be not accepted then i shall return to miss tringle and all the glories of lombard street  frank she said then before she could speak another word he had risen from his seat and she was in his arms frank she continued pushing back his kisses how impossible it is that i should not be obedient to you in all things i knowi know that i am agreeing to that which will cause you some day to repent  by heavens no said he i am changed in all that  a man cannot change at once your heart is soft but your nature remains the same frank i could be so happy at this moment if i could forget the picture which my imagination points to me of your future life your love and your generous words and the look out of your dear eyes are sweet to me now as when i was a child whom you first made so proud by telling her that she owned your heart if i could only revel in the return of your affections  it is no return said he there has never been a moment in which my affections have not been the same  well thenin these permitted signs of your affectionif it were not that i cannot shut out the future do not press me to name any early day because no period of my future life will be so happy to me as this  is there any reason why i should not intrude said mrs docimer opening the door when the above conversation had been extended for perhaps another hour  not in the least as far as im concerned said frank a few words have been spoken between us all of which may be repeated to you if imogene can remember them  every one of them said imogene but i hardly think that i shall repeat them  i suppose they have been very much a matter of course said mrs docimerthe old story repeated between you two for the fourth or fifth time considering all things do you think that i should congratulate you  i ask for no congratulation said imogene  you may certainly congratulate me said frank after that the conversation became tame and the happy lover soon escaped from the house into the street when there he found very much to occupy his mind he had certainly made his resolution at last and had done so in a manner which would now leave him no power of retrogression the whole theory of his life hadwith a vengeancebeen thrown to the winds the little place abroador elsewherewas now a settled certainty he had nearly got the better of her he had all but succeeded in putting down his own love and hers by a little gentle ridicule and by a few halfwise phrases which she at the moment had been unable to answer but she now had in truth vanquished him by the absolute sincerity of her love     chapter xlii  another duel   frank houston on that sunday afternoon became an altered man the reader is not to suppose by this that he is declared to have suddenly thrown off all his weaknesses and to have succeeded in clothing himself in an armour of bright steel proof for the rest of his life against all temptations such suits of armour are not to be had at a moments notice nor as i fear can a man ever acquire one quite perfect at all points who has not begun to make it for himself before houstons age but he did on that day dine off the two mutton chops and comforted himself with no more than the halfpint of sherry it was a great beginning throughout the whole evening he could not be got for a moment to join any of the club juntas which were discussing the great difficulty of the contumacious gentleman i think he must really be going to be married at last one club pundit said when a question was asked as to houstons singular behaviour on the occasion  he was indeed very soberso sober that he left the smokingroom as soon as his one silent cigar was finished and went out alone in order that he might roam the streets in thoughtful solitude it was a clear frosty night and as he buttoned his great coat around him he felt that the dry cold air would do him good and assist his meditations at last then everything was arranged for him and he was to encounter exactly that mode of life which he had so often told himself to be most unfit for him there were to be the cradles always full and his little coffer so nearly empty and he had done it all for himself she imogene had proposed a mode of life to him which would at any rate have saved him from this but it had been impossible that he should accept a plan so cruel to her when the proposition came from herself it must all soon be done now she had asked that a distant day might be fixed for their marriage even that request coming from her made it almost imperative upon him to insist upon an early day it would be well for him to look upon tomorrow or a few morrows whose short distance would be immaterial as the time fixed  nothere should be no going back now so he declared to himself endeavouring to prepare the suit of armour for his own wearing pau might be the best placeor perhaps one of those little towns in brittany dresden would not do because there would be society at dresden and he must of course give up all ideas of society he would have liked rome but rome would be far too expensive and then residents in rome require to be absent three or four months every year he and his wife and large familyhe had no doubt in life as to the large familywould not be able to allow themselves any recreation such as that he thought he had heard that the ordinary comforts of life were cheap in the west of irelandor if not cheap unobtainable which would be the same thing perhaps castlebar might be a good locality for his nursery there would be nothing to do at castlebarno amusement whatever for such a one as himself no fitting companion for imogene but then amusement for himself and companions for imogene must of course be out of the question he thought that perhaps he might turn his hand to a little useful gardeningparsnips instead of roseswhile imogene would be at work in the nursery he would begin at once and buy two or three dozen pipes because tobacco would be so much cheaper than cigars he knew a shop at which were to be had some very pretty newfashioned meerschaums which he had been told smokers of pipes found to be excellent but whether it should be pau or whether it should be castlebar whether it should be pipes or whether in regard to economy no tobacco at all the question now was at any rate settled for him he felt rather proud of his gallantry as he took himself home to bed declaring to himself that he would answer that last letter from gertrude in a very few words and in a very decided tone  there would be many little troubles on the monday morning he got up early thinking that as a family man such a practice would be necessary for him when he had disturbed the house and nearly driven his own servant mad by demanding breakfast at an altogether unaccustomed hour he found that he had nothing to do there was that head of imogene for which she had only once sat and at which he had occasionally worked from memory because of her refusal to sit again and he thought for a moment that this might be good employment for him now but his art was only an expense to him he could not now afford for himself paint and brushes and canvas so he turned the halffinished head round upon his easel then he took out his bankers book a bundle of bills and some blotted scraps of ruled paper with which he set himself to work to arrange his accounts when he did this he must certainly have been in earnest but he had not as yet succeeded in seeing light through his figures when he was interrupted by the arrival of a letter which altogether arrested his attention it was from mudbury docimer and this was the letter      dear houston     of course i think that you and imogene are two fools    she has told me what took place here yesterday and i    have told her the same as i tell you i have no power to    prevent it but you know as well as i do that you and she    cannot live together on the interest of sixteen thousand    pounds when youve paid everything that you owe i dont    suppose there will be so much as that it had been    arranged between you that everything should be over and    if i had thought that anything of the kind would have    occurred again i would have told them not to let you into    the house what is the good of two such people as you    making yourselves wretched for ever just to satisfy the    romance of a moment i call it wicked so i told imogene    and so i tell you     you have changed your mind so often that of course you may    change it again i am sure that imogene expects that you    will indeed i can hardly believe that you intend to be    such a quixote but at any rate i have done my duty she    is old enough to look after herself but as long as she    lives with me as my sister i shall tell her what i think    and until she becomes your wifewhich i hope she never    will bei shall tell you the same     yours truly     mudbury docimer   he always was a hard unfeeling fellow said frank to himself then he put the letter by with a crowd of others assuring himself that it was one which required no answer  on the afternoon he called at the house as he did again on the tuesday but on neither day did he succeed in seeing imogene this he thought to be hard as the pleasure of her society was as sweet to him as ever though he was doubtful as to his wisdom in marrying her on the wednesday morning he received a note from her asking him not to come at once because mudbury had chosen to put himself into a bad humour then a few words of honey were added of course you know that nothing that he can say will make a change i am too well satisfied to allow of any change that shall not come from you yourself he was quite alive to the sweetness of the honey and declared to himself that mudbury docimers illhumour was a matter to him of no concern whatever  but on the wednesday there came also another letterin regard to which it will be well that we should travel down again to merle park an answer altogether averse to the proposed changes as to the nieces had been received from mrs dosett as ayala does not wish it of course nothing can be done such was the decision as conveyed by mrs dosett it seemed to lady tringle that this was absurd it was all very well extending charity to the children of her deceased sister mrs dormer but all the world was agreed that beggars should not be choosers as ayala does not wish it why should not ayala wish it what a fool must ayala be not to wish it why should not ayala be made to do as she was told whether she wished it or not such were the indignant questions which lady tringle asked of her husband he was becoming sick of the young ladies altogetherof her own girls as well as the dormer girls they are a pack of idiots together he said and tom is the worst of the lot with this he rushed off to london and consoled himself with his millions  mrs dosetts letter had reached merle park on the tuesday morning sir thomas having remained down in the country over the monday gertrude having calculated the course of the post with exactness had hoped to get a reply from frank to that last letter of hersdated from her sick bed but written in truth after a little surreptitious visit to the larder after the servants dinneron the sunday morning this had been possible and would have evinced a charming alacrity on the part of her lover but this she had hardly ventured to expect then she had looked with anxiety to the arrival of letters on the monday afternoon but had looked in vain on the tuesday morning she had felt so certain that she had contrived to open the postbag herself in spite of illnessbut there had been nothing for her then she sent the dispatch which reached frank on the wednesday morning and immediately afterwards took to her bed again with such a complication of disorders that the mare with the broken knees was sent at once into hastings for the doctor  a little rice will be the best thing for her said the doctor  but the poor child takes nothingliterally nothing said lady tringle who was frightened for her child then the doctor went on to say that arrowroot would be good and sago but offered no other prescription lady tringle was disgusted by his ignorance and thought that it might be well to send up to london for some great man the doctor bowed and made up his mind that lady tringle was an ass but being an honest man and also tenderhearted he contrived to get hold of tom before he left the house  your sisters health is generally good he said tom assented as far as he knew gertrude had always been as strong as a horse eats well asked the doctor tom who occasionally saw the family at lunch gave a description of his sisters general performance  she is a fine healthy young lady said the doctor tom gave a brothers ready adhesion to the word healthy but passed over the other epithet as being superfluous now ill tell you what it is said the doctor of course i dont want to inquire into any family secrets  my father you know said tom wont agree about the man shes engaged to  that is it i knew there was some little trouble but i did not want to ask any questions your mother is unnecessarily frightened and i have not wished to disturb her your sister is taking plenty of nourishment  she does not come to table nor yet have it in her own room  she gets it somehow i can say that it is so her veins are full and her arms are strong perhaps she goes into the kitchen have a little tray made ready for her with something nice she will be sure to find it and when she has found it two or three times she will know that she has been discovered if lady tringle does send for a physician from london you could perhaps find an opportunity of telling him what i have suggested her mamma need know nothing about it this took place on the tuesday and on the wednesday morning gertrude knew that she had been discoveredat any rate by tom and the doctor i took care to keep a wing for you said tom i carved them myself at dinner as he so addressed her he came out from his hidingplace in the kitchen about midnight and surprised her in the larder she gave a fearful scream which however luckily was not heard through the house you wont tell mamma tom will you tom promised that he would not on condition that she would come down to breakfast on the following morning this she did and the london physician was saved a journey  but in the meantime gertrudes second letter had gone up to frank and also a very heartrending epistle from lady tringle to her husband poor gertrude is in a very bad state if ever there was a girl really brokenhearted on account of love she is one i did not think she would ever set her heart upon a man with such violent affection i do think you might give way when it becomes a question of life and death there isnt anything really against mr houston sir thomas as he read this was a little shaken he had hitherto been inclined to agree with rosalind that men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love but now he did not know what to think about it there was tom undoubtedly in a bad way and here was gertrude brought to such a condition simply by her love that she refused to take her meals regularly was the world come to such a pass that a father was compelled to give his daughter with a large fortune to an idle adventurer or else to be responsible for his daughters life would augusta have pined away and died had she not been allowed to marry her traffick would lucy pine and die unless money were given to her sculptor upon the whole sir thomas thought that the cares of his family were harder to bear than those of his millions in regard to gertrude he almost thought that he would give way if only that he might be rid of that trouble  it must be acknowledged that frank houston when he received the young ladys letter was less softhearted than her father the letter was or should have been heartrending      you cruel man     you must have received my former letter and though i told    you that i was ill and almost dying you have not heeded    it three posts have come and i have not had a line from    you in your last you were weak enough to say that you    were going to give it all up because you could not make    papa do just what you wanted all at once do you know what    it is to have taken possession of a young ladys heart    or is it true as augusta says of you that you care for    nothing but the money if it is so say it at once and    let me die as it is i am so very ill that i cannot eat a    mouthful of anything and have hardly strength left to me    to write this letter     but i cannot really believe what augusta says though i    daresay it may have been so with mr traffick perhaps you    have not been to your club and so you have not got my    former letter or it may be that you are ill yourself    if so i do wish that i could come and nurse you though    indeed i am so ill that i am quite unable to leave my bed     at any rate pray write immediatelyand do come mamma    seems to think that papa will give way because i am so    ill if so i shall think my illness the luckiest thing    in the worldyou must believe dearest frank that i am    now as ever yours most affectionately     gertrude   frank houston was less credulous than sir thomas and did not believe much in the young ladys sickness it was evident that the young lady was quite up to the work of deceiving her father and mother and would no doubt be willing to deceive himself if anything could be got by it but whether she were ill or whether she were well he could offer her no comfort nevertheless he was bound to send her some answer and with a troubled spirit he wrote as follows      my dear miss tringle     it is to me a matter of inexpressible grief that i should    have to explain again that i am unable to persist in    seeking the honour of your hand in opposition to the    absolute and repeated refusals which i have received from    your father it is so evident that we could not marry    without his consent that i need not now go into that    matter but i think myself bound to say that considering    the matter in all its bearing i must regard our    engagement as finally at an end were i to hesitate in    saying this very plainly i think i should be doing you an    injury     i am sorry to hear that you are unwell and trust that you    may soon recover your health     your sincere friend     frank houston   on the next morning gertrude was still in her bed having there received her letter when she sent a message to her brother would tom come and see her tom attended to her behest and then sat down by her bedside on being told in a mysterious voice that she had to demand from him a great service tom she said that man has treated me most shamefully and most falsely  what man  what man why frank houston there has never been any other man after all that has been said and done he is going to throw me over  the governor threw him over said tom  that amounts to nothing the governor would have given way of course and if he hadnt that was no matter of his after he had had my promise he was bound to go on with it dont you think so  perhaps he was said tom dubiously  of course he was what else is the meaning of a promise now ill tell you what you must do you must go up to london and find him out you had better take a stick with you and then ask him what he means to do  and if he says hell do nothing  then tom you should call him out it is just the position in which a brother is bound to do that kind of thing for his sister when he has been called out then probably hell come round and all will be well  the prospect was one which tom did not at all like he had had one duel on his hands on his own account and had not as yet come through it with flying colours there were still moments in which he felt that he would be compelled at last to take to violence in reference to colonel stubbs he was all but convinced that were he to do so he would fall into some great trouble but still it was more than probable that his outraged feelings would not allow him to resist but this second quarrel was certainly unnecessary thats all nonsense gertrude he said i can do nothing of the kind  you will not  certainly not it would be absurd you ask septimus and he will tell you that it is so  septimus indeed  at any rate i wont men dont call each other out nowadays i know what ought to be done in these kind of things and such interference as that would be altogether improper  then tom said she raising herself in bed and looking round upon him i will never call you my brother again     chapter xliii  once more   probably you are not aware sir that i am not at present the young ladys guardian this was said at the office in lombard street by sir thomas in answer to an offer made to him by captain batsby for ayalas hand captain batsby had made his way boldly into the great mans inner room and had there declared his purpose in a short and businesslike manner he had an ample income of his own he said and was prepared to make a proper settlement on the young lady if necessary he would take her without any fortunebut it would of course be for the ladys comfort and for his own if something in the way of money were forthcoming so much he added having heard of this uncles enormous wealth and having also learned the fact that if sir thomas were not at this moment ayalas guardian he had been not long ago sir thomas listened to him with patience and then replied to him as above  just so sir thomas i did hear that but i think you were once and you are still her uncle  yes i am her uncle  and when i was so illtreated in kingsbury crescent i thought i would come to you it could not be right that a gentleman making an honourable propositionand very liberal as you must acknowledgeshould not be allowed to see the young lady it was not as though i did not know her i had been ten days in the same house with her dont you think sir thomas i ought to have been allowed to see her  i have nothing to do with her said sir thomasthat is in the way of authority nevertheless before captain batsby left him he became courteous to that gentleman and though he could not offer any direct assurance he acknowledged that the application was reasonable he was in truth becoming tired of ayala and would have been glad to find a husband whom she would accept so that she might be out of toms way he had been quite willing that tom should marry the girl if it were possible but he began to be convinced that it was impossible he had offered again to open his house to her with all its wealth but she had refused to come into it his wife had told him that if ayala could be brought back in place of lucy she would surely yield but ayala would not allow herself to be brought back and there was tom as bad as ever if ayala were once married then tom could go upon his travels and come back no doubt a sane man sir thomas thought it might be well to make inquiry about this captain and then see if a marriage might be arranged mrs dosett he told himself was a hard stiff woman and would never get the girl married unless she allowed such a suitor as this captain batsby to have access to the house he did make inquiry and before the week was over had determined that if ayala would become mrs batsby there might probably be an end to one of his troubles  as he went down to merle park he arranged his plan he would in the first place tell tom that ayala had as many suitors as penelope and that one had come up now who would probably succeed but when he reached home he found that his son was gone tom had taken a sudden freak and had run up to london he seemed quite to have got a change said lady tringle  i hope it was a change for the better as to that stupid girl lady tringle could not say that there had been any change for the better but she thought that there had been a change about the girl tom had as she said quite brisked up had declared that he was not going to stand this thing any longer had packed up three or four portmanteaus and had had himself carried off to the nearest railway station in time for an afternoon train up to london what is he going to do when he gets there asked sir thomas lady tringle had no idea what her son intended to do but thought that something special was intended in regard to ayala  he is an ass said the father  you always say he is an ass said the mother complaining  no doubt i do what else am i to call him then he went on and developed his scheme let ayala be asked to merle park for a weekjust for a weekand assured that during that time tom would not be there then let captain batsby also be invited upon this there followed an explanation as to captain batsby and his aspirations tom must be relieved after some fashion and sir thomas declared that no better fashion seemed to present itself lady tringle received her orders with sundry murmurings still grieving for her sons griefbut she assented as she always did assent to her husbands propositions  now we will accompany tom up to london the patient reader will perhaps have understood the condition of his mind when in those days of his sharpest agony he had given himself up to faddle and champagne by these means he had brought himself into trouble and disgrace of which he was fully conscious he had fallen into the hands of the police and had been harassed during the whole period by headache and nausea then had come the absurdity of his challenge to colonel stubbs the folly of which had been made plain to him by the very letter which his rival had written to him there was good sense enough about the poor fellow to enable him to understand that the police court and the prison that faddle and the orgies at bolivias that his challenge and the reply to it were alike dishonourable to him then had come a reaction and he spent a miserable fortnight down at merle park doing nothing resolving on nothing merely moping about and pouring the oftrepeated tale of his woes into his mothers bosom these days at merle park gave him back at any rate his health and rescued him from the intense wretchedness of his condition on the day after the comparison of bolivias wines in this improved state he told himself that it behoved him even yet to do something as a man and he came suddenly to the bold resolution of havingas he called it to himselfanother dash at ayala  how the dash was to be made he had not determined when he left home but to this he devoted the whole of the following sunday he had received a lachrymose letter from his friend faddle at aberdeen in which the unfortunate youth had told him that he was destined to remain in that wretched northern city for the rest of his natural life he had not as yet been to the mountaineers since his mishap with the police and did not care to show himself there at present he was therefore altogether alone and walking all alone the entire round of the parks he at last formed his resolution  on the following morning when mr dosett entered his room at somerset house a little after halfpast ten oclock he found his nephew tom there before him and waiting for him mr dosett was somewhat astonished for he too had heard of toms misfortunes some illnatured chronicle of toms latter doings had spread itself among the tringle and dosett sets and uncle reginald was aware that his nephew had been forced to relinquish his stool in lombard street the vices of the young are perhaps too often exaggerated so that mr dosett had heard of an amount of champagne consumed and a number of policemen wounded of which his nephew had not been altogether guilty there was an idea at kingsbury crescent that tom had gone nearly mad and was now kept under paternal care at merle park when therefore he saw tom blooming in health and brighter than usual in general appearance he was no doubt rejoiced but also surprised at the change what tom he said im glad to see you looking so well are you up in london again  im in town for a day or two said tom  and what can i do for you  well uncle reginald you can do a great deal for me if you will of course youve heard of all those rows of mine  i have heard something  everybody has heard said tom mournfully i dont suppose anybody was ever knocked so much about as ive been for the last six months  im sorry for that tom  im sure you are because youre always goodnatured now i wonder if you will do a great thing to oblige me  let us hear what it is said uncle reginald  i suppose you know that there is only one thing in the world that i want mr dosett thought that it would be discreet to make no reply to this but turning his chair partly round he prepared to listen very attentively to what his nephew might have to say to him all this about the policeman and the rest of it has simply come from my being so unhappy about ayala  it wouldnt be taken as a promise of your being a good husband tom when you get into such a mess as that  thats because people dont understand said tom it is because i am so earnest about it and because i cant bear the disappointment there isnt one at travers and treason who doesnt know that if id married ayala i should have settled down as quiet a young man as there is in all london you ask the governor else himself as long as i thought there was any hope i used to be there steady as a rock at halfpast nine everybody knew it so i should again if shed only come round  you cant make a lady come round as you call it  not make her no of course you cant make a girl but persuading goes a long way why shouldnt she have me as to all these rows she ought to feel at any rate that theyre her doing and what shes done it stands to reason she could undo if she would it only wants a word from her to put me all right with the governorand to put me all right with travers and treason too nobody can love her as i do  i do believe that nobody could love her better said mr dosett who was beginning to be melted by his nephews earnestness  oughtnt that to go for something and then she would have everything that she wishes she might live anywhere she pleasedso that i might go to the office every day she would have her own carriage you know  i dont think that would matter much with ayala  it shows that im in a position to ask her said tom if she could only bring herself not to hate me  there is a difference tom between hating and not loving  if she would only begin to make a little way then i could hope again uncle reginald could you not tell her that at any rate i would be good to her  i think you would be good to her he said  indeed i would there is nothing i would not do for her now will you let me see her just once again and have one other chance  this was the great thing which tom desired from his uncle and mr dosett was so much softened by his nephews earnestness that he did promise to do as much as thisto do as much as this at least if it were in his power of course ayala must be told no good could be done by surprising her by a visit but he would endeavour so to arrange it that if tom were to come to him on the following afternoon they two should go to the crescent together and then tom should remain and dine thereor go away before dinner as he might please after the interview this was settled and tom left somerset house rejoicing greatly at his success it seemed to him that now at last a way was open to him  uncle reginald on his return home took his niece aside and talked to her very gently and very kindly whether you like him or whether you do not my dear he is so true to you that you are bound to see him again when he asks it at first she was very stout declaring that she would not see him of what good could it be seeing that she would rather throw herself into the thames than marry him had she not told him so over and over again as often as he had spoken to her why would he not just leave her alone but against all this her uncle pleaded gently but persistently he had considered himself bound to promise so much on her behalf and for his sake she must do as he asked to this of course she yielded and then he said many good things of poor tom his constancy was a great virtue a man so thoroughly in love would no doubt make a good husband and then there would be the assent of all the family and an end as far as ayala was concerned of all pecuniary trouble in answer to this she only shook her head promising however that she would be ready to give tom an audience when he should be brought to the crescent on the following day  punctually at four tom made his appearance at somerset house and started with his uncle as soon as the indexbooks had been put in their places tom was very anxious to take his uncle home in a cab but mr dosett would not consent to lose his walk along the embankment they went and across charing cross into st jamess park and then by green park hyde park and kensington gardens all the way to notting hill mr dosett did not walk very fast and tom thought they would never reach kingsbury crescent his uncle would fain have talked about the weather or politics or the hardships of the civil service generally but tom would not be diverted from his one subject would ayala be gracious to him mr dosett had made up his mind to say nothing on the subject tom must plead his own cause uncle reginald thought that he knew such pleading would be useless but still would not say a word to daunt the lover neither could he say a word expressive of hope as they were fully an hourandahalf on their walk this reticence was difficult  immediately on his arrival tom was taken up into the drawingroom this was empty for it had been arranged that mrs dosett should be absent till the meeting was over now ill look for this child said uncle reginald in his cheeriest voice as he left tom alone in the room tom as he looked round at the chairs and tables remembered that he had never received as much as a kind word or look in the room and then great drops of perspiration broke out all over his brow all that he had to hope for in the world must depend upon the next five minutesmight depend perhaps upon the very selection of the words which he might use  then ayala entered the room and stood before him  ayala he said giving her his hand  uncle reg says that you would like to see me once again  of course i want to see you once and twiceand always ayala if you could know it if you could only know it then he clasped his two hands high upon his breast not as though appealing to her heart but striking his bosom in very agony ayala i feel that if i do not have you as my own i can only die for the want of you ayala do you believe me  i suppose i believe you but how can i help it  try to help it try to try and help it say a word that you will perhaps help it byandbye then there came a dark frown upon her brownot indeed from anger but from a feeling that so terrible a task should be thrown upon her i know you think that i am common  i have never said a word tom but that i could not love you  but i am truetrue as the sun would i come again after all if it were not that i cannot help coming you have heard that i have beenbeen misbehaving myself  i have not thought about that  it has been so because i have been so wretched ayala you have made me so unhappy ayala you can make me the happiest man there is in london this day i seem to want nothing else as for drink or clubs or billiards and all that they are nothing to meunless when i try to forget that you are soso unkind to me  it is not unkind not to do as you ask me  to do as i ask youthat would be kind oh ayala cannot you be kind to me she shook her head still standing in the place which she had occupied from the beginning may i come again will you give me three months and then think of it if you would only say that i would go back to my work and never leave it but she still shook her head must i never hope  not for that tom how can i help it  not help it  no how can i help it one does not fall in love by tryingnor by trying prevent it  by degrees you might love mea little she had said all that she knew how to say and again shook her head it is that accursed colonel he exclaimed forgetting himself as he thought of his rival  he is not accursed said ayala angrily  then you love him  no but you should not ask you have no right to ask it is not proper  you are not engaged to him  no i am not engaged to him i do not love him as you will ask i tell you but you should not ask and he is not accursed he is better than youthough i do not love him you should not have driven me to say this i do not ask you questions  there is none that i would not answer stay ayala for now she was going to leave the room stay yet a moment do you know that you are tearing my heart in pieces why is it that you should make me so wretched dear ayaladearest ayalastay yet a moment  tom there is nothing more that i can say i am very very sorry if you are unhappy i do think that you are good and true and if you will shake hands with me there is my hand but i cannot say what you want me to say tom took her by the hand and tried to hold her without however speaking to her again but she slid away from him and left the room not having for a moment sat down in his presence  when the door was closed he stood awhile looking round him trying to resolve what he might do or what he might say next he was now at any rate in the house with her and did not know whether such an opportunity as that might ever occur to him again he felt that there were words within his bosom which if he could only bring them up to his mouth would melt the heart of a stone there was his ineffable love his whole happiness at stake his purposehis holy purposeto devote himself and all that he had to her wellbeing of all this he had a full conception within his own heart if only he could express it so that others should believe him but of what use was it now he had had this further liberty of speech accorded to him and in it he had done nothing made no inch of progress she had hardly spoken a dozen words to him but of those she had spoken two remained clear upon his memory he must never hope she had said and she had said also that that other man was better than he had she said that he was dearer the word would hardly have been more bitter all the old feeling came upon him of rage against his rival and of a desire that something desperate should be done by which he might wreak his vengeance  but there he was standing alone in mrs dosetts drawingroom and it was necessary that he should carry himself off as for dining in that house sitting down to eat and drink in ayalas presence after such a conversation as that which was past that he felt to be quite out of the question he crammed his hat upon his head left the room and hurried down the stairs towards the door  in the passage he was met by his uncle coming out of the diningroom tom he said youll stay and eat your dinner  no indeed said tom angrily  you shouldnt let yourself be disturbed by little trifles such as these said his uncle trying to put a good face upon the matter  trifles said tom tringle trifles and he banged the door after him as he left the house   end of vol

somerset house the streets were dry and the weather fine but as mr dosett had remarked the wind was changing a little out of the east and threatened rain when tom left the house it was already falling it was then past six and the night was very dark he had walked there with a top coat and umbrella but he had forgotten both as he banged the door after him in his passion and though he remembered them as he hurried down the steps he would not turn and knock at the door and ask for them he was in that humour which converts outward bodily sufferings almost into a relief when a man has been thoroughly illused in greater matters it is almost a consolation to him to feel that he has been turned out into the street to get wet through without his dinnereven though he may have turned himself out  he walked on foot and as he walked became damp and dirty till he was soon wet through as soon as he reached lancaster gate he went into the park and under the doubtful glimmer of the lamps trudged on through the mud and slush not regarding his path hardly thinking of the present moment in the full appreciation of his real misery what should he do with himself what else was there now left to him he had tried everything and had failed as he endeavoured to count himself up as it were and tell himself whether he were worthy of a happier fate than had been awarded to him he was very humblehumble though so indignant he knew himself to be a poor creature in comparison with jonathan stubbs though he could not have been stubbs had he given his heart for it though it was absolutely beyond him to assume one of those tricks of bearing one of those manly winning ways which in his eyes was so excellent in the other man still he saw them and acknowledged them and told himself that they would be all powerful with such a girl as ayala though he trusted to his charms and his rings he knew that his charms and his rings were abominable as compared with that outside look and natural garniture which belonged to stubbs as though of rightas though it had been born with him not exactly in those words but with a full inward sense of the words he told himself that colonel stubbs was a gentlemanwhereas he acknowledged himself to be a cad how could he have hoped that ayala should accept such a one merely because he would have a good house of his own and a carriage as he thought of all this he hardly knew which he hated mosthimself or jonathan stubbs  he went down to the family house in queens gate which was closed and darkhaving come there with no special purpose but having found himself there as though by accident in the neighbourhood then he knocked at the door which after a great undoing of chains was opened by an old woman who with her son had the custody of the house when the family were out of town sir thomas in these days had rooms of his own in lombard street in which he loved to dwell and would dine at a city club never leaving the precincts of the city throughout the week the old woman was an old servant and her son was a porter at the office mr tom be that you why you are as wet as a mop he was wet as any mop and much dirtier than a mop should be there was no fire except in the kitchen and there he was taken he asked for a great coat but there was no such thing in the house as the young man had not yet come home nor was there any food that could be offered him or anything to drink as the cellar was locked up and the old woman was on board wages but he sat crouching over the fire watching the steam as it came up from his damp boots and trousers and aint you had no dinner mr tom said the old woman tom only shook his head and aint you going to have none the poor wretch again shook his head thats bad mr tom then she looked up into his face there is something wrong i know mr tom i hears that from jem of course he hears what they do be saying in lombard street  what is it they say mrs tapp  wellthat you aint there as you used to be things is awkard and sir thomas they say isnt best pleased but of course it isnt no affair of mine mr tom  do they know why he asked  they do say its someat about a young lady  yes by heavens said tom jumping up out of his chair oh mrs tapp you cant tell the condition im in a young lady indeed d the fellow  dont ee now mr tom  d the fellow but theres no good in my standing here cursing ill go off again you neednt say that ive been here mrs tapp  but you wont go out into the rain mr tom  rainwhat matters the rain then he started again disregarding all her prayers and went off eastward on foot disdaining the use of a cab because he had settled in his mind on no place to which he would go  yes they knew all about it down to the very porters at the office everyone had heard of his love for ayala and everyone had heard also that ayala had scorned him not a man or woman connected by ever so slight a tie to the establishment was unaware that he had been sent away from his seat because of ayala all this might have been borne easily had there been any hope but now he was forced to tell himself that there was none he saw no end to his miseryno possibility of escape where was he to go in this moment of his misery for any shred of comfort the solitude of his lodgings was dreadful to him nor had he heart enough left to him to seek companionship at his club  at about ten oclock he found himself as it were by accident close to mr bolivias establishment he was thoroughly wet through jaded wretched and in want of sustenance he turned in and found the place deserted the diners had gone away and the hour had not come at which men in quest of later refreshment were wont to make their appearance but there were still one or two gaslights burning and he threw himself wearily into a little box or partition nearest to the fire here signor bolivia himself came to him asking in commiserating accents what had brought him thither in so wretched a plight i have left my coat and umbrella behind said tom trying to pluck up a little spiritand my dinner too  no dinner mr tringle and you wet through like that what shall i get you mr tringle but tom declared that he would have no dinner he was off his appetite altogether he said he would have a bottle of champagne and a devilled biscuit mr walker who as we are aware put himself forward to the world generally as signor bolivia felt for the moment a throb of pity which overcame in his heart the innkeepers natural desire to make the most he could of his customer better have a mutton chop and a little drop of brandyandwater hot  i aint up to it bolivia said the young man i couldnt swallow it if i had it give us the bottle of champagne and the devilled biscuit then mr walkerfor bolivia was in truth walkerfetched the wine and ordered the biscuit and poor tom was again brought back to the miserable remedy to which he had before applied himself in his misfortune there he remained for about an hour during a part of which he slept but before he left the house he finished the wine as he got up to take his departure mr walker scanned his gait and bearing having a friendly feeling for the young man and not wishing him to fall again into the hands of the police but tom walked forth apparently as sober as a judge and as melancholy as a hangman as far as mr walker could see the liquor had made no impression on him if i were you mr tringle said the keeper of the eatinghouse id go home at once because you are so mortal wet  all right said tom going out into the pouring rain  it was then something after eleven and tom instead of taking the friendly advice which had been offered to him walked as fast as he could round leicester square and as he walked the fumes of the wine mounted into his head but he was not drunknot as yet so drunk as to misbehave himself openly he did not make his way round the square without being addressed but he simply shook off from him those who spoke to him his mind was still intent upon ayala but now he was revengeful rather than despondent the liquor had filled him once again with a desire to do something if he could destroy himself and the colonel by one and the same blow how fitting a punishment would that be for ayala but how was he to do it he would throw himself down from the top of the duke of yorks column but that would be nothing unless he could force the colonel to take the jump with him he had called the man out and he wouldnt come now with the alcohol in his brain he again thought that the man was a coward for not coming had not such a meeting been from time immemorial the resource of gentlemen injured as he now was injured the colonel would not come when calledbut could he not get at him so as to strike him if he could do the man a real injury he would not care what amount of punishment he might be called upon to bear  he hurried at last out of the square into coventry street and down the haymarket his lodgings were in duke street turning out of piccadillybut he could not bring himself to go home to his bed he was unutterably wretched but yet he kept himself going with some idea of doing something or of fixing some purpose he certainly was tipsy now but not so drunk as to be unable to keep himself on his legs he gloried in the wet shouting inwardly to himself that he in his misery was superior to all accidents of the weather then he stood for awhile watching the people as they came out of the haymarket theatre he was at this time a sorry sight to be seen his hat was jammed on to his head and had been almost smashed in the jamming his coat reeking wet through was fastened by one button across his chest his two hands were thrust into his pockets and the bottle of champagne was visible in his face he was such a oneto look atthat no woman would have liked to touch or any man to address in this guise he stood there amidst the crowd foremost among those who were watching the ladies as they got into their vehicles and she might be as good as the best of them and i might be here to hand her into her own carriagesaid he to himselfif it were not for that intruder  at that moment the intruder was there before him and on his arm was a lady whom he was taking across to a carriage at the door of which a servant in livery was standing they were followed closely by a pretty young girl who was picking her steps after them alone these were lady albury and nina whom colonel stubbs had escorted to the play  you will be down by the twentieth said the elder lady  punctual as the day comes said the colonel  and mind you have ayala with you said the younger  if lady albury can manage it with her aunt of course i will wait upon her said the colonel then the door of the carriage was shut and the colonel was left to look for a cab he had on an overcoat and an opera hat but otherwise was dressed as for dinner on one side a linkboy was offering him assistance and on another a policeman tendering him some service he was one of those who by their outward appearance always extort respect from those around them  as long as the ladies had been thereduring the two minutes which had been occupied while they got into the carriagetom had been restrained by their presence he had been restrained by their presence even though he had heard ayalas name and had understood the commission given to the man whom he hated had colonel stubbs luckily followed the ladies into the carriage tom in his fury would have taken himself off to his bed but nowthere was his enemy within a yard of him here was the opportunity the lack of which seemed a few moments since to be so grievous to him he took two steps out from the row in which he stood and struck his rival high on his breast with his fist he had aimed at the colonels face but in his eagerness had missed his mark there said he there you would not fight me and now you have got it stubbs staggered and would have fallen but for the policeman tom though no hero was a strong young man and had contrived to give his blow with all his force the colonel did not at first see from whom the outrage had come but at once claimed the policemans help  weve got him sirweve got him said the policeman  youve got me said tom but ive had my revenge then though two policemen and one waterman were now holding him he stretched himself up to his full height and glared at his enemy in the face  its the chap who gave that hawful blow to thompson in the bowls said one of the policemen who by this time had both toms arms locked behind his own  then the colonel knew who had struck him i know him said the colonel to the policeman it is a matter of no consequence  so do we sir hes thomas tringle junior  hes a friend of mine said the colonel you must let him come with me  a friend is he said an amateur attendant the policeman who had remembered the cruel onslaught made on his comrade looked very grave and still held tom tight by the arms a very hugly sort of friend said the amateur tom only stretched himself still higher but remained speechless  tringle said the colonel this was very foolish you knowa most absurd thing to do come with me and we will talk it all over  he must come along with us to the watchhouse just at present said the policeman and you sir if you can had better please to come with us it aint far across to vine street but of course you can have a cab if you like it this was ended by two policemen walking off with tom between them and by the colonel following in a cab after having administered divers shillings to the amateur attendants though the journey in the cab did not occupy above five minutes it sufficed to enable him to determine what step he should take when he found himself before the night officers of the watch  when he found himself in the presence of the night officer he had considerable difficulty in carrying out his purpose that tom should be locked up for the night and be brought before the police magistrate next morning to answer for the outrage he had committed seemed to the officers to be a matter of course it was long before the colonel could persuade the officer that this little matter between him and mr tringle was a private affair of which he at least wished to take no further notice no doubt he said he had received a blow on his chest but it had not hurt him in the least  e it the genleman with all his might and main said the policeman  it is quite a private affair said the colonel my name is colonel stubbs here is my card sir  is a particular friend of mine here he named a pundit of the peace very high in the estimation of all policemen if you will let the gentleman come away with me i will be responsible for him tomorrow if it should be necessary to take any further step in the matter this he said very eagerly and with all the authority which he knew how to use tom in the meantime stood perfectly motionless with his arms folded akimbo on his breast wet through muddy still tipsy a sight miserable to behold  the card and the colonels own name and the name of the pundit of the peace together had their effect and after a while tom was dismissed in the colonels care the conclusion of the evenings affair was for the moment one which tom found very hard to bear it would have been better for him to have been dragged off to a cell and there to have been left to his miserable solitude but as he went down through the narrow ways leading from the policeoffice out into the main street he felt that he was altogether debarred from making any further attack upon his protector he could not strike him again as he might have done had he escaped from the police by his own resources his own enemy had saved him from durance and he could not therefore turn again upon his enemy  in heavens name my dear fellow said the colonel what good do you expect to get by that you have hit me a blow when you knew that i was unprepared and therefore unarmed was that manly to this tom made no reply i suppose you have been drinking and stubbs as he asked this question looked into his companions face i see you have been drinking what a fool you are making of yourself  it is that girl said tom  does that seem to you to be right can you do yourself any good by that will she be more likely to listen to you when she hears that you have got drunk and have assaulted me in the street have i done you any harm  she says that you are better than me replied tom  if she does is that my doing come old fellow try to be a man try to think of this thing rightly if you can win the girl you love win her but if you cannot do not be such an ass as to suppose that she is to love no one because she will not love you it is a thing which a man must bear if it comes in his way as far as miss dormer is concerned i am in the same condition as you but do you think that i should attack you in the street if she began to favour you tomorrow  i wish she would and then i shouldnt care what you did  i should think you a happy fellow certainly and for a time i might avoid you because your happiness would remind me of my own disappointment but i should not come behind your back and strike you now tell me where you live and i will see you home then tom told him where he lived and in a few minutes the colonel had left him within his own hall door     chapter xlv  there is something of the angel about him   the little accident which was recorded at the close of the last chapter occurred on a tuesday night on the following afternoon tom tringle again very much out of spirits returned to merle park there was now nothing further for him to do in london he had had his last chance with ayala and the last chance had certainly done him no good fortune whether kindly or unkindly had given him an opportunity of revenging himself upon the colonel he had taken advantage of the opportunity but did not find himself much relieved by what he had done his rivals conduct had caused him to be thoroughly ashamed of himself it had at any rate taken from him all further hope of revenge so that now there was nothing for him but to take himself back to merle park on the wednesday he heard nothing further of the matter but on the thursday sir thomas came down from london and showing to poor tom a paragraph in one of the morning papers asked whether he knew anything of the circumstance to which reference was made the paragraph was as follows      that very bellicose young city knight who at christmas    time got into trouble by thrashing a policeman within    an inch of his life in the streets and who was then    incarcerated on account of his performance again    exhibited his prowess on tuesday night by attacking    colonel  an officer than whom none in the army is    more popularunder the portico of the haymarket theatre    we abstain from mentioning the officers namewhich is    however known to us the city knight again fell into the    hands of the police and was taken to the watchhouse    but colonel  who knew something of his family    accompanied him and begged his assailant off the officer    on duty was most unwilling to let the culprit go but the    colonel used all his influence and was successful this    may be all very well between the generous colonel and the    valiant knight but if the young man has any friends they    had better look to him a gentleman with such a desire    for the glories of battle must be restrained if he cannot    control his propensities when wandering about the streets    of the metropolis   yes said tomwho scorned to tell a lie in any matter concerning ayala it was me i struck colonel stubbs and he got me off at the police office  and youre proud of what youve done  no sir im not im not proud of anything whatever i do or whatever i say seems to go against me  he didnt go against you as you call it  i wish he had with all my heart i didnt ask him to get me off i struck him because i hated him and whatever might have happened i would sooner have borne it than be like this  you would sooner have been locked up again in prison  i would sooner anything than be as i am  i tell you what it is tom said the father if you remain here any longer with this bee in your bonnet you will be locked up in a lunatic asylum and i shall not be able to get you out again you must go abroad to this tom made no immediate answer lamentable as was his position he still was unwilling to leave london while ayala was living there were he to consent to go away for any lengthened period by doing so he would seem to abandon his own claim hope he knew there was none but yet even yet he regarded himself as one of ayalas suitors do you think it well continued the father that you should remain in london while such paragraphs as these are being written about you  i am not in london now said tom  no you are not in london while you are at merle parkof course and you will not go up to london without my leave do you understand that here tom again was silent if you do continued his father you shall not be received down here again nor at queens gate nor will the cheques for your allowance be honoured any longer at the bank in fact if you do not obey me i will throw you off altogether this absurdity about your love has been carried on long enough and so it came to be understood in the family that tom was to be kept in mild durance at merle park till everything should have been arranged for his extended tour about the world to this tom himself gave no positive assent but it was understood that when the time came he would yield to his fathers commands  it had thus come to pass that the affray at the door of the haymarket became known to so much of the world at large as interested itself in the affairs either of colonel stubbs or of the tringles other paragraphs were written in which the two heroes of the evening were designated as colonel j s and as t t junior of the firm of t and t in the city all who pleased could read these initials and thus the world was aware that our colonel had received a blow and had resented the affront only by rescuing his assailant from the hands of the police a word was said at first which seemed to imply that the colonel had not exhibited all the spirit which might have been expected from him having been struck should he not have thrashed the man who struck himor at any rate have left the ruffian in the hands of the policemen for proper punishment but many days had not passed over before the colonels conduct had been viewed in a different light and men and women were declaring that he had done a manly and a gallant thing the affair had in this way become sufficiently well known to justify the allusion made to it in the following letter from lady albury to ayala      stalham tuesday 11th february 18     my dear ayala     it is quite indispensable for the happiness of everybody    particularly that of myself and sir harry that you should    come down here on the twentieth nina will be here on    her farewell visit before her return to her mother of    course you have heard that it is all arranged between    her and lord george bideford and this will be the last    opportunity which any of us will have of seeing her once    again before her martyrdom the world is to be told    that he is to follow her to rome where they are to be    marriedno doubt by the pope himself under the dome of    st peters but my belief is that lord george is going    to travel with her all the way if he is the man i take    him to be he will do so but of course it would be very    improper     you however must of course come and say pretty things    to your friend and as you cannot go to rome to see her    married you must throw your old shoe after her when she    takes her departure from stalham i have written a line    to your aunt to press my request for this visit this she    will no doubt show to you and you if you please can    show her mine in return     and now my dear i must explain to you one or two other    arrangements a certain gentleman will certainly not be    here it was not my fault that a certain gentleman went to    kingsbury crescent the certain gentleman is as you are    aware a great friend of ours and was entitled to explain    himself if it so seemed good to him but the certain    gentleman was not favoured in that enterprise by the    stalham interest at any rate the certain gentleman    will not be at stalham on this occasion so much for the    certain gentleman     colonel stubbs will be here and as he will be coming    down on the twentieth would be glad to travel by the same    train so that he may look after your ticket and your    luggage and be your slave for the occasion he will leave    the paddington station by the 4 pm train if that will    suit you     we all think that he behaved beautifully in that little    affair at the haymarket theatre i should not mention it    only that everybody has heard of it almost any other man    would have struck the poor fellow again but he is one    of the very few who always know what to do at the moment    without taking time to think of it     mind you come like a good girlyour affectionate friend     rosaline albury   it was in this way that ayala heard what had taken place between her cousin tom and colonel stubbs some hint of a fracas between the two men had reached her ears but now she asked various questions of her aunt and at last elicited the truth tom had attacked her other lover in the streethad attacked colonel stubbs because of his injured love and had grossly misbehaved himself as a consequence he would have been locked up by the police had not the colonel himself interfered on his behalf this to ayala seemed to be conduct worthy almost of an angel of light  then the question of the proposed visit was discussedfirst with her aunt and then with herself mrs dosett was quite willing that her niece should go to stalham to mrs dosetts thinking a further journey to stalham would mean an engagement with colonel stubbs when she had read lady alburys letter she was quite sure that that had been lady alburys meaning captain batsby was not to receive the stalham interestbut that interest was to be used on the part of colonel stubbs she had not the slightest objection it was clear to her that ayala would have to be married before long it was out of the question that one man after another should fall in love with her violently and that nothing should come of it mrs dosett had become quite despondent about tom there was an amount of dislike which it would be impossible to overcome and as for captain batsby there could be no chance for a man whom the young lady could not be induced even to see but the other lover whom the lady would not admit that she lovedas to whom she had declared that she could never love himwas held in very high favour i do think it was so noble not to hit tom again she had said therefore as colonel stubbs had a sufficient income there could be no reason why ayala should not go again to stalham so it was that mrs dosett argued with herself and such was the judgment which she expressed to ayala  but there were difficulties ayalas little stock of cash was all gone she could not go to stalham without money and that money must come out of her uncle reginalds pocket she could not go to stalham without some expenditure which as she well knew it would be hard for him to bear and then there was that terrible question of her clothes when that suggestion had been made of a further transfer of the nieces a cheque had come from sir thomas if ayala comes to us she will want a few things sir thomas had said in a note to mrs dosett but mr dosett had chosen that the cheque should be sent back when it was decided that the further transfer should not take place the cheque had been sent back and there had been an end of it there must be a morning dress and there must be another hat and there must be boots so much mrs dosett acknowledged let them do what they might with the old things mrs dosett acknowledged that so much as that would at least be necessary we will both go to work mrs dosett said and we will ask your uncle what he can do for us i think she felt that she had received some recompense when ayala kissed her  it was after this that ayala discussed the matter with herself she had longed to go once again to stalhamdear stalham as she called it to herself and as she thought of the place she told herself that she loved it because lady albury had been so kind to her and because of nina and because of the hunting and because of the general pleasantness and luxury of the big comfortable house and yes there was something to be said too of the pleasantness of colonel stubbs till he had made love to her he had been perhaps of all these fine new friends the pleasantest how joyous his voice had sounded to her how fraught with gratification to her had been his bright ugly face how well he had known how to talk to her and to make her talk so that everything had been easy with her how thoroughly she remembered all his drollery on that first night at the party in londonand all his keen sayings at the theatreand the way he had insisted that she should hunt she thought of little confidences she had had with him almost as though he had been her brother and then he had destroyed it all by becoming her lover  was he to be her lover still and if so would it be right that she should go again to stalham knowing that she would meet him there would it be right that she should consent to travel with himunder his special escort were she to do so would she not be forced to do moreif he should again ask her it was so probable that he would not ask her again it was so strange that such a one should have asked her  but if he did ask her certainly he was not like that angel of light whom she had never seen but of whom the picture in her imagination was as clearly drawn as though she were in his presence daily nothere was a wave of hair and a shape of brow and a peculiarity of the eye with a nose and mouth cut as sharp as chisel could cut them out of marble all of which graced the angel but none of which belonged to the colonel nor were these the chief of the graces which made the angel so glorious to her there was a depth of poetry about him deep and clear pellucid as a lake among grassy banks which make all things of the world mean when compared to it the angel of light lived on the essence of all that was beautiful altogether unalloyed by the grossness of the earth that such a one should come in her way oh no she did not look for it but having formed such an image of an angel for herself would it be possible that she should have anything less divine less beautiful less angelic  yes there was something of the angel about him even about him colonel jonathan stubbs but he was so clearly an angel of the earth whereas the other one though living upon the earth would be of the air and of the sky of the clouds and of the heaven celestial such a one she knew she had never seen she partly dreamed that she was dreaming but if so had not her dream spoilt her for all else oh yes indeed he was good this redhaired ugly stubbs how well had he behaved to tom how kind he had been to herself how thoughtful of her he was if it were not a question of downright loveof giving herself up to him body and soul as it werehow pleasant would it be to dwell with him for herself she would confess that she loved earthly thingssuch as jumping over the brook with larry twentyman before her to show her the way but for her love it was necessary that there should be an angel of light had she not read that angels had come from heaven and taken in marriage the daughters of men  but was it right that she should go to stalham seeing that there were two such strong reasons against it she could not go without costing her uncle money which he could ill afford and if she did go would shewould she not confess that she had abandoned her objection to the colonels suit she too understood something of that which had made itself so plain to her aunt your uncle thinks it is right that you should go her aunt said to her in the drawingroom that evening and we will set to work tomorrow and do the best that we can to make you smart  her uncle was sitting in the room at the time and ayala felt herself compelled to go to him and kiss him and thank him for all his kindness i am so sorry to cost you so much money uncle reginald she said  it will not be very much my dear he answered it is hard that young people should not have some amusement i only hope they will make you happy at stalham  they always make people happy at stalham said ayala energetically  and now ayala said her aunt you can write your letter to lady albury before we go out tomorrow give her my compliments and tell her that as you are writing i need not trouble her  ayala when she was alone in her bedroom felt almost horrified as she reflected that in this manner the question had been settled for her it had been impossible for her to reject her uncles liberal offer when it had been made she could not find the courage at that moment to say that she had thought better of it all and would decline the visit before she was well aware of what she was doing she had assented and had thus as it were thrown over all the creations of her dream and yet as she declared herself not even lady albury could make her marry this man merely because she was at her house she thought that if she could only avoid that first journey with colonel stubbs in the railway still she might hold her own but were she to travel with him of her own accord would it not be felt that she would be wilfully throwing herself in his way then she made a little plan for herself which she attempted to carry out when writing her letter to lady albury on the following morning what was the nature of her plan and how she effected it will be seen in the letter which she wrote      kingsbury crescent thursday     dear lady albury     it is so very good of you to ask me again and i shall    be so happy to visit stalham once more i should have    been very sorry not to see dear nina before her return to    italy i have written to congratulate her of course and    have told her what a happy girl i think she is though    i have not seen lord george i take all that from her    description as she is going to be his wife immediately    i dont at all see why he should not go back with her to    rome as for being married by the pope i dont think he    ever does anything so useful as that i believe he sits    all day and has his toe kissed that is what they told me    at rome     i am very glad of what you tell me about the certain    gentleman because i dont think i could have been happy    at stalham if he had been there it surprised me so much    that i could not think that he meant it in earnest we    never hardly spoke to each other when we were in the house    together     perhaps if you dont mind and i shant be in the way   here she began to display the little plan which she had made for her own protection      i will come down by an earlier train than you mention    there is one at 215 and then i need not be in the dark    all the way you need not say anything about this to    colonel stubbs because i do not at all mind travelling by    myselfyours affectionately     ayala   this was her little plan but she was very innocent when she thought that lady albury would be blind to such a scheme as that she got three words from lady albury saying that the 215 train would do very well and that the carriage would be at the station to meet her lady albury did not also say in her note that she had communicated with colonel stubbs on the subject and informed him that he must come up from aldershot earlier than he intended in order that he might adapt himself to ayalas whims foolish little child said lady albury to herself as if that would make any difference it was clear to lady albury that ayala must surrender now that she was coming to stalham a second time knowing that the colonel would be there     chapter xlvi  ayala goes again to stalham   the correspondence between lady albury and colonel stubbs was close and frequent the friendship between them being very close ayala had sometimes asked herself why lady albury should have been so kind and affectionate to her and had failed to find any sufficient answer she had been asked to stalham at firstso far as she knewbecause she had been intimate at rome with the marchesa baldoni hence had apparently risen lady alburys great friendship which had seemed even to herself to be strange but in truth the marchesa had had very little to do with itnor had lady albury become attached to ayala for ayalas own sake to lady albury colonel stubbs wasas she declared to herself very oftenher own real brother she had married a man very rich well known in the world whom she loved very well and she was not a woman who in such a position would allow herself to love another man that there might certainly be no danger of this kind she was continually impressing on her friend the expediency of marriageif only he could find some one good enough to marry then the colonel had found ayala lady albury at the beginning of all this was not inclined to think that ayala was good enough judging at first from what she heard and then from what she saw she had not been very favourable to ayala but when her friend had insistedhad declared that his happiness depended on ithad shown by various signs that he certainly would carry out his intentions if not at stalham then elsewhere lady albury had yielded herself to him and had become ayalas great friend if it was written in the book that ayala was to become mrs stubbs then it would certainly be necessary that she and ayala should be friends and she herself had such confidence in jonathan stubbs as a man of power that she did not doubt of his success in any matter to which he might choose to devote himself the wonder had been that ayala should have rejected the chance when it had come in her way the girl had been foolish allowing herself to be influenced by the mans red hair and illsounding namenot knowing a real pearl when she saw it so lady albury had thoughthaving only been partially right in so thinkingnot having gone to the depth of ayalas power of dreaming she was very confident however that the girl when once again at stalham would yield herself easily and therefore she went to work doing all that she could to smoothen loves road for her friend jonathan her womans mind had seen all those difficulties about clothes and would have sent what was needful herself had she not feared to offend both the dosetts and ayala therefore she prepared a present which she could give to the girl at stalham without offence if it was to be the girls high fate to become mrs jonathan stubbs it would be proper that she should be adorned and decked and made beautiful among others of her classas would become the wife of such a hero  of all that passed between her and ayala word was sent down to aldershot the stupid little wretch will throw you out i know wrote lady albury by making you start two hours before you have done your work but you must let your work do itself for this occasion there is nothing like a little journey together to make people understand each other  the colonel was clearly determined to have the little journey together whatever might be the present military duties at aldershot the duties of love were for the nonce in the colonels mind more imperative though his royal highness had been coming that afternoon to inspect all the troops still he would have resolved so to have arranged matters as to travel down with ayala to stalham but not only was he determined to do this but he found it necessary also to arrange a previous meeting with lady albury before that important twentieth of the month this he did by making his friend believe that her presence in london for a few hours would be necessary for various reasons she came up as he desired and there he met her at her hotel in jermyn street on his arrival here he felt that he was almost making a fool of himself by the extent of his anxiety in his nervousness about this little girl he was almost as insane as poor tom tringle who when she despised his love was altogether unable to control himself if i cannot persuade her at last i shall be knocking somebody over the head as he did it was thus he was talking to himself as he got out of the cab at the door of the hotel  and now jonathan said lady albury what can there possibly be to justify you in giving me all this trouble  you know you had to come up about that cooks character  i know that i have given that as a reason to sir harry but i know also that i should have gone without a cook for a twelvemonth had you not summoned me  the truth is i could not get down to stalham and back without losing an additional day which i cannot possibly spare with you it does not very much matter how many days you spare  nor how much money i spend nor how much labour i take so that i obey all the commands of colonel jonathan stubbs what on earth is there that i can say or do for you more  there are one or two things said he that i want you to understand in the first place i am quite in earnest about this  dont i know that youre in earnest  but perhaps you do not understand the full extent of my earnestness if she were to refuse me ultimately i should go away  go away go where  oh that i have not at all thought ofprobably to india as i might manage to get a regiment there but in truth it would matter very little  you are talking like a goose  that is very likely because in this matter i think and feel like a goose it is not a great thing in a man to be turned out of his course by some undefined feeling which he has as to a young woman but the thing has occurred before now and will occur again in my case if i am thrown over  what on earth is there about the girl asked lady albury there is that precious brotherinlaw of ours going to hang himself incontinently because she will not look at him and that unfortunate friend of yours tom tringle is if possible worse than ben batsby or yourself  if two other gentlemen are in the same condition it only makes it the less singular that i should be the third at any rate i am the third  you do not mean to liken yourself to them  indeed i do as to our connection with miss dormer i can see no difference we are all in love with her and she has refused us all it matters little whether a mans ugliness or his rings or his natural stupidity may have brought about this result  you are very modest jonathan  i always was only you never could see it i am modest in this matter but not for that reason the less persistent in doing the best i can for myself my object now in seeing you is to let you understand that it iswell not life and death because she will not suffice either to kill me or to keep me alivebut one of those matters which in a mans career are almost as important to him as life and death she was very decided in her refusal  so is every girl when a first offer is made to her how is any girl so to arrange her thoughts at a moments notice as to accept a man offhand  girls do do so  very rarely i think and when they do they are hardly worth having said lady albury laying down the law on the matter with great precision if a girl accept a man all at once when she has had as it were no preparation for such a proposal she must always surely be in a state of great readiness for matrimonial projects when there has been a prolonged period of spooning then of course it is quite a different thing the whole thing has in fact been arranged before the important word has been spoken  what a professor in the art you are said he  the odd thing is that such a one as you should be so ignorant cant you understand that she would not come to stalham if her mind were made up against you i said nothing of you as a lover but i took care to let her know that you were coming you are very ready to put yourself in the same boat with poor ben batsby or that other unfortunate wretch would she do you think have consented to come had she known that ben would have been there or your friend tom tringle  there was much more of it but the upshot wasas the colonel had intended that it should bethat lady albury was made to understand that ayalas goodwill was essential to his happiness of course i will do my best she said as he parted from her though i am not quite as much in love with her myself as you are yet i will do my best then when she was left alone and was prosecuting her inquiries about the new cook and travelling back in the afternoon to stalham she again considered how wonderful a thing it was such a girl as ayala so small apparently so unimportant so childish in her manner with so little to say for herself should become a person of such terrible importance  the twentieth came and at ten minutes before two ayala was at the paddington railway station the train which was to start at 215 had been chosen by herself so that she might avoid the colonel and there she was with her aunt waiting for it mrs dosett had thought it to be her duty to see her off and had come with her in the cab there were the two boxes laden with her wardrobe such as it was both she and her aunt had worked hard for thoughas she had declared to herselfthere was no special reason for it still she had wished to look her best as she saw the boxes put into the van and had told herself how much shabbier they were than the boxes of other young ladies who went visiting to such houses as stalham she rejoiced that colonel stubbs was not there to see them and she considered whether it was possible that colonel stubbs should recognise a dress which she had worn at stalham before which was now to appear in a quite altered shape she wondered also whether it would be possible that colonel stubbs should know how poor she was as she was thinking of all this there was colonel stubbs on the platform  she had never doubted but that little plan would be efficacious nor had her aunt doubtedwho had seen through the plan though not a word had been spoken between them on the subject mrs dosett had considered it to be impossible that a colonel engaged on duties of importance at aldershot should run away from them to wait upon a child like ayalaeven though he had professed himself to be in love with the child she had never seen the colonel and on this occasion did not expect to see him but there he was all suddenly shaking hands with ayala  my aunt mrs dosett whispered ayala then the colonel began to talk to the elder lady as though the younger lady were a person of very much less importance yes he had run up from aldershot a little earlier than he had intended there had been nothing particular to keep him down at aldershot it had always been his intention to go to stalham on this day and was glad of the accident which was bringing miss dormer there just at the same time he spent a good deal of his time at stalham because sir harry and he who were in truth cousins were as intimate as brothers he always lived at stalham when he could get away from duty and was not in london stalham was a very nice place certainly one of the most comfortable houses he knew in england so he went on till he almost made mrs dosett believe and did make ayala believe that his visit to stalham had nothing to do with herself and yet mrs dosett knew that the offer had been made ayala bethought herself that she did not care so much for the remanufactured frock after all nor yet for the shabby appearance of the boxes the real angel of light would not care for her frock nor for her boxes and certainly would not be indifferent after the fashion ofof then she began to reflect that she was making a fool of herself  she was put into the carriage mr dosett having luckily decided against the use of the second class going to such a house as stalham ayala ought said mr dosett to go as any other lady would had it been himself or his wife it would have been very different but for ayala on such an occasion as this he would be extravagant ayala was therefore put into her seat while the colonel stood at the door outside still talking to mrs dosett i dont think she will be let to come away at the end of a week said the colonel sir harry doesnt like people to come away very soon ayala heard this and thought that she remembered that sir harry himself was very indifferent as to the coming and going of the visitors they go up to london about the end of march said the colonel and if miss dormer were to return about a week before it would do very well  oh no said ayala putting her head out of the window i couldnt think of staying so long as that then the last final bustle was made by the guard the colonel got in the door was shut and mrs dosett standing on the platform nodded her head for the last time  there were only four persons in the carriage in the opposite corner there were two old persons probably a husband and wife who had been very careful as to a footwarming apparatus and were muffled up very closely in woollen and furs if you dont mind shutting the door sir said the old gentleman rather testily because my wife has a pain in her face the door absolutely was shut when the words were spoken but the colonel made some sign of closing all the apertures but there was a ventilator above which the old lady spied if you dont mind shutting that hole up there sir because my husband is very bad with neuralgia the colonel at once got up and found that the ventilator was fast closed so as not to admit a breath of air there are draughts come in everywhere said the old gentleman the company ought to be prosecuted i believe the more people they kill the better they like it said the old lady then the colonel looked at ayala with a very grave face with no hint at a smile with a face which must have gratified even the old lady and gentleman but ayala understood the face and could not refrain from a little laugh she laughed only with her eyesbut the colonel saw it  the weather has been very severe all day said the colonel in a severe voice  ayala protested that she had not found it cold at all then miss i think you must be made of granite said the old lady i hope youll remember that other people are not so fortunate ayala again smiled and the colonel made another effort as though to prevent any possible breath of air from making its way into the interior of the vehicle  there was silence among them for some minutes and then ayala was quite surprised by the tone in which her friend addressed her what an illnatured girl you must be said he to have put me to such a terrible amount of trouble all on purpose  i didnt said ayala  yes you did why wouldnt you come down by the four oclock train as i told you now ive left everything undone and i shouldnt wonder if i get into such a row at the horse guards that i shall never hear the end of it and now you are not a bit grateful  yes i am grateful but i didnt want you to come at all she said  of course i should come i didnt think you were so perverse  im not perverse colonel stubbs  when young persons are perverse it is my opinion they oughtnt to be encouraged said the old lady from her corner  my dear you know nothing about it said the old gentleman  yes i do said the old lady i know all about it whatever she does a young lady ought not to be perverse i do hate perversity i am sure that hole up there must be open sir for the wind does come in so powerful colonel stubbs again jumped up and poked at the ventilator  in the meantime ayala was laughing so violently that she could with difficulty prevent herself from making a noise which she feared would bring down increased wrath upon her from the old lady that feigned scolding from the colonel at once brought back upon her the feeling of sudden and pleasant intimacy which she had felt when he had first come and ordered her to dance with him at the ball in london it was once again with her as though she knew this man almost more intimately and certainly more pleasantly than any of her other acquaintances whatever he said she could answer him now and pretend to scold him and have her joke with him as though no offer had ever been made she could have told him now all the story of that turned dress if that subject had come naturally to her or have laughed with him at her own old boxes and confided to him any other of the troubles of her poverty as if they were jokes which she could share at any rate with him then he spoke again i do abominate a perverse young woman he said upon this ayala could no longer constrain herself but burst into loud laughter  after a while the two old people became quite familiar and there arose a contest in which the lady took part with the colonel and the old man protected ayala the colonel spoke as though he were quite in earnest and went on to declare that the young ladies of the present time were allowed far too much licence they never have their own bread to earn he said and they ought to make themselves agreeable to other people who have more to do  i quite agree with you sir said the old lady they should run about and be handy i like to see a girl that can jump about the house and make herself useful  young ladies ought to be young ladies said the old man putting his mouth for a moment up out of his comforter  and cant a young lady be useful and yet be a young lady said the colonel  it is her special province to be ornamental said the old gentleman i like to see young ladies ornamental i dont think young ladies ought to be scolded even if they are a little fractious  i quite agree with you sir said ayala and so the fight went on with sundry breaks and changes in the matter under discussion till the station for stalham had been reached the old gentleman indeed seemed to lose his voice before the journey was half over but the lady persevered so that she and the colonel became such fast friends that she insisted on shaking hands with him when he left the carriage  how could you be so wicked as to go on hoaxing her like that said ayala as soon as they were on the platform  there was no hoax at all i was quite in earnest was not every word true that i said now come and get into the carriage quickly or you will be as bad as the old gentleman himself  ayala did get into the carriage quickly where she found nina  the two girls were full of conversation as they went to stalham but through it all ayala could not refrain from thinking how the jonathan stubbs of today had been exactly like that jonathan stubbs she had first knownand how very unlike a lover     chapter xlvii  captain batsby at merle park   when ayala went to stalham captain batsby went to merle park they had both been invited by lady tringle and when the letter was written to ayala she was assured that tom should not be there at that time toms last encounter with the police had not as yet become known to the tringles and the necessity of keeping tom at the house in the country was not manifest the idea had been that captain batsby should have an opportunity of explaining himself to ayala the captain came but as to ayala mrs dosett sent word to say that she had been invited to stay some days just at that time with her friend lady albury at stalham  what to do with captain batsby had been felt to be a difficulty by lady albury it was his habit to come to stalham some time in march and there finish the hunting season it might be hoped that ayalas little affair might be arranged early in march and then whether he came or whether he did not it would be the same to ayala but the captain himself would be grievously irate when he should hear the trick which would have been played upon him lady albury had already desired him not to come till after the first week in march having fabricated an excuse she had been bound to keep the coast clear both for ayalas sake and the colonels but she knew that when her trick should be discovered there would be unmeasured wrath why the deuce dont you let the two men come and then the best man may win said sir harry who did not doubt but that in such a case the colonel would prove to be the best man here too there was another difficulty when lady albury attempted to explain that ayala would not come unless she were told that she would not meet the captain sir harry declared that there should be no such favour who the deuce is this little girl he asked that everybody should be knocked about in this way for her lady albury was able to pacify the husband but she feared that any pacifying of the captain would be impossible there would be a family quarrelbut even that must be endured for the colonels sake  in the meantime the captain was kept in absolute ignorance of ayalas movements and went down to merle park hoping to meet her there he must have been very much in love for merle park was by no means a spot well adapted for hunting hounds there were in the neighbourhood but he turned up his nose at the offer when sir thomas suggested that he might bring down a hunter captain batsby when he went on hunting exhibitions never stirred without five horses and always confined his operations to six or seven favoured counties but ayala just at present was more to him than hunting and therefore though it was now the end of february he went to merle park  it was all sir thomass doing it was thus that lady tringle endeavoured to console herself when discussing the matter with her daughters the honourable septimus traffick had now gone up to london and was inhabiting a single room in the neighbourhood of the house augusta was still at merle park much to the disgust of her father he did not like to tell her to be gone and would indeed have been glad enough of her presence had it not been embittered by the feeling that he was being done but there she remained and in discussing the affairs of the captain with her mother and gertrude was altogether averse to the suggested marriage for ayala to her thinking ayala was not entitled to a husband at all augusta had never given way in the affair of tomhad declared her conviction that stubbs had never been in earnest and was of opinion that captain batsby would be much better off at merle park without ayala than he would have been in that young ladys presence when he arrived nothing was said to him at once about ayala gertrude who recovered from the great sickness occasioned by mr houstons misconduct though the recovery was intended only to be temporary made herself as pleasant as possible captain batsby was made welcome and remained three days before he sought an opportunity of asking a question about ayala  during this time he found gertrude to be a very agreeable companion but he made mrs traffick his first confidant well you know captain batsby to tell you the truth we are not very fond of our cousin  sir thomas told me she was to be here  so we know my father is perhaps a little mistaken about ayala  was she not asked demanded captain batsby beginning to think that he had been betrayed  oh yes she was asked she has been asked very often because she is mammas niece and did live with us once for a short time but she did not come in fact she wont go anywhere unless  unless what  you know colonel stubbs  jonathan stubbs oh dear yes very intimately he is a sort of connection of mine he is my halfbrothers second cousin by the fathers side  oh indeed does that make him very near  not at all i dont like him if you mean that he always takes everything upon himself down at stalham  what we hear is that ayala is always running after him  ayala running after jonathan  havent you heard of that asked mrs traffick whyshe is at stalham with the alburys this moment and i do not doubt that colonel stubbs is there also she would not have gone had she not been sure of meeting him  this disturbed the captain so violently that for two or three hours he kept himself apart not knowing what to do with himself or where to betake himself could this be true about jonathan stubbs there had been moments of deep jealousy down at stalham but then he had recovered from that having assured himself that he was wrong it had been larry twentyman and not jonathan stubbs who had led the two girls over the brookinto which stubbs had simply fallen making himself an object of pity but now again the captain believed it all it was on this account then that his halfsisterinlaw rosaline had desired him to stay away from stalham for the present he knew well how high in favour with lady albury was that traitor stubbs how it was by her favour that stubbs who was no more than a second cousin was allowed to do just what he pleased in the stables while sir harry himself the master of the hounds confined himself to the kennel he was determined at first to leave merle park and start instantly for stalham and had sent for his servant to begin the packing of his things but as he thought of it more maturely he considered that his arrival at stalham would be very painful to himself as well as to others for the others he did not much care but he saw clearly that the pain to himself would be very disagreeable no one at stalham would be glad to see him sir harry would be disturbed and the other three persons with whom he was concernedlady albury stubbs and ayalawould be banded together in hostility against him what chance would he have under such circumstances therefore he determined that he would stay at merle park yet a little longer  and after all was ayala worth the trouble which he had proposed to take for her how much had he offered her how scornfully had his offer been received and how little had she to give him in return and now he had been told that she was always running after jonathan stubbs could it be worth his while to run after a girl who was always running after jonathan stubbs was he not much higher in the world than jonathan stubbs seeing that he had at any rate double stubbss income stubbs was a redhaired ugly impudent fellow who made his way wherever he went simply by cheek upon reflection he found that it would be quite beneath him to run after any girl who could so demean herself as to run after jonathan stubbs therefore he came down to dinner on that evening with all his smiles and said not a word about ayala to sir thomas who had just returned from london  is he very much provoked sir thomas asked his wife that evening  provoked about what  he was expressly told that he would meet ayala here  he seems to be making himself very comfortable and hasnt said a word to me about ayala i am sick of ayala poor tom is going to be really ill then sir thomas frowned and said nothing more on that occasion  tom was certainly in an uncomfortable position and never left his bed till after noon then he would mope about the place moping even worse than he did before and would spend the evening all alone in the housekeepers room with a pipe in his mouth which he seemed hardly able to take the trouble to keep alight there were three or four other guests in the house including two honourable miss trafficks and a couple of young men out of the city whom lady tringle hoped might act as antidotes to houston and hamel but with none of them would tom associate with captain batsby he did form some little intimacy driven to it no doubt by a community of interest i believe you were acquainted with my cousin miss dormer at stalham asked tom at the moment the two were sitting over the fire in the housekeepers room and captain batsby was smoking a cigar while tom was sucking an empty pipe  oh yes said captain batsby pricking up his ears i saw a good deal of her  a wonderful creature ejaculated tom  yes indeed  for a real romantic style of beauty i dont suppose that the world ever saw her like before did you  are you one among your cousins admirers demanded the captain  am i asked tom surprised that there should be anybody who had not as yet heard his tragic story am i one of her admirers whyrather havent you heard about me and stubbs  no indeed  i thought that everybody had heard that i challenged him you know  to fight a duel  yes to fight a duel i sent my friend faddle down with a letter to stalham but it was of no use why should a man fight a duel when he has got such a girl as ayala to love him  that is quite true then  i fear so i fear so oh yes it is too true then you knowand as he came to this portion of his story he jumped up from his chair and frowned fiercelythen you know i met him under the portico of the haymarket and struck him  ohwas that you  indeed it was  and he did not do anything to you  he behaved like a hero said tom i do think that he behaved like a herothough of course i hate him the bitterness of expression was here very great he wouldnt let them lock me up though in the matter of that i should have been best pleased if they would have locked me up for ever and kept me from the sight of the world admire that girl captain batsby i dont think that i ever heard of a man who loved a girl as i love her i do not hesitate to say that i continue to walk the worldin the way of not committing suicide i meansimply because there is still a possibility while she has not as yet stood at the hymeneal altar with another man i would have shot stubbs willingly though i knew i was to be tried for it at the old baileyand hung i would have done it willinglywillingly or any other man after that captain batsby thought it might be prudent not to say anything especial as to his own love  and how foolish would it be for a man like himself with a good fortune of his own to marry any girl who had not a sixpence the captain was led into this vain thought by the great civility displayed to him by the ladies of the house with lucy whom he knew to be ayalas sister he had not prospered very well it came to his ears that she was out of favour with her aunt and he therefore meddled with her but little the tringle ladies however were very kind to himso kind that he was tempted to think less than ever of one who had been so little courteous to him as ayala mrs traffick was of course a married woman and it amounted to nothing but gertrude all the world knew that septimus traffick without a shilling of his own had become the happy possessor of a very large sum of money he batsby had more to recommend him than traffick why should not he also become a happy possessor he went away for a weeks hunting into northamptonshire and then at lady tringles request came back to merle park  at this time miss tringle had quite recovered her health she had dropped all immediate speech as to mr houston had she not been provoked she would have allowed all that to drop into oblivion but a married sister may take liberties you are well rid of him i think said augusta gertrude heaved a deep sigh she did not wish to acknowledge herself to be rid of him until another string were well fitted to her bow after all a man with nothing to do in the world with no profession no occupation with no money  mr traffick had not got very much money of his own  he has a seat in parliament which is very much more than fortune and will undoubtedly be in power when his party comes in and he is a man of birth but frank houston had nothing to recommend him  birth said gertrude turning up her nose  the queen who is the fountain of honour made his father a nobleman and that constitutes birth this the married sister said with stern severity of manner and perfect reliance on the constitutional privileges of her sovereign  i dont know that we need talk about it said gertrude  not at all mr houston has behaved very badly and i suppose there is an end of him as far as this house is concerned captain batsby seems to me to be a very nice young man and i suppose he has got money a man should certainly have got moneyor an occupation  he has got both said gertrude which however was not true as captain batsby had left the service                                          have you forgotten my cousin so soon gertrude asked one day as she was walking with the happy captain in the park the captain no doubt had been saying soft things to her  do you throw that in my teeth as an offence  inconstancy in men is generally considered as an offence said gertrude what it might be in women she did not just then declare  after all i have heard of your cousin since i have been here i should hardly have thought that it would be reckoned so in this case  you have heard nothing against her from me  i am told that she has treated your brother very badly  poor tom  and that she is flirting with a man i particularly dislike  i suppose she does make herself rather peculiar with that colonel stubbs  and after all only think how little i saw of her she is pretty  so some people think i never saw it myself said gertrude we always thought her a mass of affectation we had to turn her out of the house once you know she was living here and then it was that her sister had to come in her place it is not their fault that they have got nothingpoor girls they are mammas nieces and so papa always has one of them after that forgiveness was accorded to the captain on account of his fickle conduct and gertrude consented to accept of his services in the guise of a lover that this was so mrs traffick was well aware nor was lady tringle very much in the dark frank houston was to be considered as good as gone and if so it would be well that her daughter should have another string she was tired of the troubles of the girls around her and thought that as captain batsby was supposed to have an income he would do as a soninlaw but she had not hitherto been consulted by the young people who felt among themselves that there still might be a difficulty the difficulty lay with sir thomas sir thomas had brought captain batsby there to merle park as ayalas lover and as he had been very little at home was unaware of the changes which had taken place and then gertrude was still supposed to be engaged to mr houston although this lover had been so violently rejected by himself the ladies felt that as he was made of sterner stuff than they so would it be more difficult to reconcile him to the alterations which were now proposed in the family arrangements who was to bell the cat let him go to papa in the usual way and ask his leave said mrs traffick  i did suggest that said gertrude but he seems not to like to do it quite yet  is he such a coward as that  i do not know that he is more a coward than anybody else i remember when septimus was quite afraid to go near papa but then benjamin has got money of his own which does make a difference  its quite untrue saying that septimus was ever afraid of papa of course he knows his position as a member of parliament too well for that i suppose the truth is its about ayala  it is a little odd about ayala said gertrude resuming her confidential tone it is so hard to make papa understand about these kind of things i declare i believe he thinks that i never ought to speak to another man because of that scoundrel frank houston  all this was in truth so strange to sir thomas that he could not understand any of the existing perplexities why did captain batsby remain as a guest at merle park he had no special dislike to the man and when lady tringle had told him that she had asked the captain to prolong his visit he had made no objection but why should the man remain there knowing as he did now that there was no chance of ayalas coming to merle park at last on a certain saturday evening he did make inquiry on the subject what on earth is that man staying here for he said to his wife  i think he likes the place  perhaps he likes the place as well as septimus traffick and means to live here always such allusions as these were constant with sir thomas and were always received by lady tringle with dismay and grief when does he mean to go away asked sir thomas gruffly  lady tringle had felt that the time had come in which some word should be said as to the captains intentions but she feared to say it she dreaded to make the clear explanation to her husband perhaps said she he is becoming fond of some of the young ladies  young ladies what young ladies do you mean lucy  oh dear no said lady tringle  then what the deuce do you mean he came here after ayala because i wanted to have all that nonsense settled about tom ayala is not here nor likely to be here and i dont know why he should stay here philandering away his time i hate men in a countryhouse who are thorough idlers you had better take an opportunity of letting him know that he has been here long enough  all this was repeated by lady tringle to mrs traffick and by mrs traffick to gertrude then they felt that this was no time for captain batsby to produce himself to sir thomas as a suitor for his youngest daughter     chapter xlviii  the journey to ostend   no doubt it will be very hard to make papa understand this was said by gertrude to her new lover a few days after that order had been given that the lover should be sent away from merle park the purport of the order in all its severity had not been conveyed to captain batsby the ladies had feltgertrude had felt very stronglythat were he informed that the master of the house demanded his absence he would take himself off at once but still something had to be saidand something done captain batsby was just at present in a matrimonial frame of mind he had come to merle park to look for a wife and as he had missed one was in his present mood inclined to take another but there was no knowing how long this might last augusta had hinted that something must be done either with papas consent or without it then there had come the conversation in which gertrude acknowledged the existing difficulty papa too probably would not consent quite at once  he must think it very odd that i am staying here said the captain  of course it is odd if you could go to him and tell him everything but the captain looking at the matter all round thought that he could not go to sir thomas and tell him anything then she began gently to introduce the respectable clergyman at ostend it was not necessary that she should refer at length to the circumstances under which she had studied the subject but she gave captain batsby to understand that it was one as to which she had picked up a good deal of information  but the money if sir thomas were made really angry the consequences would be disastrous said the captain but gertrude was of a different way of thinking her father was no doubt a man who could be very imperious and would insist upon having his own way as long as his own way was profitable to him but he was a man who always forgave  if you mean about the money said gertrude i am quite sure that it would all come right he did mean about the money and was evidently uneasy in his mind when the suggested step was made manifest to him gertrude was astonished to see how long and melancholy his face could become papa was never unkind about money in his life said gertrude he could not endure to have any of us poor  on the next saturday sir thomas again came down and still found his guest at merle park we are now a little in advance of our special story which is or ought to be devoted to ayala but with the affairs of so many lovers and their loves it is almost impossible to make the chronicle run at equal periods throughout it was now more than three weeks since ayala went to stalham and lady albury had written to the captain confessing something of her sin and begging to be forgiven this she had done in her anxiety to keep the captain away he had not answered his sisterinlaws letter but in his present frame of mind was not at all anxious to finish up the huntingseason at stalham sir thomas on his arrival was very full of toms projected tour he had arranged everythingexcept in regard to toms own assent he had written to new york and had received back a reply from his correspondent assuring him that tom should be made most heartily welcome it might be that toms fighting propensities had not been made known to the people of new york sir thomas had taken a berth on board of one of the cunard boats and had even gone so far as to ask the captain to come down for a day or two to merle park he was so much employed with tom that he could hardly afford time and consideration to captain batsby and his affairs nevertheless he did ask a question and received an answer with which he seemed to be satisfied what on earth is that man staying here for he said to his wife  he is going on friday replied lady tringle doubtinglyalmost as though she thought that she would be subjected to further anger because of this delay but sir thomas dropped the subject and passed on to some matter affecting toms outfit lady tringle was very glad to change the subject and promised that everything should be supplied befitting the hottest and coldest climates on the earths surface  she sails on the nineteenth of april said sir thomas to his son  i dont think i could go as soon as that sir replied tom whining  why not there are more than three weeks yet and your mother will have everything ready for you what on earth is there to hinder you  i dont think i could gonot on the nineteenth of april  well then you must i have taken your place and firkin expects you at new york theyll do everything for you there and youll find quite a new life i should have thought youd have been delighted to get away from your wretched condition here  it is wretched said tom but id rather not go quite so soon  why not  well then  what is it tom it makes me unhappy when i see you such a fool  i am a fool i know i am a fool  then make a new start of it cut and run and begin the world again youre young enough to forget all this  so i would only  only what  i suppose she is engaged to that man stubbs if i knew it for certain then i would go if i went before i should only come back as soon as i got to new york if they were once married and it were all done with i think i could make a new start  in answer to this his father told him that he must go on the nineteenth of april whether ayala were engaged or disengaged married or unmarriedthat his outfit would be bought his cabin would be ready circular notes for his use would be prepared and everything would be arranged to make his prolonged tour as comfortable as possible but that if he did not start on that day all the tringle houses would be closed against him and he would be turned penniless out into the world youll have to learn that im in earnest said sir thomas as he turned his back and walked away tom took himself off to reflect whether it would not be a grand thing to be turned penniless out into the worldand all for love  by the early train on monday sir thomas returned to london having taken little or no heed of captain batsby during his late visit to the country even at merle park captain batsbys presence was less important than it would otherwise have been to lady tringle and mrs traffick because of the serious nature of sir thomass decision as to his son lady tringle perhaps suspected something mrs traffick no doubt had her own ideas as to her sisters position but nothing was said and nothing was done both on the wednesday and on the thursday lady tringle went up to town to give the required orders on toms behalf on the thursday her elder daughter accompanied her and returned with her in the evening on their arrival they learnt that neither captain batsby nor miss gertrude had been seen since ten oclock that almost immediately after lady tringles departure in the morning captain batsby had caused all his luggage to be sent into hastings and that it had since appeared that a considerable number of miss gertrudes things were missing there could be no doubt that she had caused them to be packed up with the captains luggage they have gone to ostend mamma said augusta i was sure of it because ive heard gertrude say that people can always get themselves married at ostend there is a clergyman there on purpose to do it  it was at this time past seven oclock and lady tringle when she heard the news was so astounded that she did not at first know how to act it was not possible for her to reach dover that night before the nightboat for ostend should have startedeven could she have done any good by going there tom was in such a condition that she hardly dared to trust him but it was settled at last that she should telegraph at once to sir thomas in lombard street and that tom should travel up to london by the night train  on the following morning lady tringle received a letter from gertrude posted by that young lady at dover as she passed through on her road to ostend it was as follows      dear mamma     you will be surprised on your return from london to    find that we have gone after much thinking about it we    determined it would be best because we had quite made    up our mind not to be kept separated ben was so eager    about it that i was obliged to yield we were afraid that    if we asked papa at once he would not have given his    consent pray give him my most dutiful love and tell him    that i am sure he will never have occasion to be ashamed    of his soninlaw i dont suppose he knows but it is    the fact that captain batsby has about three thousand a    year of his own it is very different from having nothing    like that wretch frank houston or for that matter mr    traffick ben was quite in a position to ask papa but    things had happened which made us both feel that papa    would not like it just at present we mean to be married    at ostend and then will come back as soon as you and papa    say that you will receive us in the meantime i wish you    would send some of my clothes after me of course i had to    come away with very little luggage because i was obliged    to have my things mixed up with bens i did not dare to    have my boxes brought down by the servants could you send    me the green silk in which i went to church the last two    sundays and my pink gauze and the grey poplin please    send two or three flannel petticoats as i could not put    them among his things and as many cuffs and collars as    you can cram in i suppose i can get boots at ostend    but i should like to have the hat with the little brown    feather there is my silk jacket with the fur trimming    i should like to have that i suppose i shall have to be    married without any regular dress but i am sure papa will    make up my trousseau to me afterwards i lent a little    lace fichu to augusta tell her that i shall so like to    have it     give papa my best love and augusta and poor tom and    accept the same from your affectionate daughter     gertrude     i suppose i must not add the other name yet   sir thomas did not receive the telegram till eleven oclock when he returned from dinner and could do nothing that night on the next morning he was disturbed soon after five oclock by tom who had come on the same errand idiots exclaimed sir thomas what on earth can they have gone to ostend for and what can you do by coming up  my mother thought that i might follow them to ostend  they wouldnt care for you no one will care for you until you have got rid of all this folly i must go idiots who is to marry them at ostend if they are fools enough to want to be married why shouldnt they get married in england  i suppose they thought you wouldnt consent  of course i shant consent but why should i consent a bit more because they have gone to ostend i dont suppose anybody ever had such a set of fools about him as i have this would have been hard upon tom had it not been that he had got beyond the feeling of any hardness from contempt or contumely as he once said of himself all sense of other injury had been washed out of him by ayalas unkindness  on that very day sir thomas started for ostend and reached the place about two oclock captain batsby and gertrude had arrived only during the previous night and gertrude as she had been very sick was still in bed captain batsby was not in bed captain batsby had been engaged since an early hour in the morning looking for that respectable clergyman of the church of england of whose immediate services he stood in need by the time that sir thomas had reached ostend he had found that no such clergyman was known in the place there was a regular english clergyman who would be very happy to marry himand to accept the usual feesafter the due performance of certain preliminaries as ordained by the law and as usual at ostend the lady no doubt could be married at ostend after such preliminariesas she might have been married also in england all this was communicated by the captain to gertrudewho was still very unwellat her bedroom door her conduct during this trying time was quite beyond reproachand also hisas captain batsby afterwards took an opportunity of assuring her father  what on earth sir is the meaning of all this said sir thomas encountering the man who was not his soninlaw in the sittingroom of the hotel  i have just run away with your daughter sir thomas that is the simple truth  and i have got the trouble of taking her back again  i have behaved like a gentleman through it all sir thomas said the captain thus defending his own character and the ladys  you have behaved like a fool what on earth am i to think of it sir you were asked down to my house because you gave me to understand that you proposed to ask my niece miss dormer to be your wife and now you have run away with my daughter is that behaviour like a gentleman  i must explain myself  well sir captain batsby found the explanation very difficult and hummed and hawed a great deal do you mean to say that it was a lie from beginning to end about miss dormer great liberties of speech are allowed to gentlemen whose daughters have been run away with and whose hospitality has been outraged  oh dear no what i said then was quite true it was my intention butbut the perspiration broke out upon the unhappy mans brow as the great immediate trouble of his situation became clear to him there was no lieno lie at all i beg to assure you sir thomas that i am not a man to tell a lie  how has it all been then  when i found how very superior a person your daughter was  it isnt a month since she was engaged to somebody else said the angry father forgetting all propriety in his indignation  gertrude demanded captain batsby  you are two fools so you gave up my niece  oh dear yes altogether she didnt come to merle park you know how was i to say anything to her when you didnt have her there  why didnt you go away then instead of remaining under a false pretence or why at any rate didnt you tell me the truth  and what would you have me to do now asked captain batsby  go to the d said sir thomas as he left the room and went to his daughters chamber  gertrude had heard that her father was in the house and endeavoured to hurry herself into her clothes while the interview was going on between him and her father but she was not yet perfectly arrayed when her father burst into her room oh papa she said going down on her knees you do mean to forgive us  i mean to do nothing of the kind i mean to carry you home and have you locked up  but we may be married  not with my leave why didnt you come and ask if you wanted to get yourselves married why didnt you tell me  we were ashamed  what has become of mr houston whom you loved so dearly  oh papa  and the captain was so much attached to ayala  oh papa  get up you stupid girl why is it that my children are so much more foolish than other peoples i dont suppose you care for the man in the least  i do i do i love him with all my heart  and as for himhow can he care for you when it is but the other day he was in love with your cousin  oh papa  what he wants is my money of course  he has got plenty of money papa  i can understand him fool as he is there is something for him to get he wont get it but he might think it possible as for you i cannot understand you at all what do you expect it cant be for love of a hatchetfaced fellow like that whom you had never seen a fortnight ago  it is more than a month ago papa  frank houston was at any rate a manlylooking fellow  he was a scoundrel said gertrude now standing up for the first time  a goodlooking fellow was frank houston that at least may be said for him continued the father determined to exasperate his daughter to the utmost i had half a mind to give way about him because he was a manly outspoken fellow though he was such an idle dog if youd gone off with him i could have understood itand perhaps forgiven it he added  he was a scoundrel screamed gertrude remembering her ineffectual attempts to make her former lover perform this same journey  but this fellow i cannot bring myself to believe that you really care for him  he has a good income of his own while houston was little better than a beggar  im glad of that said sir thomas because there will be something for you to live upon i can assure you that captain batsby will never get a shilling of my money now you had better finish dressing yourself and come down and eat your dinner with me if youve got any appetite you will have to go back to dover by the boat tonight  may ben dine with us asked gertrude timidly  ben may go to the d at any rate he had better not show himself to me again said sir thomas  the lovers however did get an opportunity of exchanging a few words during which it was settled between them that as the young lady must undoubtedly obey her fathers behests and return to dover that night it would be well for captain batsby to remain behind at ostend indeed he spoke of making a little tour as far as brussels in order that he might throw off the melancholy feelings which had been engendered you will come to me again ben she said upon this he looked very grave you do not mean to say that after all this you will desert me  he has insulted me so horribly  what does that signify of course he is angry if you could only hear how he has insulted me  he says that you were in love with somebody else not a month since  so were you ben for the matter of that he did however before they parted make her a solemn promise that their engagement should remain an established fact in spite both of father and mother  gertrude who had now recovered the effects of her seasicknesswhich however she would have to encounter again so very quicklycontrived to eat a hearty dinner with her father there however arose a little trouble how should she contrive to pack up the clothes which she had brought with her and which had till lately been mixed with the captains garments she did however at last succeed in persuading the chambermaid to furnish her with a carpetbag with which in her custody she arrived safely on the following day at merle park     chapter xlix  the new frock   ayalas arrival at stalham was full of delight to her there was nina with all her newfledged hopes and her perfect assurance in the absolute superiority of lord george bideford to any other man either alive or dead ayala was quite willing to allow this assurance to pass current as her angel of light was as yet neither alive nor dead but she was quite certainwholly certainthat when the angel should come forth he would be superior to lord george the first outpouring of all this took place in the carriage as nina and ayala were driven from the station to the house while the colonel went home alone in a dogcart it had been arranged that nothing should be said to ayala about the colonel and in the carriage the colonels name was not mentioned but when they were all in the hall at stalham taking off their cloaks and depositing their wraps standing in front of the large fire colonel stubbs was there lady albury was present also welcoming her guests and sir harry who had already come home from hunting with one or two other men in red coats and top breeches and a small bevy of ladies who were staying in the house lady albury was anxious to know how her friend had sped with ayala but at such a moment no question could be asked but ayalas spirits were so high that lady albury was at a loss to understand whether the whole thing had been settled by jonathan with successor whether on the other hand ayala was so happy because she had not been troubled by a word of love  he has behaved so badly lady albury said ayala  whatstubbs asked sir harry not quite understanding all the ins and outs of the matter  yes sir harry there was an old lady and an old gentleman they were very funny and he would laugh at them  i deny it said the colonel  why shouldnt he laugh at them if they were funny asked lady albury  he knew it would make me laugh out loud i couldnt help myself but he could be as grave as a judge all the time so he went till the old woman scolded me dreadfully  but the old man took your part said the colonel  yeshe did he said that i was ornamental  a decent and truthspeaking old gentleman said one of the sportsmen in topboots  quite sobut then the old lady said that i was perverse and colonel stubbs took her part if you had been there lady albury you would have thought that he had been in earnest  so i was said the colonel  all this was very pleasant to ayala it was a return to the old joyousness when she had first discovered the delight of having such a friend as colonel stubbs had he flattered her paid her compliments been soft and delicate to heras a lover might have beenshe would have been troubled in spirit and heavy at heart but now it seemed as though all that lovemaking had been an episode which had passed away and that the old pleasant friendship still remained as yet while they were standing there in the hall there had come no moment for her to feel whether there was anything to regret in this but certainly there had been comfort in it she had been able to appear before all her stalham friends in the presence even of the man himself without any of that consciousness which would have oppressed her had he come there simply as her acknowledged lover and had she come there conscious before all the guests that it was so  then they sat for a while drinking tea and eating buttered toast in the drawingroom a supply of buttered toast fully to gratify the wants of three or four men just home from hunting has never yet been created by the resources of any establishment but the greater marvel is that the buttered toast has never the slightest effect on the dinner which is to follow in an hour or two during this period the conversation turned chiefly upon huntingwhich is of all subjects the most imperious it never occurs to a huntingman to suppose that either a lady or a bishop or a political economist can be indifferent to hunting there is something beyond millinerybeyond the interests of the churchbeyond the price of wheatin that great question whether the hounds did or did not change their fox in gobblegoose wood on the present occasion sir harry was quite sure that the hounds did carry their fox through gobblegoose wood whereas captain glomax who had formerly been master of the pack which now obeyed sir harry was perfectly certain that they had got upon another animal who went away from gobblegoose as fresh as paint he pretended even to ridicule sir harry for supposing that any fox could have run at that pace up buddlecombe hill who had travelled all the way from stickborough gorse to this sir harry replied resentfully that the captain did not know what were the running powers of a dogfox in march then he told various stories of what had been done in this way at this special period of the year glomax however declared that he knew as much of a fox as any man in england and that he would eat both the foxes and the wood and sir harry and finally himself if the animal which had run up buddlecombe hill was the same which they brought with them from stickborough gorse into gobblegoose wood so the battle raged and the ladies no doubt were much interestedas would have been the bishop had he been there or the political economist  after this ayala was taken up into her room and left to sit there by herself for a while till lady albury should send her maid my dear said lady albury there is something on the bed which i expect you to wear tonight i shall be brokenhearted if it doesnt fit you the frock is a present from sir harry the scarf comes from me dont say a word about it sir harry always likes to make presents to young ladies then she hurried out of the room while ayala was still thanking her lady albury had at first intended to say something about the colonel as they were sitting together over ayalas fire but she had made up her mind against this as soon as she saw their manner towards each other on entering the house if ayala had accepted him at a word as they were travelling together then there would be need of no further interference in the matter but if not it would be better that she should hold her peace for the present  ayalas first instinct was to look at the finery which had been provided for her it was a light grey silk almost pearl colour as to which she thought she had never seen anything so lovely before she measured the waist with her eye and knew at once that it would fit her she threw the gauzy scarf over her shoulders and turned herself round before the large mirror which stood near the fireplace dear lady albury she exclaimed dear lady albury it was impossible that she should have understood that lady alburys affection had been shown to jonathan stubbs much rather than to her when those presents were prepared  she got rid of her travelling dress and her boots and let down her hair and seated herself before the fire that she might think of it all in her solitude was she or was she not gladglad in sober earnest glad now the moment of her mirth had passed by the mirth which had made her return to stalham so easy for herwas she or was she not glad that this change had come upon the colonel this return to his old ways she had got her friend again but she had lost her lover she did not want the lover she was sure of that she was still sure that if a lover would come to her who would be in truth acceptablesuch a lover as would enable her to give herself up to him altogether and submit herself to him as her lord and masterhe must be something different from jonathan stubbs that had been the theory of her life for many months past a theory on which she had resolved to rely with all her might from the moment in which this man had spoken to her of his love would she give way and render up herself and all her dreams simply because the man was one to be liked she had declared to herself again and again that it should not be so there should come the angel of light or there should come no lover for her on that very morning as she was packing up her boxes at kingsbury crescent she had arranged the words in which should he speak to her on the subject in the railway train she would make him understand that it could never be surely he would understand if she told him so simply with a little prayer that his suit might not be repeated his suit had not been repeated nothing apparently had been further from his intention he had been droll pleasant friendlyjust like his old dear self for in truth the pleasantness and the novelty of his friendship had made him dear to her he had gone back of his own accord to the old ways without any little prayer from her now was she contented as the question would thrust itself upon her in opposition to her own will driving out the thoughts which she would fain have welcomed she gazed listlessly at the fire if it were so then for what purpose then for what reason had lady albury procured for her the pale grey pearlcoloured dress  and why were all these grand people at stalham so good to herto her a poor little girl whose ordinary life was devoted to the mending of linen and to the furtherance of economy in the use of pounds of butter and legs of mutton why was she taken out of her own sphere and petted in this new luxurious world she had a knowledge belonging to herif not quite what we may call common sensewhich told her that there must be some cause of some intellectual capacity some appreciation of things and words which were divine in their beauty she was half conscious it could not be she felt that without some such capacity she should have imaged to herself that angel of light but not for such capacity as that had she been made welcome at stalham as for her prettiness her beauty of face and form she thought about them not at allalmost not at all in appearing in that palepearl silk with that gauzy scarf upon her shoulders she would take pride not to be shamed among other girls by the poorness of her apparel was a pride to her perhaps to excel some others by the prettiness of her apparel might be a pride to her but of feminine beauty as a great gift bestowed upon her she thought not at all she would look in the mirror for the effect of the scarf but not for the effect of the neck and shoulders beneath it could she have looked in any mirror for the effect of the dreams she had thus dreamedah that would have been the mirror in which she would have loved yet feared to look  why was lady albury so kind to her perhaps lady albury did not know that colonel stubbs had changed his mind she would know it very soon and then maybe everything would be changed as she thought of this she longed to put the pearl silk dress aside and not to wear it as yetto put it aside so that it might never be worn by her if circumstances should so require it was to be hoped that the man had changed his mindand to be hoped that lady albury would know that he had done so then she would soon see whether there was a change could she not give a reason why she should not wear the dress this night as she sat gazing at the fire a tear ran down her cheek was it for the dress she would not wear or for the lover whom she would not love  the question as to the dress was settled for her very soon lady alburys maid came into the roomnot a chit of a girl without a thought of her own except as to her own grandness in being two steps higher than the kitchenmaidbut a wellgrown buxom powerful woman who had no idea of letting such a young lady as ayala do anything in the matter of dress but what she told her when ayala suggested something as to the next evening in reference to the palepearl silk the buxom powerful woman poohpoohed her down in a moment whatafter sir harry had taken so much trouble about having it made having actually inquired about it with his own mouth tonight miss you must wear it tonight my lady would be quite angry my lady not know what you wear my lady knows what all the ladies wearmorning noon and night that little plan of letting the dress lie by till she should know how she should be received after colonel stubbss change of mind had been declared fell to the ground altogether under the hands of the buxom powerful woman  when she went into the drawingroom some of the guests were assembled sir harry and lady albury were there and so was colonel stubbs as she walked in sir harry was standing well in front of the fire in advance of the rug so as to be almost in the middle of the room captain glomax was there also and the discussion about the foxes was going on it had occurred to ayala that as the dress was a present from sir harry she must thank him so she walked up to him and made a little curtsey just before him am i nice sir harry she said  upon my word said sir harry that is the best spent tenpoundnote i ever laid out in my life then he took her by the hand and gently turned her round so as to look at her and her dress  i dont know whether i am nice but you are she said curtseying again everybody felt that she had had quite a little triumph as she subsided into a seat close by lady albury who called her as she seated herself she caught the colonels eye who was looking at her she fancied that there was a tear in it then he turned himself and looked away into the fire  you have won his heart for ever said lady albury  whose heart asked ayala in her confusion  sir harrys heart as for the other cela va sans dire you must go on wearing it every night for a week or sir harry will want to know why you have left it off if the woman had made it on you it couldnt have fitted better baker baker was the buxom femalesaid that she knew it was right you did that very prettily to sir harry now go up and ask colonel stubbs what he thinks of it  indeed i wont said ayala lady albury a few minutes afterwards when she saw ayala walking away towards the drawingroom leaning on the colonels arm acknowledged to herself that she did at last understand it the colonel had been able to see it all even without the dress and she confessed in her mind that the colonel had eyes with which to see and ears with which to hear and a judgment with which to appreciate dont you think that girl very lovely she said to lord rufford on whose arm she was leaning  something almost more than lovely said lord rufford with unwonted enthusiasm  it was acknowledged now by everybody is it true about colonel stubbs and miss dormer whispered lady rufford to her hostess in the drawingroom  upon my word i never inquire into those things said lady albury i suppose he does admire her everybody must admire her  oh yes said lady rufford she is certainly very pretty who is she lady albury lady rufford had been a miss penge and the penges were supposed to be direct descendants from boadicea  she is miss ayala dormer her father was an artist and her mother was a very handsome woman when a girl is as beautiful as miss dormer and as clever it doesnt much signify who she is then the direct descendant from boadicea withdrew holding an opinion much at variance with that expressed by her hostess  who is that young lady who sat next to you asked captain glomax of colonel stubbs after the ladies had gone  she is a miss ayala dormer  did i not see her out hunting with you once or twice early in the season  you saw her out hunting no doubt and i was there i did not specially bring her she was staying here and rode one of alburys horses  take her top and bottom and all round said captain glomax she is the prettiest little thing ive seen for many a day when she curtsyed to sir harry in the drawingroom i almost thought that i should like to be a marrying man myself stubbs did not carry on the conversation having felt displeased rather than otherwise by the admiration expressed  i didnt quite understand before said sir harry to his wife that night what it was that made jonathan so furious about that girl but i think i see it now  fine feathers make fine birds said his wife laughing  feathers ever so fine said sir harry dont make wellbred birds  to tell the truth said lady albury i think we shall all have to own that jonathan has been right  this took place upstairs but before they left the drawingroom lady albury whispered a few words to her young friend we have had a terrible trouble about you ayala  a trouble about me lady albury i should be so sorry  it is not exactly your faultbut we havent at all known what to do with that unfortunate man  what man asked ayala forgetful at the moment of all men except colonel stubbs  you naughty girl dont you know that my brotherinlaw is brokenhearted about you  captain batsby whispered ayala in her faintest voice  yes captain batsby a captain has as much right to be considered as a colonel in such a matter as this here ayala frowned but said nothing of course i cant help it who may break his heart but poor ben is always supposed to be at stalham just at this time of the year and now i have been obliged to tell him one fib upon another to keep him away when he comes to know it all what on earth will he say to me  i am sure it has not been my fault said ayala  thats what young ladies always say when gentlemen break their hearts  when ayala was again in her room and had got rid of the buxom female who came to assist her in taking off her new finery she was aware of having passed the evening triumphantly she was conscious of admiration she knew that sir harry had been pleased by her appearance she was sure that lady albury was satisfied with her and she had seen something in the colonels glance that made her feel that he had not been indifferent but in their conversation at the dinner table he had said nothing which any other man might not have said if any other man could have made himself as agreeable those hunting days were all again described with their various incidents with the great triumph over the brook and twentymans wife and baby and fat lord rufford who was at the moment sitting there opposite to them and the ball in london with the lady who was thrown out of the window and the old gentleman and the old lady of today who had been so peculiar in their remarks there had been nothing else in their conversation and it surely was not possible that a man who intended to put himself forward as a lover should have talked in such fashion as that but then there were other things which occurred to her why had there been that tear in his eye and that cela va sans dire which had come from lady albury in her railing moodwhat had that meant lady albury when she said that could not have known that the colonel had changed his purpose  but after all what is a dress let it be ever so pretty the angel of light would not care for her dress let her wear what she might were he to seek her because of her dress he would not be the angel of light of whom she had dreamed it was not by any dress that she could prevail over him she did rejoice because of her little triumphbut she knew that she rejoiced because she was not an angel of light herself her only chance lay in this that the angels of yore did come down from heaven to ask for love and worship from the daughters of men  as she went to bed she determined that she would still be true to her dream not because folk admired a new frock would she be ready to give herself to a man who was only a mana man of the earth really who had about him no more than a few of the real attributes of an angel of light     chapter l  gobblegoose wood on sunday   the next two days were not quite so triumphant to ayala as had been the evening of her arrival there was hunting on both of those days the gentlemen having gone on the friday away out of sir harrys country to the brake hounds ayala and the colonel had arrived on the thursday ayala had not expected to be asked to hunt againhad not even thought about it it had been arranged before on ninas account and nina now was not to hunt any more lord george did not altogether approve of it and nina was quite in accord with lord georgethough she had held up her whip and shaken it in triumph when she jumped over the cranbury brook and the horse which alaya had ridden was no longer in the stables my dear i am so sorry but im afraid we cant mount you lady albury said in answer to this ayala declared that she had not thought of it for a moment but yet the days seemed to be dull with her lady rufford waswellperhaps a little patronising to her and patronage such as that was not at all to ayalas taste lady albury seems to be quite a kind friend to you lady rufford said nothing could be more true the idea implied was true alsothe idea that such a one as ayala was much in lucks way to find such a friend as lady albury it was true no doubt but nevertheless it was ungracious and had to be resented a very kind friend indeed some people only make friends of those who are as grand as themselves  i am sure we should be very glad to see you at rufford if you remain long in the country said lady rufford a little time afterwards but even in this there was not a touch of that cordiality which might have won ayalas heart i am not at all likely to stay said ayala i live with my uncle and aunt at notting hill and i very rarely go away from home lady rufford however did not quite understand it it had been whispered to her that morning that ayala was certainly going to marry colonel stubbs and if so why should she not come to rufford  on that day the friday she was taken out to dinner by captain glomax i remember quite as if it were yesterday said the captain it was the day we rode the cranbury brook  ayala looked up into his face also remembering everything as well as it were yesterday mr twentyman rode over it she said and colonel stubbs rode into it  oh yes stubbs got a ducking so he did the captain had not got a ducking but then he had gone round by the road it was a good run that  i thought so  we havent been lucky since sir harry has had the hounds somehow there doesnt seem to be the dash about em there used to be when i was here i had them before sir harry you know all this was nearly in a whisper  were you master asked ayala with a tone of surprise which was not altogether pleasing to the captain  indeed i was but the fag of it was too great and the thanks too small so i gave it up they used to get four days a week out of me during the two years that the captain had had the hounds there had been no doubt two or three weeks in which he had hunted four days  ayala liked hunting but she did not care much for captain glomax who having seen her once or twice on horseback would talk to her about nothing else a little away on the other side of the table nina was sitting next to colonel stubbs and she could hear their voices and almost their words nina and jonathan were first cousins and of course could be happy together without giving her any cause for jealousybut she almost envied nina yet she had hoped that it might not fall to her lot to be taken out again that evening by the colonel hitherto she had not even spoken to him during the day they had started to the meet very early and the gentlemen had almost finished their breakfast before she had come down if there had been any fault it was her fault but yet she almost felt that there was something of a disruption between them it was so evident to her that he was perfectly happy whilst he was talking to nina  after dinner it seemed to be very late before the men came into the drawingroom and then they were still engaged upon that weary talk about hunting till lady rufford in order to put a stop to it offered to sing i always do she said if rufford ventures to name a fox in the drawingroom after dinner she did sing and ayala thought that the singing was more weary than the talk about hunting  while this was going on the colonel had got himself shut up in a corner of the room lady albury had first taken him there and afterwards he had been hemmed in when lady rufford sat down to the piano ayala had hardly ventured even to glance at him but yet she knew all that he did and heard almost every word that he spoke the words were not many but still when he did speak his voice was cheerful nina now and again had run up to him and lady rufford had asked him some questions about the music but why didnt he come out and speak to her thought ayala though all that nonsense about love was over still he ought not to have allowed a day to pass at stalham without speaking to her he was the oldest friend there in that house except nina it was indeed no more than nine months since she had first seen him but still it seemed to her that he was an old friend she did feel as she endeavoured to answer the questions that lord rufford was asking her that jonathan stubbs was treating her unkindly  then came the moment in which lady albury marshalled her guests out of the room towards their chambers have you found yourself dull without the hunting the colonel said to ayala  oh dear no i must have a dull time if i do seeing that i have only hunted three days in my life there was something in the tone of her voice which as she herself was aware almost expressed dissatisfaction and yet not for worlds would she have shown herself to be dissatisfied with him could she have helped it  i thought that perhaps you might have regretted the little pony he said  because a thing has been very pleasant it should not be regretted because it cannot be had always  to me a thing may become so pleasant that unless i can have it always my life must be one long regret  the pony is not quite like that said ayala smiling as she followed the other ladies out of the room  on the next morning the meet was nearer and some of the ladies were taken there in an open carriage lady rufford went and mrs gosling and nina and ayala of course there is a place for you lady albury had said to her had i wanted to go i would have made sir harry send the drag but ive got to stop at home and see that the buttered toast is ready by the time the gentlemen all come back the morning was almost warm so that the sportsmen were saying evil things of violets and primroses as is the wont of sportsmen on such occasions and at the meet the ladies got out of the carriage and walked about among the hounds making civil speeches to old tony no my lady said tony i dont like these sunshiny mornings at all there aint no kind of scent and i goes riding about these big woods up and down till my shirt is as wet on my back with the sweat as though id been pulled through the river then lady rufford walked away and did not ask tony any more questions  ayala was patting one of the hounds when the colonel who had given his horse to a groom came and joined her if you dont regret that pony said he somebody else does  i do regret him in one way of course i did like it very much but i dont think it nice when much has been done for me to say that i want to have more done  of course i knew what you meant  perhaps you would go and tell sir harry and then he would think me very ungrateful  ayala he said i will never say anything of you that will make anybody think evil of you but between ourselves as sir harry is not here i suppose i may confess that i regret the pony  i should like it of course whispered ayala  and so should iso much i suppose all these men here would think me an ass if they knew how little i care about the days workwhether we find or whether we run or whether we killjust because the pony is not here if the pony were here i should have that feeling of expectation of joy which is so common to girls when some muchthoughtof ball or promised pleasure is just before them then tony went off with his hounds and jonathan mounting his horse followed with the ruck  ayala knew very well what the pony meant as spoken of by the colonel when he declared that he regretted the pony it was because the pony might have carried herself he had meant her to understand that the muchthoughtof ball or promised pleasure would have been the delight of again riding with herself and then he had again called her ayala she could remember well every occasion on which he had addressed her by her christian name it had been but seldom once however it had occurred in the full flow of their early intimacy before that lovemaking had been begun it had struck her as being almost wrong but still as very pleasant if it might be made right by some feeling of brotherly friendship how pleasant would it be and now she would like it again if only it might be taken as a sign of friendship rather than of love it never occurred to her to be angry as she would have been angry with any other man how she would have looked at captain batsby had he dared to call her ayala colonel stubbs should call her ayala as long as he pleasedif it were done only in friendship  after that they were driven about for a while seeing what tony did with the hounds as tidings came to them now and again that one fox had broken this way and another had gone the other but ayala through it all could not interest herself about the foxes she was thinking only of jonathan stubbs she knew that she was pleased because he had spoken to her and had said kind pleasant words to her she knew that she had been displeased while he had sat apart from her talking to others but yet she could not explain to herself why she had been either pleased or displeased she feared that there was more than friendshipthan mere friendship in that declaration of his that he did in truth regret the pony his voice had been oh so sweet as he had said it something told her that men do not speak in mere friendship after that fashion not even in the softness of friendship between a man and a woman will the mans voice become as musical as that young as she was child as she was there was an instinct in her breast which declared to her that it was so but then if it were so was not everything again wrong with her if it were so then must that condition of things be coming back which it had been and still was her firm resolve to avoid and yet as the carriage was being driven about and as the frequent exclamations came that the fox had traversed this way or that her pride was gratified and she was happy  what was colonel stubbs saying to you asked nina when they were at home at the house after lunch  he was talking about the dear pony which i used to ride  about nothing else  noabout nothing else this ayala said with a short dry manner of utterance which she would assume when she was determined not to have a subject carried on  ayala why do you not tell me everything i told you everything as soon as it happened  nothing has happened  i know he asked you said nina  and i answered him  is that to be everything  yesthat is to be everything said ayala with a short dry manner of utterance it was so plain that even nina could not pursue the subject  there was nothing done on that day in the way of sport glomax thought that tony had been idle and had made a holiday of the day from the first but sir harry declared that there had not been a yard of scent the buttered toast however was eaten and the regular sporting conversation was carried on ayala however was not there to hear it ayala was in her own room dreaming  she was taken in to dinner by a curate in the neighbourhoodto whom she endeavoured to make herself very pleasant while the colonel sat at her other side the curate had a good deal to say as to lawn tennis if the weather remained as it was it was thought that they could all play lawn tennis on the tuesdaywhen there would be no hunting the curate was a pleasant young fellow and ayala devoted herself to him and to their joint hopes for next tuesday colonel stubbs never once attempted to interfere with the curates opportunity there was lady rufford on the other side of him and to lady rufford he said all that he did say during dinner at one period of the repast she was more than generally lively because she felt herself called upon to warn her husband that an attack of the gout was imminent and would be certainly produced instantaneously if he could not deny himself the delight of a certain diet which was going the round of the table his lordship smiled and denied himselfthinking as he did so whether another wife plus the gout would or would not have been better for him all this either amused colonel stubbs so sufficiently or else made him so thoughtful that he made no attempt to interfere with the curate in the evening there was again musicwhich resulted in a declaration made upstairs by sir harry to his wife that that wife of ruffords was a confounded bore we all knew that my dear as soon as he married her said lady albury  why did he marry a bore  because he wanted a wife to look after himself and not to amuse his friends the wonder used to be that he had done so well  not a word had there beennot a word since that sound of ayala had fallen upon her ears nohe was not handsome and his name was jonathan stubbsbut surely no voice so sweet had ever fallen from a mans lips so she sat and dreamed far into the night he the angel of light would certainly have a sweeter voice that was an attribute without which no angel could be angelic as to the face and the name that would not perhaps signify but he must have an intellect high soaring a soul tuned to music and a mind versed in nothing but great matters he might be an artist or more probably a poetor perhaps a musician yet she had read of poets artists and musicians who had misused their wives been fond of money and had perhaps been drunkards the angel of light must have the gifts and must certainly be without the vices  the next day was sunday and they all went to church in the afternoon they as many of them as pleased were to walk as far as gobblegoose wood which was only three miles from the house they could not hunt and therefore they must go to the very scene of the late contest and again discuss it there sir harry and the captain would walk and so would ayala and nina and some others lord rufford did not like walking and lady rufford would stay at home to console him ayala used her little wiles to keep herself in close company with nina but the colonels wiles were more effectiveand then perhaps nina assisted the colonel rather than ayala it came to pass that before they had left gobblegoose wood ayala and the colonel were together when it was so he did not beat about the bush for a moment longer he had fixed his opportunity for himself and he put it to use at once ayala he said am i to have any other answer  what answer  nay my dearestmy own own dearest as i fain would have youwho shall say what answer but you ayala you know that i love you  i thought you had given it up  given it up nevernever does a man give up his joythe pride of his lifethe one only delight on which his heart has set itself no my darling i have not given it up because you would not have it as i wished when i first spoke to you i have not gone on troubling you i thought i would wait till you were used again to the look of me and to my voice i shall never give it up ayala when you came into the room that night with your new frock on then he paused and she glanced round upon him and saw that a tear again was in his eye when you came in and curtseyed to sir harry i could hardly keep within myself because i thought you were so beautiful  it was the new gown which he had given me  no my petno you may add a grace to a dress but it can do but little for you it was the little motion the little word the light in your eye it twinkles at me sometimes when you glance about so that i do not know whether it is meant for me or not i fear that it is never meant for me  it is meant for nothing said ayala  and yet it goes into my very bosom when you were talking to that clergyman at dinner i could see every sparkle that came from it then i wonder to myself whether you can ever be thinking of me as i am always thinking of you she knew that she had been thinking of him every waking moment since she had been at albury and through many of her sleeping moments also ayala one little word one other glance from your eyes one slightest touch from your hand upon my arm shall tell meshall tell meshall tell me that i am the happiest the proudest man in all the world she walked on steadfastly closing her very teeth against a word with her eyes fixed before her so that no slightest glance should wander her two hands were in her little muff and she kept them with her fingers clasped together as though afraid lest one might rebel and fly away and touch the sleeve of his coat ayala how is it to be with me  i cannot she said sternly and her eyes were still fixed before her and her fingers were still bound in one with another and yet she loved him yet she knew that she loved him she could have hung upon his arm and smiled up into his face and frowned her refusal only with mock anger as he pressed her to his bosomonly that those dreams were so palpable to her and so dear had been to her so vast a portion of her young life i cannot she said again i cannot  is that to be your answer for ever to this she made no immediate reply must it be so ayala  i cannot she said but the last little word was so impeded by the sobs which she could not restrain as almost to be inaudible  i will not make you unhappy ayala yes she was unhappy she was unhappy because she knew that she could not rule herself to her own happiness because even at this moment she was aware that she was wrong if she could only release part of herself from the other then could she fly into his arms and tell him that that spirit which had troubled her had flown but the spirit was too strong for her and would not fly shall we go and join them he asked her in a voice altered but still so sweet to her ears  if you think so she replied  perhaps it will be best ayala do not be angry with me now i will not call you so again angry oh no she was not angry with him but it was very bitter to her to be told that she should never hear the word again from his lips  the hunted fox never went up buddlecombe hillnever if he did ill eat every fox in the rufford and ufford country this was heard spoken in most angry tones by captain glomax as the colonel and ayala joined the rest of the party     chapter li  no   ayala on her return from the walk to the wood spent the remainder of the afternoon in tears during the walk she kept close to sir harry pretending to listen to the arguments about the fox but she said nothing her ears were really intent on endeavouring to catch the tones of her lovers voice as he went on in front of them talking to nina nothing could be more pleasant than the sound as he said a word or two now and again encouraging nina in her rhapsodies as to lord george and all lord georges family but ayala learned nothing from that she had come to know the man well enough to be aware that he could tune his voice to the occasion and could hide his feelings let them be ever so strong she did not doubt his love now she did not doubt but that at this moment his heart was heavy with rejected love she quite believed in him but nevertheless his words were pleasant and kind as he encouraged nina  nor did she doubt her own love she was alone in her room that afternoon till she told herself at last the truth oh yes she loved him she was sure of that but now he was gone why had she been so foolish then it seemed as though at that moment the separation took place between herself and the spirit which had haunted her she seemed to know nownow at this very momentthat the man was too good for her the knowledge had been coming to her it had almost come when he had spoken to her in the wood if it could only have been that he should have delayed his appeal to her yet for another day or two she thought now that if he could have delayed it but for a few hours the cure would have been complete if he had talked to her as he so well knew how to talk while they were in the wood together while they were walking homeso as to have exorcised the spirit from her by the sweetness of his wordsand then have told her that there was his love to have if she chose to have it then she thought she would have taken it but he had come to her while those words which she had prepared under the guidance of the spirit were yet upon her tongue i cannot she had said i cannot but she had not told him that she did not love him  i did love him she said to herself almost acknowledging that the spirit had been wholly exorcised the fashion of her mind was altogether different from that which had so strongly prevailed with her he was an honest noble man high in the worlds repute clever a gentleman a man of taste and possessed of that gentle everpresent humour which was so inexpressibly delightful to her she never again spoke to herself even in her thoughts of that angel of lightnever comforted herself again with the vision of that which was to come there had appeared to her a man better than all other men and when he had asked her for her hand she had simply saidi cannot and yet she had loved him all the time how foolish how false how wicked she had been it was thus that she thought of it all as she sat there alone in her bedroom through the long hours of the afternoon when they sent up for her asking her to come down she begged that she might be allowed to remain there till dinnertime because she was tired with her walk  he would not come again now oh nohe was too proud too firm too manly for that it was not for such a one as he to come whining after a girllike her cousin tom would it be possible that she should even yet tell him could she say to him one little word contradicting that which she had so often uttered in the wood now i can once whispered in his ear would do it all but as to this she was aware that there was no room for hope to speak such a word low as it might be spoken simple and little as it might be was altogether impossible she had had her chance and had lost itbecause of those idle dreams that the dreams had been all idle she declared to herselfnot aware that the ayala whom her lover had loved would not have been an ayala to be loved by him but for the dreams now she must go back to her uncle and aunt and to kingsbury crescent with the added sorrow that the world of dreams was closed to her for ever when the maid came to her she consented to have the frock put on the frock which sir harry had given her boldly resolving to struggle through her sorrow till lady albury should have dismissed her to her home nobody would want her now at stalham and the dismissal would soon come  while she had been alone in her room the colonel had been closeted with lady albury they had at least been thus shut up together for some halfhour during which he had told his tale i have to own said he halflaughing as he began his tale that i thoroughly respect miss dormer  why is she to be called miss dormer  because she has shown herself worthy of my respect  what is it that you mean jonathan  she knew her own mind when she told me at first that she could not accept the offer which i did myself the honour of making her and now she sticks to her purpose i think that a young lady who will do that should be respected  she has refused you again  altogether  as how  well i hardly know that i am prepared to explain the as how even to you i am about as thickskinned a man in such matters as you may find anywhere but i do not know that even i can bring myself to tell the as how the as how was very clear in one respect it was manifest that she knew her own mind which is a knowledge not in the possession of all young ladies she told me that she could not marry me  i do not believe it  not that she told me so  not that she knew her own mind she is a little simple fool who with some vagary in her brain is throwing away utterly her own happiness while she is vexing you  as to the vexation you are right  crossgrained little idiot  an idiot she certainly is not and as to being crossgrained i have never found it a human being with the grains running more directly all in the same way i have never come across  do not talk to me jonathan like that she said when i call her crossgrained i mean that she is running counter to her own happiness  i cannot tell anything about that i should have endeavoured i think to make her happy she has certainly run counter to my happiness  and now  whatas to this very moment i shall leave stalham tomorrow  why should you do that let her go if one must go  that is just what i want to prevent why should she lose her little pleasure  you dont suppose that we can make the house happy to her now why should we care to do so when she will have driven you away he sat silent for a minute or two looking at the fire with his hands on his two knees you must acknowledge jonathan continued she that i have taken kindly to this ayala of yours  i do acknowledge it  but it cannot be that she should be the same to us simply as a young lady staying here as it were on her own behalf as she was when we regarded her as your possible wife then every little trick and grace belonging to her endeared itself to us because we regarded her as one who was about to become one of ourselves but what are her tricks and graces to us now  they are all the world to me said the colonel  but you must wipe them out of your memoryunless indeed you mean to ask her again  ahthat is it  you will ask her again  i do not say so but i do not wish to rob myself of the chance it may be that i shall of course i should tomorrow if i thought there was a hope tomorrow there would be nonebut i should like to know that i could find her again in hands so friendly as yours if at the end of a month i should think myself strong enough to encounter the risk of another refusal would sir harry allow her to remain here for another month  he would say probably nothing about it  my plan is this he continued let her remain here say for three weeks or a month do you continue all your kindness to herif not for her sake then for mine let her feel that she is made one of yourselves as you say  that will be hard said lady albury  it would not be hard if you thought that she was going to become so at last try it for my sake say not a word to her about methough not shunning my name be to her as though i had told you nothing of this then when the period is over i will come againif i find that i can do so if my love is still stronger than my sense of selfrespect i shall do so all this lady albury promised to do and then the interview between them was over  colonel stubbs is going to aldershot tomorrow said she to ayala in the drawingroom after dinner he finds now that he cannot very well remain away there was no hesitation in her voice as she said this and no look in her eye which taught ayala to suppose that she had heard anything of what had occurred in the wood  is he indeed said ayala trying but in vain to be equally undemonstrative  it is a great trouble to us but we are quite unable to prevent itunless you indeed can control him  i cannot control him said ayala with that fixed look of resolution with which lady albury had already become familiar  that evening before they went to bed the colonel bade them all goodbye as he intended to start early in the morning i never saw such a fellow as you are for sudden changes said sir harry  what is the good of staying here for hunting when the ground and tonys temper are both as hard as brickbats if i go now i can get another week further on in march if the rain should come with this sir harry seemed to be satisfied but ayala felt sure that tonys temper and the rain had had nothing to do with it  goodbye miss dormer he said with his pleasantest smile and his pleasantest voice  goodbye she repeated what would she not have given that her voice should be as pleasant as his and her smile but she failed so utterly that the little word was inaudiblealmost obliterated by the choking of a sob how bitterly severe had that word miss dormer sounded from his mouth could he not have called her ayala for the last timeeven though all the world should have heard it she was wide awake in the morning and heard the wheels of his cart as he was driven off as the sound died away upon her ear she felt that he was gone from her for ever how had it been that she had said i cannot so often when all her heart was set upon i can  and now it remained to her to take herself away from stalham as fast as she might she understood perfectly all those ideas which lady albury had expressed to her wellloved friend she was nothing to anybody at stalham simply a young lady staying in the houseas might be some young lady connected with them by blood or some young lady whose father and mother had been their friends she had been brought there to stalham now this second time in order that jonathan stubbs might take her as his wife driven by some madness she had refused her destiny and now nobody would want her at stalham any longer she had better begin to pack up at onceand go the coldness of the people now that she had refused to do as she had been asked would be unbearable to her and yet she must not let it appear that stalham was no longer dear to her merely because colonel stubbs had left it she would let a day go by and then say with all the ease she could muster that she would take her departure on the next after that her life before her would be a blank she had known up to thisso at least she told herselfthat jonathan stubbs would afford her at any rate another chance now there could be no other chance  the first blank day passed away and it seemed to her almost as though she had no right to speak to any one she was sure that lady rufford knew what had occurred because nothing more was said as to the proposed visit mrs colonel stubbs would have been welcome anywhere but who was ayala dormer even though lady albury bade her come out in the carriage it seemed to her to be done as a final effort of kindness of course they would be anxious to be rid of her that evening the buxom woman did not come to help her dress herself it was an accident the buxom woman was wanted here and there till it was too late and ayala had left her room ayala in truth required no assistance in dressing when the first agonizing moment of the new frock had been passed over she would sooner have arrayed herself without assistance but now it seemed as though the buxom woman was running away because she ayala was thought to be no longer worthy of her services  on the next morning she began her little speech to lady albury going away tomorrow said lady albury  or perhaps the next day suggested ayala  my dear it has been arranged that you should stay here for another three weeks  no  i say it was arranged everybody understood it i am sure your aunt understood it because one person goes everybody else isnt to follow so as to break up a party honour among thieves  thieves  wellanything else you like to call us all the party has been made up and to tell the truth i dont think that young ladies have the same right of changing their minds and rushing about as men assume young ladies ought to be more steady where am i to get another young lady at a moments notice to play lawn tennis with mr greene compose yourself and stay where you are like a good girl  what will sir harry say  sir harry will probably go on talking about the stillborough fox and quarreling with that odious captain glomax that is if you remain here if you go all of a sudden he will perhaps hint  hint what lady albury  never mind he shall make no hints if you are a good girl nothing was said at the moment about the colonelnothing further than the little allusion made above then there came the lawn tennis and ayala regained something of her spirits as she contrived with the assistance of sir harry to beat nina and the curate but on the following day lady albury spoke out more plainly it was because of colonel stubbs that you said that you would go away  ayala paused a moment and then answered stoutly yes it was because of colonel stubbs  and why  ayala paused again and the stoutness almost deserted her because  well my dear  i dont think i ought to be asked said ayala  well you shall not be asked i will not be cruel to you but do you not know that if i ask anything it is with a view to your own good  oh yes said ayala  but though i may not ask i suppose i may speak to this ayala made no reply either assenting or dissenting you know do you not that i and colonel stubbs love each other like brother and sistermore dearly than many brothers and sisters  i suppose so  and that therefore he tells me everything he told me what took place in the woodand because of that he has gone away  of course you are angry with mebecause he has gone away  i am sorry that he has gonebecause of the cause of it i always wish that he should have everything that he desires and now i wish that he should have this thing because he desires it above all other things does he desire it above all other thingsthought ayala to herself and if it be really so cannot i now tell her that he shall have it cannot i say that i too long to get it quite as eagerly as he longs to have it the suggestion rushed quickly to her mind but the answer to it came as quickly noshe would not do so no offer of the kind would come from her by what she had said must she abideunless indeed he should come to her again but why should you go ayala because he has gone why should you say aloud that you had come here to listen to his offer and that you had gone away as soon as you had resolved that for this reason or that it was not satisfactory to you  oh lady albury  that would be the conclusion drawn remain here with us and see if you can like us well enough to be one of us  dear lady albury i do love you dearly  what he may do i cannot say whether he may bring himself to try once again i do not knownor will i ask you whether there might possibly be any other answer were he to do so  no said ayala driven by a sudden fit of obstinacy which she could not control  i ask no questions about it but i am sure it will be better for you to remain here for a few weeks we will make you happy if we can and you can learn to think over what has passed without emotion thus it was decided that ayala should prolong her visit into the middle of march she could not understand her own conduct when she again found herself alone why had she ejaculated that sudden no when lady albury had suggested to her the possibility of changing her purpose she knew that she would fain change it if it were possible and yet when the idea was presented to her she replied with a sudden denial of its possibility but still there was hope even though the hope was faint whether he may bring himself to try again i do not know so it was that lady albury had spoken of him and of what lady albury said to her she now believed every word whether he could bring himself surely such a one as he would not condescend so far as that but if he did one word should be sufficient by no one else would she allow it to be thought for an instant that she would wish to reverse her decision it must still be no to any other person from whom such suggestion might come but should he give her the chance she would tell him instantly the truth of everything can i love you oh my love it is impossible that i should not love you it would be thus that the answer should be given to him should he allow her the chance of making it     chapter lii  i call it folly   three weeks passed by and ayala was still at stalham colonel stubbs had not as yet appeared and very little had been said about him sir henry would sometimes suggest that if he meant to see any more hunting he had better come at once but this was not addressed to ayala she made up her mind that he would not come and was sure that she was keeping him away by her presence he could notbring himself to try over again as lady albury had put it why should hebring himselfto do anything on behalf of one who had treated him so badly it had been settled that she should remain to the 25th of march when the month should be up from the time in which lady albury had decided upon that as the period of her visit of her secret she had given no slightest hint if he ever did come again it should not be because she had asked for his coming as far as she knew how to carry out such a purpose she concealed from lady albury anything like a feeling of regret and she was so far successful that lady albury thought it expedient to bring in other assistance to help her causeas will be seen by a letter which ayala received when the three weeks had passed by  in the meantime there had been at first dismay then wonder and lastly some amusement at the condition of captain batsby when captain batsby had first learned at merle park that ayala and jonathan stubbs were both at stalham he wrote very angrily to lady albury in answer to this his sisterinlaw had pleaded guiltybut still defending herself how could she make herself responsible for the young ladywho did not indeed seem ready to bestow her affections on any of her suitors but still she acknowledged that a little favour was being shown to colonel stubbswishing to train the man to the idea that in this special matter colonel stubbs must be recognised as the stalham favourite then no further letters were received from the captain but there came tidings that he was staying at merle park ayala heard continually from her sister and lucy sent some revelations as to the captain he seemed to be very much at home at merle park said lucy and then at last she expressed her own opinion that captain batsby and gertrude were becoming very fond of each other and yet the whole story of gertrude and mr houston was known of course to lucy and through lucy to ayala to ayala these sudden changes were very amusing as she certainly did not wish to retain her own hold on the captain and was not specially attached to her cousin gertrude from ayala the tidings went to lady albury and in this way the fears which had been entertained as to the captains displeasure were turned to wonder and amusement but up to this period nothing had been heard of the projected trip to ostend  then came the letter to ayala to which allusion has been made a letter from her old friend the marchesa who was now at rome it was ostensibly in answer to a letter from ayala herself but was written in great part in compliance with instructions received from lady albury it was as follows      dear ayala     i was glad to get your letter about nina she is very    happy and lord george is here indeed to tell the truth    they arrived togetherwhich was not at all proper but    everything will be made proper on tuesday 8th april    which is the day at last fixed for the wedding i wish you    could have been here to be one of the bridesmaids nina    says that you will have it that the pope is to marry her    instead of that it is going to be done by lord georges    uncle the dean of dorchester who is coming for this    purpose then they are going up to a villa they have    taken on como where we shall join them some time before    the spring is over after that they seem to have no    plansexcept plans of connubial bliss which is never to    know any interruption     now that i have come to connubial bliss and feel so    satisfied as to ninas prospects i have a word or two    to say about the bliss of somebody else nina is my own    child and of course comes first but one jonathan stubbs    is my nephew and is also very near to my heart from all    that i hear i fancy that he has set his mind also on    connubial bliss have you not heard that it is so     a bird has whispered to me that you have not been kind    to him why should it be so nobody knows better than i    do that a young lady is entitled to the custody of her    own heart and that she should not be compelled or even    persuaded to give her hand in opposition to her own    feelings if your feelings and your heart are altogether    opposed to the poor fellow of course there must be an end    of it but i had thought that from the time you first met    him he had been a favourite of yoursso much so that    there was a moment in which i feared that you might think    too much of the attentions of a man who has ever been a    favourite with all who have known him but i have found    that in this i was altogether mistaken when he came that    evening to see the last of you at the theatre taking as    i knew he did considerable trouble to release himself    from other engagements i was pretty sure how it was going    to be he is not a man to be in love with a girl for a    month and then to be in love with another the next month    when once he allowed himself to think that he was in    love the thing was done and fixed either for his great    delightor else to his great trouble     i knew how it was to be and so it has been am i not    right in saying that on two occasions at considerable    intervals he has come to you and made distinct offers of    his hand i fear though i do not actually know it that    you have just as distinctly rejected those offers i do    not know it because none but you and he can know the    exact words with which you received from him the tender    of all that he had to give you i can easily believe that    he with all his intelligence might be deceived by the    feminine reserve and coyness of such a girl as you if it    be so i do pray that no folly may be allowed to interfere    with his happiness and with yours     i call it folly not because i am adverse to feminine    reserve not because i am prone to quarrel even with what    i call coyness but because i know his nature so well and    feel that he would not bear rebuffs of which many another    man would think nothing that he would not bring himself    to ask again perhaps even for a seventh time as they    might do and if it be that by some frequent asking his    happiness and yours could be insured would it not be    folly that such happiness should be marred by childish    disinclination on your part to tell the truth     as i said before if your heart be set against him there    must be an end of it i can understand that a girl so    young as you should fail to see the great merit of such a    man i therefore write as i do thinking it possible that    in this respect you may be willing to accept from my mouth    something as to the man which shall be regarded as truth    it is on the inner man on his nature and disposition    that the happiness of a wife must depend a more noble    nature a more truthful spirit than his i have never    met he is one on whom in every phase of life you may    dependor i may dependas on a rock he is one without    vacillation always steady to his purpose requiring from    himself in the way of duty and conduct infinitely more    than he demands from those around him if ever there was    a man altogether manly he is one and yet no woman no    angel ever held a heart more tender within his bosom see    him with children think of his words when he has spoken    to yourself remember the estimation in which those    friends hold him who know him bestsuch as i and your    friend lady albury and sir harry and his cousin nina    i could name many others but these are those with whom    you have seen him most frequently if you can love such a    man do you not think that he would make you happy and    if you cannot must there not be something wrong in your    heartunless indeed it be already predisposed to some    one else think of all this dear ayala and remember that    i am always     your affectionate friend     julia baldoni   ayalas first feeling as she read the letter was a conviction that her friend had altogether wasted her labour in writing it of what use was it to tell her of the mans virtuesto tell her that the mans heart was as tender as an angels his truth as assured as a gods his courage that of a herothat he was possessed of all those attributes which should by right belong to an angel of light she knew all that without requiring the evidence of a lady from romehaving no need of any evidence on that matter from any other human being of what use could any evidence be on such a subject from the most truthful lips that ever spoke had she not found it all out herself would any words from others have prevailed with her but she had found it out herself it was already her gospel that he was tender and true manly heroicas brightly angelic as could be any angel of lightwas already an absolute fact to her noher heart had never been predisposed to any one else it was of him she had always dreamed even long before she had seen him he was the man perfect in all good things who was to come and take her with himif ever man should come and take her she wanted no marchesa baldoni now to tell her that the angel had in truth come and realised himself before her in all his glory  but she had shown herself to be utterly unfit for the angel though she recognised him now she had not recognised him in timeand even when she had recognised him she had been driven by her madness to reject him feminine reserve and coyness folly yes indeed she knew all that too without need of telling from her elders the kind of coyness which she had displayed had been the very infatuation of feminine imbecility it was because nature had made her utterly unfit for such a destiny that she had been driven by coyness and feminine reserve to destroy herself it was thus that ayala conversed with herself  i know his nature so well and feel that he would not bear rebuffs of which many another man would think nothing thus she did not doubt the marchesa had spoken very truly but of what value was all that now she could not recall the rebuff she could not now eradicate the cowardice which had made her repeat those wicked fatal wordsi cannot i cannot i cannot the letter had come too late for there was nothing she could do to amend her doom she must send some answer to her friend in italy but there could be nothing in her answer to her to assist her the feminine reserve and coyness had become odious to heras it had been displayed by herself to him but it still remained in full force as to any assistance from others she could not tell another to send him back to her she could not implore help in her trouble if he would come himselfhimself of his own accordhimself impelled once more by his great tenderness of hearthimself once more from his real real love then there should be no more coyness if you will still have meoh yes  but there was the letter to be written she so wrote it that by far the greater part of itthe larger part at leasthad reference to nina and her wedding i will think of her on the 8th of april she said i shall then be at home at kingsbury crescent and i shall have nothing else to think of in that was her first allusion to her own condition with her lover but on the last side of the sheet it was necessary that she should say more than that something must be said thoughtfully carefully and gratefully in reply to so much thought and care and friendship as had been shown to her but it must be so written that nothing of her secret should be read in it the task was so troublesome that she was compelled to recopy the whole of her long letter because the sentences as first written did not please her i am so much obliged to you she said by your kindness about colonel stubbs he did do me the honour of asking me to be his wife and i felt it so you are not to suppose that i did not understand that it is all over now and i cannot explain to you why i felt that it would not do it is all over and therefore writing about it is no good only i want you to be sure of two thingsthat there is no one else and that i do love you so much for all your kindness and you may be sure of a third thing toothat it is all over i do hope that he will still let me be his friend as a friend i have always liked him so much it was brave and bold she thought in answer to such words as the marchesas but she did not know how to do it any better  on tuesday the 25th of march she was to return to kingsbury crescent various little words were said at stalham indicating an intended break in the arrangement the captain certainly wont come now said lady albury alluding to the arrangement as though it had been made solely with the view of saving ayala from an encounter with her objectionable lover croppy has come back said sir harry one daycroppy being the pony which ayala had ridden miss dormer can have him now for what little there is left of the hunting this was said on the saturday before she was to go how could she ride croppy for the rest of the hunting when she would be at kingsbury crescent on neither of these occasions did she say a word but she assumed that little look of contradiction which her friends at stalham already knew how to read then on the sunday morning there came a letter for lady albury what does he say asked sir harry at breakfast ill show it you before you go to church answered his wife then ayala knew that the letter was from colonel stubbs  but she did not expect that the letter should be shown herwhich however came to be the case when she was in the library waiting to start to church lady albury came in and threw the letter to her across the table that concerns you she said you had better read it there was another lady in the room also waiting to start on their walk across the park and therefore it was natural that nothing else should be said at the moment ayala read the letter returned it to the envelope and then handed it back to lady alburyso that there was no word spoken about it before church the letter which was very short was as follows  i shall be at stalham by the afternoon train on sunday 30thin time for dinner if you will send the dogcart i could not leave this most exigeant of all places this week i suppose albury will go on in the woodlands for a week or ten days in april and i must put up with that i hear that batsby is altogether fixed by the fascinations of merle park i hope that you and albury will receive consolation in the money then there was a postscript if croppy can be got back again miss dormer might see me tumble into another river  it was evident that lady albury did not expect anything to be said at present she put the letter into her pocket and there for the moment was the end of it it may be feared that ayalas attention was not fixed that morning so closely as it should have been on the services of the church there was so much in that little letter which insisted upon having all her attention had there been no postscript the letter would have been very different in that case the body of the letter itself would have intended to have no reference to heror rather it would have had a reference altogether opposite to that which the postscript gave it in that case it would have been manifest to her that he had intentionally postponed his coming till she had left stalham then his suggestion about the hunting would have had no interest for her everything would have been over she would have been at kingsbury crescent and he would have been at stalham but the postscript declared his intention of finding her still in the old quarters she would not be thereas she declared to herself after this there would be but one other day and then she would be gone but even this allusion to her and to the pony made the letter something to her of intense interest had it not been so lady albury would not have shown it to her as it was why had lady albury shown it to her in that quiet placid friendly wayas though it were natural that any letter from colonel stubbs to stalham should be shown to her  at lunch sir harry began about the pony at once miss dormer he said the pony will hardly be fit tomorrow and the distances during the rest of the week are all too great for you you had better wait till monday week when stubbs will be here to look after you  but i am going home on tuesday said ayala  ive had the pony brought on purpose for you said sir harry  you are not going at all said lady albury all that has to be altered ill write to mrs dosett  i dont think began ayala  i shall take it very much amiss said sir harry if you go now stubbs is coming on purpose  i dont think began ayala again  my dear ayala it isnt a case for thinking said lady albury you most positively will not leave this house till some day in april which will have to be settled hereafter do not let us have a word more about it then on that immediate occasion no further word about it was spoken ayala was quite unable to speak as she sat attempting to eat her lunch     chapter liii  how lucys affairs arranged themselves   we must go again to merle park where the tringle family was still livingand from which gertrude had not as yet been violently abducted at the period to which the reader has been brought in the relation which has been given of the affairs at stalham jonathan stubbss little note to lady albury was received on sunday 23rd march and gertrude was not abducted till the 29th on sunday the 30th she was brought backnot in great triumph at that time the house was considerably perturbed sir thomas was very angry with his daughter augusta having been led to believe that she had been privy to gertrudes escapadeso angry that very violent words had been spoken as to her expulsion from the house tom also was ill absolutely ill in bed with a doctor to see himand all from love declaring that he would throw himself over the ships side and drown himself while there was yet a chance left to him for ayala and in the midst of this lady tringle herself was by no means exempt from the paternal wrath she was told that she must have known what was going on between her daughter and that idiot captainthat she encouraged the trafficks to remainthat she coddled up her son till he was sick from sheer lackadaisical idleness the only one in the house who seemed to be exempt from the wrath of sir thomas was lucyand therefore it was upon lucys head that fell the concentrated energy of aunt emmelines revenge when captain batsby was spoken of with contumely in the light of a husbandthis being always done by sir thomaslady tringle would make her rejoinder to this when sir thomas had turned his back by saying that a captain in her majestys army with good blood in his veins and a competent fortune was at any rate better than a poor artist who had so to say no blood and was unable to earn his bread and when tom was ridiculed for his love for ayala she would go on to explainalways after sir thomass back had been turnedthat poor tom had been encouraged by his father whereas lucy had taken upon herself to engage herself in opposition to her pastors and masters and then came the climax it was all very well to say that augusta was intrudingbut there were people who intruded much worse than augusta without half so much right when this was said the poor sorehearted woman felt her own cruelty and endeavoured to withdraw the harsh words but the wound had been given and the venom rankled so bitterly that lucy could no longer bear her existence among the tringles i ought not to remain after that she wrote to her lover though i went into the poorhouse i ought not to remain  i wrote to mr hamel she said to her aunt and told him that as you did not like my being here i had betterbetter go away  but where are you to go and i didnt say that i didnt like you being here you oughtnt to take me up in that way  i do feel that i am in the way aunt and i think that i had better go  but where are you to go i declare that everybody says everything to break my heart of course you are to remain here till he has got a house to keep you in but the letter had gone and a reply had come telling lucy that whatever might be the poorhouse to which she would be destined he would be there to share it with her  hamel wrote this with high heart he had already resolved previous to this that he would at once prepare a home for his coming bride though he was sore distressed by the emergency of his position his father had become more and more bitter with him as he learned that his son would in no respect be guided by him there was a sum of money which he now declared to be due to him and which isadore acknowledged to have been lent to him of this the father demanded repayment if said he you acknowledge anything of the obedience of a son that money is at your disposaland any other that you may want but if you determine to be as free from my control and as deaf to my advice as might be any other young man then you must be to me as might be any other young man he had written to his father saying that the money should be repaid as soon as possible the misfortune had come to him at a trying time it was however before he had received lucys last account of her own misery at merle park so that when that was received he was in part prepared  our colonel in writing to lady albury had declared aldershot to be a most exigeant placeby which he had intended to imply that his professional cares were too heavy to allow his frequent absence but nevertheless he would contrive occasionally to fly up to london for a little relief once when doing so he had found himself sitting in the sculptors studio and there listening to hamels account of lucys troubles at merle park hamel said nothing as to his own difficulties but was very eager in explaining the necessity of removing lucy from the tyranny to which she was subjected it will perhaps be remembered that hamel down in scotland had declared to his friend his purpose of asking lucy dormer to be his wife and also the success of his enterprise after he had gone across the lake to glenbogie it will be borne in mind also that should the colonel succeed in winning ayala to his way of thinking the two men would become the husbands of the two sisters each fully sympathised with the other and in this way they had become sincere and intimate friends  is she like her sister asked the colonel who was not as yet acquainted with lucy  hardly like her although in truth there is a family likeness lucy is taller with perhaps more regular features and certainly more quiet in her manner  ayala can be very quiet too said the lover  oh yesbecause she varies in her moods i remember her almost as a child when she would remain perfectly still for a quarter of an hour and then would be up and about the house everywhere glancing about like a ray of the sun reflected from a mirror as you move it in your hand  she has grown steadier since that said the colonel  i cannot imagine her to be steadynot as lucy is steady lucy if it be necessary can sit and fill herself with her own thoughts for the hour together  which of them was most like their father  they were both of them like him in their thorough love for things beautifulbut they are both of them unlike him in this that he was selfindulgent while they like women in general are always devoting themselves to others she will not devote herself to me thought jonathan stubbs to himself but that may be because like her father she loves things beautiful my poor lucy continued hamel would fain devote herself to those around her if they would only permit it  she would probably prefer devoting herself to you said the colonel  no doubt she wouldif it were expedient if i may presume that she loves me i may presume also that she would wish to live with me  is it not expedient asked the other  it will be so i trust before long  but it seems to be so necessary just at present to this the sculptor at the moment made no reply if continued stubbs they treat her among them as you say she ought at any rate to be relieved from her misery  she ought to be relieved certainly she shall be relieved  but you say that it is not expedient  i only meant that there were difficultiesdifficulties which will have to be got over i think that all difficulties are got over when a man looks at them steadily  this i suppose is an affair of money  well yes all difficulties seem to me to be an affair of money a man of course would wish to earn enough before he marries to make his wife comfortable i would struggle on as i am and not be impatient were it not that i fear she is more uncomfortable as she is now than she would be here in the midst of my poverty  after all hamel what is the extent of the poverty what are the real circumstances as you have gone so far you might as well tell me everything then after considerable pressure the sculptor did tell him everything there was an income of less than three hundred a yearwhich would probably become about four within the next twelvemonth there were no funds prepared with which to buy the necessary furniture for the incoming of a wife and there was that debt demanded by his father  must that be paid asked the colonel  i would starve rather than not pay it said hamel if i alone were to be considered it would certainly be paid within the next six months if i were alone even though i should starve  then his friend told him that the debt should be paid at once it amounted to but little more than a hundred pounds and then of course the conversation was carried further when a friend inquires as to the pecuniary distresses of a friend he feels himself as a matter of course bound to relieve him he would supply also the means necessary for the incoming of the young wife with much energy and for a long time hamel refused to accept the assistance offered to him but the colonel insisted in the first place on what he considered to be due from himself to ayalas sister and then on the fact that he doubted not in the least the ultimate success which would attend the professional industry of his friend and so before the day was over it was settled among them the money was to be forthcoming at once so that the debt might be paid and the preparations made and hamel was to write to lucy and declare that he should be ready to receive her as soon as arrangements should be made for their immediate marriage then came the further outragethat cruel speech as to intruders and lucy wrote to her lover owning that it would be well for her that she should be relieved  the news was of course declared to the family at merle park i never knew anything so hard said aunt emmeline of course you have told him that it was all my fault when lucy made no answer to this she went on with her complaint i know that you have told him that i have turned you outwhich is not true  i told him it was better i should go as you did not like my being here  i suppose lucy was in a little hurry to have the marriage come off said augustawho would surely have spared her cousin if at the moment she had remembered the haste which had been displayed by her sister  i thought it best said lucy  im sure i dont know how it is to be done said aunt emmeline you must tell your uncle yourself i dont know how you are to be married from here seeing the trouble we are in  we shall be up in london before that said gertrude  or from queens gate either continued aunt emmeline  i dont suppose that will much signify i shall just go to the church  like a servantmaid asked gertrude  yeslike a servantmaid said lucy that is to say a servantmaid would i suppose simply walk in and be married and i shall do the same  i think you had better tell your uncle said aunt emmeline but i am sure i did not mean that you were to go away like this it will be your own doing and i cannot help it if you will do it  then lucy did tell her uncle and you mean to live upon three hundred a year exclaimed sir thomas you dont know what you are talking about  i think mr hamel knows  he is as ignorant as a babe unborni mean about that kind of thing i dont doubt he can make things in stone as well as anybody  in marble uncle tom  marble is stone i supposeor in iron  bronze uncle tom  very well there is iron in bronze i suppose but he doesnt know what a wife will cost has he bought any furniture  he is going to buy itjust a littlewhat will do  why should you want to bring him into this lucy looked wistfully up into his face he himself had been personally kind to her and she found it to be impossible to complain to him of her aunt you are not happy here  my aunt and cousins think that i am wrong but i must be married to him now uncle tom  why did he kick up his heels when i wanted to help him nevertheless he gave his orders on the subject very much in lucys favour she was to be married from queens gate and gertrude must be her bridesmaid ayala no doubt would be the other when his wife expostulated he consented that the marriage should be very quiet but still he would have it as he had said then he bestowed a cheque upon lucylarger in amount than stubbss loansaying that after what had passed in lombard street he would not venture to send money to so independent a person as mr isadore hamel but adding that lucy perhaps would condescend to accept it there was a smile in his eye as he said the otherwise illnatured word so that lucy without any wound to her feelings could kiss him and accept his bounty  i suppose i am to have nothing to do in settling the day said aunt emmeline it was however settled between them that the marriage should take place on a certain day in may upon this lucy was of course overjoyed and wrote to her lover in a full flow of spirits and she sent him the cheque having written her name with great pride on the back of it there was a little trouble about this as a part of it had to come back as her trousseau but still the arrangement was pleasantly made then sir thomas again became more kind to her in his rough mannereven when his troubles were at the worst after the return of gertrude if it will not be altogether oppressive to his pride you may tell him that i shall make you an allowance of a hundred a year as my niecejust for your personal expenses  i dont know that he is so proud uncle tom  he seemed so to me but if you say nothing to him about it and just buy a few gowns now and again he will perhaps be so wrapt up in the higher affairs of his art as not to take any notice  i am sure he will notice what i wear said lucy however she communicated her uncles intentions to her lover and he sent back his grateful thanks to sir thomas as one effect of all this the colonels money was sent back to him with an assurance that as things were now settling themselves such pecuniary assistance was not needed but this was not done till ayala had heard what the angel of light had done on her sisters behalf but as to ayalas feelings in that respect we must be silent here as otherwise we should make premature allusion to the condition in which ayala found herself before she had at last managed to escape from stalham park  papa said gertrude to her father one evening dont you think you could do something for me too now just at this time sir thomas greatly to his own annoyance was coming down to merle park every evening according to their plans as at present arranged they were to stay in the country till after easter and then they were to go up to town in time to despatch poor tom upon his long journey round the world but poor tom was now in bed apparently ill and there seemed to be great doubt whether he could be made to go on the appointed day in spite of the taking of his berth and the preparation of his outfit tom if well enough was to sail on the nineteenth of april and there now wanted not above ten days to that time dont you think you could do something for me now asked gertrude hitherto sir thomas had extended no sign of pardon to his youngest daughter and never failed to allude to her and to captain batsby as those two idiots whenever their names were mentioned before him  yes my dear i will endeavour to do a good deal for you if you will behave yourself  what do you call behaving myself papa  in the first place telling me that you are very sorry for your misbehaviour with that idiot  of course i am sorry if i have offended you  well that shall go for something but how about the idiot  papa she exclaimed  was he not an idiot would any one but an idiot have gone on such an errand as that  gentlemen and ladies have done it before papa  i doubt it he said gentlemen have run away with young ladies before and generally have behaved very badly when they have done so he behaved very badly indeed because he had come to my house with my sanction with the express purpose of expressing his affection for another young lady but i think that his folly in this special running away was worse even than his conduct how did he come to think that he could get himself married merely by crossing over the sea to ostend i should be utterly ashamed of him as a soninlawchiefly because he has shown himself to be an idiot  but papa you will accept him wont you  no my dear i will not  not though i love him  if i were to give you a choice which you would take him or mr houston  houston is a scoundrel  very likely but then he is not an idiot my choice would be altogether in favour of mr houston shall i tell you what i will do my dear i will consent to accept captain batsby as my soninlaw if he will consent to become your husband without having a shilling with you  would that be kind papa  i do not think that i can show you any greater kindness than to protect you from a man who i am quite sure does not care a farthing about you he has you tell me an ample income of his own  oh yes papa  then he can afford to marry you without a fortune poor mr houston could not have done so because he had nothing of his own i declare as i think of it all i am becoming very tenderhearted towards mr houston dont you think we had better have mr houston back again i suppose he would come if you were to send for him then she burst into tears and went away and hid herself     chapter liv  toms last attempt   while gertrude was still away on her illomened voyage in quest of a parson lady tringle was stirred up to a great enterprise on behalf of her unhappy son there wanted now little more than a fortnight before the starting of the ship which his father still declared should carry him out across the world and he had progressed so far in contemplating the matter as to own to himself that it would be best for him to obey his father if there was no hope but his mind was still swayed by a theory of love and constancy he had heard of men who had succeeded after a dozen times of asking if stubbs the hated but generous stubbs were in truth a successful rival then indeed the thing would be overthen he would go the sooner the better and as he told his mother halfadozen times a day it would matter nothing to him whether he were sent to japan or the rocky mountains or the north pole in such case he would be quite content to go if only for the sake of going but how was he to be sure he was indeed nearly sure in the other direction if ayala were in truth engaged to colonel stubbs it would certainly be known through lucy then he had heard through lucy that though ayala was staying at stalham the colonel was not there he had gone and ayala had remained week after week without him then towards the end of march he wrote a letter to his uncle reginald which was very piteous in its tone  dear uncle reginald the letter said      i dont know whether you have heard of it but i have    been very illand unhappy i am now in bed and nobody    here knows that i am sending this letter to you it is    all about ayala and i am not such a fool as to suppose    that you can do anything for me if you could i think    you wouldbut of course you cant she must choose for    herselfonly i do so wish that she should choose me    nobody would ever be more kind to her but you can tell    me really how it is is she engaged to marry colonel    stubbs i know that she refused him because he told me    so himself if she is not engaged to him i think that    i would have another shy at it you know what the poet    saysfaint heart never won fair lady do tell me if    she is or is not engaged i know that she is with those    alburys and that colonel stubbs is their friend but    they cant make her marry colonel stubbs any more than my    friends can make her marry me i wish they could i mean    my friends not his     if she were really engaged i would go away and hide myself    in the furthermost corner of the world siberia or central    africa would be the same to me they would have little    trouble in getting rid of me if i knew that it was all    over with me but i will never stir from these realms till    i know my fatetherefore waiting your reply i am your    affectionate nephew     thomas tringle junior   mr dosett when he received this letter consulted his wife before he replied to it and then did so very shortly      my dear tom     as far as i know or her aunt your cousin ayala is not    engaged to marry any one but i should deceive you if i    did not add my belief that she is resolved not to accept    the offer you have done her the honour to make her     your affectionate uncle     reginald dosett   the latter portion of this paragraph had no influence whatsoever on tom did he not know all that before had he ever attempted to conceal from his relations the fact that ayala had refused him again and again was not that as notorious to the world at large as a ministers promise that the incometax should be abolished but the incometax was not abolishedand as yet ayala was not married to any one else ayala was not even engaged to any other suitor why should she not change her mind as well as the minister certainly he would not go either to the north pole or to new york as long as there should be a hope of bliss for him in england then he called his mother to his bedside  go to stalham my dear said his mother  why not they cant eat you lady albury is no more than a baronets wifejust the same as you  it isnt about eating me tom i shouldnt know what to say to them  you need not tell them anything say that you had come to call upon your niece  but it would be such an odd thing to do i never do call on ayalaeven when i am in london  what does it matter being odd you could learn the truth at any rate if she does not care for any one else why shouldnt she have me i could make her a baronets wifethat is some day when the governor  dont tomdont talk in that way  i only mean in the course of nature sons do come after their fathers you know and as for money i suppose the governor is quite as rich as those alburys  i dont think that would matter  it does count mother i suppose ayala is the same as other girls in that respect i am sure i dont know why it is that she should have taken such an aversion to me i suppose it is that she doesnt think me so muchquite such a swell as some other men  one cant account for such things tom  nothat is just it and therefore she might come round without accounting for it at any rate you might try you might tell her that it is ruining methat i shall have to go about wandering over all the world because she is so hardhearted  i dont think i could my dear said lady tringle after considering the matter for a while  why not is it because of the trouble  no my dear a mother does not think what trouble she may take for her child if any good may be done it is not the trouble i would walk all round england to get her for you if that would do it  why not then at any rate you might get an answer from her she would tell you something of her intention mother i shall never go away till i know more about it than i do now the governor says that he will turn me out let him turn me out that wont make me go away  oh tom he doesnt mean it  but he says it if i knew that it was all overthat every chance was gone then i would go away  it is not the alburys that i am afraid of said lady tringle  what then  it is your father i cannot go if he will not let me nevertheless she promised before she left his bedside that she would ask sir thomas when he came home whether he would permit her to make the journey all this occurred while sir thomas was away in quest of his daughter and it may be imagined that immediately after his return he was hardly in a humour to yield to any such request as that which had been suggested he was for the moment almost sick of his children sick of merle park sick of his wife and inclined to think that the only comfort to be found in the world was to be had among his millions in that little back parlour in lombard street  it was on a sunday that he returned and on that day he did not see his son on the monday morning he went into the room and tom was about to press upon him the prayer which he had addressed to his mother when his lips were closed by his fathers harshness tom he said you will be pleased to remember that you start on the nineteenth  but father  you start on the nineteenth said sir thomas then he left the room closing the door behind him with none of the tenderness generally accorded to an invalid  you have not asked him tom said to his mother shortly afterwards  not yet my dear his mind is so disturbed by this unfortunate affair  and is not my mind disturbed you may tell him that i will not go though he should turn me out a dozen times unless i know more about it than i do now  sir thomas came home again that evening very sour in temper and nothing could be said to him he was angry with everybody and lady tringle hardly dared to go near him either then or on the following morning on the tuesday evening however he returned somewhat softened in his demeanour the millions had perhaps gone right though his children would go so wrong when he spoke either to his younger daughter or of her he did so in that jeering tone which he afterwards always assumed when allusion was made to captain batsby and which disagreeable as it was seemed to imply something of forgiveness and he ate his dinner and drank his glass of wine without making any allusion to the parsimonious habits of his soninlaw mr traffick lady tringle therefore considered that she might approach him with toms request  you go to stalham he exclaimed  well my dear i suppose i could see her  and what could you learn from her  i dont suppose i could learn much she was always a pigheaded stiffnecked creature i am sure it wouldnt be any pleasure to me to see her  what good would it do demanded sir thomas  well my dear he says that he wont go unless he can get a message from her i am sure i dont want to go to stalham nothing on earth could be so disagreeable but perhaps i could bring back a word or two which would make him go upon his journey  what sort of word  whyif i were to say that she were engaged to this colonel stubbs then he would go he says that he would start at once if he knew that his cousin were really engaged to somebody else  but if she be not  perhaps i could just colour it a little it would be such a grand thing to get him away and he in this miserable condition if he were once on his travels i do think he would soon begin to forget it all  of course he would said sir thomas  then i might as well try he has set his heart upon it and if he thinks that i have done his bidding then he will obey you as for turning him out tom of course you do not really mean that  in answer to this sir thomas said nothing he knew well enough that tom couldnt be turned out that turning out of a son is a difficult task to accomplish and one altogether beyond the power of sir thomas the chief cause of his sorrow lay in the fact that he as the head of travers and treason was debarred from the assistance and companionship of his son all travers and treason was nothing to him because his son would run so far away from the right path there was nothing he would not do to bring him back if ayala could have been bought by any reasonable or even unreasonable amount of thousands he would have bought her willingly for his boys delight it was a thing wonderful to him that tom should have been upset so absolutely by his love he did appreciate the feeling so far that he was willing to condone all those follies already committed if tom would only put himself in the way of recovery that massacreing of the policeman those illspent nights at the mountaineers and at bolivias that foolish challenge and the almost more foolish blow under the portico at the haymarket should all be forgiven if tom would only consent to go through some slight purgation which would again fit him for travers and treason and the purgation should be made as pleasant as possible he should travel about the world with his pocket full of money and with every arrangement for luxurious comfort only he must go there was no other way in which he could be so purged as to be again fit for travers and treason he did not at all believe that ayala could now be purchased whether pigheaded or not ayala was certainly selfwilled no good such as tom expected would come from this projected visit to stalham but if he would allow it to be made in obedience to toms requestthen perhaps some tidings might be brought back which whether strictly true or not might induce tom to allow himself to be put on board the ship arguing thus with himself sir thomas at last gave his consent  it was a most disagreeable task which the mother thus undertook she could not go from merle park to stalham and back in one day it was necessary that she should sleep two nights in london it was arranged therefore that she should go up to london on the thursday then make her journey down to stalham and back on the friday and get home on the saturday there would then still remain nearly a fortnight before tom would have to leave merle park after much consideration it was decided that a note should be written to ayala apprising her of her aunts coming i hope lady albury will not be surprised at my visit said the note but i am so anxious to see you just for halfanhour upon a matter of great importance that i shall run my chance she would prefer to have seen the girl without any notice but then had no notice been given the girl would perhaps have been out of the way as it was a telegram was received back in reply i shall be at home lady albury will be very glad to see you at lunch she says there shall be a room all ready if you will sleep  i certainly shall not stay there lady tringle said to mrs traffick but it is as well to know that they will be civil to me  they are stuckup sort of people i believe said augusta just like that marchesa baldoni who is one of them but as to their being civil that is a matter of course they would hardly be uncivil to any one connected with lord boardotrade  then came the thursday on which the journey was to be commenced as the moment came near lady tringle was very much afraid of the task before her she was afraid even of her niece ayala who had assumed increased proportions in her eyes since she had persistently refused not only tom but also colonel stubbs and captain batsby and then in spite of her own connexion with lord boardotradeof whom since her daughters marriage she had learned to think less than she had done beforeshe did feel that the alburys were fashionable people and that ayala as their guest had achieved something for herself stalham was no doubt superior in general estimation to merle park and with her there had been always a certain awe of ayala which she had not felt in reference to lucy ayalas demand that augusta should go upstairs and fetch the scrapbook had had its effectas had also her success in going up st peters and to the marchesas dance and then there would be lady albury herselfand all the alburys only that tom was very anxious she would even now have abandoned the undertaking  mother said tom on the last morning you will do the best you can for me  oh yes my dear  i do think that if you would make her understand the real truth she might have me yet she wouldnt like that a fellow should die  i am afraid that she is hardhearted tom  i do not believe it mother i have seen her when she wouldnt kill even a fly if she could only be made to see all the good she could do  i am afraid she wont care for that unless she can bring herself really to love you  why shouldnt she love me  ah my boy how am i to tell you perhaps if you hadnt loved her so well it might have been different if you had scorned her  scorn her i couldnt scorn her i have heard of that kind of thing before but how is one to help oneself you cant scorn a friend just because you choose to say so to yourself when i see her she is something so precious to me that i could not be rough to her to save my life when she first came it wasnt so i could laugh at her then but now they talk about goddesses but i am sure she is a goddess to me  if you had made no more than a woman of her it might have been better tom all that was too late now the doctrine which lady tringle was enunciating to her son and which he repudiated is one that has been often preached and never practised a man when he is conscious of the presence of a mere woman to whom he feels that no worship is due may for his own purpose be able to tell a lie to her and make her believe that he acknowledges a divinity in her presence but when he feels the goddess he cannot carry himself before her as though she were a mere woman and as such inferior to himself in her attributes poor tom had felt the touch of something divine and had fallen immediately prostrate before the shrine with his face to the ground his chance with ayala could in no circumstances have been great but she was certainly not one to have yielded to a prostrate worshipper  mother said tom recalling lady tringle as she was leaving the room  what is it my dear i must really go now or i shall be too late for the train  mother tell her tell hertell her that i love her his mother ran back kissed his brow and then left the room  lady tringle spent that evening in queens gate where sir thomas remained with her the hours passed heavily as they had not much present to their mind with which to console each other sir thomas had no belief whatever in the journey except in so far as it might help to induce his son to proceed upon his travelsbut his wife had been so far softened by poor toms sorrows as to hope a little in spite of her judgment that ayala might yet relent her heart was soft towards her son so that she felt that the girl would deserve all manner of punishment unless she would at last yield to toms wishes she was all but sure that it could not be so and yet in spite of her convictions she hoped  on the next morning the train took her safely to the stalham road station and as she approached the end of her journey her heart became heavier within her she felt that she could not but fail to give any excuse to the alburys for such a journeyunless indeed ayala should do as she would have her at the station she found the albury carriage with the albury coachman and the albury footman and the albury liveries waiting for her it was a closed carriage and for a moment she thought that ayala might be there in that case she could have performed her commission in the carriage and then have returned to london without going to the house at all but ayala was not there lady tringle was driven up to the house and then taken through the hall into a small sittingroom where for a moment she was alone then the door opened and ayala radiant with beauty in all the prettiness of her best morning costume was in a moment in her arms she seemed in her brightness to be different from that ayala who had been known before at glenbogie and in rome dear aunt said ayala i am so delighted to see you at stalham     chapter lv  in the castle there lived a knight   ayala was compelled to consent to remain at stalham the i dont think which she repeated so often was of course of no avail to her sir harry would be angry and lady albury would be disgusted were she to goand so she remained there was to be a week before colonel stubbs would come and she was to remain not only for the week but also for some short time afterwardsso that there might be yet a few days left of hunting under the colonel it could not surely have been doubtful to her after she had read that letterwith the postscriptthat if she remained her happiness would be insured he would not have come again and insisted on her being there to receive him if nothing were to come of it and yet she had fought for permission to return to kingsbury crescent after her little fashion and had at last yielded as she told lady alburybecause sir harry seemed to wish it of course he wishes it said lady albury he has got the pony on purpose and nobody likes being disappointed when he has done a thing so much as sir harry ayala delighted as she was did not make her secret known she was fluttered and apparently uneasyso that her friend did not know what to make of it or which way to take it ayalas secret was to herself a secret still to be maintained with holy reticence it might still be possible that jonathan stubbs should never say another word to her of his love if he didwhy then all the world might know then there would be no secret then she could sit and discuss her love and his love all night long with lady albury if lady albury would listen to her in the meantime the secret must be a secret to confess her love and then to have her love disappointedthat would be death to her  and thus it went on through the whole week lady albury not quite knowing what to make of it once she did say a word thinking that she would thus extract the truth not as yet understanding how potent ayala could be to keep her secret that man has at any rate been very true to you she said ayala frowned and shook her head and would not say a word upon the subject if she did not mean to take him now surely she would have gone lady albury said to her husband  she is a pretty little girl enough said sir harry but i doubt whether she is worth all the trouble  of course she is not what pretty little girl ever was but as long as he thinks her worth it the trouble has to be taken  of course shell accept him  i am not at all so sure of it she has been made to believe that you wanted her to stay and therefore she has stayed she is quite master enough of herself to ride out hunting with him again and then to refuse him and so lady albury doubted up to the sunday and all through the sundayup to the very moment when the last preparations were to be made for the mans arrival  the train reached the stalham road station at 7 pm and the distance was five miles on sundays they usually dined at stalham at 730 the hour fixed was to be 8 on this occasionand even with this there would be some bustling the house was now nearly empty there being no visitors there except mr and mrs gosling and ayala lady albury gave many thoughts to the manner of the mans reception and determined at last that jonathan should have an opportunity of saying a word to ayala immediately on his arrival if he so pleased mind you are down at halfpast seven she said to ayala coming to her in her bedroom  i thought we should not dine till eight  there is no knowing sir harry is so fussy i shall be down and i should like you to be with me then ayala promised and mind you have his frock on  youll make me wear it out before any one else sees it she said laughing but again she promised she got a glimmer of light from it all nearly understanding what lady albury intended but against such intentions as these she had no reason to fight why should she not be ready to see him why should she not have on her prettiest dress when he came if he meant to say the wordthen her prettiest dress would all be too poor and her readiest ears not quick enough to meet so great a joy if he were not to say the other wordthen should she shun him by staying behind or be afraid of the encounter should she be less gaily attired because it would be unnecessary to please his eye  oh no ill be there at halfpast seven she said but i know the train will be late and sir harry wont get his dinner till nine  then my dear great as the colonel is he may come in and get what is left for him in the middle sir harry will not wait a minute after eight  the buxom woman came and dressed her the buxom woman probably knew what was going to happenwas perhaps more keenly alive to the truth than lady albury herself we have taken great care of it havent we miss she said as she fastened the dress behind its just as new still  new said ayala it has got to be new with me for the next two years  i dont know much about that miss somebody will have to pay for a good many more new dresses before two years are over i take it to this ayala made no answer but she was quite sure that the buxom woman intended to imply that colonel stubbs would have to pay for the new dresses  punctually at halfpast seven she was in the drawingroom and there she remained alone for a few minutes she endeavoured to sit down and be quiet but she found it impossible to compose herself almost immediately he would be there and thenas she was quite sureher fate would be known to her instantly she knew that the first moment of his presence in the room with her would tell her everything if that were told to her which she desired to hear everything should be retold to him as quickly but if it were otherwise then she thought that when the moment came she would still have strength enough to hide her sorrow if he had come simply for the huntingsimply that they two might ride ahunting together so that he might show to her that all traces of his disappointment were gonethen she would know how to teach him to think that her heart towards him was as it had ever been the thing to be done would be so sad as to call from her tears almost of blood in her solitude but it should be so done that no one should know that any sorrow such as this had touched her bosom not even to lucy should this secret be told  there was a clock on the mantelpiece to which her eye was continually turned it now wanted twenty minutes to eight and she was aware that if the train was punctual he might now be at the halldoor at this moment lady albury entered the room your knight has come at last she said i hear his wheels on the gravel  he is no knight of mine said ayala with that peculiar frown of hers  whose ever knight he is there he is knight or not i must go and welcome him then lady albury hurried out of the room and ayala was again alone the door had been left partly open so that she could hear the sound of voices and steps across the inner hall or billiardroom there were the servants waiting upon him and sir harry bidding him to go up and dress at once so as not to keep the whole house waiting and lady albury declaring that there was yet ample time as the dinner certainly would not be on the table for halfanhour she heard it all and heard him to whom all her thoughts were now given laughing as he declared that he had never been so cold in his life and that he certainly would not dress himself till he had warmed his fingers she was far away from the door not having stirred from the spot on which she was standing when lady albury left her but she fancied that she heard the murmur of some slight whisper and she told herself that lady albury was telling him where to seek her then she heard the sound of the mans step across the billiardroom she heard his hand upon the door and there he was in her presence  when she thought of it all afterwards as she did so many scores of times she never could tell how it had occurred when she accused him in her playfulness telling him that he had taken for granted that of which he had had no sign she never knew whether there had been aught of truth in her accusation but she did know that he had hardly closed the door behind him when she was in his arms and felt the burning love of his kisses upon her cheeks there had been no more asking whether he was to have any other answer of that she was quite sure had there been such further question she would have answered him and some remembrance of her own words would have remained with her she was quite sure that she had answered no question some memory of mingled granting and denying of repulses and assents all quickly huddled upon one another of attempts to escape while she was so happy to remain and then of a deluge of love terms which fell upon her earshis own one his wife his darling his ayala at last his own sweet ayalathis was what remained to her of that little interview she had not spoken a word she thought she was sure of that her breath had left herso that she could not speak and yet it had been taken for grantedthough on former occasions he had pleaded with slow piteous words how had it been that he had come to know the truth so suddenly then she became aware that lady albury was speaking to mrs gosling in the billiardroom outside detaining her other guest till the scene within should be over at that moment she did speak a word which she remembered afterwards gogo you must go now then there had been one other soft repulse one other sweet assent and the man had gone there was just a moment for her in which to tell herself that the angel of light had come for her and had taken her to himself  mrs gosling who was a pretty little woman crept softly into the room hiding her suspicion if she had any lady albury put out her hand to ayala behind the other womans back not raising it high but just so that her young friend might touch it if she pleased ayala did touch it sliding her little fingers into the offered grasp i thought it would be so whispered lady albury i thought it would be so  what the deuce are you all up to said sir harry bursting into the room its eight now and that man has only just gone up to his room  he hasnt been in the house above five minutes yet said lady albury and i think he has been very quick ayala thought so too  during dinner and afterwards they were very full of hunting for the next day it was wonderful to ayala that there should be thought for such a trifle when there was such a thing as love in the world while there was so much to fill her heart how could there be thoughts of anything else but jonathanhe was jonathan to her now her jonathan her angel of lightwas very keen upon the subject there was but one week left he thought that croppy might manage three days as there was to be but one week croppy would have leisure and rest enough afterwards its a little sharp said sir harry  oh pray dont said ayala  but lady albury and jonathan together silenced sir harry and mrs gosling proved the absurdity of the objection by telling the story of a pony who had carried a lady three days running i should not have liked to be either the pony or the owner or the lady said sir harry but he was silenced what did it matter though the heavens fell so that ayala was pleased what is too much to be done for a girl who proves herself to be an angel by accepting the right man at the right time  she had but one moment alone with her lover that night i always loved you she whispered to him as she fled away the colonel did not quite understand the assertion but he was contented with it as he sat smoking his cigar with sir harry and mr gosling  but though she could have but one word that night with her lover there were many words between her and lady albury before they went to bed and so like wise people you have settled it all between you at last said lady albury  i dont know whether he is wise  we will take that for granted at any rate he has been very true  oh yes  and youyou knew all about it  noi knew nothing i did not think he would ever ask again i only hoped  but why on earth did you give him so much trouble  i cant tell you said ayala shaking her head  do you mean that there is still a secret  no not that i would tell you anything that i could tell because you have been so very very good to me but i cannot tell i cannot explain even to myself oh lady albury why have you been so good to me  shall i say because i have loved you  yesif it be true  but it is not true  oh lady albury  i do love you dearly i shall always love you now i do hope i shall love you now because you will be his wife but i have not been kind to you as you call it because i loved you  then why  because i loved him cannot you understand that because i was anxious that he should have all that he wanted was it not necessary that there should be some house in which he might meet you could there have been much of a pleasant time for wooing between you in your aunts drawingroom in kingsbury crescent  oh no said ayala  could he have taken you out hunting unless you had been here how could he and you have known each other at all unless i had been kind to you now you will understand  yes said ayala i understand now did he ask you  wellhe consulted me we talked you all over and made up our minds between us that if we petted you down here that would be the best way to win you were we not right  it was a very nice way i do so like to be petted  sir harry was in the secret and he did his petting by buying the frock that was a success too i think  did he care about that lady albury  what he  jonathan said ayala almost stumbling over the word as she pronounced it aloud for the first time  i think he liked it but whether he would have persevered without it you must ask yourself if he tells you that he would never have said another word to you only for this frock then i think you ought to thank sir harry and give him a kiss  i am sure he will not tell me that said ayala with mock indignation  and now my dear as i have told you all my secret and have explained to you how we laid our heads together and plotted against you i think you ought to tell me your secret why was it that you refused him so pertinaciously on that sunday when you were out walking and yet you knew your mind about it so clearly as soon as he arrived today  i cant explain it said ayala  you must know that you liked him  i always liked him  you must have more than liked on that sunday  i adored him  then i dont understand you  lady albury i think i fell in love with him the first moment i saw him the marchesa took me to a party in london and there he was  did he say anything to you then  no he was very funnyas he often is dont you know his way i remember every word he said to me he came up without any introduction and ordered me to dance with him  and you did  oh yes whatever he told me i should have done then he scolded me because i did not stand up quick enough and he invented some story about a woman who was engaged to him and would not marry him because he had red hair and his name was jonathan i knew it was all a joke and yet i hated the woman  that must have been love at first sight  i think it was from that day to this i have always been thinking about him  and yet you refused him twice over  yes  at ever so long an interval ayala bobbed her head at her companion and why  ahthat i cant tell i shall try to tell him some day but i know that i never shall it was because but lady albury i cannot tell it did you ever picture anything to yourself in a waking dream  build castles in the air suggested lady albury  thats just it  very often but they never come true  never have come trueexactly i had a castle in the air and in the castle lived a knight she was still ashamed to say that the inhabitant of the castle was an angel of light i wanted to find out whether he was the knight who lived there he was  and you were not quite sure till today  i have been sure a long time but when we walked out on that sunday i was such an idiot that i did not know how to tell him oh lady albury i was such a fool what should i have done if he hadnt come back  sent for him  nevernever i should have been miserable always but now i am so happy  he is the real knight  oh yes indeed he is the realreal knight that has always been living in my castle  ayalas promotion was now so firmly fixed that the buxom female came to assist her off with her clothes when lady albury had left her from this time forth it was supposed that such assistance would be necessary i take it miss said the buxom female there will be a many new dresses before the end of this time two years from which ayala was quite sure that everybody in the house knew all about it                                          but it was now now when she was quite alone that the great sense of her happiness came to her in the fulness of her dreams there had never been more than the conviction that such a being and none other could be worthy of her love there had never been faith in the hope that such a one would come to hernever even though she would tell herself that angels had come down from heaven and had sought in marriage the hands of the daughters of men her dreams had been to her a barrier against love rather than an encouragement but now he that she had in truth dreamed of had come for her then she brought out the marchesas letter and read that description of her lover yes he was all that true brave tendera very hero but then he was more than all thatfor he was in truth the very angel of light     chapter lvi  gobblegoose wood again   the monday was devoted to hunting i am not at all sure that riding about the country with a pack of hounds is an amusement specially compatible with that assured love entertainment which was now within the reach of ayala and her angel for the rudiments of lovemaking for little endearing attentions for a few sweet words to be whispered with shortened breath as one horse gallops beside another perhaps for a lengthened halfhour together amidst the mazes of a large wood when opportunities are no doubt given for private conversation hunting may be very well but for two persons who are engaged with the mutual consent of all their friends a comfortable sofa is perhaps preferable ayala had heard as yet but very little of her lovers intentionswas acquainted only with that one single intention which he had declared in asking her to be his wife there were a thousand things to be toldthe how the where and the when she knew hitherto the why and that was all nothing could be told her while she was galloping about a big wood on croppys back i am delighted to see you again in these parts miss said larry twentyman suddenly  oh mr twentyman how is the baby  the baby is quite well miss his mamma has been out ever so many times  i ought to have asked for her first does baby come out too  not quite but when the hounds are near mamma comes for an hour or so we have had a wonderful seasonquite wonderful you have heard perhaps of our great run from dillsborough wood we found him there close to my place you know and run him down in the brake country after an hour and forty minutes there were only five or six of them youd have been one miss to a moral if youd have been here on the pony i say we never changed our fox  ayala was well disposed towards larry twentyman and was quite aware that according to the records and established usages of that hunt he was a man with whom she might talk safely but she did not care about the foxes so much as she had done before there was nothing now for which she cared much except jonathan stubbs he was always riding near her throughout the day so that he might be with her should there arise anything special to be done but he was not always close to heras she would have had him he had gained his purpose and he was satisfied she had entered in upon the fruition of positive bliss but enjoyed it in perfection only when she heard the sound of his voice or could look into his eyes as she spoke to him she did not care much about the great run from dillsborough or even for the compliment with which mr twentyman finished his narrative they were riding about the big woods all day not without killing a fox but with none of the excitement of a real run after that croppy will be quite fit to come again on wednesday suggested the colonel on their way home to which sir harry assented  what do you folks mean to do today asked lady albury at breakfast on the following morning ayala had her own little plan in her head but did not dare to propose it publicly will you choose to be driven or will you choose to walk said lady albury addressing herself to ayala ayala in her present position was considered to be entitled to special consideration ayala thought she would prefer to walk at last there came a moment in which she could make her request to the person chiefly concerned walk with me to the wood with that absurd name suggested ayala  gobblegoose wood suggested the colonel then that was arranged according to ayalas wishes  a walk in a wood is perhaps almost as good as a comfortable seat in a drawingroom and is perhaps less liable to intrusion they started and walked the way which ayala remembered so well when she had trudged along pretending to listen to sir harry and captain glomax as they carried on their discussion about the hunted fox but giving all her ears to the colonel and wondering whether he would say anything to her before the day was over then her mind had been in a perturbed state which she herself had failed to understand she was sure that she would say no to him should he speak and yet she desired that it should be yes what a fool she had been she told herself as she walked along now and how little she had deserved all the good that had come to her  the conversation was chiefly with him as they went he told her much now of the how and the when and the where he hoped there might be no long delay he would live he said for the next year or two at aldershot and would be able to get a house fit for her on condition that they should be married at once he did not explain why the house could not be taken even though their marriage were delayed two or three monthsbut as to this she asked no questions of course they must be married in london if mrs dosett wished it but if not it might be arranged that the wedding should take place at stalham upon all this and many other things he had much to propose and all that he said ayala accepted as gospel as the angel of light had appearedas the knight who was lord of the castle had come forthof course he must be obeyed in everything he could hardly have made a suggestion to which she would not have acceded when they had entered the wood ayala in her own quiet way led him to the very spot in which on that former day he had asked her his question do you remember this path she asked  i remember that you and i were walking here together he said  ay but this very turn do you remember this branch  well no not the branch  you put your hand on it when you said that nevernever to me  did i say nevernever  yes you didwhen i was so untrue to you  were you untrue he asked  jonathan you remember nothing about it it has all passed away from you just as though you were talking to captain glomax about the fox  has it dear  i remember every word of it i remember how you stood and how you looked even to the hat you wore and the little switch you held in your handwhen you asked for one little word one glance one slightest touch there nowyou shall have all my weight to bear then she leant upon him with both her hands turned round her arm glanced up into his face and opened her lips as though speaking that little word do you remember that i said i thought you had given it all up  i remember that certainly  and was not that untrue oh jonathan that was such a story had i thought so i should have been miserable  then why did you swear to me so often that you could not love me  i never said so replied ayala never  did you not he asked  i never said so i never told you such a story as that i did love you then almost as well as i do now oh i had loved you for so long a time  then why did you refuse me  ah that is what i would explain to you nowhere on this very spotif i could does it not seem odd that a girl should have all that she wants offered to her and yet not be able to take it  was it all that you wanted  indeed it was when i was in church that morning i told myself that i never never could be happy unless you came to me again  but when i did come you would not have me  i knew how to love you she said but i did not know how to tell you that i loved you i can tell you now cannot i and then she looked up at him and smiled yes i think i shall never be tired of telling you now it is sweet to hear you say that you love me but it is sweeter still to be always telling you and yet i could not tell you then suppose you had taken me at my word  i told you that i should never give you up  it was only that that kept me from being altogether wretched i think that i was ashamed to tell you the truth when i had once refused to do as you would have me i had given you so much trouble all for nothing i think that if you had asked me on that first day at the ball in london i should have said yes if i had told the truth  that would have been very sudden i had never seen you before that  nevertheless it was so i dont mind owning it to you now though i never never would own it to any one else when you came to us at the theatre i was sure that no one else could ever have been so good i certainly did love you then  hardly that ayala  i did she said now i have told you everything and if you choose to think i have been badwhy you must think so and i must put up with it  bad my darling  i suppose it was bad to fall in love with a man like that and very bad to give him the trouble of coming so often but now i have made a clean breast of it and if you want to scold me you must scold me now you may do it now but you must never scold me afterwardsbecause of that it may be left to the reader to imagine the nature of the scolding which she received  then on their way home she thanked him for all the good that he had done to all those belonging to her i have heard it all from lucyhow generous you have been to isadore  that has all come to nothing he said  how come to nothing i know that you sent him the money  i did offer to lend him something and indeed i sent him a cheque but two days afterwards he returned it that tremendous uncle of yours  uncle tom  yes your uncle tom the man of millions he came forward and cut me out altogether i dont know what went on down there in sussex but when he heard that they intended to be married shortly he put his hand into his pocket as a magnificent uncle overflowing with millions ought to do  i did not hear that  hamel sent my money back at once  and poor tom you were so good to poor tom  i like tom  but he did behave badly  well yes one gentleman shouldnt strike another even though he be ever so much in love its an uncomfortable proceeding and never has good results but then poor fellow he has been so much in earnest  why couldnt he take a no when he got it  why didnt i take a no when i got it  that was very different he ought to have taken it if you had taken it you would have been very wrong and have broken a poor girls heart i am sure you knew that all through  did i  and then you were too goodnatured that was it i dont think you really love menot as i love you oh jonathan if you were to change your mind now suppose you were to tell me that it was a mistake suppose i were to awake and find myself in bed at kingsbury crescent  i hope there may be no such waking as that  i should go madstark mad shake me till i find out whether it is real waking downright earnest but jonathan why did you call me miss dormer when you went away that was the worst of all i remember when you called me ayala first it went through and through me like an electric shock but you never saw itdid you  on that afternoon when she returned home she wrote to her sister lucy giving a sisters account to her sister of all her happiness i am sure isadore is second best but jonathan is best i dont want you to say so but if you contradict me i shall stick to it you remember my telling you that the old woman in the railway said that i was perverse she was a clever old woman and knew all about it for i was perverse however it has come all right now and jonathan is best of all oh my manmy man is it not sweet to have a man of ones own to love if this letter had been written on the day beforeas would have been the case had not ayala been taken out huntingit would have reached merle park on the wednesday the news would have been made known to aunt emmeline and so conveyed to poor tom and that disagreeable journey from merle park to stalham would have been saved but there was no time for writing on the monday the letter was sent away in the stalham postbag on the tuesday evening and did not reach merle park till the thursday after lady tringle had left the house had it been known on that morning that ayala was engaged to colonel stubbs that would have sufficed to send tom away upon his travels without any more direct messenger from stalham  on the wednesday there was more hunting and on this day ayala having liberated her mind to her lover in gobblegoose wood was able to devote herself more satisfactorily to the amusement in hand her engagement was now an old affair it had already become matter for joking to sir harry and had been discussed even with mrs gosling it was of course a joy for everbut still she was beginning to descend from the clouds and to walk the earthno more than a simple queen when therefore the hounds went away and larry told her that he knew the best way out of the wood she collected her energies and rode like a little brick as sir harry said when they got back to stalham on that afternoon she received the note from her aunt and replied to it by telegram  on the thursday she stayed at home and wrote various letters the first was to the marchesa and then one to ninain both of which much had to be said about jonathan to nina also she could repeat her idea of the delight of having a man to love then there was a letter to aunt margaretwhich certainly was due and another to aunt emmelinewhich was not however received until after lady tringles visit to stalham there was much conversation between her and lady albury as to the possible purpose of the visit which was to be made on the morrow lady albury was of opinion that lady tringle had heard of the engagement and was coming with the intention of setting it on one side on toms behalf but she cant do that you know said ayala with some manifest alarm she is nothing to me now lady albury she got rid of me you know i was changed away for lucy  if there had been no changing away she could do nothing said lady albury  about a quarter of an hour before the time for lunch on the following day lady tringle was shown into the small sittingroom which has been mentioned in a previous chapter and ayala radiant with happiness and beauty appeared before her there was a look about her of being at home at stalham as though she were almost a daughter of the house that struck her aunt with surprise there was nothing left of that submissiveness which though ayala herself had not been submissive belonged as of right to girls so dependent as she and her sister lucy i am so delighted to see you at stalham said ayala as she embraced her aunt  i am come to you said lady tringle on a matter of very particular business then she paused and assumed a look of peculiar solemnity  have you got my letter demanded ayala  i got your telegram and i thought it very civil of lady albury but i cannot stay your poor cousin tom is in such a condition that i cannot leave him longer than i can help  but you have not got my letter  i have had no letter from you ayala  i have sent you such newsoh such news aunt emmeline  what news my dear lady tringle as she asked the question seemed to become more solemn than ever  oh aunt emmeline i am  you are what ayala  i am engaged to be married to colonel jonathan stubbs  engaged  yes aunt emmelineengaged i wrote to you on tuesday to tell you all about it i hope you and uncle tom will approve there cannot possibly be any reason against itexcept only that i have nothing to give him in return that is in the way of money colonel stubbs aunt emmeline is not what uncle tom will call a rich man but everybody here says that he has got quite enough to be comfortable if he had nothing in the world it could not make any difference to me i dont understand how anybody is to love any one or not to love him just because he is rich or poor  but you are absolutely engaged exclaimed lady tringle  oh dear yes perhaps you would like to ask lady albury about it he did want it before you know  but now you are engaged to him in answer to this ayala thought it sufficient simply to nod her head it is all over then  all over exclaimed ayala it is just going to begin  all over for poor tom said lady tringle  oh yes it was always over for him aunt emmeline i told him ever so many times that it never could be so dont you know aunt emmeline that i did  but you said that to this man just the same  aunt emmeline said ayala putting on all the serious dignity which she knew how to assume i am engaged to colonel stubbs and nothing on earth that anybody can say can change it if you want to hear all about it lady albury will tell you she knows that you are my aunt and therefore she will be quite willing to talk to you only nothing that anybody can say can change it  poor tom ejaculated the rejected lovers mother  i am very sorry if my cousin is displeased  he is illterribly ill he will have to go away and travel all about the world and i dont know that ever he will come back again i am sure this stubbs will never love you as he has done  oh aunt what is the use of that  and then tom will have twice as much but however ayala stood silent not seeing that any good could be done by addition to her former assurances i will go and tell him my dear thats all will you not send him some message ayala  oh yes any message that i can that shall go along with my sincere attachment to colonel stubbs you must tell him that i am engaged to colonel stubbs you will tell him aunt emmeline  oh yes if it must be so  it must said ayala then you may give him my love and tell him that i am very unhappy that i should have been a trouble to him and that i hope he will soon be well and come back from his travels by this time aunt emmeline was dissolved in tears i could not help it aunt emmeline could i her aunt had once terribly outraged her feelings by telling her that she had encouraged tom ayala remembered at this moment the cruel words and the wound which they had inflicted on her but nevertheless she behaved tenderly and endeavoured to be respectful and submissive i could not help itcould i aunt emmeline  i suppose not my dear  after that lady tringle declared that she would return to london at once noshe would rather not go in to lunch she would rather go back at once to the station if they would take her she had been weeping and did not wish to show her tears therefore at ayalas request the carriage came round againto the great disgust no doubt of the coachmanand lady tringle was taken back to the station without having seen any of the albury family     chapter lvii  captain batsby in lombard street   it was not till colonel stubbs had been three or four days at stalham basking in the sunshine of ayalas love that any of the stalham family heard of the great event which had occurred in the life of ayalas third lover during that walk to and from gobblegoose wood something had been said between the lovers as to captain batsbysomething no doubt chiefly in joke the idea of the poor captain having fallen suddenly into so melancholy a condition was droll enough but he never spoke to me said ayala he doesnt speak very much to any one said the colonel but he thinks a great deal about things he has had ever so many affairs with ever so many ladies who generally i fancy want to marry him because of his money how he has escaped so long nobody knows a man when he has just engaged himself to be married is as prone as ever to talk of other men escaping feeling that though other young ladies were no better than evils to be avoided his young lady is to be regarded as almost a solitary instance of a blessing then two days afterwards arrived the news of the trip to ostend sir harry received a letter from a friend in which an account was given of his halfbrothers adventure what do you think has happened said sir harry jumping up from his chair at the breakfast table  what has happened asked his wife  benjamin has run off to ostend with a young lady  benjaminwith a young lady exclaimed lady albury ayala and stubbs were equally astonished each of them knowing that the captain had been excluded from stalham because of the ardour of his unfortunate love for ayala ayala that is your doing  no said ayala but i am very glad if hes happy  who is the young lady asked stubbs  it is that which makes it so very peculiar said sir harry looking at ayala he had learned something of the tringle family and was aware of ayalas connection with them  who is it harry demanded her ladyship  sir thomas tringles younger daughter  gertrude exclaimed ayala who also knew of the engagement with mr houston  but the worst of it is continued sir harry that he is not at all happy the young lady has come back while nobody knows what has become of benjamin  benjamin never will get a wife said lady albury thus all the details of the little event became known at stalhamexcept the immediate condition and whereabouts of the lover  of the captains condition and whereabouts something must be told when the great disruption came and he had been abused and ridiculed by sir thomas at ostend he felt that he could neither remain there where the very waiters knew what had happened nor could he return to dover in the same vessel with sir thomas and his daughter he therefore took the first train and went to brussels  but brussels did not offer him many allurements in his present frame of mind he found nobody there whom he particularly knew and nothing particular to do solitude in a continental town with no amusements beyond those offered by the table dhôte and the theatre is oppressing his time he endeavoured to occupy with thinking of the last promise he had made to gertrude should he break it or should he keep it sir thomas tringle was no doubt a very rich manand then there was the fact which would become known to all the world that he had run off with a young lady should he ultimately succeed in marrying the young lady the enterprise would bear less of an appearance of failure than it would do otherwise but then should the money not be forthcoming the consolation coming from the possession of gertrude herself would hardly suffice to make him a happy man sir thomas when he came to consider the matter would certainly feel that his daughter had compromised herself by her journey and that it would be good for her to be married to the man who had taken her it might be that sir thomas would yield and consent to make at any rate some compromise a rumour had reached his ears that traffick had received £200000 with the elder daughter he would consent to take half that sum after a week spent amidst the charms of brussels he returned to london without any public declaration of his doing sosneaked back as a friend of his said of him at the cluband then went to work to carry out his purpose as best he might all that was known of it at stalham was that he had returned to his lodgings in london  on friday the 11th of april when ayala was a promised bride of nearly two weeks standing and all the uncles and aunts were aware that her lot in life had been fixed for her sir thomas was alone in the backroom in lombard street with his mind sorely diverted from the only joy of his life the whole family were now in town and septimus traffick with his wife was actually occupying a room in queens gate how it had come to pass sir thomas hardly knew some word had been extracted from him signifying a compliance with a request that augusta might come to the house for a night or two until a fitting residence should be prepared for her something had been said of lord boardotrades house being vacated for her and her husband early in april an occurrence to which married ladies are liable was about to take place with augusta and sir thomas certainly understood that the occurrence was to be expected under the roof of the coming infants noble grandfather something as to ancestral halls had been thrown out in the chance way of conversation then he certainly had assented to some minimum of london hospitality for his daughteras certainly not including the presence of his soninlaw and now both of them were domiciled in the big front spare bedroom at queens gate this perplexed him sorely and then tom had been brought up from the country still as an invalid his mother moaning and groaning over him as though he were sick almost past hope of recovery and yet the nineteenth of the month now only eight days distant was still fixed for his departure tom on the return of his mother from stalham had to a certain extent accepted as irrevocable the fact of which she bore the tidings ayala was engaged to stubbs and would doubtless with very little delay become mrs jonathan stubbs i knew it he said i knew it nothing could have prevented it unless i had shot him through the heart he told me that she had refused him but no man could have looked like that after being refused by ayala then he never expressed a hope again it was all over for him as regarded ayala but still he refused to be well or even for a day or two to leave his bed he had allowed his mother to understand that if the fact of her engagement were indubitably brought home to him he would gird up his loins for his journey and proceed at once wherever it might be thought good to send him his father had sternly reminded him of his promise but when so reminded tom had turned himself in his bed and uttered groans instead of replies now he had been brought up to london and was no longer actually in bed but even yet he had not signified his intention of girding up his loins and proceeding upon his journey nevertheless the preparations were going on and under sir thomass directions the portmanteaus were already being packed gertrude also was a source of discomfort to her father she considered herself to have been deprived of her two lovers one after the other in a spirit of cruel parsimony and with this heavy weight upon her breast she refused to take any part in the family conversations everything had been done for augusta and everything was to be done for tom for her nothing had been done and nothing had been promisedand she was therefore very sulky with these troubles all around him sir thomas was sitting oppressed and disheartened in lombard street on friday the 11th of april  then there entered to him one of the junior clerks with a card announcing the name of captain batsby he looked at it for some seconds before he gave any notification of his intention and then desired the young man to tell the gentleman that he would not see him the message had been delivered and captain batsby with a frown of anger on his brow was about to shake the dust off from his feet on the uncourteous threshold when there came another message saying that captain batsby could go in and see sir thomas if he wished it upon this he turned round and was shown into the little sittingroom well captain batsby said sir thomas what can i do for you now i am glad to see that you have come back safely from foreign parts  i have called said the captain to say something about your daughter  what more can you have to say about her  at this the captain was considerably puzzled of course sir thomas must know what he had to say the way in which we were separated at ostend was very distressing to my feelings  i daresay  and also i should think to miss tringles  not improbably i have always observed that when people are interrupted in the performance of some egregious stupidity their feelings are hurt as i said before what can i do for you now  i am very anxious to complete the alliance which i have done myself the honour to propose to you  i did not know that you had proposed anything you came down to my house under a false pretence and then you persuaded my daughteror else she persuaded youto go off together to ostend is that what you call an alliance  that as far as it went waswas an elopement  am i to understand that you now want to arrange another elopement and that you have come to ask my consent  oh dear no  then what do you mean by completing an alliance  i want to make said the captain an offer for the young ladys hand in a proper form i consider myself to be in a position which justifies me in doing so i am possessed of the young ladys affections and have means of my own equal to those which i presume you will be disposed to give her  very much better means i hope captain batsby otherwise i do not see what you and your wife would have to live upon i will tell you exactly what my feelings are in this matter my daughter has gone off with you forgetting all the duty that she owed to me and to her mother and throwing aside all ideas of propriety after that i will not say that you shall not marry her if both of you think fit i do not doubt your means and i have no reason for supposing that you would be cruel to her you are two fools but after all fools must live in the world what i do say is that i will not give a sixpence towards supporting you in your folly now captain batsby you can complete the alliance or not as you please  captain batsby had been called a fool also at ostend and there amidst the distressing circumstances of his position had been constrained to bear the opprobious name little customary as it is for one gentleman to allow himself to be called a fool by another but now he had collected his thoughts had reminded himself of his position in the world and had told himself that it did not become him to be too humble before this city man of business it might have been all very well at ostend but he was not going to be called a fool in london without resenting it sir thomas said he fool and folly are terms which i cannot allow you to use to me  if you do not present yourself to me here captain batsby or at my own houseor perhaps i may say at ostendi will use no such terms to you  i suppose you will acknowledge that i am entitled to ask for your daughters hand  i suppose you will acknowledge that when a man runs away with my daughter i am entitled to express my opinion of his conduct  that is all over now sir thomas what i did i did for love there is no good in crying over spilt milk the question is as to the future happiness of the young lady  that is the only wise word i have heard you say captain batsby there is no good in crying after spilt milk our journey to ostend is done and gone it was not very agreeable but we have lived through it i quite think that you show a good judgment in not intending to go there again in quest of a clergyman if you want to be married there are plenty of them in london i will not oppose your marriage but i will not give you a shilling no man ever had a better opportunity of showing the disinterestedness of his affection now good morning  but sir thomas  captain batsby my time is precious i have told you all that there is to tell then he stood up and the captain with a stern demeanour and angry brow left the room and took himself in silence away from lombard street  do you want to marry captain batsby sir thomas said to his daughter that evening having invited her to come apart with him after dinner  yes i do  you think that you prefer him on the whole to mr houston  mr houston is a scoundrel i wish that you would not talk about him papa  i like him so much the best of the two said sir thomas but of course it is for you to judge i could have brought myself to give something to houston luckily however captain batsby has got an income of his own  he has papa  and you are sure that you would like to take him as your husband  yes papa  very well he has been with me today  is he in london  i tell you that he has been with me today in lombard street  what did he say did he say anything about me  yes my dear he came to ask me for your hand  well papa  i told him that i should make no objectionthat i should leave it altogether to you i only interfered with one small detail as to my own wishes i assured him that i should never give him or you a single shilling i dont suppose it will matter much to him as he has you know means of his own it was thus that sir thomas punished his daughter for her misconduct  captain batsby and the trafficks were acquainted with each other the member of parliament had of course heard of the journey to ostend from his wife and had been instigated by her to express an opinion that the young people ought to be married it is such a very serious thing said augusta to her husband to be four hours on the sea together and then you know mr traffick acknowledged that it was serious and was reminded by his wife that he in the capacity of brother was bound to interfere on his sisters behalf papa you know understands nothing about these kind of things you with your family interest and your seat in parliament ought to be able to arrange it mr traffick probably knew how far his family interest and his seat in parliament would avail they had at any rate got him a wife with a large fortune they were promising for him still further certain domiciliary advantages he doubted whether he could do much for batsby but still he promised to try if he could arrange these matters it might be that he would curry fresh favour with sir thomas by doing so he therefore made it his business to encounter captain batsby on the sunday afternoon at a club to which they both belonged so you have come back from your little trip said the member of parliament  the captain was not unwilling to discuss the question of their family relations with mr traffick if anybody would have influence with sir thomas it might probably be mr traffick yes i have come back  without your bride  without my brideas yet that is a kind of undertaking in which a man is apt to run many dangers before he can carry it through  i dare say i never did anything of the kind myself of course you know that i am the young ladys brotherinlaw  oh yes  and therefore you wont mind me speaking dont you think you ought to do something further  something further by george i should think so said the captain exultingly i mean to do a great many things further you dont suppose i am going to give it up  you oughtnt you know when a man has taken a girl off with him in that way he should go on with it its a deuced serious thing you know  it was his fault in coming after us  that was a matter of course if he hadnt done it i must i have made the family my own and of course must look after its honour the noble scion of the house of traffick as he said this showed by his countenance that he perfectly understood the duty which circumstances had imposed upon him  he made himself very rough you know said the captain  i dare say he would  and said thingswellthings which he ought not to have said  in such a case as that a father may say pretty nearly what comes uppermost  that was just it he did say what came uppermostand very rough it was  what does it matter  not much if hed do as he ought to do now as you are her brotherinlaw ill tell you just how it stands i have been to him and made a regular proposal  since you have been back  yes the day before yesterday and what do you think he says  what does he say  he gives his consent only  only what  he wont give her a shilling such an idea you know as though she were to be punished after marriage for running away with the man she did marry  take your chance batsby said the member of parliament  what chance  take your chance of the money id have done it only of course it was different with me he was glad to catch me and therefore the money was settled  ive got a tidy income of my own you know said the captain thinking that he was entitled to be made more welcome as a soninlaw than the younger son of a peer who had no income  take your chance continued traffick what on earth can a man like tringle do with his money except give it to his children he is rough as you say but he is not hardhearted nor yet stubborn i can do pretty nearly what i like with him  can you though  yes by smoothing him down the right way you run your chance and well get it all put right for you the captain hesitated rubbing his head carefully to encourage the thoughts which were springing up within his bosom the honourable mr traffick might perhaps succeed in getting the affair put right as he called it in the interest rather of the elder than of the second daughter i dont see how you can hesitate now as you have been off with the girl said mr traffick  i dont know about that i should like to see the money settled  there would have been nothing settled if you had married her at ostend  but i didnt said the captain i tell you what you might do you might talk him over and make him a little more reasonable i should be ready tomorrow if hed come forward  whats the sum you want  the same as yours i suppose  thats out of the question said mr traffick shaking his head suppose we say sixty thousand pounds then after some chaffering on the subject it was decided between them that mr traffick should use his powerful influence with his fatherinlaw to give his daughter on her marriagesay a hundred thousand pounds if it were possible or sixty thousand pounds at the least     chapter lviii  mr traffick in lombard street   mr traffick entertained some grand ideas as to the house of travers and treason why should not he become a member and ultimately the leading member of that firm sir thomas was not a young man though he was strong and hearty tom had hitherto succeeded only in making an ass of himself as far as transacting the affairs of the firm tomso thought mr traffickwas altogether out of the question he might perish in those extensive travels which he was about to take mr traffick did not desire any such catastrophebut the young man might perish there was a great opening mr traffick with his thorough knowledge of business could not but see that there was a great opening besides tom there were but two daughters one of whom was his own wife augusta his wife was he thought certainly the favourite at the present moment sir thomas could indeed say rough things even to her but then sir thomas was of his nature rough now at this time the rough things said to gertrude were very much the rougher in all these circumstances the wisdom of interfering in gertrudes little affairs was very clear to mr traffick gertrude would of course get herself married sooner or later and almost any other husband would obtain a larger portion than that which would satisfy batsby sir thomas was now constantly saying good things about mr houston mr houston would be much more objectionable than captain batsbymuch more likely to interfere he would require more money at once and might possibly come forward himself in the guise of a partner mr traffick saw his way clearly it was incumbent upon him to see that gertrude should become mrs batsby with as little delay as possible  but one thing he did not see one thing he had failed to see since his first introduction to the tringle family he had not seen the peculiar nature of his fatherinlaws foibles he did not understand either the weakness or the strength of sir thomaseither the softness or the hardness mr traffick himself was blessed with a very hard skin in the carrying out of a purpose there was nothing which his skin was not sufficiently serviceable to endure but sir thomas rough as he was had but a thin skina thin skin and a soft heart had houston and gertrude persevered he would certainly have given way for tom in his misfortune he would have made any sacrifice though he had given the broadest hints which he had been able to devise he had never as yet brought himself absolutely to turn traffick out of his house when ayala was sent away he still kept her name in his will and added also that of lucy as soon as lucy had been entrusted to him had things gone a little more smoothly between him and hamel when they methad he not unluckily advised that all the sculptors grand designs should be sold by auction for what they would fetchhe would have put hamel and lucy upon their legs he was a softhearted manbut there never was one less willing to endure interference in his own affairs  at the present moment he was very sore as to the presence of traffick in queens gate the easter parliamentary holidays were just at hand and there was no sign of any going augusta had whispered to her mother that the poky little house in mayfair would be very uncomfortable for the coming eventand lady tringle though she had not dared to say even as much as that in plain terms to her husband had endeavoured to introduce the subject by little hintswhich sir thomas had clearly understood he was hardly the man to turn a daughter and an expected grandchild into the streets but he was in his present mood a fatherinlaw who would not unwillingly have learned that his soninlaw was without a shelter except that afforded by the house of commons why on earth should he have given up one hundred and twenty thousand pounds£6000 ayear as it was under his fostering careto a man who could not even keep a house over his wifes head this was the humour of sir thomas when mr traffick undertook to prevail with him to give an adequate fortune to his youngest daughter on her marriage with captain batsby  the conversation between traffick and batsby took place on a sunday on the following day the captain went down to the house and saw the member no i have not spoken to him yet  i was with him on friday you know said batsby i cant well go and call on the ladies in queens gate till i hear that he has changed his mind  i should i dont see what difference it would make  then captain batsby was again very thoughtful it would make a difference you know if i were to say a word to gertrude nowas to being married or anything of that kindit would seem that i meant to go on whether i got anything or not  and you should seem to want to go on said traffick with all that authority which the very surroundings of the house of commons always give to the words and gait of a member  but then i might find myself dropped in a hole at last  my dear batsby you made that hole for yourself when you ran off with the young lady  we settled all that before  not quite what we did settle was that wed do our best to fill the hole up of course you ought to go and see them you went off with the young ladyand since that have been accepted as her suitor by her father you are bound to go and see her  do you think so  certainly certainly it never does to talk to tringle about business at his own house ill make an hour to see him in the city tomorrow im so pressed by business that i can hardly get away from the house after twelvebut ill do it but while im in lombard street do you go to queens gate the captain after further consideration said that he would go to queens gate  at three oclock on the next day he did go to queens gate he had many misgivings feeling that by such a step he would be committing himself to matrimony with or without the money no doubt he could so offer himself even to lady tringle as a soninlaw that it should be supposed that the offer would depend upon the fatherinlaws goodwill but then the fatherinlaw had told him that he would be welcome to the young ladywithout a farthing should he go on with his matrimonial purpose towards which this visit would be an important step he did not see the moment in which he could stop the proceedings by a demand for money nevertheless he went not being strong enough to oppose mr traffick  yesthe ladies were at home and he found himself at once in lady tringles presence there was at the time no one with her and the captain acknowledged to himself that a trying moment had come to him dear me captain batsby said her ladyship who had not seen him since he and gertrude had gone off together  yes lady tringle as i have come back from abroad i thought that i might as well come and call i did see sir thomas in the city  was not that a very foolish thing you did  perhaps it was lady tringle perhaps it would have been better to ask permission to address your daughter in the regular course of things there was perhapsperhaps a little romance in going off in that way  it gave sir thomas a deal of trouble  well yes he was so quick upon us you know may i be allowed to see gertrude now  upon my word i hardly know said lady tringle hesitating  i did see sir thomas in the city  but did he say you were to come and call  he gave his consent to the marriage  but i am afraid there was to be no money whispered lady tringle if money is no matter i suppose you may see her but before the captain had resolved how he might best answer this difficult suggestion the door opened and the young lady herself entered the room together with her sister  benjamin said gertrude is this really you and then she flew into his arms  my dear said augusta do control your emotions  yes indeed gertrude said the mother as the things are at present you should control yourself nobody as yet knows what may come of it  oh benjamin again exclaimed gertrude tearing herself from his arms throwing herself on the sofa and covering her face with both her hands oh benjaminso you have come at last  i am afraid he has come too soon said augusta who however had received her lesson from her husband and had communicated some portion of her husbands tidings to her sister  why too soon exclaimed gertrude it can never be too soon oh mamma tell him that you make him welcome to your bosom as your second soninlaw  upon my word my dear i do not know without consulting your father  but papa has consented said gertrude  but only if  oh mamma said mrs traffick do not talk about matters of business on such an occasion as this all that must be managed between the gentlemen if he is here as gertrudes acknowledged lover and if papa has told him that he shall be accepted as such i dont think that we ought to say a word about money i do hate money it does make things so disagreeable  nobody can be more noble in everything of that kind than benjamin said gertrude it is only because he loves me with all his heart that he is here why else was it that he took me off to ostend  captain batsby as he listened to all this felt that he ought to say something and yet how dangerous might a word be it was apparent to him even in his perturbation that the ladies were in fact asking him to renew his offer and to declare that he renewed it altogether independently of any money consideration he could not bring himself quite to agree with that noble sentiment in expressing which mrs traffick had declared her hatred of money in becoming the soninlaw of a millionaire he would receive the honest congratulations of all his friendson condition that he received some comfortable fraction out of the millions but he knew well that he would subject himself to their ridicule were he to take the girl and lose the plunder if he were to answer them now as they would have him answer he would commit himself to the girl without any bargain as to the plunder and yet what else was there for him to do he must be a brave man who can stand up before a girl and declare that he will love her for everon condition that she shall have so many thousand pounds but he must be more than brave he will be heroic who can do so in the presence not only of the girl but of the girls mother and married sister as well captain batsby was no such hero of course he said at last  of course what asked augusta  it was because i loved her  i knew that he loved me sobbed gertrude  and you are here because you intend to make her your wife in presence of all men asked augusta  oh certainly  then i suppose that it will be all right said lady tringle  it will be all right said augusta and now mamma i think that we may leave them alone together but to this lady tringle would not give her assent she had not had confided to her the depth of mr trafficks wisdom and declared herself opposed to any absolute overt lovemaking until sir thomas should have given his positive consent  it is all the same thing benjamin is it not said augusta assuming already the familiarity of a sister inlaw  oh quite said the captain  but gertrude looked as though she did not think it to be exactly the same such deficiency as that however she had to endure and she received from her sister after the captains departure full congratulations as to her lovers return to tell you the truth said augusta i didnt think that you would ever see him again after what papa said to him in the city he might have got off and nobody could have said a word to him now hes fixed  captain batsby effected his escape as quickly as he could and went home a melancholy man he too was aware that he was fixed and as he thought of this a dreadful idea fell upon him that the honourable mr traffick had perhaps played him false  in the meantime mr traffick was true to his word and went into the city in the early days of his married life his journeys to lombard street were frequent the management and investing of his wifes money had been to him a matter of much interest and he had felt a gratification in discussing any money matter with the man who handled millions in this way he had become intimate with the ways of the house though latterly his presence there had not been encouraged i suppose i can go in to sir thomas he said laying his hand upon a leaf in the counter which he had been accustomed to raise for the purpose of his own entrance but here he was stopped his name should be taken in and sir thomas duly apprised in the meantime he was relegated to a dingy little waitingroom which was odious to him and there he was kept waiting for halfanhour this made him angry and he called to one of the clerks will you tell sir thomas that i must be down at the house almost immediately and that i am particularly anxious to see him on business of importance for another ten minutes he was still kept and then he was shown into his fatherin laws presence i am very sorry traffick said sir thomas but i really cant turn two directors of the bank of england out of my room even for you  i only thought i would just let you know that i am in a hurry  so am i for the matter of that have you gone to your fathers house today so that you would not be able to see me in queens gate  this was intended to be very severe but mr traffick bore it it was one of those rough things which sir thomas was in the habit of saying but which really meant nothing no my father is still at his house as yet though they are thinking of going every day it is about another matter and i did not want to trouble you with it at home  let us hear what it is  captain batsby has been with me  oh he has has he  ive known him ever so long hes a foolish fellow  so he seems  but a gentleman  perhaps i am not so good a judge of that his folly i did perceive  oh yes hes a gentleman you may take my word for that and he has means  thats an advantage  while that fellow houston is hardly more than a beggar and batsby is quite in earnest about gertrude  if the two of them wish it he can have her tomorrow she has made herself a conspicuous ass by running away with him and perhaps its the best thing she can do  thats just it augusta sees it quite in the same light  augusta was never tempted you wouldnt have run away  it wasnt necessary sir thomas was it there he isready to marry her tomorrow but of course he is a little anxious about the money  i dare say he is  ive been talking to himand the upshot is that i have promised to speak to you he isnt at all a bad fellow  hed keep a house over his wifes head you think sir thomas had been particularly irate that morning and before the arrival of his soninlaw had sworn to himself that traffick should go augusta might remain if she pleased for the occurrence but the honourable septimus should no longer eat and drink as an inhabitant of his house  hed do his duty by her as a man should do said traffick determined to ignore the disagreeable subject  very well there she is  but of course he would like to hear something about money  would he  thats only natural  you found it sodid you not whats the good of giving a girl money when her husband wont spend it perhaps this captain batsby would expect to live at queens gate or merle park  it was impossible to go on enduring this without notice mr traffick however only frowned and shook his head it was clear at last that sir thomas intended to be more than rough and it was almost imperative upon mr traffick to be rough in return i am endeavouring to do my duty by the family he said  oh indeed  gertrude has eloped with this man and the thing is talked about everywhere augusta feels it very much  she does does she  and i have thought it right to ask his intentions  he didnt knock you down or anything of that sort  knock me down  for interfering but he hasnt pluck for that houston would have done it immediately and i should have said he was right but if you have got anything to say you had better say it when you have done then i shall have something to say  ive told him that he couldnt expect as much as you would have given her but for this running away  you told him that  yes i told him that then some sum had to be mentioned he suggested a hundred thousand pounds  how very modest why should he have put up with less than you seeing that he has got something of his own  he hasnt my position sir you know that well enough now to make a long and short of it i suggested sixty  out of your own pocket  not exactly  but out of mine  youre her father and i suppose you intend to provide for her  and you have come here to dictate to me the provision which i am to make for my own child that is an amount of impudence which i did not expect even from you but suppose that i agree to the terms will he do you think consent to have a clause put into the settlement  what clause  something that shall bind him to keep a house for his own wifes use so that he should not take my money and then come and live upon me afterwards  sir thomas said the member of parliament that is a mode of expression so uncourteous that i cannot bear it even from you  is there any mode of expression that you cannot bear  if you want me to leave your house say it at once  why i have been saying it for the last six months i have been saying it almost daily since you were married  if so you should have spoken more clearly for i have not understood you  heavens and earth ejaculated sir thomas  am i to understand that you wish your child to leave your roof during this inclement weather in her present delicate condition  are you in a delicate condition asked sir thomas to this mr traffick could condescend to make no reply because if not you at any rate had better gounless you find the weather too inclement  of course i shall go said mr traffick no consideration on earth shall induce me to eat another meal under your roof until you shall have thought good to have expressed regret for what you have said  then it is very long before i shall have to give you another meal  and now what shall i say to captain batsby  tell him from me said sir thomas that he cannot possibly set about his work more injudiciously than by making you his ambassador then mr traffick took his departure  it may be as well to state here that mr traffick kept his threat religiouslyat any rate to the end of the session he did not eat another meal during that period under his fatherinlaws roof but he slept there for the next two or three days until he had suited himself with lodgings in the neighbourhood of the house in doing this however he contrived to get in and out without encountering sir thomas his wife in her delicate conditionand because of the inclemency of the weatherawaited the occurrence at queens gate     chapter lix  tregothnan   the writer in giving a correct chronicle of the doings of the tringle family at this time has to acknowledge that gertrude during the prolonged absence of captain batsby at brusselsan absence that was cruelly prolonged for more than a weekdid make another little effort in another direction her father in his rough way had expressed an opinion that she had changed very much for the worse in transferring her affections from mr houston to captain batsby and had almost gone so far as to declare that had she been persistent with her houston the money difficulty might have been overcome this was imprudentunless indeed he was desirous of bringing back mr houston into the bosom of the tringles it instigated gertrude to another attemptwhich however she did not make till captain batsby had been away from her for at least four days without writing a letter then it occurred to her that if she had a preference it certainly was for frank houston no doubt the general desirability of marriage was her chief actuating motive will the world of british young ladies be much scandalised if i say that such is often an actuating motive they would be justly scandalised if i pretended that many of its members were capable of the speedy transitions which miss tringle was strong enough to endure but transitions do take place and i claim on behalf of my young lady that she should be regarded as more strongminded and more determined than the general crowd of young ladies she had thought herself to be off with the old love before she was on with the new then the new had gone away to brusselsor heaven only knows whereand there seemed to be an opportunity of renewing matters with the old having perceived the desirability of matrimony she simply carried out her purpose with a determined will it was with a determined will but perhaps with deficient judgment that she had written as follows  papa has altered his mind altogether he speaks of you in the highest terms and says that had you persevered he would have yielded about the money do try him again when hearts have been united it is terrible that they should be dragged asunder mr traffick had been quite right in telling his fatherinlaw that the thing had been talked about everywhere the thing talked about had been gertrudes elopement the daughter of a baronet and a millionaire cannot go off with the halfbrother of another baronet and escape that penalty the journey to ostend was in everybodys mouth and had surprised frank houston the more because of the recent termination of his own little affair with the lady that he should already have reaccommodated himself with imogene was intelligible to him and seemed to admit of valid excuse before any jury of matrons it was an old affair and the lovereal true lovewas already existing he at any rate was going back to the better courseas the jury of matrons would have admitted but gertrudes new affair had had to be arranged from the beginning and shocked him by its celerity already he had said to himselfgone off with another man already he felt himself to have been wounded in a tender part and was conscious of a feeling that he should like to injure the successful loverblackball him at a club or do him some other mortal mischief when therefore he received from the young lady the little billet above given he was much surprised could it be a hoax it was certainly the young ladys handwriting was he to be enticed once again into lombard street in order that the clerks might set upon him in a body and maltreat him was he to be decoyed into queens gate and made a sacrifice of by the united force of the housemaids not understanding the celerity of the young lady he could hardly believe the billet  when he received the note of which we have here spoken two months had elapsed since he had seen imogene and had declared to her his intention of facing the difficulties of matrimony in conjunction with herself as soon as she would be ready to undergo the ceremony with him the reader will remember that her brother mudbury docimer had written to him with great severity abusing both him and imogene for the folly of their intention and houston as he thought of their intention thought to himself that perhaps they were foolish the poverty and the cradles and the cabbages were in themselves evils but still he encouraged himself to think that there might be an evil worse even than folly after that scene with imogene in which she had offered to sacrifice herself altogether and to be bound to him even though they should never be married on condition that he should take to himself no other wife he had quite resolved that it behoved him not to be exceeded by her in generosity he had stoutly repudiated her offer which he had called a damnable compact and then there had been a delightful scene between them in which it had been agreed that they should face the cradles and the cabbages with bold faces since that he had never allowed himself to fluctuate in his purpose had sir thomas come to him with gertrude in one hand and the muchdesired £120000 in the other he would have repudiated the lot of them he declared to himself with stern resolution that he had altogether washed his hands from dirt of that kind cabbages and cradles for ever was the unpronounced cry of triumph with which he buoyed up his courage he set himself to work earnestly if not altogether steadfastly to alter the whole tenor of his life the champagne and the woodcocksor whatever might be the special delicacies of the seasonhe did avoid for some few days he absolutely dined upon a cut of mutton at an eatinghouse and as he came forth from the unsavoury doors of the establishment regarded himself as a hero cabbages and cradles for ever he would say to himself as he went away to drink a cup of tea with an old maiden aunt who was no less surprised than gratified by his new virtue therefore when it had at last absolutely come home to him that the last little note had in truth been written by gertrude with no object of revenge but with the intention of once more alluring him into the wealth of lombard street he simply put it into his breastcoatpocket and left it there unanswered  mudbury docimer did not satisfy himself with writing the very uncourteous letter which the reader has seen but proceeded to do his utmost to prevent the threatened marriage she is old enough to look after herself he had said as though all her future actions must be governed by her own will but within ten days of the writing of that letter he had found it expedient to go down into the country and to take his sister with him as the head of the docimer family he possessed a small countryhouse almost in the extremity of cornwall and thither he went it was a fraternal effort made altogether on his sisters behalf and was so far successful that imogene was obliged to accompany him it was all very well for her to feel that as she was of age she could do as she pleased but a young lady is constrained by the exigencies of society to live with somebody she cannot take a lodging by herself as her brother may do therefore when mudbury docimer went down to cornwall imogene was obliged to accompany him  is this intended for banishment she said to him when they had been about a week in the country  what do you call banishment you used to like the country in the spring it was now the middle of april  so i do and in summer also but i like nothing under constraint  i am sorry that circumstances should make it imperative upon me to remain here just at present  why cannot you tell the truth mudbury  have i told you any falsehood  why do you not say outright that i have been brought down here to be out of frank houstons way  because frank houston is a name which i do not wish to mention to you againat any rate for some time  what would you do if he were to show himself here she asked  tell him at once that he was not welcome in other words i would not have him here it is very improbable i should think that he would come without a direct invitation from me that invitation he will never have until i feel satisfied that you and he have changed your mind again and that you mean to stick to it  i do not think we shall do that  then he shall not come down here nor as far as i am able to arrange it shall you go up to london  then i am a prisoner  you may put it as you please said her brother i have no power of detaining you whatever influence i have i think it right to use i am altogether opposed to this marriage believing it to be an absurd infatuation i think that he is of the same opinion  no said she indignantly  that i believe to be his feeling he continued taking no notice of her assertion he is as perfectly aware as i am that you two are not adapted to live happily together on an income of a few hundreds a year some time ago it was agreed between you that it was so you both were quite of one mind and i was given to understand that the engagement was at an end it was so much at an end that he made an arrangement for marrying another woman but your feelings are stronger than his and you allowed them to get the better of you then you enticed him back from the purpose on which you had both decided  enticed said she i did nothing of the kind  would he have changed his mind if you had not enticed him  i did nothing of the kind i offered to remain just as we are  that is all very well of course he could not accept such an offer thinking as i do it is my duty to keep you apart as long as i can if you contrive to marry him in opposition to my efforts the misery of both of you must be on your head i tell you fairly that i do not believe he wishes anything of the kind  i am quite sure he does said imogene  very well do you leave him alone stay down here and see what will come of it i quite agree that such a banishment as you call it is not a happy prospect for youbut it is happier than that of a marriage with frank houston give that up and then you can go back to london and begin the world again  begin the world again she knew what that meant she was to throw herself into the market and look for such other husband as providence might send her she had tried that before and had convinced herself that providence could never send her any that could be acceptable the one man had taken possession of her and there never could be a second she had not known her own strengthor her own weakness as the case might bewhen she had agreed to surrender the man she loved because there had been an alteration in their prospects of an income she had struggled with herself had attempted to amuse herself with the world had told herself that somebody would come who would banish that image from her thoughts and heart she had bade herself to submit to the separation for his welfare then she had endeavoured to quiet herself by declaring to herself that the man was no herowas unworthy of so much thinking but it had all been of no avail gertrude tringle had been a festering sore to her frank whether a hero or only a commonplace man wasas she owned to herselfhero enough for her then came the opening for a renewal of the engagement frank had been candid with her and had told her everything the tringle money would not be forthcoming on his behalf thennot resolving to entice him back againshe had done so the word was odious to her and was rejected with disdain when used against her by her brotherbut when alone she acknowledged to herself that it was true she had enticed her lover back againto his great detriment yes she certainly had enticed him back she certainly was about to sacrifice him because of her love if i could only die and there be an end of it she exclaimed to herself  though tregothnan hall as the docimers house was called was not open to frank houston there was the post running always he had written to her halfadozen times since she had been in cornwall and had always spoken of their engagement as an affair at last irrevocably fixed she too had written little notes tender and loving but still tinged by that tone of despondency which had become common to her as for naming a day she said once suppose we fix the first of january ten years hence mudburys opposition will be worn out by old age and you will have become thoroughly sick of the pleasures of london but joined to this there would be a few jokes and then some little word of warmest most enduring most trusting love dont believe me if i say that i am not happy in knowing that i am altogether your own then there would come a simple i as a signature and after that some further badinage respecting her cerberus as she called her brother  but after that word that odious word enticed there went another letter up to london of altogether another nature  i have changed my mind again she said      and have become aware that though i should die in doing    itthough we should both die if it were possiblethere    should be an end of everything between you and me yes    frank there i send you back my troth and demand my own    in return after all why should not one diehang oneself    if it be necessary to be selfdenying is all that is    necessaryat any rate to a woman hanging or lying down    and dying or lingering on and saying ones prayers and    knitting stockings is altogether immaterial i have    sometimes thought mudbury to be brutal to me but i have    never known him to be untrueor even as i believe    mistaken he sees clearly and knows what will happen he    tells me that i have enticed you back i am not true as    he is so i threw him back the word in his teeththough    its truth at the moment was going like a dagger through    my heart i know myself to have been selfish unfeeling    unfeminine when i induced you to surrender yourself to    a mode of life which will make you miserable i have    sometimes been proud of myself because i have loved you so    truly but now i hate myself and despise myself because i    have been incapable of the first effort which love should    make love should at any rate be unselfish     he tells me that you will be miserable and that the misery    will be on my headand i believe him there shall be an    end of it i want no promise from you there may perhaps    be a time in which imogene docimer as a sturdy old maid    shall be respected and serene of mind as a wife who had    enticed her husband to his misery she would be respected    neither by him nor by herselfand as for serenity    it would be quite out of the question i have been    unfortunate that is allbut not half so unfortunate as    others that i see around me     pray pray pray take this as final and thus save    me from renewed trouble and renewed agony     now i am yours truly    never again will i be affectionate to any one    with true feminine love     imogene docimer   houston when he received the above letter of course had no alternative but to declare that it could not possibly be regarded as having any avail and indeed he had heart enough in his bosom to be warmed to something like true heat by such words as these the cabbages and cradles ran up in his estimation the small house at pau which in some of his more despondent moments had assumed an unqualified appearance of domestic discomfort was now ornamented and accoutred till it seemed to be a little paradise the very cabbages blossomed into roses and the little babies in the cradles produced a throb of paternal triumph in his heart if she were woman enough to propose to herself such an agony of devotion could he not be man enough to demand from her a devotion of a different kind as to mudbury docimers truth he believed in it not at all but was quite convinced of the mans brutality yes she should hang herselfbut it should be round his neck the serenity should be displayed by her not as an aunt but as a wife and mother as for enticing did he not nowjust in this moment of his manly triumphacknowledge to himself that she had enticed him to his happiness to his glory to his welfare in this frame of mind he wrote his answer as follows      my dearest     you have no power of changing your mind again there must    be some limit to vacillations and that has been reached    something must be fixed at last something has been fixed    at last and i most certainly shall not consent to any    further unfixing what right has mudbury to pretend to    know my feelings or for the matter of that what right    have you to accept his description of them i tell you now    that i place my entire happiness in the hope of making    you my wife i call upon you to ignore all the selfish    declarations as to my own ideas which i have made in times    past the only right which you could now possibly have    to separate yourself from me would come from your having    ceased to love me you do not pretend to say that such is    the case and therefore with considerable indignation    but still very civilly i desire that mudbury with his    hardhearted counsels may go to the      enticed of course you have enticed me i suppose that    women do as a rule entice men either to their advantage    or disadvantage i will leave it to you to say whether    you believe that such enticement if it be allowed its    full scope will lead to one or the other as far as i am    concerned i never was so happy as when i felt that you    had enticed me back to the hopes of former days     now i am yours as always and most affectionately     frank houston     i shall expect the same word back from you by return of    post scored under as eagerly as those futile prays   imogene when she received this was greatly disturbednot knowing how to carry herself in her great resolveor whether indeed that resolve must not be again abandoned she had determined should her lovers answer be as she had certainly intended it to be when she wrote her letter to go at once to her brother and to declare to him that the danger was at an end and that he might return to london without any fear of a relapse on her part but she could not do so with such a reply as that she now held in her pocket if that reply could in very truth be true then there must be another revulsion another change of purpose another yielding to absolute joy if it could be the case that frank houston no longer feared the dangers that he had feared before if he had in truth reconciled himself to a state of things which he had once described as simple poverty if he really placed his happiness on the continuation of his love thenthen why should she make the sacrifice why should she place such implicit confidence in her brothers infallibility against error seeing that by doing so she would certainly shipwreck her own happinessand his too if his words were to be trusted  he called upon her to write to him again by return of post she was to write to him and unsay those prayers and comfort him with a repetition of that dear word which she had declared that she would never use again with all its true meaning that was his express order to her should she obey it or should she not obey it should she vacillate again or should she leave his last letter unanswered with stern obduracy she acknowledged to herself that it was a dear letter deserving the best treatment at her hands giving her lover credit probably for more true honesty than he deserved what was the best treatment her brother had plainly shown his conviction that the best treatment would be to leave him without meddling with him any further her sisterinlaw though milder in her language was she feared of the same opinion would it not be better for him not to be meddled with ought not that to be her judgment looking at the matter all round  she did not at any rate obey him at all points for she left his letter in her pocket for three or four days while she considered the matter backwards and forwards     chapter lx  aunt rosina   during this period of heroism it had been necessary to houston to have some confidential friend to whom from time to time he could speak of his purpose he could not go on eating slices of boiled mutton at eatinghouses and drinking dribblets of bad wine out of little decanters no bigger than the bottles in a cruet stand without having some one to encourage him in his efforts it was a hard apprenticeship and coming as it did rather late in life for such a beginning and after much luxurious indulgence required some sympathy and consolation there were tom shuttlecock and lord john battledore at the club lord john was the man as to whose expulsion because of his contumacious language so much had been said but who lived through that and various other dangers these had been his special friends and to them he had confided everything in regard to the tringle marriage shuttlecock had ridiculed the very idea of love and had told him that everything else was to be thrown to the dogs in pursuit of a good income battledore had reminded him that there was a deuced deal of cutandcomeagain in a hundred and twenty thousand pounds they had been friends not always altogether after his own heart but friends who had served his purpose when he was making his raid upon lombard street but they were not men to whom he could descant on the wholesomeness of cabbages as an article of daily food or who would sympathise with the struggling joys of an embryo father to their thinking women were occasionally very convenient as being the depositaries of some of the accruing wealth of the world frank had been quite worthy of their friendship as having spotted and nearly run down for himself a wellladen city heiress but now tom shuttlecock and lord john battledore were distasteful to himas would he be to them but he found the confidential friend in his maiden aunt  miss houston was an old ladyolder than her time as are some peoplewho lived alone in a small house in green street she was particular in calling it green street hyde park she was very anxious to have it known that she never occupied it during the months of august september and octoberthough it was often the case with her that she did not in truth expatriate herself for more than six weeks she was careful to have a fashionable seat in a fashionable church she dearly loved to see her name in the papers when she was happy enough to be invited to a house whose entertainments were chronicled there were a thousand little tricksi will not be harsh enough to call them unworthyby which she served mammon but she did not limit her service to the evil spirit when in her place in church she sincerely said her prayers when in london or out of it she gave a modicum of her slender income to the poor and though she liked to see her name in the papers as one of the fashionable world she was a great deal too proud of the blood of the houstons to toady any one or to ask for any favour she was a neat clean nicelooking old lady who understood that if economies were to be made in eating and drinking they should be effected at her own table and not at that of the servants who waited upon her this was the confidential friend whom frank trusted in his new career  it must be explained that aunt rosina as miss houston was called had been well acquainted with her nephews earlier engagement and had approved of imogene as his future wife then had come the unexpected collapse in the uncles affairs by which aunt rosina as well as others in the family had sufferedand frank much to his aunts displeasure had allowed himself to be separated from the lady of his love on account of his comparative poverty she had heard of gertrude tringle and all her money but from a high standing of birth and social belongings had despised all the tringles and all their money to her as a maiden lady truth in love was everything to her as a wellborn lady good blood was everything therefore though there had been no quarrel between her and frank there had been a cessation of sympathetic interest and he had been thrown into the hands of the battledores and shuttlecocks now again the old sympathies were revived and frank found it convenient to drink tea with his aunt when other engagements allowed it  i call that an infernal interference he said to his aunt showing her imogenes letters  my dear frank you need not curse and swear said the old lady  infernal is not cursing nor yet swearing then miss houston having liberated her mind by her remonstrance proceeded to read the letter i call that abominable said frank alluding of course to the allusions made in the letter to mudbury docimer  it is a beautiful letterjust what i should have expected from imogene my dear i will tell you what i propose remain as you are both of you for five years  five years thats sheer nonsense  five years my dear will run by like a dream five years to look back upon is as nothing  but these five years are five years to be looked forward to it is out of the question  but you say that you could not live as a married man  live i suppose we could live then he thought of the cabbages and the cottage at pau there would be seven hundred ayear i suppose  couldnt you do something frank  what to earn money no i dont think i could if i attempted to break stones i shouldnt break enough to pay for the hammers  couldnt you write a book  that would be worse than the stones i sometimes thought i could paint a picturebut if i did nobody would buy it as to making money that is hopeless i could save some by leaving off gloves and allowing myself only three clean shirts aweek  that would be dreadful frank  it would be dreadful but it is quite clear that i must do something an effort has to be made this he said with a voice the tone of which was almost heroic then they discussed the matter at great length in doing which aunt rosina thoroughly encouraged him in his heroism that idea of remaining unmarried for another short period of five years was allowed to go by the board and when they parted on that night it was understood that steps were to be taken to bring about a marriage as speedily as possible  perhaps i can do a little to help said aunt rosina in a faint whisper as frank left the room  frank houston when he showed imogenes letter to his aunt had already answered it then he waited a day or two not very patiently for a further rejoinder from imogenein which she of course was to unsay all that she had said before but when after four or five days no rejoinder had come and his fervour had been increased by his expectation then he told his aunt that he should immediately take some serious step the more ardent he was the better his aunt loved him could he have gone down and carried off his bride and married her at once in total disregard of the usual weddingcake and stgeorgeshanoversquare ceremonies to which the houston family had always been accustomed she could have found it in her heart to forgive him do not be rash frank she said he merely shook his head and as he again left her declared that he was not going to be driven this way or that by such a fellow as mudbury docimer  as i live theres frank coming through the gate this was said by imogene to her sisterinlaw as they were walking up and down the road which led from the lodge to the tregothnan house the two ladies were at that moment discussing imogenes affairs no rejoinder had as yet been made to franks last letter which to imogenes feeling was the most charming epistle which had ever come from the hands of a true lover there had been passion and sincerity in every word of iteven when he had been a little too strong in his language as he denounced the hardhearted counsels of her brother but yet she had not responded to all this sincerity nor had she as yet withdrawn the resolution which she had herself declared mrs docimer was of opinion that that resolution should not be withdrawn and had striven to explain that the circumstances were now the same as when after full consideration they had determined that the engagement should come to an end at this very moment she was speaking words of wisdom to this effect and as she did so frank appeared walking up from the gate  what will mudbury say was mrs docimers first ejaculation but imogene before she had considered how this danger might be encountered rushed forward and gave herself upi fear we must confessinto the arms of her lover after that it was felt at once that she had withdrawn all her last resolution and had vacillated again there was no ground left even for an argument now that she had submitted herself to be embraced franks words of affection need not here be repeated but they were of a nature to leave no doubt on the minds of either of the ladies  mudbury had declared that he would not receive houston in his house as his sisters lover and had expressed his opinion that even houston would not have the face to show his face there but houston had come and something must be done with him it was soon ascertained that he had walked over from penzance which was but two miles off and had left his portmanteau behind him i wouldnt bring anything said he mudbury would find it easier to maltreat my things than myself it would look so foolish to tell the man with a fly to carry them back at once is he in the house  he is about the place said mrs docimer almost trembling  is he very fierce against me  he thinks it had better be all over  i am of a different way of thinking you see i cannot acknowledge that he has any right to dictate to imogene  nor can i said imogene  of course he can turn me out  if he does i shall go with you said imogene  we have made up our minds to it said frank and he had better let us do as we please he can make himself disagreeable of course but he has got no power to prevent us now they had reached the house and frank was of course allowed to enter had he not entered neither would imogene who was so much taken by this further instance of her lovers ardour that she was determined now to be led by him in everything his explanation of that word enticed had been so thoroughly satisfactory to her that she was no longer in the least angry with herself because she had enticed him she had quite come to see that it is the duty of a young woman to entice a young man  frank and imogene were soon left alone not from any kindness of feeling on the part of mrs docimer but because the wife felt it necessary to find her husband oh mudbury who do you think has come he is here  houston  yes frank houston  in the house  he is in the house but he hasnt brought anything he doesnt mean to stay  what does that matter he shall not be asked even to dine here  if he is turned out she will go with him if she says so she will do it you cannot prevent her thats what would come of it if she were to insist on going up to london with him  he is a scoundrel  no mudburynot a scoundrel you cannot call him a scoundrel there is something firm about him isnt there  to come to my house when i told him not  but he does really love her  bother  at any rate there they are in the breakfastparlour and something must be done i couldnt tell him not to come in and she wouldnt have come without him there will be enough for them to live upon dont you think youd better docimer as he returned to the house declared that he did not think hed better but he had to confess to himself that whether it were better or whether it were worse he could do very little to prevent it  the greeting of the two men was anything but pleasant what i have got to say i would rather say outside said docimer  certainly said frank i suppose im to be allowed to return  if he does notsaid imogene who at her brothers request had left the room but still stood at the open doorif he does not i shall go to him in penzance you will hardly attempt to keep me a prisoner  who says that he is not to return i think that you are two idiots but i am quite aware that i cannot prevent you from being married if you are both determined then he led the way out through the hall and frank followed him i cannot understand that any man should be so fickle he said when they were both out on the walk together  constant i should suppose you mean  i said fickle and i meant it it was at your own suggestion that you and imogene were to be separated  no doubt it was at my suggestion and with her consent but you see that we have changed our minds  and will change them again  we are steady enough in our purpose now at any rate you hear what she says if i came down here to persuade her to alter her purposeto talk her into doing something of which you disapproved and as to which she agreed with youthen you might do something by quarreling with me but whats the use of it when she and i are of one mind you know that you cannot talk her over  where do you mean to live  ill tell you all about that if youll allow me to send into penzance for my things i cannot discuss matters with you if you proclaim yourself to be my enemy you say we are both idiots  i do  very well then you had better put up with two idiots you cant cure their idiocy nor have you any authority to prevent them from exhibiting it the argument was efficacious though the idiocy was acknowledged the portmanteau was sent for and before the evening was over frank had again been received at tregothnan as imogenes accepted lover  then frank had his story to tell and his new proposition to make aunt rosina had offered to join her means with his the house in green street no doubt was small but room it was thought could be made at any rate till the necessity had come for various cribs and various cradles i cannot imagine that you will endure to live with aunt rosina said the brother  why on earth should i object to aunt rosina said imogene she and i have always been friends in her present mood she would hardly have objected to live with any old woman however objectionable and we shall be able to have a small cottage somewhere said frank she will keep the house in london and we shall keep the cottage  and what on earth will you do with yourself  i have thought of that too said frank i shall take to painting pictures in earnestportraits probably i dont see why i shouldnt do as well as anybody else  that head of yours of old mrs jones said imogene was a great deal better than dozens of things one sees every year in the academy  bother exclaimed docimer  i dont see why he should not succeed if he really will work hard said mrs docimer  bother  why should it be bother said frank put upon his mettle ever so many fellows have begun and have got on older than i am and even if i dont earn anything ive got an employment  and is the paintingroom to be in green street also asked docimer  just at present i shall begin by copying things at the national gallery explained houston who was not as yet prepared with his answer to that difficulty as to a studio in the little house in green street  when the matter had been carried as far as this it was manifest enough that anything like opposition to imogenes marriage was to be withdrawn houston remained at tregothnan for a couple of days and then returned to london a week afterwards the docimers followed him and early in the following june the two lovers after all their troubles and many vacillations were made one at st georges church to the great delight of aunt rosina it cannot be said that the affair gave equal satisfaction to all the bridegrooms friends as may be learnt from the following narration of two conversations which took place in london very shortly after the wedding  fancy after all that fellow houston going and marrying such a girl as imogene docimer without a single blessed shilling to keep themselves alive this was said in the smokingroom of houstons club by lord john battledore to tom shuttlecock but it was said quite aloud so that houstons various acquaintances might be enabled to offer their remarks on so interesting a subject and to express their pity for the poor object of their commiseration  its the most infernal piece of folly i ever heard in my life said shuttlecock there was that tringle girl with two hundred thousand pounds to be had just for the takingtrafficks wifes sister you know  there was something wrong about that said another benjamin batsby that stupid fellow who used to be in the twentieth ran off with her just when everything had been settled between houston and old tringle  not a bit of it said battledore tringle had quarrelled with houston before that batsby did go with her but the governor wouldnt come down with the money then the girl was brought back and there was no marriage upon that the condition of poor gertrude in reference to her lovers and her fortune was discussed by those present with great warmth but they all agreed that houston had proved himself to be a bigger fool than any of them had expected  by george hes going to set up for painting portraits said lord john with great disgust  in queens gate the matter was discussed by the ladies there very much in the same spirit at this time gertrude was engaged to captain batsby if not with the full approbation at any rate with the consent both of her father and mother and therefore she could speak of frank houston and his bride if with disdain still without wounded feelings here it is in the papers francis houston and imogene docimer said mrs traffick  so she has really caught him at last said gertrude  there was not much to catch rejoined mrs traffick i doubt whether they have got £500 a year between them  it does seem so very sudden said lady tringle  sudden said gertrude they have been about it for the last five years of course he has tried to wriggle out of it all through i am glad that she has succeeded at last if only because he deserves it  i wonder where theyll find a place to live in said augusta this took place in the bedroom which mrs traffick still occupied in queens gate when she had been just a month a mother  thus with the kind assistance of aunt rosina frank houston and imogene docimer were married at last and the chronicler hereby expresses a hope that it may not be long before frank may see a picture of his own hanging on the walls of the academy and that he may live to be afraid of the coming of no baby     chapter lxi  tom tringle goes upon his travels   we must again go back and pick up our threads to april having rushed forward to be present at the wedding of frank houston and imogene docimer which did not take place till near midsummer this we must do at once in regard to tom tringle who if the matter be looked at aright should be regarded as the hero of this little history ayala indeed who is no doubt the real heroine among so many young ladies who have been more or less heroic did not find in him the angel of whom she had dreamed and whose personal appearance on earth was necessary to her happiness but he had been able very clearly to pick out an angel for himself and though he had failed in his attempts to take the angel home with him had been constant in his endeavours as long as there remained to him a chance of success he had shown himself to be foolish vulgar and ignorant he had given way to bolivian champagne and faddle intimacies he had been silly enough to think that he could bribe his ayala with diamonds for herself and charm her with cheaper jewelry on his own person he had thought to soar high by challenging his rival to a duel and had then been tempted by pot courage to strike him in the streets a very vulgar and foolish young man but a young man capable of a persistent passion young men not foolish and not vulgar are perhaps common enough but the young men of constant heart and capable of such persistency as toms are not to be found every day walking about the streets of the metropolis jonathan stubbs was constant too but it may be doubted whether the colonel ever really despaired the merit is to despair and yet to be constant when a man has reason to be assured that a young lady is very fond of him he may always hope that love will followunless indeed the love which he seeks has been already given away elsewhere moreover stubbs had many substantial supports at his back the relationship of the marchesa the friendship of lady albury the comforts of stalhamand not least if last the capabilities and prowess of croppy then too he was neither vulgar nor foolish nor ignorant tom tringle had everything against himeverything that would weigh with ayala and yet he fought his battle out to the last gasp therefore i desire my hearers to regard tom tringle as the hero of the transactions with which they have been concerned and to throw their old shoes after him as he starts away upon his grand tour  tom my boy you have to go you know in four days said his father to him at this time tom had as yet given no positive consent as to his departure he had sunk into a low state of moaning and groaning in which he refused even to accede to the doctrine of the expediency of a manly bearing whats the good of telling a lie about it he would say to his mother whats the good of manliness when a fellow would rather be drowned he had left his bed indeed and had once or twice sauntered out of the house he had been instigated by his sister to go down to his club under the idea that by such an effort he would shake off the despondency which overwhelmed him but he had failed in the attempts and had walked by the doors of the mountaineers finding himself unable to face the hallporter but still the preparations for his departure were going on it was presumed that he was to leave london for liverpool on the friday and his father had now visited him in his own room on the tuesday evening with the intention of extorting from him his final consent sir thomas had on that morning expressed himself very freely to his soninlaw mr traffick and on returning home had been glad to find that his words had been of avail at any rate as regarded the dinnerhour he was tenderhearted towards his son and disposed to tempt him rather than threaten him into obedience  i havent ever said i would go replied tom  but you must you know everything has been packed up and i want to make arrangements with you about money i have got a cabin for you to yourself and captain merry says that you will have a very pleasant passage the equinoxes are over  i dont care about the equinoxes said tom i should like bad weather if i am to go  perhaps you may have a touch of that too  if the ship could be dashed against a rock i should prefer it exclaimed tom  thats nonsense the cunard ships never are dashed against rocks by the time youve been three days at sea youll be as hungry as a hunter now tom how about money  i dont care about money said tom  dont you then youre very unlike anybody else that i meet i think i had better give you power to draw at new york san francisco yokohama pekin and calcutta  am i to go to pekin asked tom with renewed melancholy  well yesi think so you had better see what the various houses are doing in china and then from calcutta you can go up the country by that time i dare say we shall have possession of cabul with such a government as we have now thank god the russians will have been turned pretty nearly out of asia by this time next year      it has to be stated that this story was written in 1878   am i to be away more than a year  if i were you said the father glad to catch the glimmer of assent which was hereby impliedif i were you i would do it thoroughly whilst i was about it had i seen so much when i was young i should have been a better man of business  its all the same to me said tom say ten years if you like it say twenty i shant ever want to come back again where am i to go after cabul  i didnt exactly fix it that you should go to cabul of course you will write home and give me your own opinion as you travel on you will stay two or three months probably in the states  am i to go to niagara he asked  of course you will if you wish it the falls of niagara i am told are very wonderful  if a man is to drown himself said tom its the sort of place to do it effectually  oh tom exclaimed his father do you speak to me in that way when i am doing everything in my power to help you in your trouble  you cannot help me said tom  circumstances will time will do it employment will do it a sense of your dignity as a man will do it when you find yourself amongst others who know nothing of what you have suffered you revel in your grief now because those around you know that you have failed all that will be changed when you are with strangers you should not talk to your father of drowning yourself  that was wrong i know it was wrong said tom humbly i wont do it if i can help itbut perhaps i had better not go there and how long ought i to stay at yokohama perhaps you had better put it all down on a bit of paper then sir thomas endeavoured to explain to him that all that he said now was in the way of advice that it would be in truth left to himself to go almost where he liked and to stay at each place almost as long as he likedthat he would be his own master and that within some broad and undefined limits he would have as much money as he pleased to spend surely no preparations for a young mans tour were ever made with more alluring circumstances but tom could not be tempted into any expression of satisfaction  this however sir thomas did gainthat before he left his sons room it was definitely settledthat tom should take his departure on the friday going down to liverpool by an afternoon train on that day i tell you what said sir thomas ill go down with you see you on board the ship and introduce you to captain merry i shall be glad of an opportunity of paying a visit to liverpool and so the question of toms departure was settled  on the wednesday and thursday he seemed to take some interest in his bags and portmanteaus and began himself to look after those assuagements of the toils of travel which are generally dear to young men he interested himself in a fur coat in a wellarranged despatch box and in a very neat leathern case which was intended to hold two brandy flasks he consented to be told of the number of his shirts and absolutely expressed an opinion that he should want another pair of dressboots when this occurred every female bosom in the house from lady tringles down to the kitchenmaids rejoiced at the signs of recovery which evinced themselves but neither lady tringle nor the kitchenmaid nor did any of the intermediate female bosoms know how he employed himself when he left the house on that thursday afternoon he walked across the park and calling at kingsbury crescent left a note addressed to his aunt it was as followsi start tomorrow afternooni hardly know whither it may be for years or it may be for ever i should wish to say a word to ayala before i go will she see me if i come at twelve oclock exactly tomorrow morning i will call for an answer in halfanhour t t junior of course i am aware that ayala is to become the bride of colonel jonathan stubbs in halfanhour he returned and got his answer ayala will be glad to have an opportunity of saying goodbye to you tomorrow morning  from this it will be seen that ayala had at that time returned from stalham to kingsbury crescent she had come back joyful in heart thoroughly triumphant as to her angel with everything in the world sweet and happy before herdesirous if possible to work her fingers off in mending the family linen if only she could do something for somebody in return for all the joy that the world was giving her when she was told that tom wished to see her for the last timefor the last time at any rate before her marriageshe assented at once i think you should see him as he asks it said her aunt  poor tom of course i will see him and so the note was written which tom received when he called the second time at the door  at halfpast eleven he skulked out of the house in queens gate anxious to avoid his mother and sisters who were on their side anxious to devote every remaining minute of the time to his comfort and welfare i am afraid it must be acknowledged that he went with all his jewelry it could do no good at last he was aware of that but still he thought that she would like him better with his jewelry than without it stubbs wore no gems not even a ring and ayala when she saw her cousin enter the room could only assure herself that the male angels certainly were never bejewelled she was alone in the drawingroom mrs dosett having arranged that at the expiration of ten minutes which were to be allowed to tom for his private adieux she would come down to say goodbye to her nephew ayala said tom  so you are going awayfor a very long journey tom  yes ayala for a very long journey to pekin and cabul if i live through to get to those sort of places  i hope you will live through tom  thank you ayala thank you i daresay i shall they tell me i shall get over it i dont feel like getting over it now  youll find some beautiful young lady at pekin perhaps  beauty will never have any effect upon me again ayala beauty indeed think what i have suffered from beauty from the first moment in which you came down to glenbogie i have been a victim to it it has destroyed medestroyed me  i am sure you will come back quite well said ayala hardly knowing how to answer the last appeal  perhaps i may if i can only get my heart to turn to stone then i shall i dont know why i should have been made to care so much about it other people dont  and now we must say goodbye i suppose  oh yesgoodbye i did want to say one or two words if you aint in a hurry of course youll be his bride now  i hope so said ayala  i take that for granted of course i hate him  oh tom you shant say that  its human nature i can tell a lie if you want it id do anything for you but you may tell him this im very sorry i struck him  he knows that tom he has said so to me  he behaved well to mevery wellas he always does to everybody  now tom that is good of you i do like you so much for saying that  but i hate him  no  the evil spirits always hate the good ones i am conscious of an evil spirit within my bosom it is because my spirit is evil that you would not love me he is good and you love him  yes i do said ayala  and now we will change the conversation ayala i have got a little present which you must take from me  oh no said ayala thinking of the diamond necklace  its only a little thingand i hope you will then he brought out from his pocket a small brooch which he had selected from his own stock of jewelry for the occasion we are cousins you know  yes we are cousins said ayala accepting the brooch but still accepting it unwillingly  he must be very disdainful if he would object to such a little thing as this said tom referring to the colonel  he is not at all disdainful he will not object in the least i am sure of that tom i will take it then and i will wear it sometimes as a memento that we have parted like friendsas cousins should do  yes as friends said tom who thought that even that word was softer to his ear than cousins then he took her by the hand and looked into her face wistfully thinking what might be the effect if for the last and for the first time he should snatch a kiss had he done so i think she would have let it pass without rebuke under the guise of cousinship it would have been very disagreeablebut then he was going away for so long a time for so many miles but at the moment mrs dosett came in and ayala was saved goodbye he said goodbye and without waiting to take the hand which his aunt offered him he hurried out of the room out of the house and back across the gardens to queens gate  at queens gate there was an early dinner at three oclock at which sir thomas did not appear as he had arranged to come out of the city and meet his son at the railway station there were therefore sitting at the board for the last time the mother and the two sisters with the intending traveller oh tom said lady tringle as soon as the servant had left them together i do so hope you will recover  of course he will recover said augusta  why shouldnt he recover asked gertrude its all in a persons mind if hed only make up his mind not to think about her the thing would be done and there would be nothing the matter with him  there are twenty others ever so much better than ayala would have him tomorrow said his mother  and be glad to catch him said gertrude hes not like one of those who havent got anything to make a wife comfortable with  as for ayala said augusta she didnt deserve such good luck i am told that that colonel stubbs cant afford to keep any kind of carriage for her but then to be sure she has never been used to a carriage  oh tom do look up said his mother and say that you will try to be happy  hell be all right in new york said gertrude theres no place in the world they say where the girls put themselves forward so much and make things so pleasant for the young men  he will soon find some one there said augusta with a deal more to say for herself than ayala and a great deal betterlooking  i hope he will find some one who will really love him said his mother  tom sat silent while he listened to all this encouragement turning his face from one speaker to the other it was continued with many other similar promises of coming happiness and assurances that he had been a gainer in losing all that he lost when he suddenly turned sharply upon them and strongly expressed his feelings to his sisters i dont believe that either of you know anything about it he said  dont know anything about what said augusta who as a lady who had been married over twelve months and was soon about to become a mother felt that she certainly did know all about it  why dont we know as well as you asked gertrude who had also had her experiences  i dont believe you do know anything about itthats all said tom and now theres the cab goodbye mother goodbye augusta i hope youll be all right this alluded to the baby goodbye gertrude i hope youll get all right too some day this alluded to gertrudes two lovers then he left them and as he got into his cab declared to himself that neither of them had ever or would ever know anything of that special trouble which had so nearly overwhelmed himself  upon my word tom said his father walking about the vessel with him i wish i were going to new york myself with youit all looks so comfortable  yes said tom its very nice  youll enjoy yourself amazingly there is that mrs thompson has two as pretty daughters with her as ever a man wished to see tom shook his head and youre fond of smoking did you see the smokingroom theyve got everything on board these ships now upon my word i envy you the voyage  its as good as anything else i daresay said tom perhaps its better than london  then his father who had been speaking aloud to him whispered a word in his ear shake yourself tomshake yourself and get over it  i am trying said tom  love is a very good thing tom when a man can enjoy it and make himself warm with it and protect himself by it from selfishness and hardness of heart but when it knocks a mans courage out of him and makes him unfit for work and leaves him to bemoan himself theres nothing good in it its as bad as drink dont you know that i am doing the best i can for you to make a man of you  i suppose so  then shake yourself as i call it it is to be done if you set about it in earnest now god bless you my boy then sir thomas got into his boat and left his son to go upon his travels and get himself cured by a change of scene  i have no doubt that tom was cured if not before he reached new york at any rate before he left that interesting cityso that when he reached niagara which he did do in company with mrs thompson and her charming daughters he entertained no idea of throwing himself down the falls we cannot follow him on that prolonged tour to japan and china and thence to calcutta and bombay i fancy that he did not go on to cabul as before that time the ministry in england was unfortunately changed and the russians had not as yet been expelled from asiabut i have little doubt that he obtained a great deal of very useful mercantile information and that he will live to have a comfortable wife and a large family and become in the course of years the senior partner in the great house of travers and treason let us who have soft hearts now throw our old shoes after him     chapter lxii  how very much he loved her   we have seen how mr traffick was finally turned out of his fatherinlaws houseor rather not quite finally when we last saw him as he continued to sleep at queens gate for two or three nights after that until he had found shelter for his head this he did without encountering sir thomas sir thomas pretending the while to believe that he was gone and then in very truth his last pair of boots was removed but his wife remained awaiting the great occurrence with all the paternal comforts around her mr traffick having been quite right in surmising that the father would not expose his daughter in her delicate condition to the inclemencies of the weather  but this no more than natural attention on the part of the father and grandfather to the needs of his own daughter and grandchild did not in the least mitigate in the bosom of the member of parliament the wrath which he felt at his own expulsion it was not as he said to himself the fact that he was expelled but the coarseness of the language used the truth is he said to a friend in the house that though it was arranged i should remain there till after my wifes confinement i could not bear his language it will probably be acknowledged that the language was of a nature not to be borne  when therefore captain batsby went down to the house on the day of toms departure to see his counsellor he found mr traffick full rather of anger than of counsel oh yes said the member walking with the captain up and down some of the lobbies i spoke to him and told him my mind very freely when i say ill do a thing i always do it and as for tringle nobody knows him better than i it does not do to be afraid of him there is a little bit of the cur about him  what did he say  he didnt like it the truth is you know i dont mind speaking to you openly  oh no said batsby  he thinks he ought to do as well with the second girl as he has done with the first captain batsby at this opened his eyes but he said nothing having a good income of his own he thought much of it not being the younger son of a lord and not being a member of parliament he thought less of the advantages of those high privileges it did not suit him however to argue the question at the present moment he is proud of his connection with our family and looks perhaps even more than he ought to do to a seat in the house  i could get in myself if i cared for it said batsby  very likely it is more difficult than ever to find a seat just now a family connection of course does help one i had to trust to that a good deal before i was known myself  but what did sir thomas say  he made himself uncommonly disagreeablei can tell you that he couldnt very well abuse me but he wasnt very particular in what he said about you of course he was cut up about the elopement we all felt it augusta was very much hurt in her precarious state it was so likely to do a mischief  it cant be undone now  noit cant be undone but it makes one feel that you cant make a demand for money as though you set about it in the other way when i made up my mind to marry i stated what i thought i had a right to demand and i got it he knew very well that i shouldnt take a shilling less it does make a difference when he knows very well that youve got to marry the girl whether with or without money  i havent got to marry the girl at all  havent you i rather think you have old fellow it is generally considered that when a gentleman has gone off with a girl he means to marry her  not if the father comes after her and brings her back  and when he has gone afterwards to the family house and proposed himself again in the mothers presence in all this mr traffick received an unfair advantage from the communications which were made to him by his wife of course you must marry her sir thomas knows that and knowing it why should he be flush with his money i never allowed myself to say a single word they could use against me till the readymoneydown had been all settled  what was it he did say batsby was thoroughly sick of hearing his counsellor tell so many things as to his own prudence and his own success and asked the question in an angry tone  he said that he would not consider the question of money at all till the marriage had been solemnised of course he stands on his right why shouldnt he but rough as he is he isnt stingy give him his due he isnt stingy the moneys there all right and the girl is his own child youll have to wait his timethats all  and have nothing to begin with  thatll be about it i think but what does it matter batsby you are always talking about your income  no i aint not half so much as you do of your seat in parliamentwhich everybody says you are likely to lose at the next election then of course there was a quarrel mr traffick took his offended dignity back to the housealmost doubting whether it might not be his duty to bring captain batsby to the bar for contempt of privilege and the captain took himself off in thorough disgust  nevertheless there was the fact that he had engaged himself to the young lady a second time he had run away with her with the object of marrying her and had then according to his own theory in such mattersbeen relieved from his responsibility by the appearance of the father and the reabduction of the young lady as the young lady had been taken away from him it was to be supposed that the intended marriage was negatived by a proper authority when starting for brussels he was a free man and had he been wise he would have remained there or at some equally safe distance from the ladys charms then from a distance he might have made his demand for money and the elopement would have operated in his favour rather than otherwise but he had come back and had foolishly allowed himself to be persuaded to show himself at queens gate he had obeyed trafficks advice and now traffick had simply thrown him over and quarrelled with him he had too promised in the presence both of the mother and the married sister that he would marry the young lady without any regard to money he felt it all and was very angry with himself consoling himself as best he might with the reflection that sir thomass money was certainly safe and that sir thomas himself was a liberal man in his present condition it would be well for him he thought to remain inactive and see what circumstances would do for him  but circumstances very quickly became active on his return to his lodgings after leaving mr traffick he found a note from queens gate dearest benmamma wants you to come and lunch tomorrow papa has taken poor tom down to liverpool and wont be back till dinnertimeg he did not do as he was bid alleging some engagement of business but the persecution was continued in such a manner as to show him that all opposition on his part would be hopeless unless he were to proceed on some tour as prolonged as that of his future brotherinlaw come and walk at three oclock in kensington gardens tomorrow this was written on the saturday after his note had been received what use would there be in continuing a vain fight he was in their hands and the more gracefully he yielded the more probable it would be that the father would evince his generosity at an early date he therefore met his ladylove on the steps of the albert memorial whither she had managed to take herself all alone from the door of the family mansion  ben she said as she greeted him why did you not come for me to the house  i thought you would like it best  why should i like it best of course mamma knows all about it augusta would have come with me just to see me here only that she cannot walk out just at present then he said something to her about the monument expressed his admiration of the princes back abused the east wind remarked that the buds were coming on some of the trees and suggested that the broad road along by the round pond would be drier than the little paths it was not interesting as gertrude felt but she had not expected him to be interesting the interest she knew must be contributed by herself ben she said i was so happy to hear what you said to mamma the other day  what did i say  why of course that as papa has given his consent our engagement is to go on just as if  just as if what  as if we had found the clergyman at ostend  if we had done that we should have been married now suggested batsby  exactly and its almost as good as being marriedisnt it  i suppose it comes to the same thing  hadnt you better go to papa again and have it all finished  he makes himself so very unpleasant  thats only because he wants to punish us for running away i suppose it was wrong i shall never be sorry because it made me know how very very much you loved me didnt it make you feel how very very dearly i loved youto trust myself all alone with you in that way  oh yes of course  and papa cant bite you you know you go to him and tell him that you hope to be received in the house as mymy future husband you know  shall i say nothing else  you mean about the day  i was meaning about money  i dont think i would he is very generous but he does not like to be asked when augusta was to be married he arranged all that himself after they were engaged  but traffick demanded a certain sum this question captain batsby asked with considerable surprise remembering what mr traffick had said to him in reference to augustas fortune  not at all septimus knew nothing about it till after the engagement he was only too glad to get papas consent you mustnt believe all that septimus says you know you may be sure of thisthat you can trust papas generosity then before he landed her at the door in queens gate he had promised that he would make another journey to lombard street with the express purpose of obtaining sir thomass sanction to the marriageeither with or without money  how are you again said sir thomas when the captain was for the third time shown into the little back parlour have you had another trip to the continent since i saw you sir thomas was in a good humour tom had gone upon his travels mr traffick had absolutely taken himself out of the house and the millions were accommodating themselves comfortably  no sir thomas i havent been abroad since then i dont keep on going abroad constantly in that way  and what can i do for you now  of course its about your daughter i want to have your permission to consider ourselves engaged  i explained to you before that if you and gertrude choose to marry each other i shall not stand in your way  thank you sir  i dont know that it is much to thank me for only that she made a fool of herself by running away with you i should have preferred to wait till some more sensible candidate had proposed himself for her hand i dont suppose youll ever set the thames on fire  i did very well in the army  its a pity you did not remain there and then perhaps you would not have gone to ostend with my daughter as it is there she is i think she might have done better with herself but that is her fault she has made her bed and she must lie upon it  if we are to be married i hope you wont go on abusing me always sir thomas  thats as you behave you didnt suppose that i should allow such a piece of tomfoolery as that to be passed over without saying anything about it if you marry her and behave well to her i will then he paused  what will you do sir thomas  ill say as little as possible about the ostend journey  and as to money sir thomas  i think i have promised quite enough for you you are not in a position captain batsby to ask me as to moneynor is she you shall marry her without a shillingor you shall not marry her at all which is it to be i must have an end put to all this i wont have you hanging about my house unless i know the reason why are you two engaged to each other  i suppose we are said batsby lugubriously  suppose is not enough  we are said batsby courageously  very well then from this moment ostend shall be as though there werent such a seaport anywhere in europe i will never allude to the place againunless perhaps you should come and stay with me too long when i am particularly anxious to get rid of you now you had better go and settle about the time and all that with lady tringle and tell her that you mean to come and dine tomorrow or next day or whenever it suits come and dine as often as you please only do not bring your wife to live with me pertinaciously when youre not asked all this captain batsby did not understand but as he left lombard street he made up his mind that of all the men he had ever met sir thomas tringle his future fatherinlaw was the most singular hes a better fellow than traffick said sir thomas to himself when he was alone and as he has trusted me so far ill not throw him over  the captain now had no hesitation in taking himself to queens gate as he was to be married he might as well make the best of such delights as were to be found in the happy state of mutual affection my dear dearest benjamin i am so happy said lady tringle dissolved in tears as she embraced her soninlaw that was to be you will always be so dear to me in this she was quite true traffick was not dear to her she had at first thought much of mr trafficks position and noble blood but of late she too had become very tired of mr traffick augusta took almost too much upon herself and mr trafficks prolonged presence had been an eyesore captain batsby was softer and would be much more pleasant as a soninlaw even the journey to ostend had had a good effect in producing a certain humility  my dear benjamin said augusta we shall always be so happy to entertain you as a brother mr traffick has a great regard for you and said from the first that if you behaved as you ought to do after that little journey he would arrange that everything should go straight between you and papa i was quite sure that you would come forward at once as a man  but gertrudes delight was of course the strongest and gertrudes welcoming the warmestas was proper when i think of it she said to him i dont know how i should ever have looked anybody in the face againafter our going away with our things mixed up in that way  i am glad rather now that we didnt find the clergyman  oh certainly said gertrude i dont suppose anybody would have given me anything now therell be a regular wedding and of course there will be the presents  and though nothing is to be settled i suppose he will do something  and it would have been very dreadful not having a regular trousseau said gertrude mamma will of course do now just as she did about augusta he allowed her £300 only thinkif we had been married at ostend you would have had to buy things for me before the first month was out i hadnt more than halfadozen pair of stockings with me  he cant but say now that we have done as he would have us added the captain i do suppose that he will not be so unnatural as not to give something when augusta had £200000  indeed she had not but youll see that sooner or later papa will do for me quite as well as for augusta in this way they were happy together consoling each other for any little trouble which seemed for a while to cloud their joys and basking in the full sunshine of their permitted engagement  the day was soon fixed but fixed not entirely in reference to the wants of gertrude and her wedding lucy had also to be married from the same house and the day for her marriage had already been arranged sir thomas had ordered that everything should be done for lucy as though she were a daughter of the house and her wedding had been arranged for the last week in may when he heard that ayala and colonel stubbs were also engaged he was anxious that the two sisters should be buckled as he called it on the same occasionand he magnanimously offered to take upon himself the entire expense of the double arrangement intimating that the people in kingsbury crescent had hardly room enough for a wedding but ayala acting probably under stalham influences would not consent to this lady albury who was now in london was determined that ayalas marriage should take place from her own house and as aunt margaret and uncle reginald had consented that matter was considered as settled but sir thomas having fixed his mind upon a double wedding resolved that gertrude and lucy should be the joint brides gertrude who still suffered perhaps a little in public estimation from the ostend journey was glad enough to wipe out that stain as quickly as possible and did not therefore object to the arrangement but to the captain there was something in it by which his more delicate feelings were revolted it was a matter of course that ayala should be present at her sisters wedding and would naturally appear there in the guise of a bridesmaid she would also now act as a bridesmaid to gertrudeher future position as mrs colonel stubbs giving her as was supposed sufficient dignity for that honourable employment but captain batsby not so very long ago had appeared among the suitors for ayalas hand and therefore as he said to gertrude he felt a little shamefaced about it what does that signify said gertrude if you say nothing to her about it ill be bound shell say nothing to you and so it was on the day of the wedding ayala did not say a word to captain batsby nor did captain batsby say very much to ayala  on the day before his marriage captain batsby paid a fourth visit to lombard street in obedience to directions from sir thomas there my boy said he though you and gertrude did take a little journey on the sly to a place which we will not mention you shant take her altogether emptyhanded then he explained certain arrangements which he had made for endowing gertrude with an allowance which under the circumstance the bridegroom could not but feel to be liberal it must be added that considering the shortness of time allowed for getting them together the amount of wedding presents bestowed was considered by gertrude to be satisfactory as lucys were exhibited at the same time the show was not altogether mean no doubt i had twice as much as the two put together said mrs traffick to ayala up in her bedroom but then of course lord boardotrades rank would make people give     chapter lxiii  ayala again in london   after that last walk in gobblegoose wood after lady tringles unnecessary journey to stalham on the friday and the last days hunting with sir harrys houndswhich took place on the saturdayayala again became anxious to go home her anxiety was in its nature very different from that which had prompted her to leave stalham on an appointed day lest she should seem to be waiting for the coming of colonel stubbs no i dont want to run away from him any more she said to lady albury i want to be with him always and i hope he wont run away from me but ive got to be somewhere where i can think about it all for a little time  cant you think about it here  noone can never think about a thing where it has all taken place i must be up in my own little room in kingsbury crescent and must have aunt margarets work around meso that i may realise what is going to come not but what i mean to do a great deal of work always  mend his stockings  yesif he wears stockings i know he doesnt he always wears socks he told me so whatever he has ill mendor make if he wants me     i can bake and i can brew     and i can make an irish stew     wash a shirt and iron it too  then as she sang her little song she clapped her hands together  where did you get all your poetry  he taught me that we are not going to be fine peopleexcept sometimes when we may be invited to stalham but i must go on thursday lady albury i came for a week and i have been here ever since the middle of february it seems years since the old woman told me i was perverse and he said that she was right  think how much you have done since that time  yes indeed i very nearly destroyed myselfdidnt i  not very nearly  i thought i had it was only when you showed me his letter on that sunday morning that i began to have any hopes i wonder what mr greene preached about that morning i didnt hear a word i kept on repeating what he said in the postscript  was there a postscript  of course there was dont you remember  no indeed not i  the letter would have been nothing without the postscript he said that croppy was to come back for me i knew he wouldnt say that unless he meant to be good to me and yet i wasnt quite sure of it i know it now dont i but i must go lady albury i ought to let aunt margaret know all about it then it was settled that she should go on the thursdayand on the thursday she went as it was now considered quite wrong that she should travel by the railway alonein dread probably lest the old lady should tell her again how perverse she had beencolonel stubbs accompanied her it had then been decided that the wedding must take place at stalham and many messages were sent to mr and mrs dosett assuring them that they would be made very welcome on the occasion my own darling lucy will be away at that time with her own young man said ayala in answer to further invitations from lady albury  and so youve taken colonel stubbs at last said her aunt margaret  he has taken me aunt i didnt take him  but you refused him ever so often  wellyes i dont think i quite refused him  i thought you did  it was a dreadful muddle aunt margaretbut it has come right at last and we had better not talk about that part of it  i was so sure you didnt like him  not like him i always liked him better than anybody else in the world that i ever saw  dear me  of course i shouldnt say so if it hadnt come right at last i may say whatever i please about it now and i declare that i always loved him a girl can be such a fool i was i know i hope you are glad aunt  of course i am i am glad of anything that makes you happy it seemed such a pity that when so many gentlemen were falling in love with you all round you couldnt like anybody  but i did like somebody aunt margaret and i did like the bestdidnt i in answer to this mrs dosett made no reply having always had an aunts partiality for poor tom in spite of all his chains  her uncles congratulations were warmer even than her aunts  my dear girl he said i am rejoiced indeed that you should have before you such a prospect of happiness i always felt how sad for you was your residence here with two such homely persons as your aunt and myself  i have always been happy with you said ayalaperhaps straining the truth a little in her anxiety to be courteous and i know she added how much lucy and i have always owed you since poor papas death  nevertheless it has been dull for a young girl like you now you will have your own duties and if you endeavour to do them properly the world will never be dull to you and then there were some few words about the wedding we have no feeling my dear said her uncle except to do the best we can for you we should have been glad to see you married from here if that had suited but as this lover of yours has grand friends of his own i dare say their place may be the better ayala could hardly explain to her uncle that she had acceded to lady alburys proposal because by doing so she would spare him the necessary expense of the wedding  but ayalas great delight was in meeting her sister the two girls had not seen each other since the engagement of either of them had been ratified by their friends the winter and spring as passed by lucy at merle park had been very unhappy for her things at merle park had not been pleasant to any of the residents there and lucy had certainly had her share of the unpleasantness her letters to ayala had not been triumphant when aunt emmeline had more than once expressed her wish to be rid of her and when the news reached her that uncle tom and hamel had failed to be gracious to each other nor had ayala written in a spirit of joy before she had been able to recognise the angel of light in jonathan stubbs but now they were to meet after all their miseries and each could be triumphant  it was hard for them to know exactly how to begin to lucy isadore hamel was at the present moment the one hero walking the face of this sublunary globe and to ayala as we all know jonathan stubbs was an angel of light and therefore more even than a hero as each spoke the hes intended took a different personification so that to any one less interested than the young ladies themselves there might be some confusion as to which he might at that moment be under discussion it was bad said lucy when uncle tom told him to sell those magnificent conceptions of his brain by auction  i did feel for him certainly said ayala  and then when he was constrained to say that he would take me at once without any preparation because aunt emmeline wanted me to go i dont suppose any man ever behaved more beautifully than he did  yes indeed said ayala and then she felt herself constrained to change the subject by the introduction of an exaggerated superlative in her sisters narrative hamel no doubt had acted beautifully but she was not disposed to agree that nothing could be more beautiful oh lucy she said i was so miserable when he went away after that walk in the wood i thought he never would come back again when i had behaved so badly but he did was not that grand in him  i suppose he was very fond of you  i hope he was i hope he is but what should i have done if he had not come back no other man would have come back after that you never behaved unkindly to isadore  i think he would have come back a thousand times said lucy only i cannot imagine that i should ever have given him the necessity of coming back even a second but then i had known him so much longer  it wasnt that i hadnt known him long enough said ayala i seemed to know all about him almost all at once i knew how good he was and how grand he was long before i had left the marchesa up in london but i think it astounded me that such a one as he should care for me and so it went on through an entire morning each of the sisters feeling that she was bound to listen with rapt attention to the praises of the others him if she wished to have an opportunity of singing those of her own  but lucys marriage was to come first by more than two months and therefore in that matter she was allowed precedence and at her marriage ayala would be present whereas with ayalas lucy would have no personal concern though she did think that uncle tom had been worse than any vandal in that matter of selling her lovers magnificent works still she was ready to tell of his generosity in a manner of his own he had sent the money which hamel had so greatly needed and had now come forward to provide with a generous hand for the immediate necessities and more than the necessities of the wedding it was not only that she was to share the honours of the two weddingcakes with gertrude and that she was to be taken as a bride from the gorgeous mansion in queens gate but that he had provided for her bridal needs almost as fully as for those of his own daughter never mind what shell be able to do afterwards he said to his wife who ventured on some slight remonstrance with him as to the unnecessary luxuries he was preparing for the wife of a poor man she wont be the worse for having a dozen new petticoats in her trunk and if she dont want to blow her nose with as many handkerchiefs this year as gertrude does shell be able to keep them for next year then aunt emmeline obeyed without further hesitation the orders which were given her  nor was his generosity confined to the niece who for the last twelve months had been his property lucy was still living in queens gate though at this time she spent much of each day in kingsbury crescent and on one occasion she brought with her a little note from uncle tom dear ayala said the little note      as you are going to be married too you i suppose will    want some new finery i therefore send a cheque write    your name on the back of it and give it to your uncle he    will let you have the money as you want it     yours affectionately     t tringle     i hope your colonel stubbs will come and see me some day   you must go and see him she said to her colonel stubbs when he called one day in kingsbury crescent only for him i shouldnt have any clothes to speak of at all and i should have to be married in my old brown morning frock  it would be just as good as any other for my purpose said the colonel  but it wouldnt for mine sir fine feathers make fine birds and i mean to be as fine as lady alburys big peacock so if you please youll go to queens gate and lombard street too and show yourself oh jonathan i shall be so proud that everybody who knows me should see what sort of a man has chosen to love me  then there was a joint visit paid by the two sisters to mr hamels studioan expedition which was made somewhat on the sly aunt margaret in kingsbury crescent knew all about it but aunt emmeline was kept in the dark even now though the marriage was sanctioned and was so nearly at hand aunt emmeline would not have approved of such a visit she still regarded the sculptor as improperat any rate not sufficiently proper to be treated with full familiaritypartly on account of his fathers manifest improprieties and partly because of his own relative poverty and unauthorised position in the world but aunt margaret was more tolerant and thought that the sisterinlaw was entitled to visit the workshop in which her sisters future bread was to be earned and then starting from kingsbury crescent they could go in a cab whereas any such proceeding emanating from queens gate would have required the carriage there was a wickedness in this starting off in a hansom cab to call on an unmarried young man doing it in a manner successfully concealed from aunt emmeline on which ayala expatiated with delight when she next saw colonel stubbs  you dont come and call on me said the colonel  whatall the way down to aldershot i should like but i dont quite dare to do that  the visit was very successful though it was expected hamel was found in his artists costume with a blouse or loose linen tunic fitted close round his throat and fastened with a belt round his waist lucy thought that in this apparel he was certainly as handsome as could ever have been any apolloand so thinking had contrived her little plans in such a way that he should certainly be seen at his best to her thinking colonel stubbs was not a handsome man hamels hair was nearly black and she preferred dark hair hamels features were regular whereas the colonels hair was red and he was known for a large mouth and broad nose which were not obliterated though they were enlightened by the brightness of his eyes yes said ayala to herself as she looked at hamel he is very good looking but nobody would take him for an angel of light  ayala has come to see you at your work said lucy as they entered the studio  i am delighted to see her do you remember where we last met miss dormer  miss dormer indeed said ayala i am not going to call you mr hamel yes it was high up among the seats of the coliseum there has a great deal happened to us all since then  and i remember you at the bijou  i should think so i knew then so well what was going to happen said ayala  what did you know  that you and lucy were to fall in love with each other  i had done my part of it already said he  hardly that isadore said lucy or you would not have passed me in kensington gardens without speaking to me  but i did speak to you it was then i learned where to find you  that was the second time if i had remained away as i ought to have done i suppose you never would have found me  ayala was then taken round to see all those magnificent groups and figures which sir thomas would have disposed of at so many shillings apiece under the auctioneers hammer it was cruelwas it not said lucy  he never saw them you know said ayala putting in a goodnatured word for her uncle  if he had said the sculptor he would have doubted the auctioneers getting anything i have turned it all in my mind very often since and i think that sir thomas was right  i am sure he was wrong said lucy he is very goodnatured and nobody can be more grateful to another person than i am to himbut i wont agree that he was right about that  he never would have said it if he had seen them again pleaded ayala  they will never fetch anything as they are continued the sculptor and i dont suppose that when i made them i thought they would they have served their purpose and i sometimes feel inclined to break them up and have them carted away  isadore exclaimed lucy  for what purpose asked ayala  they were the lessons which i had to teach myself and the play which i gave to my imagination who wants a great figure of beelzebub like that in his house  i call it magnificent said ayala  his name is lucifernot beelzebub said lucy you call him beelzebub merely to make little of him  it is difficult to do that because he is nearly ten feet high and who wants a figure of bacchus the thing is whether having done a figure of bacchus i may not be better able to do a likeness of mr jones when he comes to sit for his bust at the request of his admiring friends for any further purpose that it will answer bacchus might just as well be broken up and carted away in the dustcart to this however the two girls expressed their vehement opposition and were of opinion that the time would come when beelzebub and bacchus transferred to marble would occupy places of honour in some wellproportioned hall built for the purpose of receiving them i shall be quite content said hamel if the whole family of the joness will have their busts done about the size of life and stand them up over their bookshelves my period for beelzebubs has gone by the visit on the whole was delightful lucy was contented with the almost more than divine beauty of her lover and the two sisters as they made their return journey to kingsbury crescent in another hansom discussed questions of art in a spirit that would have been delightful to any aspiring artist who might have heard them  then came the wedding of which some details were given at the close of the last chapter at which two brides who were very unlike to each other were joined in matrimony to two bridegrooms as dissimilar but the captain made himself gracious to the sculptor who was now to be connected with him and declared that he would always look upon lucy as a second sister to his dear gertrude and gertrude was equally gracious protesting when she was marshalled to walk up to the altar first that she did not like to go before her darling lucy but the dimensions of the church admitted but of one couple at a time and gertrude was compelled to go in advance colonel stubbs was there acting as best man to hamel while lord john battledore performed the same service for captain batsby lord john was nearly brokenhearted by the apostacy of a second chum having heard that the girl whom frank houston had not succeeded in marrying was now being taken by batsby without a shilling somebody had to bottlehold for him said lord john defending himself at the club afterwards and i didnt like to throw the fellow over though he is such a fool and there was stubbs too continued his lordship going to take the other girl without a shilling theres stubbs and houston and batsby all gone and drowned themselves its just the same as though theyd drowned themselves lord john was horrifiednay disgustedby the folly of the world nevertheless before the end of the year he was engaged to marry a very pretty girl as devoid of fortune as our ayala     chapter lxiv  ayalas marriage   now we have come to our last chapter and it may be doubted whether any readerunless he be some one specially gifted with a genius for statisticswill have perceived how very many people have been made happy by matrimony if marriage be the proper ending for a novelthe only ending as this writer takes it to be which is not discordantsurely no tale was ever so properly ended or with so full a concord as this one infinite trouble has been taken not only in arranging these marriages but in joining like to likeso that if not happiness at any rate sympathetic unhappiness might be produced our two sisters will it is trusted be happy they have chosen men from their hearts and have been chosen after the same fashion those two other sisters have been so wedded that the one will follow the idiosyncrasies of her husband and the other bring her husband to follow her idiosyncrasies without much danger of mutiny or revolt as to miss docimer there must be room for fear it may be questioned whether she was not worthy of a better lot than has been achieved for her by joining her fortunes to those of frank houston but i speaking for myself have my hopes of frank houston it is hard to rescue a man from the slough of luxury and idleness combined if anything can do it it is a cradle filled annually it may be that he will yet learn that a broad back with a heavy weight upon it gives the best chance of happiness here below of lord johns married prospects i could not say much as he came so very lately on the scene but even he may perhaps do something in the world when he finds that his nursery is filling for our special friend tom tringle no wife has been found in making his effortwhich he did manfullyhe certainly had not chosen the consort who would be fit for him he had not seen clearly as had done his sisters and cousins he had fallen in love too youngit being the nature of young men to be much younger than young ladies and not knowing himself had been as might be a barndoor cock who had set his heart upon some azureplumaged highsoaring lady of the woods the lady with the azure plumes had too her highsoaring tendencies but she was enabled by true insight to find the male who would be fit for her the barndoor cock when we left him on board the steamer going to new york had not yet learned the nature of his own requirements the knowledge will come to him there may be doubts as to frank houston but we think that there need be none as to tom tringle the proper wife will be forthcoming and in future years when he will probably have a glenbogie and a merle park of his own he will own that fortune did well for him in making his cousin ayala so stern to his prayers  but ayala herselfayala our pet heroinehad not been yet married when the last chapter was written and now there remains a page or two in which the reader must bid adieu to her as she stands at the altar with her angel of light she was at stalham for a fortnight before her marriage in order as lady albury said that the buxom ladysmaid might see that everything had been done rightly in reference to the trousseau my dear said lady albury it is important you know i dare say you can bake and brew because you say so but you dont know anything about clothes ayala who by this time was very intimate with her friend pouted her lips and said that if jonathan did not like her things as she chose to have them he might do the other thing but lady albury had her way inducing sir harry to add something even to uncle toms liberality and the buxom woman went about her task in such a fashion that if colonel stubbs were not satisfied he must have been a very unconscionable colonel he probably would know nothing about itexcept that his bride in her bridal array had not looked so well as in any other garments which i take it is invariably the casetill at the end of the first year a glimmer of the truth as to a ladys wardrobe would come upon him i told you there would be a many new dresses before two years were over miss said the buxom female as she spread all the frocks and all the worked petticoats and all the collars and all the silk stockings and all the lace handkerchiefs about the bedroom to be inspected by lady albury mrs gosling and one or two other friends before they were finally packed up  then came the day on which the colonel was to reach stalham that day being a monday whereas the wedding was to take place on wednesday it was considered to be within the bounds of propriety that the colonel should sleep at stalham on the monday under the same roof with his bride but on the tuesday it was arranged that he should satisfy the decorous feeling of the neighbourhood by removing himself to the parsonage which was distant about halfamile across the park and was contiguous to the church here lived mr greene the bachelor curate the rector of the parish being an invalid and absent in italy  i dont see why he is to be sent away after dinner to walk across the park in the dark said ayala when the matter was discussed before the colonels coming  it is a law my dear said lady albury and has to be obeyed whether you understand it or not like other laws mr greene will be with him so that no one shall run away with him in the dark then he will be able to go into church without dirtying his dress boots  but i thought there would be halfadozen carriages at least  but there wont be room in one of them for him he is to be nobody until he comes forth from the church as your husband then he is to be everybody that is the very theory of marriage                                          i think we managed it all very well between us said lady albury afterwards but you really cannot guess the trouble we took  why should there have been trouble  because you were such a perverse creature as the old lady said i am not sure that you were not right because a girl does so often raise herself in her lovers estimation by refusing him halfadozen times but you were not up to that  indeed i was not i am sure i did not intend to give any trouble to anybody  but you did only think of my going up to london to meet him and of him coming from aldershot to meet me simply that we might put our heads together how to overcome the perversity of such a young woman as you there then came a look almost of pain on ayalas brow but i do believe it was for the best in this way he came to understand how absolutely necessary you were to him  am i necessary to him  he thinks so  oh if i can only be necessary to him always but there should have been no going up to london i should have rushed into his arms at once  that would have been unusual  but so is he unusual said ayala  it is probable that the colonel did not enjoy his days at stalham before his marriage except during the hour or two in which he was allowed to take ayala out for a last walk such days can hardly be agreeable to the man of whom it is known by all around him that he is on the eve of committing matrimony there is always on such occasions a feeling of weakness as though the man had been subdued brought at length into a cage and tamed so as to be made fit for domestic purposes and deprived of his ancient freedom amongst the woodswhereas the girl feels herself to be the triumphant conqueror who has successfully performed this great act of taming such being the case the man had perhaps better keep away till he is forced to appear at the churchdoor  nevertheless our colonel did enjoy his last walk oh yes she said of course we will go to the old wood where else i am so glad that poor fox went through gobblegooseotherwise we should never have gone there and then who knows whether you and i would ever have been friends again any more  if one wood hadnt been there i think another would have been found  ah thats just it you can know that you had a purpose and perhaps were determined to carry it out  well rather  but i couldnt be sure of that i couldnt carry out my purpose even if i had one i had to doubt and to be unhappy and to hate myself because i had been perverse i declare i do think you men have so much the best of it how glorious would it have been to be able to walk straight up and say jonathan stubbs i love you better than all the world will you be my husband  but suppose the jonathan stubbs of the occasion were to decline the honour where would you be then  that would be disagreeable said ayala  it is disagreeableas you made me feel twice over  oh jonathan i am so sorry  therefore it is possible that you may have the best of it                                          and so you never will take another walk with ayala dormer she said as they were returning home  never another he replied  you cannot think how i regret it of course i am glad to become your wife i do not at all want to have it postponed but there is something so sweet in having a loverand you know that though i shall have a husband i shall never have a lover againand i never had one before jonathan there has been very little of it when a thing has been so sweet it is sad to think that it must be gone for ever then she leaned upon him with both her hands and looked up at him and smiled with her lips a little openas she knew that he liked her to lean upon him and to lookfor she had caught by her instinct the very nature of the man and knew how to witch him with her little charms ah me i wonder whether youll like me to lean upon you when a dozen years have gone by  that depends on how heavy you may be  i shall be a fat old woman perhaps but i shall lean upon youalways always what else shall i ever have to lean upon now  what else should you want  nothingnothingnothing i want nothing else i wonder whether there is anybody in all the world who has got so completely everything that she ever dreamed of wanting as i have but if you could have been only my lover for a little longer then he assured her that he would be her lover just the same even though they were husband and wife alas no there he had promised more than it is given to a man to perform faith honesty steadiness of purpose joined to the warmest love and the truest heart will not enable a husband to maintain the sweetness of that aroma which has filled with delight the senses of the girl who has leaned upon his arm as her permitted lover  what a happy fellow you are said mr greene as in the intimacy of the moment they walked across the park together  why dont you get a wife for yourself  yes with £120 ayear  with a little money you might  i dont want to have to look for the money and if i did i shouldnt get it i often think how very unfairly things are divided in this world  that will all be made up in the next  not if one covets ones neighbours wifeor even his ass said mr greene  on the return of the two lovers to the house from their walk there were mr and mrs dosett who would much rather have stayed away had they not been unwilling not to show their mark of affection to their niece i doubt whether they were very happy but they were at any rate received with every distinction sir thomas and aunt emmeline were asked but they made some excuse sir thomas knew very well that he had nothing in common with sir harry albury and as for aunt emmeline her one journey to stalham had been enough for her but sir thomas was again very liberal and sent down as his contribution to the wedding presents the very necklace which ayala had refused from her cousin tom upon my word your uncle is magnificent said lady albury upon which the whole story was told to her lucy and her husband were away on their tour as were gertrude and hers on theirs this was rather a comfort as captain batsbys presence at the house would have been a nuisance but there was quite enough of guests to make the wedding as being a country wedding very brilliant among others old tony tappett was there mindful of the manner in which cranbury brook had been ridden and of croppys presence when the hounds ran their fox into dillsborough wood i hope she be to ride with us off and on colonel said tony when the ceremony had been completed  now and then tony when we can get hold of croppy  because when they come out like that colonel its a pity to lose em just because theys got their husbands to attend to  and lord rufford was there with his wife who on this occasion was very pressing with her invitations she had heard that colonel stubbs was likely to rise high in his profession and there were symptoms of which she was an excellent judge that mrs colonel stubbs would become known as a professional beauty and larry twentyman was there who being in the neighbourhood was to his great delight invited to the breakfast  thus to her own intense satisfaction ayala was handed over to her     angel of light
