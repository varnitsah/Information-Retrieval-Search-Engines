pardon my rude assault i am a   traveller who having surveyed most of the terrestrial angles of   this globe am hither arrived to peruse this little spot    christmas ordinary   the author  worthy reader  on again taking pen in hand i would fain make a few observations at the outset by way of bespeaking a right understanding the volumes which i have already published have met with a reception far beyond my most sanguine expectations i would willingly attribute this to their intrinsic merits but in spite of the vanity of authorship i cannot but be sensible that their success has in a great measure been owing to a less flattering cause it has been a matter of marvel to my european readers that a man from the wilds of america should express himself in tolerable english i was looked upon as something new and strange in literature a kind of demisavage with a feather in his hand instead of on his head and there was a curiosity to hear what such a being had to say about civilized society  this novelty is now at an end and of course the feeling of indulgence which it produced i must now expect to bear the scrutiny of sterner criticism and to be measured by the same standard with contemporary writers and the very favor which has been shown to my previous writings will cause these to be treated with the greater rigour as there is nothing for which the world is apt to punish a man more severely than for having been overpraised on this head therefore i wish to forestall the censoriousness of the reader and i entreat he will not think the worse of me for the many injudicious things that may have been said in my commendation  i am aware that i often travel over beaten ground and treat of subjects that have already been discussed by abler pens indeed various authors have been mentioned as my models to whom i should feel flattered if i thought i bore the slightest resemblance but in truth i write after no model that i am conscious of and i write with no idea of imitation or competition in venturing occasionally on topics that have already been almost exhausted by english authors i do it not with the presumption of challenging a comparison but with the hope that some new interest may be given to such topics when discussed by the pen of a stranger  if therefore i should sometimes be found dwelling with fondness on subjects that are trite and commonplace with the reader i beg that the circumstances under which i write may be kept in recollection having been born and brought up in a new country yet educated from infancy in the literature of an old one my mind was early filled with historical and poetical associations connected with places and manners and customs of europe but which could rarely be applied to those of my own country to a mind thus peculiarly prepared the most ordinary objects and scenes on arriving in europe are full of strange matter and interesting novelty england is as classic ground to an american as italy is to an englishman and old london teems with as much historical association as mighty rome  indeed it is difficult to describe the whimsical medley of ideas that throng upon his mind on landing among english scenes he for the first time sees a world about which he has been reading and thinking in every stage of his existence the recollected ideas of infancy youth and manhood of the nursery the school and the study come swarming at once upon him and his attention is distracted between great and little objects each of which perhaps awakens an equally delightful train of remembrances  but what more especially attracts his notice are those peculiarities which distinguish an old country and an old state of society from a new one i have never yet grown familiar enough with the crumbling monuments of past ages to blunt the intense interest with which i at first beheld them accustomed always to scenes where history was in a manner in anticipation where every thing in art was new and progressive and pointed to the future rather than to the past where in short the works of man gave no ideas but those of young existence and prospective improvement there was something inexpressibly touching in the sight of enormous piles of architecture gray with antiquity and sinking intodecay i cannot describe the mute but deepfelt enthusiasm with which i have contemplated a vast monastic ruin like tintern abbey buried in the bosom of a quiet valley and shut up from the world as though it had existed merely for itself or a warrior pile like conway castle standing in stern loneliness on its rocky height a mere hollow yet threatening phantom of departed power they spread a grand and melancholy and to me an unusual charm over the landscape i for the first time beheld signs of national old age and empires decay and proofs of the transient and perishing glories of art amidst the everspringing and reviving fertility of nature  but in fact to me every thing was full of matter the footsteps of history were every where to be traced and poetry had breathed over and sanctified the land i experienced the delightful freshness of feeling of a child to whom every thing is new i pictured to myself a set of inhabitants and a mode of life for every habitation that i saw from the aristocratical mansion amidst the lordly repose of stately groves and solitary parts to the strawthatched cottage with its scanty garden and its cherished woodbine i thought i never could be sated with the sweetness and freshness of a country so completely carpeted with verdure where every air breathed of the balmy pasture and the honeysuckled hedge i was continually coming upon some little document of poetry in the blossomed hawthorn the daisy the cowslip the primrose or some other simple object that has received a supernatural value from the muse the first time that i heard the song of the nightingale i was intoxicated more by the delicious crowd of remembered associations than by the melody of its notes and i shall never forget the thrill of ecstasy with which i first saw the lark rise almost from beneath my feet and wing its musical flight up into the morning sky  in this way i traversed england a grownup child delighted by every object great and small and betraying a wondering ignorance and simple enjoyment that provoked many a stare and a smile from my wiser and more experienced fellowtravellers such too was the odd confusion of associations that kept breaking upon me as i first approached london one of my earliest wishes had been to see this great metropolis i had read so much about it in the earliest books that had been put into my infant hands and i had heard so much about it from those around me who had come from the old countries i was familiar with the names of its streets and squares and public places before i knew those of my native city it was to me the great centre of the world round which every thing seemed to revolve i recollect contemplating so wistfully when a boy a paltry little print of the thames and london bridge and st pauls that was in front of an old magazine and a picture of kensington gardens with gentlemen in threecornered hats and broad skirts and ladies in hoops and lappets that hung up in my bedroom even the venerable cut of st johns gate that has stood time out of mind in front of the gentlemans magazine was not without its charms to me and i envied the oddlooking little men that appeared to be loitering about its arches  how then did my heart warm when the towers of westminster abbey were pointed out to me rising above the rich groves of st jamess park with a thin blue haze about their gray pinnacles i could not behold this great mausoleum of what is most illustrious in our paternal history without feeling my enthusiasm in a glow with what eagerness did i explore every part of the metropolis i was not content with those matters which occupy the dignified research of the learned traveller i delighted to call up all the feelings of childhood and to seek after those objects which had been the wonders of my infancy london bridge so famous in nursery songs the farfamed monument gog and magog and the lions in the tower all brought back many a recollection of infantile delight and of good old beings now no more who had gossiped about them to my wondering ear nor was it without a recurrence of childish interest that i first peeped into mr newberrys shop in st pauls churchyard that fountainhead of literature mr newberry was the first that ever filled my infant mind with the idea of a great and good man he published all the picturebooks of the day and out of his abundant love for children he charged nothing for either paper or print and only a pennyhalfpenny for the binding  i have mentioned these circumstances worthy reader to show you the whimsical crowd of associations that are apt to beset my mind on mingling among english scenes i hope they may in some measure plead my apology should i be found harping upon stale and trivial themes or indulging an overfondness for any thing antique and obsolete i know it is the humour not to say cant of the day to run riot about old times old books old customs and old buildings with myself however as far as i have caught the contagion the feeling is genuine to a man from a young country all old things are in a manner new and he may surely be excused in being a little curious about antiquities whose native land unfortunately cannot boast of a single ruin  having been brought up also in the comparative simplicity of a republic i am apt to be struck with even the ordinary circumstances incident to an aristocratical state of society if however i should at any time amuse myself by pointing out some of the eccentricities and some of the poetical characteristics of the latter i would not be understood as pretending to decide upon its political merits my only aim is to paint characters and manners i am no politician the more i have considered the study of politics the more i have found it full of perplexity and i have contented myself as i have in my religion with the faith in which i was brought up regulating my own conduct by its precepts but leaving to abler heads the task of making converts  i shall continue on therefore in the course i have hitherto pursued looking at things poetically rather than politically describing them as they are rather than pretending to point out how they should be and endeavouring to see the world in as pleasant a light as circumstances will permit  i have always had an opinion that much good might be done by keeping mankind in goodhumour with one another i may be wrong in my philosophy but i shall continue to practise it until convinced of its fallacy when i discover the world to be all that it has been represented by sneering cynics and whining poets i will turn to and abuse it also in the meanwhile worthy reader i hope you will not think lightly of me because i cannot believe this to be so very bad a world as it is represented  thine truly  geoffrey crayon     the hall    the ancient house and the best for housekeeping in this county or   the next and though the master of it write but squire i know no   lord like him    merry beggars   the reader if he has perused the volumes of the sketchbook will probably recollect something of the bracebridge family with which i once passed a christmas i am now on another visit to the hall having been invited to a wedding which is shortly to take place the squires second son guy a fine spirited young captain in the army is about to be married to his fathers ward the fair julia templeton a gathering of relations and friends has already commenced to celebrate the joyful occasion for the old gentleman is an enemy to quiet private weddings there is nothing he says like launching a young couple gayly and cheering them from the shore a good outset is half the voyage  before proceeding any farther i would beg that the squire might not be confounded with that class of hardriding foxhunting gentlemen so often described and in fact so nearly extinct in england i use this rural title partly because it is his universal appellation throughout the neighbourhood and partly because it saves me the frequent repetition of his name which is one of those rough old english names at which frenchmen exclaim in despair  the squire is in fact a lingering specimen of the old english country gentleman rusticated a little by living almost entirely on his estate and something of a humourist as englishmen are apt to become when they have an opportunity of living in their own way i like his hobby passing well however which is a bigoted devotion to old english manners and customs it jumps a little with my own humor having as yet a lively and unsated curiosity about the ancient and genuine characteristics of my father land  there are some traits about the squires family also which appear to me to be national it is one of those old aristocratical families which i believe are peculiar to england and scarcely understood in other countries that is to say families of the ancient gentry who though destitute of titled rank maintain a high ancestral pride who look down upon all nobility of recent creation and would consider it a sacrifice of dignity to merge the venerable name of their house in a modern title  this feeling is very much fostered by the importance which they enjoy on their hereditary domains the family mansion is an old manorhouse standing in a retired and beautiful part of yorkshire its inhabitants have been always regarded through the surrounding country as the great ones of the earth and the little village near the hall looks up to the squire with almost feudal homage an old manorhouse and an old family of this kind are rarely to be met with at the present day and it is probably the peculiar humour of the squire that has retained this secluded specimen of english housekeeping in something like the genuine old style  i am again quartered in the panelled chamber in the antique wing of the house the prospect from the window however has quite a different aspect from that which it wore on my winter visit though early in the month of april yet a few warm sunshiny days have drawn forth the beauties of the spring which i think are always most captivating on their first opening the parterres of the oldfashioned garden are gay with flowers and the gardener has brought out his exotics and placed them along the stone balustrades the trees are clothed with green buds and tender leaves when i throw open my jingling casement i smell the odour of mignonette and hear the hum of the bees from the flowers against the sunny wall with the varied song of the throstle and the cheerful notes of the tuneful little wren  while sojourning in this stronghold of old fashions it is my intention to make occasional sketches of the scenes and characters before me i would have it understood however that i am not writing a novel and have nothing of intricate plot or marvellous adventure to promise the reader the hall of which i treat has for aught i know neither trapdoor nor slidingpanel nor donjonkeep and indeed appears to have no mystery about it the family is a worthy wellmeaning family that in all probability will eat and drink and go to bed and get up regularly from one end of my work to the other and the squire is so kindhearted an old gentleman that i see no likelihood of his throwing any kind of distress in the way of the approaching nuptials in a word i cannot foresee a single extraordinary event that is likely to occur in the whole term of my sojourn at the hall  i tell this honestly to the reader lest when he finds me dallying along through everyday english scenes he may hurry ahead in hopes of meeting with some marvellous adventure further on i invite him on the contrary to ramble gently on with me as he would saunter out into the fields stopping occasionally to gather a flower or listen to a bird or admire a prospect without any anxiety to arrive at the end of his career should i however in the course of my loiterings about this old mansion see or hear anything curious that might serve to vary the monotony of this everyday life i shall not fail to report it for the readers entertainment    for freshest wits i know will soon be wearie     of any book how grave so eer it be   except it have odd matter strange and merrie     well saucd with lies and glared all with glee1  footnote 1 mirror for magistrates     the busy man    a decayed gentleman who lives most upon his own mirth and my   masters means and much good do him with it he does hold my   master up with his stories and songs and catches and such tricks   and jigs you would admirehe is with him now    jovial crew   by no one has my return to the hall been more heartily greeted than by mr simon bracebridge or master simon as the squire most commonly calls him i encountered him just as i entered the park where he was breaking a pointer and he received me with all the hospitable cordiality with which a man welcomes a friend to another ones house i have already introduced him to the reader as a brisk old bachelorlooking little man the wit and superannuated beau of a large family connection and the squires factotum i found him as usual full of bustle with a thousand petty things to do and persons to attend to and in chirping goodhumour for there are few happier beings than a busy idler that is to say a man who is eternally busy about nothing  i visited him the morning after my arrival in his chamber which is in a remote corner of the mansion as he says he likes to be to himself and out of the way he has fitted it up in his own taste so that it is a perfect epitome of an old bachelors notions of convenience and arrangement the furniture is made up of odd pieces from all parts of the house chosen on account of their suiting his notions or fitting some corner of his apartment and he is very eloquent in praise of an ancient elbowchair from which he takes occasion to digress into a censure on modern chairs as having degenerated from the dignity and comfort of highbacked antiquity  adjoining to his room is a small cabinet which he calls his study here are some hanging shelves of his own construction on which are several old works on hawking hunting and farriery and a collection or two of poems and songs of the reign of elizabeth which he studies out of compliment to the squire together with the novelists magazine the sporting magazine the racing calendar a volume or two of the newgate calendar a book of peerage and another of heraldry  his sporting dresses hang on pegs in a small closet and about the walls of his apartment are hooks to hold his fishingtackle whips spurs and a favourite fowlingpiece curiously wrought and inlaid which he inherits from his grandfather he has also a couple of old singlekeyed flutes and a fiddle which he has repeatedly patched and mended himself affirming it to be a veritable cremona though i have never heard him extract a single note from it that was not enough to make ones blood run cold  from this little nest his fiddle will often be heard in the stillness of midday drowsily sawing some longforgotten tune for he prides himself on having a choice collection of good old english music and will scarcely have any thing to do with modern composers the time however at which his musical powers are of most use is now and then of an evening when he plays for the children to dance in the hall and he passes among them and the servants for a perfect orpheus  his chamber also bears evidence of his various avocations there are halfcopied sheets of music designs for needlework sketches of landscapes very indifferently executed a camera lucida a magic lantern for which he is endeavoring to paint glasses in a word it is the cabinet of a man of many accomplishments who knows a little of everything and does nothing well  after i had spent some time in his apartment admiring the ingenuity of his small inventions he took me about the establishment to visit the stables dogkennel and other dependencies in which he appeared like a general visiting the different quarters of his camp as the squire leaves the control of all these matters to him when he is at the hall he inquired into the state of the horses examined their feet prescribed a drench for one and bleeding for another and then took me to look at his own horse on the merits of which he dwelt with great prolixity and which i noticed had the best stall in the stable  after this i was taken to a new toy of his and the squires which he termed the falconry where there were several unhappy birds in durance completing their education among the number was a fine falcon which master simon had in especial training and he told me that he would show me in a few days some rare sport of the good oldfashioned kind in the course of our round i noticed that the grooms gamekeeper whippersin and other retainers seemed all to be on somewhat of a familiar footing with master simon and fond of having a joke with him though it was evident they had great deference for his opinion in matters relating to their functions  there was one exception however in a testy old huntsman as hot as a peppercorn a meagre wiry old fellow in a threadbare velvet jockey cap and a pair of leather breeches that from much wear shone as though they had been japanned he was very contradictory and pragmatical and apt as i thought to differ from master simon now and then out of mere captiousness this was particularly the case with respect to the treatment of the hawk which the old man seemed to have under his peculiar care and according to master simon was in a fair way to ruin the latter had a vast deal to say about casting and imping and gleaming and enseaming and giving the hawk the rangle which i saw was all heathen greek to old christy but he maintained his point notwithstanding and seemed to hold all this technical lore in utter disrespect  i was surprised with the goodhumour with which master simon bore his contradictions till he explained the matter tom e afterwards old christy is the most ancient servant in the place having lived among dogs and horses the greater part of a century and been in the service of mr bracebridges father he knows the pedigree of every horse on the place and has bestrode the greatgreatgrandsires of most of them he can give a circumstantial detail of every foxhunt for the last sixty or seventy years and has a history for every stags head about the house and every hunting trophy nailed to the door of the dogkennel  all the present race have grown up under his eye and humour him in his old age he once attended the squire to oxford when he was a student there and enlightened the whole university with his hunting lore all this is enough to make the old man opinionated since he finds on all these matters of firstrate importance he knows more than the rest of the world indeed master simon had been his pupil and acknowledges that he derived his first knowledge in hunting from the instructions of christy and i much question whether the old man does not still look upon him rather as a greenhorn  on our return homewards as we were crossing the lawn in front of the house we heard the porters bell ring at the lodge and shortly afterwards a kind of cavalcade advanced slowly up the avenue at sight of it my companion paused considered it for a moment and then making a sudden exclamation hurried away to meet it as it approached i discovered a fair freshlooking elderly lady dressed in an oldfashioned ridinghabit with a broadbrimmed white beaver hat such as may be seen in sir joshua reynolds paintings she rode a sleek white pony and was followed by a footman in rich livery mounted on an overfed hunter at a little distance in the rear came an ancient cumbrous chariot drawn by two very corpulent horses driven by as corpulent a coachman beside whom sat a page dressed in a fanciful green livery inside of the chariot was a starched prim personage with a look somewhat between a ladys companion and a ladys maid and two pampered curs that showed their ugly faces and barked out of each window  there was a general turning out of the garrison to receive this new comer the squire assisted her to alight and saluted her affectionately the fair julia flew into her arms and they embraced with the romantic fervour of boardingschool friends she was escorted into the house by julias lover towards whom she showed distinguished favour and a line of the old servants who had collected in the hall bowed most profoundly as she passed  i observed that master simon was most assiduous and devout in his attentions upon this old lady he walked by the side of her pony up the avenue and while she was receiving the salutations of the rest of the family he took occasion to notice the fat coachman to pat the sleek carriage horses and above all to say a civil word to my ladys gentlewoman the prim sourlooking vestal in the chariot  i had no more of his company for the rest of the morning he was swept off in the vortex that followed in the wake of this lady once indeed he paused for a moment as he was hurrying on some errand of the good ladys to let me know that this was lady lillycraft a sister of the squires of large fortune which the captain would inherit and that her estate lay in one of the best sporting counties in all england     family servants    verily old servants are the vouchers of worthy housekeeping they   are like rats in a mansion or mites in a cheese bespeaking the   antiquity and fatness of their abode   in my casual anecdotes of the hall i may often he tempted to dwell on circumstances of a trite and ordinary nature from their appearing to me illustrative of genuine national character it seems to be the study of the squire to adhere as much as possible to what he considers the old landmarks of english manners his servants all understand his ways and for the most part have been accustomed to them from infancy so that upon the whole his household presents one of the few tolerable specimens that can now be met with of the establishment of an english country gentleman of the old school  by the by the servants are not the least characteristic part of the household the housekeeper for instance has been born and brought up at the hall and has never been twenty miles from it yet she has a stately air that would not disgrace a lady that had figured at the court of queen elizabeth  i am half inclined to think that she has caught it from living so much among the old family pictures it may however be owing to a consciousness of her importance in the sphere in which she has always moved for she is greatly respected in the neighbouring village and among the farmers wives and has high authority in the household ruling over the servants with quiet but undisputed sway  she is a thin old lady with blue eyes and pointed nose and chin her dress is always the same as to fashion she wears a small wellstarched ruff a laced stomacher full petticoats and a gown festooned and open in front which on particular occasions is of ancient silk the legacy of some former dame of the family or an inheritance from her mother who was housekeeper before her i have a reverence for these old garments as i make no doubt they have figured about these apartments in days long past when they have set off the charms of some peerless family beauty and i have sometimes looked from the old housekeeper to the neighbouring portraits to see whether i could not recognize her antiquated brocade in the dress of some one of those longwaisted dames that smile on me from the walls  her hair which is quite white is frizzed out in front and she wears over it a small cap nicely plaited and brought down under the chin her manners are simple and primitive heightened a little by a proper dignity of station  the hall is her world and the history of the family the only history she knows excepting that which she has read in the bible she can give a biography of every portrait in the picture gallery and is a complete family chronicle  she is treated with great consideration by the squire indeed master simon tells me that there is a traditional anecdote current among the servants of the squires having been seen kissing her in the picture gallery when they were both young as however nothing further was ever noticed between them the circumstance caused no great scandal only she was observed to take to reading pamela shortly afterwards and refused the hand of the village innkeeper whom she had previously smiled on  the old butler who was formerly footman and a rejected admirer of hers used to tell the anecdote now and then at those little cabals that will occasionally take place among the most orderly servants arising from the common propensity of the governed to talk against administration but he has left it off of late years since he has risen into place and shakes his head rebukingly when it is mentioned  it is certain that the old lady will to this day dwell on the looks of the squire when he was a young man at college and she maintains that none of his sons can compare with their father when he was of their age and was dressed out in his full suit of scarlet with his hair craped and powdered and his threecornered hat  she has an orphan niece a pretty softhearted baggage named phoebe wilkins who has been transplanted to the hall within a year or two and been nearly spoiled for any condition of life she is a kind of attendant and companion of the fair julias and from loitering about the young ladys apartments reading scraps of novels and inheriting secondhand finery has become something between a waitingmaid and a slipshod fine lady  she is considered a kind of heiress among the servants as she will inherit all her aunts property which if report be true must be a round sum of good golden guineas the accumulated wealth of two housekeepers savings not to mention the hereditary wardrobe and the many little valuables and knickknacks treasured up in the housekeepers room indeed the old housekeeper has the reputation among the servants and the villagers of being passing rich and there is a japanned chest of drawers and a large ironbound coffer in her room which are supposed by the housemaids to hold treasures of wealth  the old lady is a great friend of master simon who indeed pays a little court to her as to a person high in authority and they have many discussions on points of family history in which notwithstanding his extensive information and pride of knowledge he commonly admits her superior accuracy he seldom returns to the hall after one of his visits to the other branches of the family without bringing mrs wilkins some remembrance from the ladies of the house where he has been staying  indeed all the children of the house look up to the old lady with habitual respect and attachment and she seems almost to consider them as her own from their having grown up under her eye the oxonian however is her favourite probably from being the youngest though he is the most mischievous and has been apt to play tricks upon her from boyhood  i cannot help mentioning one little ceremony which i believe is peculiar to the hall after the cloth is removed at dinner the old housekeeper sails into the room and stands behind the squires chair when he fills her a glass of wine with his own hands in which she drinks the health of the company in a truly respectful yet dignified manner and then retires the squire received the custom from his father and has always continued it  there is a peculiar character about the servants of old english families that reside principally in the country they have a quiet orderly respectful mode of doing their duties they are always neat in their persons and appropriately and if i may use the phrase technically dressed they move about the house without hurry or noise there is nothing of the bustle of employment or the voice of command nothing of that obtrusive housewifery that amounts to a torment you are not persecuted by the process of making you comfortable yet every thing is done and is done well the work of the house is performed as if by magic but it is the magic of system nothing is done by fits and starts nor at awkward seasons the whole goes on like welloiled clockwork where there is no noise nor jarring in its operations  english servants in general are not treated with great indulgence nor rewarded by many commendations for the english are laconic and reserved toward their domestics but an approving nod and a kind word from master or mistress goes as far here as an excess of praise or indulgence elsewhere neither do servants often exhibit any animated marks of affection to their employers yet though quiet they are strong in their attachments and the reciprocal regard of masters and servants though not ardently expressed is powerful and lasting in old english families  the title of an old family servant carries with it a thousand kind associations in all parts of the world and there is no claim upon the homebred charities of the heart more irresistible than that of having been born in the house it is common to see grayheaded domestics of this kind attached to an english family of the old school who continue in it to the day of their death in the enjoyment of steady unaffected kindness and the performance of faithful unofficious duty i think such instances of attachment speak well for both master and servant and the frequency of them speaks well for national character  these observations however hold good only with families of the description i have mentioned and with such as are somewhat retired and pass the greater part of their time in the country  as to the powdered menials that throng the halls of fashionable town residences they equally reflect the character of the establishments to which they belong and i know no more complete epitomes of dissolute heartlessness and pampered inutility  but the good old family servantthe one who has always been linked in idea with the home of our heart who has led us to school in the days of prattling childhood who has been the confidant of our boyish cares and schemes and enterprises who has hailed us as we came home at vacations and been the promoter of all our holiday sports who when we in wandering manhood have left the paternal roof and only return thither at intervalswill welcome us with a joy inferior only to that of our parents who now grown gray and infirm with age still totters about the house of our fathers in fond and faithful servitude who claims us in a manner as his own and hastens with querulous eagerness to anticipate his fellowdomestics in waiting upon us at table and who when we retire at night to the chamber that still goes by our name will linger about the room to have one more kind look and one more pleasant word about times that are pastwho does not experience towards such a being a feeling of almost filial affection  i have met with several instances of epitaphs on the gravestones of such valuable domestics recorded with the simple truth of natural feeling i have two before me at this moment one copied from a tombstone of a churchyard in warwickshire  here lieth the body of joseph batte confidential servant to george birch esq of hamstead hall his grateful friend and master caused this inscription to be written in memory of his discretion fidelity diligence and continence he died a bachelor aged 84 having lived 44 years in the same family  the other was taken from a tombstone in eltham churchyard  here lie the remains of mr james tappy who departed this life on the 8th of september 1818 aged 84 after a faithful service of 60 years in one family by each individual of which he lived respected and died lamented by the sole survivor  few monuments even of the illustrious have given me the glow about the heart that i felt while copying this honest epitaph in the churchyard of eltham i sympathized with this sole survivor of a family mourning over the grave of the faithful follower of his race who had been no doubt a living memento of times and friends that had passed away and in considering this record of long and devoted service i called to mind the touching speech of old adam in as you like it when tottering after the youthful son of his ancient master    master go on and i will follow thee   to the last gasp with love and loyalty  notei cannot but mention a tablet which i have seen somewhere in the chapel of windsor castle put up by the late king to the memory of a family servant who had been a faithful attendant of his lamented daughter the princess amelia george iii possessed much of the strong domestic feeling of the old english country gentleman and it is an incident curious in monumental history and creditable to the human heart a monarch erecting a monument in honour of the humble virtues of a menial     the widow    she was so charitable and pitious   she would weep if that she saw a mous   caught in a trap if it were dead or wed   of small hounds had she that she fed   with rost flesh milke and wastel bread   but sore wept she if any of them were dead   or if man smote them with a yard smart    chaucer   notwithstanding the whimsical parade made by lady lillycraft on her arrival she has none of the petty stateliness that i had imagined but on the contrary she has a degree of nature and simpleheartedness if i may use the phrase that mingles well with her oldfashioned manners and harmless ostentation she dresses in rich silks with long waist she rouges considerably and her hair which is nearly white is frizzed out and put up with pins her face is pitted with the smallpox but the delicacy of her features shows that she may once have been beautiful and she has a very fair and wellshaped hand and arm of which if i mistake not the good lady is still a little vain  i have had the curiosity to gather a few particulars concerning her she was a great belle in town between thirty and forty years since and reigned for two seasons with all the insolence of beauty refusing several excellent offers when unfortunately she was robbed of her charms and her lovers by an attack of the smallpox she retired immediately into the country where she some time after inherited an estate and married a baronet a former admirer whose passion had suddenly revived having as he said always loved her mind rather than her person  the baronet did not enjoy her mind and fortune above six months and had scarcely grown very tired of her when he broke his neck in a foxchase and left her free rich and disconsolate she has remained on her estate in the country ever since and has never shown any desire to return to town and revisit the scene of her early triumphs and fatal malady all her favourite recollections however revert to that short period of her youthful beauty she has no idea of town but as it was at that time and continually forgets that the place and people must have changed materially in the course of nearly half a century she will often speak of the toasts of those days as if still reigning and until very recently used to talk with delight of the royal family and the beauty of the young princes and princesses she cannot be brought to think of the present king otherwise than as an elegant young man rather wild but who danced a minuet divinely and before he came to the crown would often mention him as the sweet young prince  she talks also of the walks in kensington garden where the gentlemen appeared in goldlaced coats and cocked hats and the ladies in hoops and swept so proudly along the grassy avenues and she thinks the ladies let themselves sadly down in their dignity when they gave up cushioned headdresses and highheeled shoes she has much to say too of the officers who were in the train of her admirers and speaks familiarly of many wild young blades that are now perhaps hobbling about wateringplaces with crutches and gouty shoes  whether the taste the good lady had of matrimony discouraged her or not i cannot say but though her merits and her riches have attracted many suitors she has never been tempted to venture again into the happy state this is singular too for she seems of a most soft and susceptible heart is always talking of love and connubial felicity and is a great stickler for oldfashioned gallantry devoted attentions and eternal constancy on the part of the gentlemen she lives however after her own taste her house i am told must have been built and furnished about the time of sir charles grandison every thing about it is somewhat formal and stately but has been softened down into a degree of voluptuousness characteristic of an old lady very tenderhearted and romantic and that loves her ease the cushions of the great armchairs and wide sofas almost bury you when you sit down on them flowers of the most rare and delicate kind are placed about the rooms and on little japanned stands and sweet bags lie about the tables and mantelpieces the house is full of pet dogs angora cats and singing birds who are as carefully waited upon as she is herself  she is dainty in her living and a little of an epicure living on white meats and little ladylike dishes though her servants have substantial old english fare as their looks bear witness indeed they are so indulged that they are all spoiled and when they lose their present place they will be fit for no other her ladyship is one of those easytempered beings that are always doomed to be much liked but ill served by their domestics and cheated by all the world  much of her time is passed in reading novels of which she has a most extensive library and has a constant supply from the publishers in town her erudition in this line of literature is immense she has kept pace with the press for half a century her mind is stuffed with lovetales of all kinds from the stately amours of the old books of chivalry down to the last bluecovered romance reeking from the press though she evidently gives the preference to those that came out in the days of her youth and when she was first in love she maintains that there are no novels written nowadays equal to pamela and sir charles grandison and she places the castle of otranto at the head of all romances  she does a vast deal of good in her neighbourhood and is imposed upon by every beggar in the county she is the benefactress of a village adjoining to her estate and takes an especial interest in all its loveaffairs she knows of every courtship that is going on every lovelorn damsel is sure to find a patient listener and a sage adviser in her ladyship she takes great pains to reconcile all lovequarrels and should any faithless swain persist in his inconstancy he is sure to draw on himself the good ladys violent indignation  i have learned these particulars partly from frank bracebridge and partly from master simon i am now able to account for the assiduous attention of the latter to her ladyship her house is one of his favourite resorts where he is a very important personage he makes her a visit of business once a year when he looks into all her affairs which as she is no manager are apt to get into confusion he examines the books of the overseer and shoots about the estate which he says is well stocked with game notwithstanding that it is poached by all the vagabonds in the neighbourhood  it is thought as i before hinted that the captain will inherit the greater part of her property having always been her chief favourite for in fact she is partial to a red coat she has now come to the hall to be present at his nuptials having a great disposition to interest herself in all matters of love and matrimony     the lovers    rise up my love my fair one and come away for lo the winter   is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the   earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of   the turtle is heard in the land    song of solomon   to a man who is a little of a philosopher and a bachelor to boot and who by dint of some experience in the follies of life begins to look with a learned eye upon the ways of man and eke of woman to such a man i say there is something very entertaining in noticing the conduct of a pair of young lovers it may not be as grave and scientific a study as the loves of the plants but it is certainly as interesting  i have therefore derived much pleasure since my arrival at the hall from observing the fair julia and her lover she has all the delightful blushing consciousness of an artless girl inexperienced in coquetry who has made her first conquest while the captain regards her with that mixture of fondness and exultation with which a youthful lover is apt to contemplate so beauteous a prize  i observed them yesterday in the garden advancing along one of the retired walks the sun was shining with delicious warmth making great masses of bright verdure and deep blue shade the cuckoo that harbinger of spring was faintly heard from a distance the thrush piped from the hawthorn and the yellow butterflies sported and toyed and coquetted in the air  the fair julia was leaning on her lovers arm listening to his conversation with her eyes cast down a soft blush on her cheek and a quiet smile on her lips while in the hand that hung negligently by her side was a bunch of flowers in this way they were sauntering slowly along and when i considered them and the scene in which they were moving i could not but think it a thousand pities that the season should ever change or that young people should ever grow older or that blossoms should give way to fruit or that lovers should ever get married  from what i have gathered of family anecdote i understand that the fair julia is the daughter of a favourite college friend of the squire who after leaving oxford had entered the army and served for many years in india where he was mortally wounded in a skirmish with the natives in his last moments he had with a faltering pen recommended his wife and daughter to the kindness of his early friend  the widow and her child returned to england helpless and almost hopeless when mr bracebridge received accounts of their situation he hastened to their relief he reached them just in time to soothe the last moments of the mother who was dying of a consumption and to make her happy in the assurance that her child should never want a protector  the good squire returned with his prattling charge to his stronghold where he had brought her up with a tenderness truly paternal as he has taken some pains to superintend her education and form her taste she has grown up with many of his notions and considers him the wisest as well as the best of men much of her time too has been passed with lady lillycraft who has instructed her in the manners of the old school and enriched her mind with all kinds of novels and romances indeed her ladyship has had a great hand in promoting the match between julia and the captain having had them together at her countryseat the moment she found there was an attachment growing up between them the good lady being never so happy as when she has a pair of turtles cooing about her  i have been pleased to see the fondness with which the fair julia is regarded by the old servants at the hall she has been a pet with them from childhood and every one seems to lay some claim to her education so that it is no wonder that she should be extremely accomplished the gardener taught her to rear flowers of which she is extremely fond old christy the pragmatical huntsman softens when she approaches and as she sits lightly and gracefully in her saddle claims the merit of having taught her to ride while the housekeeper who almost looks upon her as a daughter intimates that she first gave her an insight into the mysteries of the toilet having been dressingmaid in her young days to the late mrs bracebridge i am inclined to credit this last claim as i have noticed that the dress of the young lady had an air of the old school though managed with native taste and that her hair was put up very much in the style of sir peter lelys portraits in the picture gallery  her very musical attainments partake of this oldfashioned character and most of her songs are such as are not at the present day to be found on the piano of a modern performer i have however seen so much of modern fashions modern accomplishments and modern fine ladies that i relish this tinge of antiquated style in so young and lovely a girl and i have had as much pleasure in hearing her warble one of the old songs of herrick or carew or suckling adapted to some simple old melody as i have had from listening to a lady amateur skylark it up and down through the finest bravura of rossini or mozart we have very pretty music in the evenings occasionally between her and the captain assisted sometimes by master simon who scrapes dubiously on his violin being very apt to get out and to halt a note or two in the rear sometimes he even thrums a little on the piano and takes a part in a trio in which his voice can generally be distinguished by a certain quavering tone and an occasional false note  i was praising the fair julias performance to him after one of her songs when i found he took to himself the whole credit of having formed her musical taste assuring me that she was very apt and indeed summing up her whole character in his knowing way by adding that she was a very nice girl and had no nonsense about her     family reliques    my infelices face her brow her eye   the dimple on her cheek and such sweet skill   hath from the cunning workmans pencil flown   these lips look fresh and lively as her own   false colours last after the true be dead   of all the roses grafted on her cheeks   of all the graces dancing in her eyes   of all the music set upon her tongue   of all that was past womans excellence   in her white bosom look a painted board   circumscribes all    dekker   an old english family mansion is a fertile subject for study it abounds with illustrations of former times and traces of the tastes and humours and manners of successive generations the alterations and additions in different styles of architecture the furniture plate pictures hangings the warlike and sporting implements of different ages and fancies all furnish food for curious and amusing speculation as the squire is very careful in collecting and preserving all family reliques the hall is full of remembrances of the kind in looking about the establishment i can picture to myself the characters and habits that have prevailed at different eras of the family history i have mentioned on a former occasion the armour of the crusader which hangs up in the hall there are also several jackboots with enormously thick soles and high heels that belonged to a set of cavaliers who filled the hall with the din and stir of arms during the time of the covenanters a number of enormous drinking vessels of antique fashion with huge venice glasses and greenhockglasses with the apostles in relief on them remain as monuments of a generation or two of hard livers that led a life of roaring revelry and first introduced the gout into the family  i shall pass over several more such indications of temporary tastes of the squires predecessors but i cannot forbear to notice a pair of antlers in the great hall which is one of the trophies of a hardriding squire of former times who was the nimrod of these parts there are many traditions of his wonderful feats in hunting still existing which are related by old christy the huntsman who gets exceedingly nettled if they are in the least doubted indeed there is a frightful chasm a few miles from the hall which goes by the name of the squires leap from his having cleared it in the ardour of the chase there can be no doubt of the fact for old christy shows the very dints of the horses hoofs on the rocks on each side of the chasm  master simon holds the memory of this squire in great veneration and has a number of extraordinary stories to tell concerning him which he repeats at all hunting dinners and i am told that they wax more and more marvellous the older they grow he has also a pair of rippon spurs which belonged to this mighty hunter of yore and which he only wears on particular occasions  the place however which abounds most with mementos of past times is the picture gallery and there is something strangely pleasing though melancholy in considering the long rows of portraits which compose the greater part of the collection they furnish a kind of narrative of the lives of the family worthies which i am enabled to read with the assistance of the venerable housekeeper who is the family chronicler prompted occasionally by master simon there is the progress of a fine lady for instance through a variety of portraits one represents her as a little girl with a long waist and hoop holding a kitten in her arms and ogling the spectator out of the corners of her eyes as if she could not turn her head in another we find her in the freshness of youthful beauty when she was a celebrated belle and so hardhearted as to cause several unfortunate gentlemen to run desperate and write bad poetry in another she is depicted as a stately dame in the maturity of her charms next to the portrait of her husband a gallant colonel in fullbottomed wig and goldlaced hat who was killed abroad and finally her monument is in the church the spire of which may be seen from the window where her effigy is carved in marble and represents her as a venerable dame of seventysix  in like manner i have followed some of the family great men through a series of pictures from early boyhood to the robe of dignity or truncheon of command and so on by degrees until they were garnered up in the common repository the neighbouring church  there is one group that particularly interested me it consisted of four sisters of nearly the same age who flourished about a century since and if i may judge from their portraits were extremely beautiful i can imagine what a scene of gayety and romance this old mansion must have been when they were in the heyday of their charms when they passed like beautiful visions through its halls or stepped daintily to music in the revels and dances of the cedar gallery or printed with delicate feet the velvet verdure of these lawns how must they have been looked up to with mingled love and pride and reverence by the old family servants and followed with almost painful admiration by the aching eyes of rival admirers how must melody and song and tender serenade have breathed about these courts and their echoes whispered to the loitering tread of lovers how must these very turrets have made the hearts of the young galliards thrill as they first discerned them from afar rising from among the trees and pictured to themselves the beauties casketed like gems within these walls indeed i have discovered about the place several faint records of this reign of love and romance when the hall was a kind of court of beauty  several of the old romances in the library have marginal notes expressing sympathy and approbation where there are long speeches extolling ladies charms or protesting eternal fidelity or bewailing the cruelty of some tyrannical fair one the interviews and declarations and parting scenes of tender lovers also bear the marks of having been frequently read and are scored and marked with notes of admiration and have initials written on the margins most of which annotations have the day of the month and year annexed to them several of the windows too have scraps of poetry engraved on them with diamonds taken from the writings of the fair mrs philips the once celebrated orinda some of these seem to have been inscribed by lovers and others in a delicate and unsteady hand and a little inaccurate in the spelling have evidently been written by the young ladies themselves or by female friends who have been on visits to the hall mrs philips seems to have been their favourite author and they have distributed the names of her heroes and heroines among their circle of intimacy sometimes in a male hand the verse bewails the cruelty of beauty and the sufferings of constant love while in a female hand it prudishly confines itself to lamenting the parting of female friends the bowwindow of my bedroom which has doubtless been inhabited by one of these beauties has several of these inscriptions i have one at this moment before my eyes called camilla parting with leonora    how perishd is the joy thats past     the present how unsteady   what comfort can be great and last     when this is gone already  and close by it is another written perhaps by some adventurous lover who had stolen into the ladys chamber during her absence    theodosius to camilla    id rather in your favour live     than in a lasting name   and much a greater rate would give     for happiness than fame    theodosius 1700  when i look at these faint records of gallantry and tenderness when i contemplate the fading portraits of these beautiful girls and think too that they have long since bloomed reigned grown old died and passed away and with them all their graces their triumphs their rivalries their admirers the whole empire of love and pleasure in which they ruledall dead all buried all forgotten i find a cloud of melancholy stealing over the present gayeties around me i was gazing in a musing mood this very morning at the portrait of the lady whose husband was killed abroad when the fair julia entered the gallery leaning on the arm of the captain the sun shone through the row of windows on her as she passed along and she seemed to beam out each time into brightness and relapse into shade until the door at the bottom of the gallery closed after her i felt a sadness of heart at the idea that this was an emblem of her lot a few more years of sunshine and shade and all this life and loveliness and enjoyment will have ceased and nothing be left to commemorate this beautiful being but one more perishable portrait to awaken perhaps the trite speculations of some future loiterer like myself when i and my scribblings shall have lived through our brief existence and been forgotten     an old soldier    ive worn some leather out abroad let out a heathen soul or two fed   this good sword with the black blood of pagan christians converted   a few infidels with itbut let that pass    the ordinary   the hall was thrown into some little agitation a few days since by the arrival of general harbottle he had been expected for several days and had been looked for rather impatiently by several of the family master simon assured me that i would like the general hugely for he was a blade of the old school and an excellent table companion lady lillycraft also appeared to be somewhat fluttered on the morning of the generals arrival for he had been one of her early admirers and she recollected him only as a dashing young ensign just come upon the town she actually spent an hour longer at her toilette and made her appearance with her hair uncommonly frizzed and powdered and an additional quantity of rouge she was evidently a little surprised and shocked therefore at finding the lithe dashing ensign transformed into a corpulent old general with a double chin though it was a perfect picture to witness their salutations the graciousness of her profound curtsy and the air of the old school with which the general took off his hat swayed it gently in his hand and bowed his powdered head  all this bustle and anticipation has caused me to study the general with a little more attention than perhaps i should otherwise have done and the few days that he has already passed at the hall have enabled me i think to furnish a tolerable likeness of him to the reader  he is as master simon observed a soldier of the old school with powdered head side locks and pigtail his face is shaped like the stern of a dutch manofwar narrow at top and wide at bottom with full rosy cheeks and a double chin so that to use the cant of the day his organs of eating may be said to be powerfully developed  the general though a veteran has seen very little active service except the taking of seringapatam which forms an era in his history he wears a large emerald in his bosom and a diamond on his finger which he got on that occasion and whoever is unlucky enough to notice either is sure to involve himself in the whole history of the siege to judge from the generals conversation the taking of seringapatam is the most important affair that has occurred for the last century  on the approach of warlike times on the continent he was rapidly promoted to get him out of the way of younger officers of merit until having been hoisted to the rank of general he was quietly laid on the shelf since that time his campaigns have been principally confined to wateringplaces where he drinks the waters for a slight touch of the liver which he got in india and plays whist with old dowagers with whom he has flirted in his younger days indeed he talks of all the fine women of the last half century and according to hints which he now and then drops has enjoyed the particular smiles of many of them  he has seen considerable garrison duty and can speak of almost every place famous for good quarters and where the inhabitants give good dinners he is a diner out of firstrate currency when in town being invited to one place because he has been seen at another in the same way he is invited about the countryseats and can describe half the seats in the kingdom from actual observation nor is any one better versed in court gossip and the pedigrees and intermarriages of the nobility  as the general is an old bachelor and an old beau and there are several ladies at the hall especially his quondam flame lady jocelyne he is put rather upon his gallantry he commonly passes some time therefore at his toilette and takes the field at a late hour every morning with his hair dressed out and powdered and a rose in his buttonhole after he has breakfasted he walks up and down the terrace in the sunshine humming an air and hemming between every stave carrying one hand behind his back and with the other touching his cane to the ground and then raising it up to his shoulder should he in these morning promenades meet any of the elder ladies of the family as he frequently does lady lillycraft his hat is immediately in his hand and it is enough to remind one of those courtly groups of ladies and gentlemen in old prints of windsor terrace or kensington garden  he talks frequently about the service and is fond of humming the old song    why soldiers why   should we be melancholy boys   why soldiers why   whose business t is to die  i cannot discover however that the general has ever run any great risk of dying excepting from an apoplexy or an indigestion he criticises all the battles on the continent and discusses the merits of the commanders but never fails to bring the conversation ultimately to tippoo saib and seringapatam i am told that the general was a perfect champion at drawingrooms parades and wateringplaces during the late war and was looked to with hope and confidence by many an old lady when labouring under the terror of buonapartes invasion  he is thoroughly loyal and attends punctually on levees when in town he has treasured up many remarkable sayings of the late king particularly one which the king made to him on a fieldday complimenting him on the excellence of his horse he extols the whole royal family but especially the present king whom he pronounces the most perfect gentleman and best whistplayer in europe the general swears rather more than is the fashion of the present day but it was the mode in the old school he is however very strict in religious matters and a staunch churchman he repeats the responses very loudly in church and is emphatical in praying for the king and royal family  at table his loyalty waxes very fervent with his second bottle and the song of god save the king puts him into a perfect ecstasy he is amazingly well contented with the present state of things and apt to get a little impatient at any talk about national ruin and agricultural distress he says he has travelled about the country as much as any man and has met with nothing but prosperity and to confess the truth a great part of his time is spent in visiting from one countryseat to another and riding about the parks of his friends they talk of public distress said the general this day to me at dinner as he smacked a glass of rich burgundy and cast his eyes about the ample board they talk of public distress but where do we find it sir i see none i see no reason why any one has to complain take my word for it sir this talk about public distress is all humbug     the widows retinue    little dogs and all    lear   in giving an account of the arrival of lady lillycraft at the hall i ought to have mentioned the entertainment which i derived from witnessing the unpacking of her carriage and the disposing of her retinue there is something extremely amusing to me in the number of factitious wants the loads of imaginary conveniences but real encumbrances with which the luxurious are apt to burthen themselves i like to watch the whimsical stir and display about one of these petty progresses the number of robustious footmen and retainers of all kinds bustling about with looks of infinite gravity and importance to do almost nothing the number of heavy trunks and parcels and bandboxes belonging to my lady and the solicitude exhibited about some humble oddlooking box by my ladys maid the cushions piled in the carriage to make a soft seat still softer and to prevent the dreaded possibility of a jolt the smellingbottles the cordials the baskets of biscuit and fruit the new publications all provided to guard against hunger fatigue or ennui the led horses to vary the mode of travelling and all this preparation and parade to move perhaps some very goodfornothing personage about a little space of earth  i do not mean to apply the latter part of these observations to lady lillycraft for whose simple kindheartedness i have a very great respect and who is really a most amiable and worthy being i cannot refrain however from mentioning some of the motley retinue she has brought with her and which indeed bespeak the overflowing kindness of her nature which requires her to be surrounded with objects on which to lavish it  in the first place her ladyship has a pampered coachman with a red face and cheeks that hang down like dewlaps he evidently domineers over her a little with respect to the fat horses and only drives out when he thinks proper and when he thinks it will be good for the cattle  she has a favourite page to attend upon her person a handsome boy of about twelve years of age but a mischievous varlet very much spoiled and in a fair way to be good for nothing he is dressed in green with a profusion of gold cord and gilt buttons about his clothes she always has one or two attendants of the kind who are replaced by others as soon as they grow to fourteen years of age she has brought two dogs with her also out of a number of pets which she maintains at home one is a fat spaniel called zephyrthough heaven defend me from such a zephyr he is fed out of all shape and comfort his eyes are nearly strained out of his head he wheezes with corpulency and cannot walk without great difficulty the other is a little old graymuzzled curmudgeon with an unhappy eye that kindles like a coal if you only look at him his nose turns up his mouth is drawn into wrinkles so as to show his teeth in short he has altogether the look of a dog far gone in misanthropy and totally sick of the world when he walks he has his tail curled up so tight that it seems to lift his feet from the ground and he seldom makes use of more than three legs at a time keeping the other drawn up as a reserve this last wretch is called beauty  these dogs are full of elegant ailments unknown to vulgar dogs and are petted and nursed by lady lillycraft with the tenderest kindness they are pampered and fed with delicacies by their fellowminion the page but their stomachs are often weak and out of order so that they cannot eat though i have now and then seen the page give them a mischievous pinch or thwack over the head when his mistress was not by they have cushions for their express use on which they lie before the fire and yet are apt to shiver and moan if there is the least draught of air when any one enters the room they make a most tyrannical barking that is absolutely deafening they are insolent to all the other dogs of the establishment there is a noble staghound a great favourite of the squires who is a privileged visitor to the parlour but the moment he makes his appearance these intruders fly at him with furious rage and i have admired the sovereign indifference and contempt with which he seems to look down upon his puny assailants when her ladyship drives out these dogs are generally carried with her to take the air when they look out of each window of the carriage and bark at all vulgar pedestrian dogs these dogs are a continual source of misery to the household as they are always in the way they every now and then get their toes trod on and then there is a yelping on their part and a loud lamentation on the part of their mistress that fills the room with clamour and confusion  lastly there is her ladyships waitinggentlewoman mrs hannah a prim pragmatical old maid one of the most intolerable and intolerant virgins that ever lived she has kept her virtue by her until it has turned sour and now every word and look smacks of verjuice she is the very opposite to her mistress for one hates and the other loves all mankind how they first came together i cannot imagine but they have lived together for many years and the abigails temper being tart and encroaching and her ladyships easy and yielding the former has got the complete upper hand and tyrannizes over the good lady in secret  lady lillycraft now and then complains of it in great confidence to her friends but hushes up the subject immediately if mrs hannah makes her appearance indeed she has been so accustomed to be attended by her that she thinks she could not do without her though one great study of her life is to keep mrs hannah in goodhumour by little presents and kindnesses  master simon has a most devout abhorrence mingled with awe for this ancient spinster he told me the other day in a whisper that she was a cursed brimstonein fact he added another epithet which i would not repeat for the world i have remarked however that he is always extremely civil to her when they meet     readymoney jack    my purse it is my privy wyfe   this song i dare both syng and say   it keepeth men from grievous stryfe   when every man for himself shall pay   as i ryde in ryche array   for gold and silver men wyll me floryshe   but thys matter i dare well saye   every gramercy myne own purse    book of hunting   on the skirts of the neighbouring village there lives a kind of small potentate who for aught i know is a representative of one of the most ancient legitimate lines of the present day for the empire over which he reigns has belonged to his family time out of mind his territories comprise a considerable number of good fat acres and his seat of power is in an old farmhouse where he enjoys unmolested the stout oaken chair of his ancestors the personage to whom i allude is a sturdy old yeoman of the name of john tibbets or rather readymoney jack tibbets as he is called throughout the neighbourhood  the first place where he attracted my attention was in the churchyard on sunday where he sat on a tombstone after the service with his hat a little on one side holding forth to a small circle of auditors and as i presumed expounding the law and the prophets until on drawing a little nearer i found he was only expatiating on the merits of a brown horse he presented so faithful a picture of a substantial english yeoman such as he is often described in books heightened indeed by some little finery peculiar to himself that i could not but take note of his whole appearance  he was between fifty and sixty of a strong muscular frame and at least six feet high with a physiognomy as grave as a lions and set off with short curling irongray locks his shirtcollar was turned down and displayed a neck covered with the same short curling gray hair and he wore a coloured silk neckcloth tied very loosely and tucked in at the bosom with a green paste brooch on the knot his coat was of dark green cloth with silver buttons on each of which was engraved a stag with his own name john tibbets underneath he had an inner waistcoat of figured chintz between which and his coat was another of scarlet cloth unbuttoned his breeches were also left unbuttoned at the knees not from any slovenliness but to show a broad pair of scarlet garters his stockings were blue with white clocks he wore large silver shoebuckles a broad paste buckle in his hatband his sleevebuttons were gold sevenshilling pieces and he had two or three guineas hanging as ornaments to his watchchain  on making some inquiries about him i gathered that he was descended from a line of farmers that had always lived on the same spot and owned the same property and that half of the churchyard was taken up with the tombstones of his race he has all his life been an important character in the place when a youngster he was one of the most roaring blades of the neighbourhood no one could match him at wrestling pitching the bar cudgel play and other athletic exercises like the renowned pinner of wakefield he was the village champion carried off the prize at all the fairs and threw his gauntlet at the country round even to this day the old people talk of his prowess and undervalue in comparison all heroes of the green that have succeeded him nay they say that if readymoney jack were to take the field even now there is no one could stand before him  when jacks father died the neighbours shook their heads and predicted that young hopeful would soon make way with the old homestead but jack falsified all their predictions the moment he succeeded to the paternal farm he assumed a new character took a wife attended resolutely to his affairs and became an industrious thrifty farmer with the family property he inherited a set of old family maxims to which he steadily adhered he saw to everything himself put his own hand to the plough worked hard ate heartily slept soundly paid for every thing in cash down and never danced except he could do it to the music of his own money in both pockets he has never been without a hundred or two pounds in gold by him and never allows a debt to stand unpaid this has gained him his current name of which by the by he is a little proud and has caused him to be looked upon as a very wealthy man by all the village  notwithstanding his thrift however he has never denied himself the amusements of life but has taken a share in every passing pleasure it is his maxim that he that works hard can afford to play he is therefore an attendant at all the country fairs and wakes and has signalized himself by feats of strength and prowess on every village green in the shire he often makes his appearance at horseraces and sports his half guinea and even his guinea at a time keeps a good horse for his own riding and to this day is fond of following the hounds and is generally in at the death he keeps up the rustic revels and hospitalities too for which his paternal farmhouse has always been noted has plenty of good cheer and dancing at harvesthome and above all keeps the merry night2 as it is termed at christmas with all his love of amusement however jack is by no means a boisterous jovial companion he is seldom known to laugh even in the midst of his gayety but maintains the same grave lionlike demeanour he is very slow at comprehending a joke and is apt to sit puzzling at it with a perplexed look while the rest of the company is in a roar this gravity has perhaps grown on him with the growing weight of his character for he is gradually rising into patriarchal dignity in his native place though he no longer takes an active part in athletic sports yet he always presides at them and is appealed to on all occasions as umpire he maintains the peace on the village green at holiday games and quells all brawls and quarrels by collaring the parties and shaking them heartily if refractory no one ever pretends to raise a hand against him or to contend against his decisions the young men having grown up in habitual awe of his prowess and in implicit deference to him as the champion and lord of the green  footnote 2 merry nighta rustic merrymaking in a farmhouse about christmas common in some parts of yorkshire there is abundance of homely fare tea cakes fruit and ale various feats of agility amusing games romping dancing and kissing withal they commonly break up at midnight  he is a regular frequenter of the village inn the landlady having been a sweetheart of his in early life and he having always continued on kind terms with her he seldom however drinks any thing but a draught of ale smokes his pipe and pays his reckoning before leaving the taproom here he gives his little senate laws decides bets which are very generally referred to him determines upon the characters and qualities of horses and indeed plays now and then the part of a judge in settling petty disputes between neighbours which otherwise might have been nursed by country attorneys into tolerable lawsuits jack is very candid and impartial in his decisions but he has not a head to carry a long argument and is very apt to get perplexed and out of patience if there is much pleading he generally breaks through the argument with a strong voice and brings matters to a summary conclusion by pronouncing what he calls the upshot of the business or in other words the long and the short of the matter  jack once made a journey to london a great many years since which has furnished him with topics of conversation ever since he saw the old king on the terrace at windsor who stopped and pointed him out to one of the princesses being probably struck with jacks truly yeomanlike appearance this is a favourite anecdote with him and has no doubt had a great effect in making him a most loyal subject ever since in spite of taxes and poors rates he was also at bartholomew fair where he had half the buttons cut off his coat and a gang of pickpockets attracted by his external show of gold and silver made a regular attempt to hustle him as he was gazing at a show but for once they found that they had caught a tartar for jack enacted as great wonders among the gang as samson did among the philistines one of his neighbours who had accompanied him to town and was with him at the fair brought back an account of his exploits which raised the pride of the whole village who considered their champion as having subdued all london and eclipsed the achievements of friar tuck or even the renowned robin hood himself  of late years the old fellow has begun to take the world easily he works less and indulges in greater leisure his son having grown up and succeeded to him both in the labours of the farm and the exploits of the green like all sons of distinguished men however his fathers renown is a disadvantage to him for he can never come up to public expectation though a fine active fellow of threeandtwenty and quite the cock of the walk yet the old people declare he is nothing like what readymoney jack was at his time of life the youngster himself acknowledges his inferiority and has a wonderful opinion of the old man who indeed taught him all his athletic accomplishments and holds such a sway over him that i am told even to this day he would have no hesitation to take him in hands if he rebelled against paternal government  the squire holds jack in very high esteem and shows him to all his visitors as a specimen of old english heart of oak he frequently calls at his house and tastes some of his homebrewed which is excellent he made jack a present of old tussers hundred points of good husbandrie which has furnished him with reading ever since and is his textbook and manual in all agricultural and domestic concerns he has made dogs ears at the most favourite passages and knows many of the poetical maxims by heart  tibbets though not a man to be daunted or flattered by high acquaintances and though he cherishes a sturdy independence of mind and manner yet is evidently gratified by the attentions of the squire whom he has known from boyhood and pronounces a true gentleman every inch of him he is also on excellent terms with master simon who is a kind of privy counsellor to the family but his great favourite is the oxonian whom he taught to wrestle and play at quarterstaff when a boy and considers the most promising young gentleman in the whole country     bachelors    the bachelor most joyfully   in pleasant plight doth pass his dales   good fellowship and companie   he doth maintain and keep alwaies    evens old ballads   there is no character in the comedy of human life that is more difficult to play well than that of an old bachelor when a single gentleman therefore arrives at that critical period when he begins to consider it an impertinent question to be asked his age i would advise him to look well to his ways this period it is true is much later with some men than with others i have witnessed more than once the meeting of two wrinkled old lads of this kind who had not seen each other for several years and have been amused by the amicable exchange of compliments on each others appearance that takes place on such occasions there is always one invariable observation why bless my soul you look younger than when i last saw you whenever a mans friends begin to compliment him about looking young he may be sure that they think he is growing old  i am led to make these remarks by the conduct of master simon and the general who have become great cronies as the former is the younger by many years he is regarded as quite a youthful blade by the general who moreover looks upon him as a man of great wit and prodigious acquirements i have already hinted that master simon is a family beau and considered rather a young fellow by all the elderly ladies of the connexion for an old bachelor in an old family connexion is something like an actor in a regular dramatic corps who seems to flourish in immortal youth and will continue to play the romeos and rangers for half a century together  master simon too is a little of the chameleon and takes a different hue with every different companion he is very attentive and officious and somewhat sentimental with lady lillycraft copies out little nambypamby ditties and lovesongs for her and draws quivers and doves and darts and cupids to be worked on the corners of her pockethandkerchiefs he indulges however in very considerable latitude with the other married ladies of the family and has many sly pleasantries to whisper to them that provoke an equivocal laugh and a tap of the fan but when he gets among young company such as frank bracebridge the oxonian and the general he is apt to put on the mad wag and to talk in a very bachelorlike strain about the sex  in this he has been encouraged by the example of the general whom he looks up to as a man who has seen the world the general in fact tells shocking stories after dinner when the ladies have retired which he gives as some of the choice things that are served up at the mulligatawney club a knot of boon companions in london he also repeats the fat jokes of old major pendergast the wit of the club and which though the general can hardly repeat them for laughing always make mr bracebridge look grave he having a great antipathy to an indecent jest in a word the general is a complete instance of the declension in gay life by which a young man of pleasure is apt to cool down into an obscene old gentleman  i saw him and master simon an evening or two since conversing with a buxom milkmaid in a meadow and from their elbowing each other now and then and the generals shaking his shoulders blowing up his cheeks and breaking out into a short fit of irrepressible laughter i had no doubt they were playing the mischief with the girl  as i looked at them through a hedge i could not but think they would have made a tolerable group for a modern picture of susannah and the two elders it is true the girl seemed in nowise alarmed at the force of the enemy and i question had either of them been alone whether she would not have been more than they would have ventured to encounter such veteran roysters are daring wags when together and will put any female to the blush with their jokes but they are as quiet as lambs when they fall singly into the clutches of a fine woman  in spite of the generals years he evidently is a little vain of his person and ambitious of conquests i have observed him on sunday in church eyeing the country girls most suspiciously and have seen him leer upon them with a downright amorous look even when he has been gallanting lady lillycraft with great ceremony through the churchyard the general in fact is a veteran in the service of cupid rather than of mars having signalized himself in all the garrison towns and country quarters and seen service in every ballroom of england not a celebrated beauty but he has laid siege to and if his word may be taken in a matter wherein no man is apt to be oververacious it is incredible the success he has had with the fair at present he is like a wornout warrior retired from service but who still cocks his beaver with a military air and talks stoutly of fighting whenever he comes within the smell of gunpowder  i have heard him speak his mind very freely over his bottle about the folly of the captain in taking a wife as he thinks a young soldier should care for nothing but his bottle and kind landlady but in fact he says the service on the continent has had a sad effect upon the young men they have been ruined by light wines and french quadrilles theyve nothing he says of the spirit of the old service there are none of your sixbottle men left that were the souls of a mess dinner and used to play the very deuce among the women  as to a bachelor the general affirms that he is a free and easy man with no baggage to take care of but his portmanteau but a married man with his wife hanging on his arm always puts him in mind of a chamber candlestick with its extinguisher hitched to it i should hot mind all this if it were merely confined to the general but i fear he will be the ruin of my friend master simon who already begins to echo his heresies and to talk in the style of a gentleman that has seen life and lived upon the town indeed the general seems to have taken master simon in hand and talks of showing him the lions when he comes to town and of introducing him to a knot of choice spirits at the mulligatawney club which i understand is composed of old nabobs officers in the companys employ and other men of ind that have seen service in the east and returned home burnt out with curry and touched with the liver complaint they have their regular club where they eat mulligatawney soup smoke the hookah talk about tippoo saib seringapatam and tigerhunting and are tediously agreeable in each others company     wives    believe me man there is no greater blisse   than is the quiet joy of loving wife   which whoso wants half of himselfe doth misse   friend without change playfellow without strife   food without fulnesse counsaile without pride   is this sweet doubling of our single life    sir p sidney   there is so much talk about matrimony going on around me in consequence of the approaching event for which we are assembled at the hall that i confess i find my thoughts singularly exercised on the subject indeed all the bachelors of the establishment seem to be passing through a kind of fiery ordeal for lady lillycraft is one of those tender romanceread dames of the old school whose mind is filled with flames and darts and who breathe nothing but constancy and wedlock she is for ever immersed in the concerns of the heart and to use a poetical phrase is perfectly surrounded by the purple light of love the very general seems to feel the influence of this sentimental atmosphere to melt as he approaches her ladyship and for the time to forget all his heresies about matrimony and the sex  the good lady is generally surrounded by little documents of her prevalent taste novels of a tender nature richly bound little books of poetry that are filled with sonnets and love tales and perfumed with roseleaves and she has always an album at hand for which she claims the contributions of all her friends on looking over this last repository the other day i found a series of poetical extracts in the squires handwriting which might have been intended as matrimonial hints to his ward i was so much struck with several of them that i took the liberty of copying them out they are from the old play of thomas davenport published in 1661 entitled the city nightcap in which is drawn out and exemplified in the part of abstemia the character of a patient and faithful wife which i think might vie with that of the renowned griselda  i have often thought it a pity that plays and novels should always end at the wedding and should not give us another act and another volume to let us know how the hero and heroine conducted themselves when married their main object seems to be merely to instruct young ladies how to get husbands but not how to keep them now this last i speak it with all due diffidence appears to me to be a desideratum in modern married life it is appalling to those who have not yet adventured into the holy state to see how soon the flame of romantic love burns out or rather is quenched in matrimony and how deplorably the passionate poetic lover declines into the phlegmatic prosaic husband i am inclined to attribute this very much to the defect just mentioned in the plays and novels which form so important a branch of study of our young ladies and which teach them how to be heroines but leave them totally at a loss when they come to be wives the play from which the quotations before me were made however is an exception to this remark and i cannot refuse myself the pleasure of adducing some of them for the benefit of the reader and for the honour of an old writer who has bravely attempted to awaken dramatic interest in favour of a woman even after she was married  the following is a commendation of abstemia to her husband lorenzo    shes modest but not sullen and loves silence   not that she wants apt words for when she speaks   she inflames love with wonder but because   she calls wise silence the souls harmony   shes truly chaste yet such a foe to coyness   the poorest call her courteous and which is excellent   though fair and young she shuns to expose herself   to the opinion of strange eyes she either seldom   or never walks abroad but in your company   and then with such sweet bashfulness as if   she were venturing on crackd ice and takes delight   to step into the print your foot hath made   and will follow you whole fields so she will drive   tediousness out of time with her sweet character  notwithstanding all this excellence abstemia has the misfortune to incur the unmerited jealousy of her husband instead however of resenting his harsh treatment with clamorous upbraidings and with the stormy violence of high windy virtue by which the sparks of anger are so often blown into a flame she endures it with the meekness of conscious but patient virtue and makes the following beautiful appeal to a friend who has witnessed her long suffering    hast thou not seen me   bear all his injuries as the ocean suffers   the angry bark to plough through her bosom   and yet is presently so smooth the eye   cannot perceive where the wide wound was made  lorenzo being wrought on by false representations at length repudiates her to the last however she maintains her patient sweetness and her love for him in spite of his cruelty she deplores his error even more than his unkindness and laments the delusion which has turned his very affection into a source of bitterness there is a moving pathos in her parting address to lorenzo after their divorce    farewell lorenzo   whom my soul doth love if you eer marry   may you meet a good wife so good that you   may not suspect her nor may she be worthy   of your suspicion and if you hear hereafter   that i am dead inquire but my last words   and you shall know that to the last i lovd you   and when you walk forth with your second choice   into the pleasant fields and by chance talk of me   imagine that you see me lean and pale   strewing your path with flowers   but may she never live to pay my debts weeps   if but in thought she wrong you may she die   in the conception of the injury   pray make me wealthy with one kiss farewell sir   let it not grieve you when you shall remember   that i was innocent nor this forget   though innocence here suffer sigh and groan   she walks but thorow thorns to find a throne  in a short time lorenzo discovers his error and the innocence of his injured wife in the transports of his repentance he calls to mind all her feminine excellence her gentle uncomplaining womanly fortitude under wrongs and sorrows    oh abstemia   how lovely thou lookest now now thou appearest   chaster than is the mornings modesty   that rises with a blush over whose bosom   the western wind creeps softly now i remember   how when she sat at table her obedient eye   would dwell on mine as if it were not well   unless it lookd where i lookd oh how proud   she was when she could cross herself to please me   but where now is this fair soul like a silver cloud   she hath wept herself i fear into the dead sea   and will be found no more  it is but doing right by the reader if interested in the fate of abstemia by the preceding extracts to say that she was restored to the arms and affections of her husband rendered fonder than ever by that disposition in every good heart to atone for past injustice by an overflowing measure of returning kindness    thou wealth worth more than kingdoms i am now   confirmed past all suspicion thou art far   sweeter in thy sincere truth than a sacrifice   deckd up for death with garlands the indian winds   that blow from off the coast and cheer the sailor   with the sweet savour of their spices want   the delight flows in thee  i have been more affected and interested by this little dramatic picture than by many a popular love tale though as i said before i do not think it likely either abstemia or patient grizzle stand much chance of being taken for a model still i like to see poetry now and then extending its views beyond the weddingday and teaching a lady how to make herself attractive even after marriage there is no great need of enforcing on an unmarried lady the necessity of being agreeable nor is there any great art requisite in a youthful beauty to enable her to please nature has multiplied attractions around her youth is in itself attractive the freshness of budding beauty needs no foreign aid to set it off it pleases merely because it is fresh and budding and beautiful but it is for the married state that a woman needs the most instruction and in which she should be most on her guard to maintain her powers of pleasing no woman can expect to be to her husband all that he fancied her when he was a lover men are always doomed to be duped not so much by the arts of the sex as by their own imaginations they are always wooing goddesses and marrying mere mortals a woman should therefore ascertain what was the charm that rendered her so fascinating when a girl and endeavour to keep it up when she has become a wife one great thing undoubtedly was the chariness of herself and her conduct which an unmarried female always observes she should maintain the same niceness and reserve in her person and habits and endeavour still to preserve a freshness and virgin delicacy in the eye of her husband she should remember that the province of woman is to be wooed not to woo to be caressed not to caress man is an ungrateful being in love bounty loses instead of winning him the secret of a womans power does not consist so much in giving as in withholding  a woman may give up too much even to her husband it is to a thousand little delicacies of conduct that she must trust to keep alive passion and to protect herself from that dangerous familiarity that thorough acquaintance with every weakness and imperfection incident to matrimony by these means she may still maintain her power though she has surrendered her person and may continue the romance of love even beyond the honeymoon  she that hath a wise husband says jeremy taylor must entice him to an eternal dearnesse by the veil of modesty and the grave robes of chastity the ornament of meekness and the jewels of faith and charity she must have no painting but blushings her brightness must be purity and she must shine round about with sweetness and friendship and she shall be pleasant while she lives and desired when she dies  i have wandered into a rambling series of remarks on a trite subject and a dangerous one for a bachelor to meddle with that i may not however appear to confine my observations entirely to the wife i will conclude with another quotation from jeremy taylor in which the duties of both parties are mentioned while i would recommend his sermon on the marriagering to all those who wiser than myself are about entering the happy state of wedlock  there is scarce any matter of duty but it concerns them both alike and is only distinguished by names and hath its variety by circumstances and little accidents and what in one is called love in the other is called reverence and what in the wife is obedience the same in the man is duty he provides and she dispenses he gives commandments and she rules by them he rules her by authority and she rules him by love she ought by all means to please him and he must by no means displease her     story telling   a favorite evening pastime at the hall and one which the worthy squire is fond of promoting is story telling a good oldfashioned fireside amusement as he terms it indeed i believe he promotes it chiefly because it was one of the choice recreations in those days of yore when ladies and gentlemen were not much in the habit of reading be this as it may he will often at suppertable when conversation flags call on some one or other of the company for a story as it was formerly the custom to call for a song and it is edifying to see the exemplary patience and even satisfaction with which the good old gentleman will sit and listen to some hackneyed tale that he has heard for at least a hundred times  in this way one evening the current of anecdotes and stories ran upon mysterious personages that have figured at different times and filled the world with doubt and conjecture such as the wandering jew the man with the iron mask who tormented the curiosity of all europe the invisible girl and last though not least the pigfaced lady  at length one of the company was called upon that had the most unpromising physiognomy for a story teller that ever i had seen he was a thin pale weazenfaced man extremely nervous that had sat at one corner of the table shrunk up as it were into himself and almost swallowed up in the cape of his coat as a turtle in its shell  the very demand seemed to throw him into a nervous agitation yet he did not refuse he emerged his head out of his shell made a few odd grimaces and gesticulations before he could get his muscles into order or his voice under command and then offered to give some account of a mysterious personage that he had recently encountered in the course of his travels and one whom he thought fully entitled to being classed with the man with the iron mask  i was so much struck with his extraordinary narrative that i have written it out to the best of my recollection for the amusement of the reader i think it has in it all the elements of that mysterious and romantic narrative so greedily sought after at the present day     the stout gentleman  a stagecoach romance    ill cross it though it blast me    hamlet   it was a rainy sunday in the gloomy month of november i had been detained in the course of a journey by a slight indisposition from which i was recovering but i was still feverish and was obliged to keep within doors all day in an inn of the small town of derby a wet sunday in a country innwhoever has had the luck to experience one can alone judge of my situation  the rain pattered against the casements the bells tolled for church with a melancholy sound i went to the windows in quest of something to amuse the eye but it seemed as if i had been placed completely out of the reach of all amusement the windows of my bedroom looked out among tiled roofs and stacks of chimneys while those of my sittingroom commanded a full view of the stableyard i know of nothing more calculated to make a man sick of this world than a stableyard on a rainy day the place was littered with wet straw that had been kicked about by travellers and stableboys in one corner was a stagnant pool of water surrounding an island of muck there were several halfdrowned fowls crowded together under a cart among which was a miserable crestfallen cock drenched out of all life and spirit his drooping tail matted as it were into a single feather along which the water trickled from his back near the cart was a halfdozing cow chewing the cud and standing patiently to be rained on with wreaths of vapor rising from her reeking hide a walleyed horse tired of the loneliness of the stable was poking his spectral head out of the window with the rain dripping on it from the eaves an unhappy cur chained to a doghouse hard by uttered something every now and then between a bark and a yelp a drab of a kitchenwench tramped backwards and forwards through the yard in pattens looking as sulky as the weather itself every thing in short was comfortless and forlorn excepting a crew of harddrinking ducks assembled like boon companions round a puddle and making a riotous noise over their liquor  i was lonely and listless and wanted amusement my room soon became insupportable i abandoned it and sought what is technically called the travellersroom this is a public room set apart at most inns for the accommodation of a class of wayfarers called travellers or riders a kind of commercial knightserrant who are incessantly scouring the kingdom in gigs on horseback or by coach they are the only successors that i know of at the present day to the knightserrant of yore they lead the same kind of roving adventurous life only changing the lance for a drivingwhip the buckler for a patterncard and the coat of mail for an upper benjamin instead of vindicating the charms of peerless beauty they rove about spreading the fame and standing of some substantial tradesman or manufacturer and are ready at any time to bargain in his name it being the fashion nowadays to trade instead of fight with one another as the room of the hotel in the good old fighting times would be hung round at night with the armour of wayworn warriors such as coats of mail falchions and yawning helmets so the travellers room is garnished with the harnessing of their successors with boxcoats whips of all kinds spurs gaiters and oilcloth covered hats  i was in hopes of finding some of these worthies to talk with but was disappointed there were indeed two or three in the room but i could make nothing of them one was just finishing his breakfast quarrelling with his bread and butter and huffing the waiter another buttoned on a pair of gaiters with many execrations at boots for not having cleaned his shoes well a third sat drumming on the table with his fingers and looking at the rain as it streamed down the windowglass they all appeared infected by the weather and disappeared one after the other without exchanging a word  i sauntered to the window and stood gazing at the people picking their way to church with petticoats hoisted midleg high and dripping umbrellas the bell ceased to toll and the streets became silent i then amused myself with watching the daughters of a tradesman opposite who being confined to the house for fear of wetting their sunday finery played off their charms at the front windows to fascinate the chance tenants of the inn they at length were summoned away by a vigilant vinegarfaced mother and i had nothing further from without to amuse me  what was i to do to pass away the longlived day i was sadly nervous and lonely and every thing about an inn seems calculated to make a dull day ten times duller old newspapers smelling of beer and tobaccosmoke and which i had already read halfadozen timesgoodfornothing books that were worse than rainy weather i bored myself to death with an old volume of the ladys magazine i read all the commonplaced names of ambitious travellers scrawled on the panes of glass the eternal families of the smiths and the browns and the jacksons and the johnsons and all the other sons and i deciphered several scraps of fatiguing innwindow poetry which i have met with in all parts of the world  the day continued lowering and gloomy the slovenly ragged spongy clouds drifted heavily along there was no variety even in the rain it was one dull continued monotonous patterpatterpatter excepting that now and then i was enlivened by the idea of a brisk shower from the rattling of the drops upon a passing umbrella  it was quite refreshing if i may be allowed a hackneyed phrase of the day when in the course of the morning a horn blew and a stagecoach whirled through the street with outside passengers stuck all over it cowering under cotton umbrellas and seethed together and reeking with the steams of wet boxcoats and upper benjamins  the sound brought out from their lurkingplaces a crew of vagabond boys and vagabond dogs and the carrotyheaded hostler and that nondescript animal ycleped boots and all the other vagabond race that infest the purlieus of an inn but the bustle was transient the coach again whirled on its way and boy and dog and hostler and boots all slunk back again to their holes the street again became silent and the rain continued to rain on in fact there was no hope of its clearing up the barometer pointed to rainy weather mine hostess tortoiseshell cat sat by the fire washing her face and rubbing her paws over her ears and on referring to the almanac i found a direful prediction stretching from the top of the page to the bottom through the whole month expectmuchrainaboutthistime  i was dreadfully hipped the hours seemed as if they would never creep by the very ticking of the clock became irksome at length the stillness of the house was interrupted by the ringing of a bell shortly after i heard the voice of a waiter at the bar the stout gentleman in no 13 wants his breakfast tea and bread and butter with ham and eggs the eggs not to be too much done  in such a situation as mine every incident is of importance  here was a subject of speculation presented to my mind and ample exercise for my imagination i am prone to paint pictures to myself and on this occasion i had some materials to work upon had the guest upstairs been mentioned as mr smith or mr brown or mr jackson or mr johnson or merely as the gentleman in no 13 it would have been a perfect blank to me i should have thought nothing of it but the stout gentlemanthe very name had something in it of the picturesque it at once gave the size it embodied the personage to my minds eye and my fancy did the rest  he was stout or as some term it lusty in all probability therefore he was advanced in life some people expanding as they grow old by his breakfasting rather late and in his own room he must be a man accustomed to live at his ease and above the necessity of early rising no doubt a round rosy lusty old gentleman  there was another violent ringing the stout gentleman was impatient for his breakfast he was evidently a man of importance welltodo in the world accustomed to be promptly waited upon of a keen appetite and a little cross when hungry perhaps thought i he maybe be some london alderman or who knows but he may be a member of parliament  the breakfast was sent up and there was a short interval of silence he was doubtless making the tea presently there was a violent ringing and before it could be answered another ringing still more violent bless me what a choleric old gentleman the waiter came down in a huff the butter was rancid the eggs were overdone the ham was too saltthe stout gentleman was evidently nice in his eating one of those who eat and growl and keep the waiter on the trot and live in a state militant with the household  the hostess got into a fume i should observe that she was a brisk coquettish woman a little of a shrew and something of a slammerkin but very pretty withal with a nincompoop for a husband as shrews are apt to have she rated the servants roundly for their negligence in sending up so bad a breakfast but said not a word against the stout gentleman by which i clearly perceived that he must be a man of consequence entitled to make a noise and to give trouble at a country inn other eggs and ham and bread and butter were sent up they appeared to be more graciously received at least there was no further complaint  i had not made many turns about the travellersroom when there was another ringing shortly afterwards there was a stir and an inquest about the house the stout gentleman wanted the times or the chronicle newspaper i set him down therefore for a whig or rather from his being so absolute and lordly where he had a chance i suspected him of being a radical hunt i had heard was a large man who knows thought i but it is hunt himself  my curiosity began to be awakened i inquired of the waiter who was this stout gentleman that was making all this stir but i could get no information nobody seemed to know his name the landlords of bustling inns seldom trouble their heads about the names or occupations of their transient guests the colour of a coat the shape or size of the person is enough to suggest a travelling name it is either the tall gentleman or the short gentleman or the gentleman in black or the gentleman in snuffcolour or as in the present instance the stout gentleman a designation of the kind once hit on answers every purpose and saves all further inquiry  rainrainrain pitiless ceaseless rain no such thing as putting a foot out of doors and no occupation nor amusement within by and by i heard some one walking overhead it was in the stout gentlemans room he evidently was a large man by the heaviness of his tread and an old man from his wearing such creaking soles he is doubtless thought i some rich old squaretoes of regular habits and is now taking exercise after breakfast  i now read all the advertisements of coaches and hotels that were stuck about the mantelpiece the ladys magazine had become an abomination to me it was as tedious as the day itself i wandered out not knowing what to do and ascended again to my room i had not been there long when there was a squall from a neighbouring bedroom a door opened and slammed violently a chambermaid that i had remarked for having a ruddy goodhumoured face went downstairs in a violent flurry the stout gentleman had been rude to her  this sent a whole host of my deductions to the deuce in a moment this unknown personage could not be an old gentleman for old gentlemen are not apt to be so obstreperous to chambermaids he could not be a young gentleman for young gentlemen are not apt to inspire such indignation he must be a middleaged man and confounded ugly into the bargain or the girl would not have taken the matter in such terrible dudgeon i confess i was sorely puzzled  in a few minutes i heard the voice of my landlady i caught a glance of her as she came tramping upstairs her face glowing her cap flaring her tongue wagging the whole way shed have no such doings in her house shed warrant if gentlemen did spend money freely it was no rule shed have no servant maids of hers treated in that way when they were about their work thats what she wouldnt  as i hate squabbles particularly with women and above all with pretty women i slunk back into my room and partly closed the door but my curiosity was too much excited not to listen the landlady marched intrepidly to the enemys citadel and entered it with a storm the door closed after her i heard her voice in high windy clamour for a moment or two then it gradually subsided like a gust of wind in a garret then there was a laugh then i heard nothing more  after a little while my landlady came out with an odd smile on her face adjusting her cap which was a little on one side as she wont downstairs i heard the landlord ask her what was the matter she said nothing at all only the girls a fool i was more than ever perplexed what to make of this unaccountable personage who could put a goodnatured chambermaid in a passion and send away a termagant landlady in smiles he could not be so old nor cross nor ugly either  i had to go to work at his picture again and to paint him entirely different i now set him down for one of those stout gentlemen that are frequently met with swaggering about the doors of country inns moist merry fellows in belcher handkerchiefs whose bulk is a little assisted by malt liquors men who have seen the world and been sworn at highgate who are used to tavern life up to all the tricks of tapsters and knowing in the ways of sinful publicans freelivers on a small scale who are prodigal within the compass of a guinea who call all the waiters by name touzle the maids gossip with the landlady at the bar and prose over a pint of port or a glass of negus after dinner  the morning wore away in forming of these and similar surmises as fast as i wove one system of belief some movement of the unknown would completely overturn it and throw all my thoughts again into confusion such are the solitary operations of a feverish mind i was as i have said extremely nervous and the continual meditation on the concerns of this invisible personage began to have its effecti was getting a fit of the fidgets  dinnertime came i hoped the stout gentleman might dine in the travellersroom and that i might at length get a view of his person but nohe had dinner served in his own room what could be the meaning of this solitude and mystery he could not be a radical there was something too aristocratical in thus keeping himself apart from the rest of the world and condemning himself to his own dull company throughout a rainy day and then too he lived too well for a discontented politician he seemed to expatiate on a variety of dishes and to sit over his wine like a jolly friend of good living indeed my doubts on this head were soon at an end for he could not have finished his first bottle before i could faintly hear him humming a tune and on listening i found it to be god save the king twas plain then he was no radical but a faithful subject one that grew loyal over his bottle and was ready to stand by king and constitution when he could stand by nothing else but who could he be my conjectures began to run wild was he not some personage of distinction traveling incog god knows said i at my wits end it may be one of the royal family for aught i know for they are all stout gentlemen  the weather continued rainy the mysterious unknown kept his room and as far as i could judge his chair for i did not hear him move in the meantime as the day advanced the travellersroom began to be frequented some who had just arrived came in buttoned up in boxcoats others came home who had been dispersed about the town some took their dinners and some their tea had i been in a different mood i should have found entertainment in studying this peculiar class of men there were two especially who were regular wags of the road and up to all the standing jokes of travellers they had a thousand sly things to say to the waitingmaid whom they called louisa and ethelinda and a dozen other fine names changing the name every time and chuckling amazingly at their own waggery my mind however had become completely engrossed by the stout gentleman he had kept my fancy in chase during a long day and it was not now to be diverted from the scent  the evening gradually wore away the travellers read the papers two or three times over some drew round the fire and told long stories about their horses about their adventures their overturns and breakings down they discussed the credits of different merchants and different inns and the two wags told several choice anecdotes of pretty chambermaids and kind landladies all this passed as they were quietly taking what they called their nightcaps that is to say strong glasses of brandy and water and sugar or some other mixture of the kind after which they one after another rang for boots and the chambermaid and walked off to bed in old shoes cut down into marvellously uncomfortable slippers  there was only one man left a shortlegged longbodied plethoric fellow with a very large sandy head he sat by himself with a glass of port wine negus and a spoon sipping and stirring and meditating and sipping until nothing was left but the spoon he gradually fell asleep bolt upright in his chair with the empty glass standing before him and the candle seemed to fall asleep too for the wick grew long and black and cabbaged at the end and dimmed the little light that remained in the chamber the gloom that now prevailed was contagious around hung the shapeless and almost spectral boxcoats of departed travellers long since buried in deep sleep i only heard the ticking of the clock with the deepdrawn breathings of the sleeping topers and the drippings of the rain dropdropdrop from the eaves of the house the churchbells chimed midnight all at once the stout gentleman began to walk overhead pacing slowly backwards and forwards there was something extremely awful in all this especially to one in my state of nerves these ghastly greatcoats these guttural breathings and the creaking footsteps of this mysterious being his steps grew fainter and fainter and at length died away i could bear it no longer i was wound up to the desperation of a hero of romance be he who or what he may said i to myself ill have a sight of him i seized a chamber candle and hurried up to number 13 the door stood ajar i hesitatedi entered the room was deserted there stood a large broadbottomed elbow chair at a table on which was an empty tumbler and a times newspaper and the room smelt powerfully of stilton cheese  the mysterious stranger had evidently but just retired i turned off sorely disappointed to my room which had been changed to the front of the house as i went along the corridor i saw a large pair of boots with dirty waxed tops standing at the door of a bedchamber they doubtless belonged to the unknown but it would not do to disturb so redoubtable a personage in his den he might discharge a pistol or something worse at my head i went to bed therefore and lay awake half the night in a terrible nervous state and even when i fell asleep i was still haunted in my dreams by the idea of the stout gentleman and his waxtopped boots  i slept rather late the next morning and was awakened by some stir and bustle in the house which i could not at first comprehend until getting more awake i found there was a mailcoach starting from the door suddenly there was a cry from below the gentleman has forgot his umbrella look for the gentlemans umbrella in no 13 i heard an immediate scampering of a chambermaid along the passage and a shrill reply as she ran here it is heres the gentlemans umbrella  the mysterious stranger then was on the point of setting off this was the only chance i should ever have of knowing him i sprang out of bed scrambled to the window snatched aside the curtains and just caught a glimpse of the rear of a person getting in at the coachdoor the skirts of a brown coat parted behind and gave me a full view of the broad disk of a pair of drab breeches the door closedall right was the wordthe coach whirled offand that was all i ever saw of the stout gentleman     forest trees    a living gallery of aged trees   one of the favourite themes of boasting with the squire is the noble trees on his estate which in truth has some of the finest that i have seen in england there is something august and solemn in the great avenues of stately oaks that gather their branches together high in air and seem to reduce the pedestrians beneath them to mere pigmies an avenue of oaks or elms the squire observes is the true colonnade that should lead to a gentlemans house as to stone and marble any one can rear them at oncethey are the work of the day but commend me to the colonnades that have grown old and great with the family and tell by their grandeur how long the family has endured  the squire has great reverence for certain venerable trees gray with moss which he considers as the ancient nobility of his domain there is the ruin of an enormous oak which has been so much battered by time and tempest that scarce any thing is left though he says christy recollects when in his boyhood it was healthy and nourishing until it was struck by lightning it is now a mere trunk with one twisted bough stretching up into the air leaving a green branch at the end of it this sturdy wreck is much valued by the squire he calls it his standardbearer and compares it to a veteran warrior beaten down in battle but bearing up his banner to the last he has actually had a fence built round it to protect it as much as possible from further injury  it is with great difficulty that the squire can ever be brought to have any tree cut down on his estate to some he looks with reverence as having been planted by his ancestors to others with a kind of paternal affection as having been planted by himself and he feels a degree of awe in bringing down with a few strokes of the axe what it has cost centuries to build up i confess i cannot but sympathize in some degree with the good squire on the subject though brought up in a country overrun with forests where trees are apt to be considered mere encumbrances and to be laid low without hesitation or remorse yet i could never see a fine tree hewn down without concern the poets who are naturally lovers of trees as they are of every thing that is beautiful have artfully awakened great interest in their favour by representing them as the habitations of sylvan deities insomuch that every great tree had its tutelar genius or a nymph whose existence was limited to its duration evelyn in his sylva makes several pleasing and fanciful allusions to this superstition as the fall says he of a very aged oak giving a crack like thunder has often been heard at many miles distance constrained though i often am to fell them with reluctancy i do not at any time remember to have heard the groans of those nymphs grieving to be dispossessed of their ancient habitations without some emotion and pity and again in alluding to a violent storm that had devastated the woodlands he says methinks i still hear sure i am that i still feel the dismal groans of our forests the late dreadful hurricane having subverted so many thousands of goodly oaks prostrating the trees laying them in ghastly postures like whole regiments fallen in battle by the sword of the conqueror and crushing all that grew beneath them the public accounts he adds reckon no less than three thousand brave oaks in one part only of the forest of dean blown down  i have paused more than once in the wilderness of america to contemplate the traces of some blast of wind which seemed to have rushed down from the clouds and ripped its way through the bosom of the woodlands rooting up shivering and splintering the stoutest trees and leaving a long track of desolation there was something awful in the vast havoc made among these gigantic plants and in considering their magnificent remains so rudely torn and mangled and hurled down to perish prematurely on their native soil i was conscious of a strong movement of the sympathy so feelingly expressed by evelyn i recollect also hearing a traveller of poetical temperament expressing the kind of horror which he felt on beholding on the banks of the missouri an oak of prodigious size which had been in a manner overpowered by an enormous wild grapevine the vine had clasped its huge folds round the trunk and from thence had wound about every branch and twig until the mighty tree had withered in its embrace it seemed like laocoon struggling ineffectually in the hideous coils of the monster python it was the lion of trees perishing in the embraces of a vegetable boa  i am fond of listening to the conversation of english gentlemen on rural concerns and of noticing with what taste and discrimination and what strong unaffected interest they will discuss topics which in other countries are abandoned to mere woodmen or rustic cultivators i have heard a noble earl descant on park and forest scenery with the science and feeling of a painter he dwelt on the shape and beauty of particular trees on his estate with as much pride and technical precision as though he had been discussing the merits of statues in his collection i found that he had even gone considerable distances to examine trees which were celebrated among rural amateurs for it seems that trees like horses have their established points of excellence and that there are some in england which enjoy very extensive celebrity among treefanciers from being perfect in their kind  there is something nobly simple and pure in such a taste it argues i think a sweet and generous nature to have this strong relish for the beauties of vegetation and this friendship for the hardy and glorious sons of the forest there is a grandeur of thought connected with this part of rural economy it is if i may be allowed the figure the heroic line of husbandry it is worthy of liberal and freeborn and aspiring men he who plants an oak looks forward to future ages and plants for posterity nothing can be less selfish than this he cannot expect to sit in its shade nor enjoy its shelter but he exults in the idea that the acorn which he has buried in the earth shall grow up into a lofty pile and shall keep on flourishing and increasing and benefiting mankind long after he shall have ceased to tread his paternal fields indeed it is the nature of such occupations to lift the thoughts above mere worldliness as the leaves of trees are said to absorb all noxious qualities of the air and to breathe forth a purer atmosphere so it seems to me as if they drew from us all sordid and angry passions and breathed forth peace and philanthropy there is a serene and settled majesty in woodland scenery that enters into the soul and dilates and elevates it and fills it with noble inclinations the ancient and hereditary groves too that embower this island are most of them full of story they are haunted by the recollections of great spirits of past ages who have sought for relaxation among them from the tumult of arms or the toils of state or have wooed the muse beneath their shade who can walk with soul unmoved among the stately groves of penshurst where the gallant the amiable the elegant sir philip sidney passed his boyhood or can look without fondness upon the tree that is said to have been planted on his birthday or can ramble among the classic bowers of hagley or can pause among the solitudes of windsor forest and look at the oaks around huge gray and timeworn like the old castle towers and not feel as if he were surrounded by so many monuments of longenduring glory it is when viewed in this light that planted groves and stately avenues and cultivated parks have an advantage over the more luxuriant beauties of unassisted nature it is that they teem with moral associations and keep up the everinteresting story of human existence  it is incumbent then on the high and generous spirits of an ancient nation to cherish these sacred groves that surround their ancestral mansions and to perpetuate them to their descendants republican as i am by birth and brought up as i have been in republican principles and habits i can feel nothing of the servile reverence for titled rank merely because it is titled but i trust that i am neither churl nor bigot in my creed i can both see and feel how hereditary distinction when it falls to the lot of a generous mind may elevate that mind into true nobility it is one of the effects of hereditary rank when it falls thus happily that it multiplies the duties and as it were extends the existence of the possessor he does not feel himself a mere individual link in creation responsible only for his own brief term of being he carries back his existence in proud recollection and he extends it forward in honourable anticipation he lives with his ancestry and he lives with his posterity to both does he consider himself involved in deep responsibilities as he has received much from those that have gone before so he feels bound to transmit much to those who are to come after him his domestic undertakings seem to imply a longer existence than those of ordinary men none are so apt to build and plant for future centuries as noblespirited men who have received their heritages from foregone ages  i cannot but applaud therefore the fondness and pride with which i have noticed english gentlemen of generous temperaments and high aristocratic feelings contemplating those magnificent trees which rise like towers and pyramids from the midst of their paternal lands there is an affinity between all nature animate and inanimate the oak in the pride and lustihood of its growth seems to me to take its range with the lion and the eagle and to assimilate in the grandeur of its attributes to heroic and intellectual man with its mighty pillar rising straight and direct towards heaven bearing up its leafy honours from the impurities of earth and supporting them aloft in free air and glorious sunshine it is an emblem of what a true nobleman should be a refuge for the weak a shelter for the oppressed a defence for the defenceless warding off from them the peltings of the storm or the scorching rays of arbitrary power he who is this is an ornament and a blessing to his native land he who is otherwise abuses his eminent advantages abuses the grandeur and prosperity which he has drawn from the bosom of his country should tempests arise and he be laid prostrate by the storm who would mourn over his fall should he be borne down by the oppressive hand of power who would murmur at his fatewhy cumbereth he the ground     a literary antiquary    printed bookes he contemnes as a novelty of this latter age but   a manuscript he pores on everlastingly especially if the cover be   all motheaten and the dust make a parenthesis betweene every   syllable    micocosmographie 1638   the squire receives great sympathy and support in his antiquated humours from the parson of whom i made some mention on my former visit to the hall and who acts as a kind of family chaplain he has been cherished by the squire almost constantly since the time that they were fellowstudents at oxford for it is one of the peculiar advantages of these great universities that they often link the poor scholar to the rich patron by early and heartfelt ties that last through life without the usual humiliations of dependence and patronage under the fostering protection of the squire therefore the little parson has pursued his studies in peace having lived almost entirely among books and those too old books he is quite ignorant of the world and his mind is as antiquated as the garden at the hall where the flowers are all arranged in formal beds and the yewtrees clipped into urns and peacocks  his taste for literary antiquities was first imbibed in the bodleian library at oxford where when a student he passed many an hour foraging among the old manuscripts he has since at different times visited most of the curious libraries in england and has ransacked many of the cathedrals with all his quaint and curious learning he has nothing of arrogance or pedantry but that unaffected earnestness and guileless simplicity which seem to belong to the literary antiquary  he is a dark mouldy little man and rather dry in his manner yet on his favourite theme he kindles up and at times is even eloquent no foxhunter recounting his last days sport could be more animated than i have seen the worthy parson when relating his search after a curious document which he had traced from library to library until he fairly unearthed it in the dusty chapterhouse of a cathedral when too he describes some venerable manuscript with its rich illuminations its thick creamy vellum its glossy ink and the odour of the cloisters that seemed to exhale from it he rivals the enthusiasm of a parisian epicure expatiating on the merits of a perigord pie or a patté de strasbourg  his brain seems absolutely haunted with lovesick dreams about gorgeous old works in silk linings triple gold bands and tinted leather locked up in wire cases and secured from the vulgar hands of the mere reader and to continue the happy expressions of an ingenious writer dazzling ones eyes like eastern beauties peering through their jealousies3  footnote 3 disraelicuriosities of literature  he has a great desire however to read such works in the old libraries and chapterhouses to which they belong for he thinks a blackletter volume reads best in one of those venerable chambers where the light struggles through dusty lancet windows and painted glass and that it loses half its zest if taken away from the neighbourhood of the quaintlycarved oaken bookcase and gothic readingdesk at his suggestion the squire has had the library furnished in this antique taste and several of the windows glazed with painted glass that they may throw a properly tempered light upon the pages of their favourite old authors  the parson i am told has been for some time meditating a commentary on strutt brand and douce in which he means to detect them in sundry dangerous errors in respect to popular games and superstitions a work to which the squire looks forward with great interest he is also a casual contributor to that longestablished repository of national customs and antiquities the gentlemans magazine and is one of those that every now and then make an inquiry concerning some obsolete custom or rare legend nay it is said that several of his communications have been at least six inches in length he frequently receives parcels by coach from different parts of the kingdom containing mouldy volumes and almost illegible manuscripts for it is singular what an active correspondence is kept up among literary antiquaries and how soon the fame of any rare volume or unique copy just discovered among the rubbish of a library is circulated among them the parson is more busy than common just now being a little flurried by an advertisement of a work said to be preparing for the press on the mythology of the middle ages the little man has long been gathering together all the hobgoblin tales he could collect illustrative of the superstitions of former times and he is in a complete fever lest this formidable rival should take the field before him  shortly after my arrival at the hall i called at the parsonage in company with mr bracebridge and the general the parson had not been seen for several days which was a matter of some surprise as he was an almost daily visitor at the hall we found him in his study a small dusky chamber lighted by a lattice window that looked into the churchyard and was overshadowed by a yewtree his chair was surrounded by folios and quartos piled upon the floor and his table was covered with books and manuscripts the cause of his seclusion was a work which he had recently received and with which he had retired in rapture from the world and shut himself up to enjoy a literary honeymoon undisturbed never did boardingschool girl devour the pages of a sentimental novel or don quixote a chivalrous romance with more intense delight than did the little man banquet on the pages of this delicious work it was dibdins bibliographical tour a work calculated to have as intoxicating an effect on the imaginations of literary antiquaries as the adventures of the heroes of the round table on all true knights or the tales of the early american voyagers on the ardent spirits of the age filling them with dreams of mexican and peruvian mines and of the golden realm of el dorado  the good parson had looked forward to this bibliographical expedition as of far greater importance than those to africa or the north pole with what eagerness had he seized upon the history of the enterprise with what interest had he followed the redoubtable bibliographer and his graphical squire in their adventurous roamings among norman castles and cathedrals and french libraries and german convents and universities penetrating into the prisonhouses of vellum manuscripts and exquisitely illuminated missals and revealing their beauties to the world  when the parson had finished a rapturous eulogy on this most curious and entertaining work he drew forth from a little drawer a manuscript lately received from a correspondent which had perplexed him sadly it was written in norman french in very ancient characters and so faded and mouldered away as to be almost illegible it was apparently an old norman drinking song that might have been brought over by one of william the conquerors carousing followers the writing was just legible enough to keep a keen antiquityhunter on a doubtful chase here and there he would be completely thrown out and then there would be a few words so plainly written as to put him on the scent again in this way he had been led on for a whole day until he had found himself completely at fault  the squire endeavoured to assist him but was equally baffled the old general listened for some time to the discussion and then asked the parson if he had read captain morriss or george stevenss or anacreon moores bacchanalian songs on the other replying in the negative oh then said the general with a sagacious nod if you want a drinking song i can furnish you with the latest collectioni did not know you had a turn for those kind of things and i can lend you the encyclopedia of wit into the bargain i never travel without them theyre excellent reading at an inn  it would not be easy to describe the odd look of surprise and perplexity of the parson at this proposal or the difficulty the squire had in making the general comprehend that though a jovial song of the present day was but a foolish sound in the ears of wisdom and beneath the notice of a learned man yet a trowl written by a tosspot several hundred years since was a matter worthy of the gravest research and enough to set whole colleges by the ears  i have since pondered much on this matter and have figured to myself what may be the fate of our current literature when retrieved piecemeal by future antiquaries from among the rubbish of ages what a magnus apollo for instance will moore become among sober divines and dusty schoolmen even his festive and amatory songs which are now the mere quickeners of our social moments or the delights of our drawingrooms will then become matters of laborious research and painful collation how many a grave professor will then waste his midnight oil or worry his brain through a long morning endeavouring to restore the pure text or illustrate the biographical hints of come tell me says rosa as kissing and kissed and how many an arid old bookworm like the worthy little parson will give up in despair after vainly striving to fill up some fatal hiatus in fanny of timmol  nor is it merely such exquisite authors as moore that are doomed to consume the oil of future antiquaries many a poor scribbler who is now apparently sent to oblivion by pastrycooks and cheesemongers will then rise again in fragments and flourish in learned immortality  after all thought i time is not such an invariable destroyer as he is represented if he pulls down he likewise builds up if he impoverishes one he enriches another his very dilapidations furnish matter for new works of controversy and his rust is more precious than the most costly gilding under his plastic hand trifles rise into importance the nonsense of one age becomes the wisdom of another the levity of the wit gravitates into the learning of the pedant and an ancient farthing moulders into infinitely more value than a modern guinea     the farmhouse    love and hay   are thick sown but come up full of thistles    beaumont and fletcher   i was so much pleased with the anecdotes which were told me of readymoney jack tibbets that i got master simon a day or two since to take me to his house it was an oldfashioned farmhouse built with brick with curiously twisted chimneys it stood at a little distance from the road with a southern exposure looking upon a soft green slope of meadow there was a small garden in front with a row of beehives humming among beds of sweet herbs and flowers wellscoured milking tubs with bright copper hoops hung on the garden paling fruit trees were trained up against the cottage and pots of flowers stood in the windows a fat superannuated mastiff lay in the sunshine at the door with a sleek cat sleeping peacefully across him  mr tibbets was from home at the time of our calling but we were received with hearty and homely welcome by his wife a notable motherly woman and a complete pattern for wives since according to master simons account she never contradicts honest jack and yet manages to have her own way and to control him in every thing  she received us in the main room of the house a kind of parlour and hall with great brown beams of timber across it which mr tibbets is apt to point out with some exultation observing that they dont put such timber in houses nowadays the furniture was oldfashioned strong and highly polished the walls were hung with coloured prints of the story of the prodigal son who was represented in a red coat and leather breeches over the fireplace was a blunderbuss and a hardfavoured likeness of readymoney jack taken when he was a young man by the same artist that painted the tavern sign his mother having taken a notion that the tibbets had as much right to have a gallery of family portraits as the folks at the hall  the good dame pressed us very much to take some refreshment and tempted us with a variety of household dainties so that we were glad to compound by tasting some of her homemade wines while we were there the son and heirapparent came home a goodlooking young fellow and something of a rustic beau he took us over the premises and showed us the whole establishment an air of homely but substantial plenty prevailed throughout every thing was of the best materials and in the best condition nothing was out of place or ill made and you saw every where the signs of a man that took care to have the worth of his money and that paid as he went  the farmyard was well stocked under a shed was a taxed cart in trim order in which readymoney jack took his wife about the country his wellfed horse neighed from the stable and when led out into the yard to use the words of young jack he shone like a bottle for he said the old man made it a rule that every thing about him should fare as well as he did himself  i was pleased to see the pride which the young fellow seemed to have of his father he gave us several particulars concerning his habits which were pretty much to the effect of those i have already mentioned he had never suffered an account to stand in his life always providing the money before he purchased any thing and if possible paying in gold and silver he had a great dislike to paper money and seldom went without a considerable sum in gold about him on my observing that it was a wonder he had never been waylaid and robbed the young fellow smiled at the idea of any one venturing upon such an exploit for i believe he thinks the old man would be a match for robin hood and all his gang  i have noticed that master simon seldom goes into any house without having a world of private talk with some one or other of the family being a kind of universal counsellor and confidant we had not been long at the farm before the old dame got him into a corner of her parlour where they had a long whispering conference together in which i saw by his shrugs that there were some dubious matters discussed and by his nods that he agreed with every thing she said  after we had come out the young man accompanied us a little distance and then drawing master simon aside into a green lane they walked and talked together for nearly half an hour master simon who has the usual propensity of confidants to blab every thing to the next friend they meet with let me know that there was a love affair in question the young fellow having been smitten with the charms of phoebe wilkins the pretty niece of the housekeeper at the hall like most other love concerns it had brought its troubles and perplexities dame tibbets had long been on intimate gossiping terms with the housekeeper who often visited the farmhouse but when the neighbours spoke to her of the likelihood of a match between her son and phoebe wilkins marry come up she scouted the very idea the girl had acted as ladys maid and it was beneath the blood of the tibbets who had lived on their own lands time out of mind and owed reverence and thanks to nobody to have the heirapparent marry a servant  these vapourings had faithfully been carried to the housekeepers ear by one of their mutual gobetween friends the old housekeepers blood if not as ancient was as quick as that of dame tibbets she had been accustomed to carry a high head at the hall and among the villagers and her faded brocade rustled with indignation at the slight cast upon her alliance by the wife of a petty farmer she maintained that her niece had been a companion rather than a waitingmaid to the young ladies thank heavens she was not obliged to work for her living and was as idle as any young lady in the land and when somebody died would receive something that would be worth the notice of some folks with all their ready money  a bitter feud had thus taken place between the two worthy dames and the young people were forbidden to think of one another as to young jack he was too much in love to reason upon the matter and being a little heady and not standing in much awe of his mother was ready to sacrifice the whole dignity of the tibbets to his passion he had lately however had a violent quarrel with his mistress in consequence of some coquetry on her part and at present stood aloof the politic mother was exerting all her ingenuity to widen the accidental breach but as is most commonly the case the more she meddled with this perverse inclination of the son the stronger it grew in the meantime old readymoney was kept completely in the dark both parties were in awe and uncertainty as to what might be his way of taking the matter and dreaded to awaken the sleeping lion between father and son therefore the worthy mrs tibbets was full of business and at her wits end it is true there was no great danger of honest readymoneys finding the thing out if left to himself for he was of a most unsuspicious temper and by no means quick of apprehension but there was daily risk of his attention being aroused by the cobwebs which his indefatigable wife was continually spinning about his nose  such is the distracted state of politics in the domestic empire of readymoney jack which only shows the intrigues and internal dangers to which the bestregulated governments are liable in this perplexed situation of their affairs both mother and son have applied to master simon for counsel and with all his experience in meddling with other peoples concerns he finds it an exceedingly difficult part to play to agree with both parties seeing that their opinions and wishes are so diametrically opposite     horsemanship    a coach was a strange monster in those days and the sight put both   horse and man into amazement some said it was a great crabshell   brought out of china and some imagined it to be one of the pagan   temples in which the canibals adored the divell    taylor the water poet   i have made casual mention more than once of one of the squires antiquated retainers old christy the huntsman i find that his crabbed humour is a source of much entertainment among the young men of the family the oxonian particularly takes a mischievous pleasure now and then in slyly rubbing the old man against the grain and then smoothing him down again for the old fellow is as ready to bristle up his back as a porcupine he rides a venerable hunter called pepper which is a counterpart of himself a heady crossgrained animal that frets the flesh off its bones bites kicks and plays all manner of villainous tricks he is as tough and nearly as old as his rider who has ridden him time out of mind and is indeed the only one that can do any thing with him sometimes however they have a complete quarrel and a dispute for mastery and then i am told it is as good as a farce to see the heat they both get into and the wrongheaded contest that ensues for they are quite knowing in each others ways and in the art of teasing and fretting each other notwithstanding these doughty brawls however there is nothing that nettles old christy sooner than to question the merits of the horse which he upholds as tenaciously as a faithful husband will vindicate the virtues of the termagant spouse that gives him a curtain lecture every night of his life  the young men call old christy their professor of equitation and in accounting for the appellation they let me into some particulars of the squires mode of bringing up his children there is an odd mixture of eccentricity and good sense in all the opinions of my worthy host his mind is like modern gothic where plain brickwork is set off with pointed arches and quaint tracery though the main groundwork of his opinions is correct yet he has a thousand little notions picked up from old books which stand out whimsically on the surface of his mind  thus in educating his boys he chose peachem markam and such like old english writers for his manuals at an early age he took the lads out of their mothers hands who was disposed as mothers are apt to be to make fine orderly children of them that should keep out of sun and rain and never soil their hands nor tear their clothes  in place of this the squire turned them loose to run free and wild about the park without heeding wind or weather he was also particularly attentive in making them bold and expert horsemen and these were the days when old christy the huntsman enjoyed great importance as the lads were put under his care to practise them at the leapingbars and to keep an eye upon them in the chase  the squire always objected to their riding in carriages of any kind and is still a little tenacious on this point he often rails against the universal use of carriages and quotes the words of honest nashe to that effect it was thought says nashe in his quaternio a kind of solecism and to savour of effeminacy for a young gentleman in the flourishing time of his age to creep into a coach and to shroud himself from wind and weather our great delight was to outbrave the blustering boreas upon a great horse to arm and prepare ourselves to go with mars and bellona into the field was our sport and pastime coaches and caroches we left unto them for whom they were first invented for ladies and gentlemen and decrepit age and impotent people  the squire insists that the english gentlemen have lost much of their hardiness and manhood since the introduction of carriages compare he will say the fine gentleman of former times ever on horseback booted and spurred and travelstained but open frank manly and chivalrous with the fine gentleman of the present day full of affectation and effeminacy rolling along a turnpike in his voluptuous vehicle the young men of those days were rendered brave and lofty and generous in their notions by almost living in their saddles and having their foaming steeds like proud seas under them there is something he adds in bestriding a fine horse that makes a man feel more than mortal he seems to have doubled his nature and to have added to his own courage and sagacity the power the speed and stateliness of the superb animal on which he is mounted  it is a great delight says old nashe to see a young gentleman with his skill and cunning by his voice rod and spur better to manage and to command the great bucephalus than the strongest milo with all his strength one while to see him make him tread trot and gallop the ring and one after to see him make him gather up roundly to bear his head steadily to run a full career swiftly to stop a sudden lightly anon after to see him make him advance to yerke to go back and sidelong to turn on either hand to gallop the gallop galliard to do the capriole the chambetta and dance the curvetty  in conformity to these ideas the squire had them all on horseback at an early age and made them ride slapdash about the country without flinching at hedge or ditch or stone wall to the imminent danger of their necks  even the fair julia was partially included in this system and under the instructions of old christy has become one of the best horsewomen in the country the squire says it is better than all the cosmetics and sweeteners of the breath that ever were invented he extols the horsemanship of the ladies in former times when queen elizabeth would scarcely suffer the rain to stop her accustomed ride and then think he will say what nobler and sweeter beings it made them what a difference must there be both in mind and body between a joyous highspirited dame of those days glowing with health and exercise freshened by every breeze that blows seated loftily and gracefully on her saddle with plume on head and hawk on hand and her descendant of the present day the pale victim of routs and ballrooms sunk languidly in one corner of an enervating carriage  the squires equestrian system has been attended with great success for his sons having passed through the whole course of instruction without breaking neck or limb are now healthful spirited and active and have the true englishmans love for a horse if their manliness and frankness are praised in their fathers hearing he quotes the old persian maxim and says they have been taught to ride to shoot and to speak the truth  it is true the oxonian has now and then practised the old gentlemans doctrines a little in the extreme he is a gay youngster rather fonder of his horse than his book with a little dash of the dandy though the ladies all declare that he is the flower of the flock the first year that he was sent to oxford he had a tutor appointed to overlook him a dry chip of the university when he returned home in the vacation the squire made many inquiries about how he liked his college his studies and his tutor  oh as to my tutor sir ive parted with him some time since  you have and pray why so  oh sir hunting was all the go at our college and i was a little short of funds so i discharged my tutor and took a horse you know  ah i was not aware of that tom said the squire mildly  when tom returned to college his allowance was doubled that he might be enabled to keep both horse and tutor     love symptoms    i will now begin to sigh read poets look pale go neatly and be   most apparently in love    marston   i should not be surprised if we should have another pair of turtles at the hall for master simon has informed me in great confidence that he suspects the general of some design upon the susceptible heart of lady lillycraft i have indeed noticed a growing attention and courtesy in the veteran towards her ladyship he softens very much in her company sits by her at table and entertains her with long stories about seringapatam and pleasant anecdotes of the mulligatawney club i have even seen him present her with a fullblown rose from the hothouse in a style of the most captivating gallantry and it was accepted with great suavity and graciousness for her ladyship delights in receiving the homage and attention of the sex  indeed the general was one of the earliest admirers that dangled in her train during her short reign of beauty and they flirted together for half a season in london some thirty or forty years since she reminded him lately in the course of a conversation about former days of the time when he used to ride a white horse and to canter so gallantly by the side of her carriage in hyde park whereupon i have remarked that the veteran has regularly escorted her since when she rides out on horseback and i suspect he almost persuades himself that he makes as captivating an appearance as in his youthful days  it would be an interesting and memorable circumstance in the chronicles of cupid if this spark of the tender passion after lying dormant for such a length of time should again be fanned into a flame from amidst the ashes of two burntout hearts it would be an instance of perdurable fidelity worthy of being placed beside those recorded in one of the squires favourite tomes commemorating the constancy of the olden times in which times we are told men and wymmen coulde love togyders seven yeres and no licours lustes were betwene them and thenne was love trouthe and feythfulnes and lo in lyke wyse was used love in king arthurs dayes4  footnote 4 morte d arthur  still however this may be nothing but a little venerable flirtation the general being a veteran dangler and the good lady habituated to these kind of attentions master simon on the other hand thinks the general is looking about him with the wary eye of an old campaigner and now that he is on the wane is desirous of getting into warm winterquarters much allowance however must be made for master simons uneasiness on the subject for he looks on lady lillycrafts house as one of his strongholds where he is lord of the ascendant and with all his admiration of the general i much doubt whether he would like to see him lord of the lady and the establishment  there are certain other symptoms notwithstanding that give an air of probability to master simons intimations thus for instance i have observed that the general has been very assiduous in his attentions to her ladyships dogs and has several times exposed his fingers to imminent jeopardy in attemptingto pat beauty on the head it is to be hoped his advances to the mistress will be more favourably received as all his overtures towards a caress are greeted by the pestilent little cur with a wary kindling of the eye and a most venomous growl  he has moreover been very complaisant towards my ladys gentlewoman the immaculate mrs hannah whom he used to speak of in a way that i do not choose to mention whether she has the same suspicions with master simon or not i cannot say but she receives his civilities with no better grace than the implacable beauty unscrewing her mouth into a most acid smile and looking as though she could bite a piece out of him in short the poor general seems to have as formidable foes to contend with as a hero of ancient fairy tale who had to fight his way to his enchanted princess through ferocious monsters of every kind and to encounter the brimstone terrors of some fiery dragon  there is still another circumstance which inclines me to give very considerable credit to master simons suspicions lady lillycraft is very fond of quoting poetry and the conversation often turns upon it on which occasions the general is thrown completely out it happened the other day that spensers fairy queen was the theme for the greater part of the morning and the poor general sat perfectly silent i found him not long after in the library with spectacles on nose a book in his hand and fast asleep on my approach he awoke slipt the spectacles into his pocket and began to read very attentively after a little while he put a paper in the place and laid the volume aside which i perceived was the fairy queen i have had the curiosity to watch how he got on in his poetical studies but though i have repeatedly seen him with the book in his hand yet i find the paper has not advanced above three or four pages the general being extremely apt to fall asleep when he reads     falconry    ne is there hawk which mantleth on her perch   whether high towring or accousting low   but i the measure of her flight doe search   and all her prey and all her diet know    spenser   there are several grand sources of lamentation furnished to the worthy squire by the improvement of society and the grievous advancement of knowledge among which there is none i believe that causes him more frequent regret than the unfortunate invention of gunpowder to this he continually traces the decay of some favourite custom and indeed the general downfall of all chivalrous and romantic usages english soldiers he says have never been the men they were in the days of the crossbow and the longbow when they depended upon the strength of the arm and the english archer could draw a clothyard shaft to the head these were the times when at the battles of cressy poietiers and agincourt the french chivalry was completely destroyed by the bowmen of england the yeomanry too have never been what they were when in times of peace they were constantly exercised with the bow and archery was a favourite holiday pastime  among the other evils which have followed in the train of this fatal invention of gunpowder the squire classes the total decline of the noble art of falconry shooting he says is a skulking treacherous solitary sport in comparison but hawking was a gallant open sunshiny recreation it was the generous sport of hunting carried into the skies  it was moreover he says according to braithwate the stately amusement of high and mounting spirits for as the old welsh proverb affirms in those tunes you might know a gentleman by his hawk horse and grayhound indeed a cavalier was seldom seen abroad without his hawk on his fist and even a lady of rank did not think herself completely equipped in riding forth unless she had a tasselgentel held by jesses on her delicate hand it was thought in those excellent days according to an old writer quite sufficient for noblemen to winde their horn and to carry their hawke fair and leave study and learning to the children of mean people  knowing the good squires hobby therefore i have not been surprised at finding that among the various recreations of former times which he has endeavoured to revive in the little world in which he rules he has bestowed great attention on the noble art of falconry in this he of course has been seconded by his indefatigable coadjutor master simon and even the parson has thrown considerable light on their labours by various hints on the subject which he has met with in old english works as to the precious work of that famous dame juliana barnes the gentlemans academie by markham and the other wellknown treatises that were the manuals of ancient sportsmen they have them at their fingers ends but they have more especially studied some old tapestry in the house whereon is represented a party of cavaliers and stately dames with doublets caps and flaunting feathers mounted on horse with attendants on foot all in animated pursuit of the game  the squire has discountenanced the killing of any hawks in his neighbourhood but gives a liberal bounty for all that are brought him alive so that the hall is well stocked with all kinds of birds of prey on these he and master simon have exhausted their patience and ingenuity endeavouring to reclaim them as it is termed and to train them up for the sport but they have met with continual checks and disappointments their feathered school has turned out the most untractable and graceless scholars nor is it the least of their trouble to drill the retainers who were to act as ushers under them and to take immediate charge of these refractory birds old christy and the gamekeeper both for a time set their faces against the whole plan of education christy having been nettled at hearing what he terms a wildgoose chase put on a par with a foxhunt and the gamekeeper having always been accustomed to look upon hawks as arrant poachers which it was his duty to shoot down and nail in terrorem against the outhouses  christy has at length taken the matter in hand but has done still more mischief by his intermeddling he is as positive and wrongheaded about this as he is about hunting master simon has continual disputes with him as to feeding and training the hawks he reads to him long passages from the old authors i have mentioned but christy who cannot read has a sovereign contempt for all bookknowledge and persists in treating the hawks according to his own notions which are drawn from his experience in younger days in the rearing of gamecocks  the consequence is that between these jarring systems the poor birds have had a most trying and unhappy time of it many have fallen victims to christys feeding and master simons physicking for the latter has gone to work secundum artem and has given them all the vomitings and scourings laid down in the books never were poor hawks so fed and physicked before others have been lost by being but half reclaimed or tamed for on being taken into the field they have raked after the game quite out of hearing of the call and never returned to school  all these disappointments had been petty yet sore grievances to the squire and had made him to despond about success he has lately however been made happy by the receipt of a fine welsh falcon which master simon terms a stately highflyer it is a present from the squires friend sir watkyn williams wynne and is no doubt a descendant of some ancient line of welsh princes of the air that have long lorded it over their kingdom of clouds from wynnstay to the very summit of snowden or the brow of penmanmawr  ever since the squire received this invaluable present he has been as impatient to sally forth and make proof of it as was don quixote to assay his suit of armour there have been some demurs as to whether the bird was in proper health and training but these have been overruled by the vehement desire to play with a new toy and it has been determined right or wrong in season or out of season to have a days sport in hawking tomorrow  the hall as usual whenever the squire is about to make some new sally on his hobby is all agog with the thing miss templeton who is brought up in reverence for all her guardians humours has proposed to be of the party and lady lillycraft has talked also of riding out to the scene of action and looking on this has gratified the old gentleman extremely he hails it as an auspicious omen of the revival of falconry and does not despair but the time will come when it will be again the pride of a fine lady to carry about a noble falcon in preference to a parrot or a lapdog  i have amused myself with the bustling preparations of that busy spirit master simon and the continual thwartings he receives from that genuine son of a pepperbox old christy they have had halfadozen consultations about how the hawk is to be prepared for the mornings sport old nimrod as usual has always got in a pet upon which master simon has invariably given up the point observing in a goodhumoured tone well well have it your own way christy only dont put yourself in a passion a reply which always nettles the old man ten times more than ever     hawking    the soaring hawk from fist that flies   her falconer doth constrain   some times to range the ground about   to find her out again   and if by sight or sound of bell   his falcon he may see   wo ho he cries with cheerful voice   the gladdest man is he    handful of pleasant delites   at an early hour this morning the hall was in a bustle preparing for the sport of the day i heard master simon whistling and singing under my window at sunrise as he was preparing the jesses for the hawks legs and could distinguish now and then a stanza of one of his favourite old ditties    in peascod time when hound to horn   gives note that buck be killd   and little boy with pipe of corn   is tending sheep afield c  a hearty breakfast well flanked by cold meats was served up in the great hall the whole garrison of retainers and hangerson were in motion reenforced by volunteer idlers from the village the horses were led up and down before the door every body had something to say and something to do and hurried hither and thither there was a direful yelping of dogs some that were to accompany us being eager to set off and others that were to stay at home being whipped back to their kennels in short for once the good squires mansion might have been taken as a good specimen of one of the rantipole establishments of the good old feudal times  breakfast being finished the chivalry of the hall prepared to take the field the fair julia was of the party in a huntingdress with a light plume of feathers in her ridinghat as she mounted her favourite galloway i remarked with pleasure that old christy forgot his usual crustiness and hastened to adjust her saddle and bridle he touched his cap as she smiled on him and thanked him and then looking round at the other attendants gave a knowing nod of his head in which i read pride and exultation at the charming appearance of his pupil  lady lillycraft had likewise determined to witness the sport she was dressed in her broad white beaver tied under the chin and a ridinghabit of the last century she rode her sleek ambling pony whose motion was as easy as a rockingchair and was gallantly escorted by the general who looked not unlike one of the doughty heroes in the old prints of the battle of blenheim the parson likewise accompanied her on the other side for this was a learned amusement in which he took great interest and indeed had given much counsel from his knowledge of old customs  at length every thing was arranged and off we set from the hall the exercise on horseback puts one in fine spirits and the scene was gay and animating the young men of the family accompanied miss templeton she sat lightly and gracefully in her saddle her plumes dancing and waving in the air and the group had a charming effect as they appeared and disappeared among the trees cantering along with the bounding animation of youth the squire and master simon rode together accompanied by old christy mounted on pepper the latter bore the hawk on his fist as he insisted the bird was most accustomed to him there was a rabble rout on foot composed of retainers from the hall and some idlers from the village with two or three spaniels for the purpose of starting the game  a kind of corps de reserve came on quietly in the rear composed of lady lillycraft general harbottle the parson and a fat footman her ladyship ambled gently along on her pony while the general mounted on a tall hunter looked down upon her with an air of the most protecting gallantry  for my part being no sportsman i kept with this last party or rather lagged behind that i might take in the whole picture and the parson occasionally slackened his pace and jogged on in company with me  the sport led us at some distance from the hall in a soft meadow reeking with the moist verdure of spring a little river ran through it bordered by willows which had put forth their tender early foliage the sportsmen were in quest of herons which were said to keep about this stream  there was some disputing already among the leaders of the sport the squire master simon and old christy came every now and then to a pause to consult together like the field officers in an army and i saw by certain motions of the head that christy was as positive as any old wrongheaded german commander  as we were prancing up this quiet meadow every sound we made was answered by a distinct echo from the sunny wall of an old building that lay on the opposite margin of the stream and i paused to listen to this spirit of a sound which seems to love such quiet and beautiful places the parson informed me that this was the ruin of an ancient grange and was supposed by the country people to be haunted by a dobbie a kind of rural sprite something like robingoodfellow they often fancied the echo to be the voice of the dobbie answering them and were rather shy of disturbing it after dark he added that the squire was very careful of this ruin on account of the superstition connected with it as i considered this local habitation of an airy nothing i called to mind the fine description of an echo in websters duchess of malfry    yond side o th river lies a wall   piece of a cloister which in my opinion   gives the best echo that you ever heard   so plain in the distinction of our words   that many have supposed it a spirit   that answers  the parson went on to comment on a pleasing and fanciful appellation which the jews of old gave to the echo which they called bathkool that is to say the daughter of the voice they considered it an oracle supplying in the second temple the want of the urim and thummim with which the first was honoured5 the little man was just entering very largely and learnedly upon the subject when we were startled by a prodigious bawling shouting and yelping a flight of crows alarmed by the approach of our forces had suddenly risen from a meadow a cry was put up by the rabble rout on footnow christy now is your time christy the squire and master simon who were beating up the river banks in quest of a heron called out eagerly to christy to keep quiet the old man vexed and bewildered by the confusion of voices completely lost his head in his flurry he slipped off the hood cast off the falcon and away flew the crows and away soared the hawk  footnote 5 bekkers monde enchanté  i had paused on a rising ground close to lady lillycraft and her escort from whence i had a good view of the sport i was pleased with the appearance of the party in the meadow riding along in the direction that the bird flew their bright beaming faces turned up to the bright skies as they watched the game the attendants on foot scampering along looking up and calling out and the dogs bounding and yelping with clamorous sympathy  the hawk had singled out a quarry from among the carrion crew it was curious to see the efforts of the two birds to get above each other one to make the fatal swoop the other to avoid it now they crossed athwart a bright feathery cloud and now they were against the clear blue sky i confess being no sportsman i was more interested for the poor bird that was striving for its life than for the hawk that was playing the part of a mercenary soldier at length the hawk got the upper hand and made a rushing stoop at her quarry but the latter made as sudden a surge downwards and slanting up again evaded the blow screaming and making the best of his way for a dry tree on the brow of a neighbouring hill while the hawk disappointed of her blow soared up again into the air and appeared to be raking off it was in vain old christy called and whistled and endeavoured to lure her down she paid no regard to him and indeed his calls were drowned in the shouts and yelps of the army of militia that had followed him into the field  just then an exclamation from lady lillycraft made me turn my head i beheld a complete confusion among the sportsmen in the little vale below us they were galloping and running towards the edge of a bank and i was shocked to see miss templetons horse galloping at large without his rider i rode to the place to which the others were hurrying and when i reached the bank which almost overhung the stream i saw at the foot of it the fair julia pale bleeding and apparently lifeless supported in the arms of her frantic lover  in galloping heedlessly along with her eyes turned upward she had unwarily approached too near the bank it had given way with her and she and her horse had been precipitated to the pebbled margin of the river  i never saw greater consternation the captain was distracted lady lillycraft fainting the squire in dismay and master simon at his wits end the beautiful creature at length showed signs of returning life she opened her eyes looked around her upon the anxious group and comprehending in a moment the nature of the scene gave a sweet smile and putting her hand in her lovers exclaimed feebly i am not much hurt guy i could have taken her to my heart for that single exclamation  it was found indeed that she had escaped almost miraculously with a contusion on the head a sprained ankle and some slight bruises after her wound was stanched she was taken to a neighbouring cottage until a carriage could be summoned to convey her home and when this had arrived the cavalcade which had issued forth so gayly on this enterprise returned slowly and pensively to the hall  i had been charmed by the generous spirit shown by this young creature who amidst pain and danger had been anxious only to relieve the distress of those around her i was gratified therefore by the universal concern displayed by the domestics on our return they came crowding down the avenue each eager to render assistance the butler stood ready with some curiously delicate cordial the old housekeeper was provided with halfadozen nostrums prepared by her own hands according to the family receiptbook while her niece the melting phoebe having no other way of assisting stood wringing her hands and weeping aloud  the most material effect that is likely to follow this accident is a postponement of the nuptials which were close at hand though i commiserate the impatience of the captain on that account yet i shall not otherwise be sorry at the delay as it will give me a better opportunity of studying the characters here assembled with which i grow more and more entertained  i cannot but perceive that the worthy squire is quite disconcerted at the unlucky result of his hawking experiment and this unfortunate illustration of his eulogy on female equitation old christy too is very waspish having been sorely twitted by master simon for having let his hawk fly at carrion as to the falcon in the confusion occasioned by the fair julias disaster the bird was totally forgotten i make no doubt she has made the best of her way back to the hospitable hall of sir watkyn williams wynne and may very possibly at this present writing be pluming her wings among the breezy bowers of wynnstay     st marks eve    o t is a fearful thing to be no more   or if to be to wander after death   to walk as spirits do in brakes all day   and when the darkness comes to glide in paths   that lead to graves and in the silent vault   where lies your own pale shroud to hover oer it   striving to enter your forbidden corpse    dryden   the conversation this evening at the suppertable took a curious turn on the subject of a superstition formerly very prevalent in this part of the country relative to the present night of the year which is the eve of st marks it was believed the parson informed us that if any one would watch in the church porch on this eve for three successive years from eleven to one oclock at night he would see on the third year the shades of those of the parish who were to die in the course of the year pass by him into church clad in their usual apparel  dismal as such a sight would be he assured us that it was formerly a frequent thing for persons to make the necessary vigils he had known more than one instance in his time one old woman who pretended to have seen this phantom procession was an object of great awe for the whole year afterwards and caused much uneasiness and mischief if she shook her head mysteriously at a person it was like a deathwarrant and she had nearly caused the death of a sick person by looking ruefully in at the window  there was also an old man not many years since of a sullen melancholy temperament who had kept two vigils and began to excite some talk in the village when fortunately for the public comfort he died shortly after his third watching very probably from a cold that he had taken as the night was tempestuous it was reported about the village however that he had seen his own phantom pass by him into the church  this led to the mention of another superstition of an equally strange and melancholy kind which however is chiefly confined to wales it is respecting what are called corpsecandles little wandering fires of a pale bluish light that move about like tapers in the open air and are supposed to designate the way some corpse is to go one was seen at lanyler late at night hovering up and down along the bank of the istwith and was watched by the neighbours until they were tired and went to bed not long afterwards there came a comely country lass from montgomeryshire to see her friends who dwelt on the opposite side of the river she thought to ford the stream at the very place where the light had been first seen but was dissuaded on account of the height of the flood she walked to and fro along the bank just where the candle had moved waiting for the subsiding of the water she at length endeavored to cross but the poor girl was drowned in the attempt6  footnote 6 aubreys miscel  there was something mournful in this little anecdote of rural superstition that seemed to affect all the listeners indeed it is curious to remark how completely a conversation of the kind will absorb the attention of a circle and sober down its gayety however boisterous by degrees i noticed that every one was leaning forward over the table with eyes earnestly fixed upon the parson and at the mention of corpsecandles which had been seen about the chamber of a young lady who died on the eve of her weddingday lady lillycraft turned pale  i have witnessed the introduction of stories of the kind into various evening circles they were often commenced in jest and listened to with smiles but i never knew the most gay or the most enlightened of audiences that were not if the conversation continued for any length of time completely and solemnly interested in it there is i believe a degree of superstition lurking in every mind and i doubt if any one can thoroughly examine all his secret notions and impulses without detecting it hidden perhaps even from himself it seems in fact to be a part of our nature like instinct in animals acting independently of our reason it is often found existing in lofty natures especially those that are poetical and aspiring a great and extraordinary poet of our day whose life and writings evince a mind subject to powerful exaltations is said to believe in omens and secret intimations caesar it is well known was greatly under the influence of such belief and napoleon had his good and evil days and his presiding star  as to the worthy parson i have no doubt that he is strongly inclined to superstition he is naturally credulous and passes so much of his time searching out popular traditions and supernatural tales that his mind has probably become infected by them he has lately been immersed in the demonolatria of nicholas remigus concerning supernatural occurrences in lorraine and the writings of joachimus camerius called by vossius the phoenix of germany and he entertains the ladies with stories from them that make them almost afraid to go to bed at night i have been charmed myself with some of the wild little superstitions which he has adduced from blefkénius scheffer and others such as those of the laplanders about the domestic spirits which wake them at night and summon them to go and fish of thor the deity of thunder who has power of life and death health and sickness and who armed with the rainbow shoots his arrows at those evil demons that live on the tops of rocks and mountains and infest the lakes of the jubles or juhlafolket vagrant troops of spirits which roam the air and wander up and down by forests and mountains and the moonlight sides of hills  the parson never openly professes his belief in ghosts but i have remarked that he has a suspicious way of pressing great names into the defence of supernatural doctrines and making philosophers and saints fight for him he expatiates at large on the opinions of the ancient philosophers about larves or nocturnal phantoms the spirits of the wicked which wandered like exiles about the earth and about those spiritual beings which abode in the air but descended occasionally to earth and mingled among mortals acting as agents between them and the gods he quotes also from philo the rabbi the contemporary of the apostles and according to some the friend of st paul who says that the air is full of spirits of different ranks some destined to exist for a time in mortal bodies from which being emancipated they pass and repass between heaven and earth as agents or messengers in the service of the deity  but the worthy little man assumes a bolder tone when he quotes from the fathers of the church such as st jerome who gives it as the opinion of all the doctors that the air is filled with powers opposed to each other and lactantius who says that corrupt and dangerous spirits wander over the earth and seek to console themselves for their own fall by effecting the ruin of the human race and clemens alexandrinus who is of opinion that the souls of the blessed have knowledge of what passes among men the same as angels have  i am now alone in my chamber but these themes have taken such hold of my imagination that i cannot sleep the room in which i sit is just fitted to foster such a state of mind the walls are hung with tapestry the figures of which are faded and look like unsubstantial shapes melting away from sight over the fireplace is the portrait of a lady who according to the housekeepers tradition pined to death for the loss of her lover in the battle of blenheim she has a most pale and plaintive countenance and seems to fix her eyes mournfully upon me the family have long since retired i have heard their steps die away and the distant doors clap to after them the murmur of voices and the peal of remote laughter no longer reach the ear the clock from the church in which so many of the former inhabitants of this house lie buried has chimed the awful hour of midnight  i have sat by the window and mused upon the dusky landscape watching the lights disappearing one by one from the distant village and the moon rising in her silent majesty and leading up all the silver pomp of heaven as i have gazed upon these quiet groves and shadowy lawns silvered over and imperfectly lighted by streaks of dewy moonshine my mind has been crowded by thickcoming fancies concerning those spiritual beings which                 walk the earth   unseen both when we wake and when we sleep  are there indeed such beings is this space between us and the deity filled up by innumerable orders of spiritual beings forming the same gradations between the human soul and divine perfection that we see prevailing from humanity downwards to the meanest insect it is a sublime and beautiful doctrine inculcated by the early fathers that there are guardian angels appointed to watch over cities and nations to take care of the welfare of good men and to guard and guide the steps of helpless infancy nothing says st jerome gives up a greater idea of the dignity of our soul than that god has given each of us at the moment of our birth an angel to have care of it  even the doctrine of departed spirits returning to visit the scenes and beings which were dear to them during the bodys existence though it has been debased by the absurd superstitions of the vulgar in itself is awfully solemn and sublime  however lightly it may be ridiculed yet the attention involuntarily yielded to it whenever it is made the subject of serious discussion its prevalence in all ages and countries and even among newlydiscovered nations that have had no previous interchange of thought with other parts of the world prove it to be one of those mysteries and almost instinctive beliefs to which if left to ourselves we should naturally incline  in spite of all the pride of reason and philosophy a vague doubt will still lurk in the mind and perhaps will never be perfectly eradicated as it is concerning a matter that does not admit of positive demonstration every thing connected with our spiritual nature is full of doubt and difficulty we are fearfully and wonderfully made we are surrounded by mysteries and we are mysteries even to ourselves who yet has been able to comprehend and describe the nature of the soul its connection with the body or in what part of the frame it is situated we know merely that it does exist but whence it came and when it entered into us and how it is retained and where it is seated and how it operates are all matters of mere speculation and contradictory theories if then we are thus ignorant of this spiritual essence even while it forms a part of ourselves and is continually present to our consciousness how can we pretend to ascertain or to deny its powers and operations when released from its fleshy prisonhouse it is more the manner therefore in which this superstition has been degraded than its intrinsic absurdity that has brought it into contempt raise it above the frivolous purposes to which it has been applied strip it of the gloom and horror with which it has been surrounded and there is none of the whole circle of visionary creeds that could more delightfully elevate the imagination or more tenderly affect the heart it would become a sovereign comfort at the bed of death soothing the bitter tear wrung from us by the agony of our mortal separation what could be more consoling than the idea that the souls of those whom we once loved were permitted to return and watch over our welfarethat affectionate and guardian spirits sat by our pillows when we slept keeping a vigil over our most helpless hoursthat beauty and innocence which had languished into the tomb yet smiled unseen around us revealing themselves in those blest dreams wherein we live over again the hours of past endearment a belief of this kind would i should think be a new incentive to virtue rendering us circumspect even in our most secret moments from the idea that those we once loved and honoured were invisible witnesses of all our actions  it would take away too from that loneliness and destitution which we are apt to feel more and more as we get on in our pilgrimage through the wilderness of this world and find that those who set forward with us lovingly and cheerily on the journey have one by one dropped away from our side place the superstition in this light and i confess i should like to be a believer in it i see nothing in it that is incompatible with the tender and merciful nature of our religion nor revolting to the wishes and affections of the heart  there are departed beings that i have loved as i never again shall love in this worldthat have loved me as i never again shall be loved if such beings do ever retain in their blessed spheres the attachments which they felt on earthif they take an interest in the poor concerns of transient mortality and are permitted to hold communion with those whom they have loved on earth i feel as if now at this deep hour of night in this silence and solitude i could receive their visitation with the most solemn but unalloyed delight  in truth such visitations would be too happy for this world they would be incompatible with the nature of this imperfect state of being we are here placed in a mere scene of spiritual thraldom and restraint our souls are shut in and limited by bounds and barriers shackled by mortal infirmities and subject to all the gross impediments of matter in vain would they seek to act independently of the body and to mingle together in spiritual intercourse they can only act here through their fleshy organs their earthly loves are made up of transient embraces and long separations the most intimate friendship of what brief and scattered portions of time does it consist we take each other by the hand and we exchange a few words and looks of kindness and we rejoice together for a few short momentsand then days months years intervene and we see and know nothing of each other or granting that we dwell together for the full season of this our mortal life the grave soon closes its gates between us and then our spirits are doomed to remain in separation and widowhood until they meet again in that more perfect state of being where soul will dwell with soul in blissful communion and there will be neither death nor absence nor any thing else to interrupt our felicity                                       in the foregoing paper i have alluded to the writings of some of the old jewish rabbis they abound with wild theories but among them are many truly poetical flights and their ideas are often very beautifully expressed their speculations on the nature of angels are curious and fanciful though much resembling the doctrines of the ancient philosophers in the writings of the rabbi eleazer is an account of the temptation of our first parents and the fall of the angels which the parson pointed out to me as having probably furnished some of the groundwork for paradise lost  according to eleazer the ministering angels said to the deity what is there in man that thou makest him of such importance is he any thing else than vanity for he can scarcely reason a little on terrestrial things to which god replied do you imagine that i will be exalted and glorified only by you here above i am the same below that i am here who is there among you that can call all the creatures by their names there was none found among them that could do so at that moment adam arose and called all the creatures by their names seeing which the ministering angels said among themselves let us consult together how we may cause adam to sin against the creator otherwise he will not fail to become our master  sammaël who was a great prince in the heavens was present at this council with the saints of the first order and the seraphim of six bands sammaël chose several out of the twelve orders to accompany him and descended below for the purpose of visiting all the creatures which god had created he found none more cunning and more fit to do evil than the serpent  the rabbi then treats of the seduction and the fall of man of the consequent fall of the demon and the punishment which god inflicted on adam eve and the serpent he made them all come before him pronounced nine maledictions on adam and eve and condemned them to suffer death and he precipitated sammaël and all his band from heaven he cut off the feet of the serpent which had before the figure of a camel sammaël having been mounted on him and he cursed him among all beasts and animals     gentility    true gentrie standeth in the trade   of virtuous life not in the fleshy line   for bloud is knit but gentrie is divine    mirror for magistrates   i have mentioned some peculiarities of the squire in the education of his sons but i would not have it thought that his instructions were directed chiefly to their personal accomplishments he took great pains also to form their minds and to inculcate what he calls good old english principles such as are laid down in the writings of peachem and his contemporaries there is one author of whom he cannot speak without indignation which is chesterfield he avers that he did much for a time to injure the true national character and to introduce instead of open manly sincerity a hollow perfidious courtliness his maxims he affirms were calculated to chill the delightful enthusiasm of youth to make them ashamed of that romance which is the dawn of generous manhood and to impart to them a cold polish and a premature worldliness  many of lord chesterfields maxims would make a young man a mere man of pleasure but an english gentleman should not be a mere man of pleasure he has no right to such selfish indulgence his ease his leisure his opulence are debts due to his country which he must ever stand ready to discharge he should be a man at all points simple frank courteous intelligent accomplished and informed upright intrepid and disinterested one that can mingle among freemen that can cope with statesmen that can champion his country and its rights either at home or abroad in a country like england where there is such free and unbounded scope for the exertion of intellect and where opinion and example have such weight with the people every gentleman of fortune and leisure should feel himself bound to employ himself in some way towards promoting the prosperity or glory of the nation in a country where intellect and action are trammelled and restrained men of rank and fortune may become idlers and triflers with impunity but an english coxcomb is inexcusable and this perhaps is the reason why he is the most offensive and insupportable coxcomb in the world  the squire as frank bracebridge informs me would often hold forth in this manner to his sons when they were about leaving the paternal roof one to travel abroad one to go to the army and one to the university he used to have them with him in the library which is hung with the portraits of sidney surrey raleigh wyat and others look at those models of true english gentlemen my sons he would say with enthusiasm those were men that wreathed the graces of the most delicate and refined taste around the stern virtues of the soldier that mingled what was gentle and gracious with what was hardy and manly that possessed the true chivalry of spirit which is the exalted essence of manhood they are the lights by which the youth of the country should array themselves they were the patterns and idols of their country at home they were the illustrators of its dignity abroad surrey says camden was the first nobleman that illustrated his high birth with the beauty of learning he was acknowledged to be the gallantest man the politest lover and the completest gentleman of his time and as to wyat his friend surrey most amiably testifies of him that his person was majestic and beautiful his visage stern and mild that he sung and played the lute with remarkable sweetness spoke foreign languages with grace and fluency and possessed an inexhaustible fund of wit and see what a high commendation is passed upon these illustrious friends they were the two chieftains who having travelled into italy and there tasted the sweet and stately measures and style of the italian poetry greatly polished our rude and homely manner of vulgar poetry from what it had been before and therefore may be justly called the reformers of our english poetry and style and sir philip sidney who has left us such monuments of elegant thought and generous sentiment and who illustrated his chivalrous spirit so gloriously in the field and sir walter raleigh the elegant courtier the intrepid soldier the enterprising discoverer the enlightened philosopher the magnanimous martyr these are the men for english gentlemen to study chesterfield with his cold and courtly maxims would have chilled and impoverished such spirits he would have blighted all the budding romance of their temperaments sidney would never have written his arcadia nor surrey have challenged the world in vindication of the beauties of his geraldine these are the men my sons the squire will continue that show to what our national character may be exalted when its strong and powerful qualities are duly wrought up and refined the solidest bodies are capable of the highest polish and there is no character that may be wrought to a more exquisite and unsullied brightness than that of the true english gentleman  when guy was about to depart for the army the squire again took him aside and gave him a long exhortation he warned him against that affectation of coolblooded indifference which he was told was cultivated by the young british officers among whom it was a study to sink the soldier in the mere man of fashion a soldier said he without pride and enthusiasm in his profession is a mere sanguinary hireling nothing distinguishes him from the mercenary bravo but a spirit of patriotism or a thirst for glory it is the fashion nowadays my son said he to laugh at the spirit of chivalry when that spirit is really extinct the profession of the soldier becomes a mere trade of blood he then set before him the conduct of edward the black prince who is his mirror of chivalry valiant generous affable humane gallant in the field but when he came to dwell on his courtesy toward his prisoner the king of france how he received him in his tent rather as a conqueror than as a captive attended on him at table like one of his retinue rode uncovered beside him on his entry into london mounted on a common palfrey while his prisoner was mounted in state on a white steed of stately beauty the tears of enthusiasm stood in the old gentlemans eyes  finally on taking leave the good squire put in his sons hands as a manual one of his favourite old volumes the life of the chevalier bayard by godefroy on a blank page of which he had written an extract from the morte darthur containing the eulogy of sir ector over the body of sir launcelot of the lake which the squire considers as comprising the excellencies of a true soldier ah sir launcelot thou wert head of all christian knights now there thou liest thou wert never matched of none earthly knightshands and thou wert the curtiest knight that ever bare shield and thou wert the truest friend to thy lover that ever bestrood horse and thou wert the truest lover of a sinfull man that ever loved woman and thou wert the kindest man that ever strook with sword and thou wert the goodliest person that ever came among the presse of knights and thou wert the meekest man and the gentlest that ever eate in hall among ladies and thou wert the sternest knight to thy mortal foe that ever put speare in the rest     fortunetelling    each city each town and every village   affords us either an alms or pillage   and if the weather be cold and raw   then in a barn we tumble on straw   if warm and fair by yeacock and naycock   the fields will afford us a hedge or a haycock    merry beggars   as i was walking one evening with the oxonian master simon and the general in a meadow not far from the village we heard the sound of a fiddle rudely played and looking in the direction from whence it came we saw a thread of smoke curling up from among the trees the sound of music is always attractive for wherever there is music there is goodhumour or goodwill we passed along a footpath and had a peep through a break in the hedge at the musician and his party when the oxonian gave us a wink and told us that if we would follow him we should have some sport  it proved to be a gipsy encampment consisting of three or four little cabins or tents made of blankets and sailcloth spread over hoops that were stuck in the ground it was on one side of a green lane close under a hawthorn hedge with a broad beechtree spreading above it a small rill tinkled along close by through the fresh sward that looked like a carpet  a teakettle was hanging by a crooked piece of iron over a fire made from dry sticks and leaves and two old gipsies in red cloaks sat crouched on the grass gossiping over their evening cup of tea for these creatures though they live in the open air have their ideas of fireside comforts there were two or three children sleeping on the straw with which the tents were littered a couple of donkeys were grazing in the lane and a thievishlooking dog was lying before the fire some of the younger gipsies were dancing to the music of a fiddle played by a tall slender stripling in an old frockcoat with a peacocks feather stuck in his hatband  as we approached a gipsy girl with a pair of fine roguish eyes came up and as usual offered to tell our fortunes i could not but admire a certain degree of slattern elegance about the baggage her long black silken hair was curiously plaited in numerous small braids and negligently put up in a picturesque style that a painter might have been proud to have devised  her dress was of figured chintz rather ragged and not overclean but of a variety of most harmonious and agreeable colours for these beings have a singularly fine eye for colours her straw hat was in her hand and a red cloak thrown over one arm  the oxonian offered at once to have his fortune told and the girl began with the usual volubility of her race but he drew her on one side near the hedge as he said he had no idea of having his secrets overheard i saw he was talking to her instead of she to him and by his glancing towards us now and then that he was giving the baggage some private hints when they returned to us he assumed a very serious air zounds said he its very astonishing how these creatures come by their knowledge this girl has told me some things that i thought no one knew but myself the girl now assailed the general come your honour said she i see by your face youre a lucky man but youre not happy in your mind youre not indeed sir but have a good heart and give me a good piece of silver and ill tell you a nice fortune  the general had received all her approaches with a banter and had suffered her to get hold of his hand but at the mention of the piece of silver he hemmed looked grave and turning to us asked if we had not better continue our walk come my master said the girl archly youd not be in such a hurry if you knew all that i could tell you about a fair lady that has a notion for you come sir old love burns strong theres many a one comes to see weddings that go away brides themselveshere the girl whispered something in a low voice at which the general coloured up was a little fluttered and suffered himself to be drawn aside under the hedge where he appeared to listen to her with great earnestness and at the end paid her halfacrown with the air of a man that has got the worth of his money the girl next made her attack upon master simon who however was too old a bird to be caught knowing that it would end in an attack upon his purse about which he is a little sensitive as he has a great notion however of being considered a royster he chucked her under the chin played her off with rather broad jokes and put on something of the rakehelly air that we see now and then assumed on the stage by the sadboy gentleman of the old school ah your honour said the girl with a malicious leer you were not in such a tantrum last year when i told you about the widow you know who but if you had taken a friends advice youd never have come away from doncaster races with a flea in your ear there was a secret sting in this speech that seemed quite to disconcert master simon he jerked away his hand in a pet smacked his whip whistled to his dogs and intimated that it was high time to go home the girl however was determined not to lose her harvest she now turned upon me and as i have a weakness of spirit where there is a pretty face concerned she soon wheedled me out of my money and in return read me a fortune which if it prove true and i am determined to believe it will make me one of the luckiest men in the chronicles of cupid  i saw that the oxonian was at the bottom of all this oracular mystery and was disposed to amuse himself with the general whose tender approaches to the widow have attracted the notice of the wag i was a little curious however to know the meaning of the dark hints which had so suddenly disconcerted master simon and took occasion to fall in the rear with the oxonian on our way home when he laughed heartily at my questions and gave me ample information on the subject  the truth of the matter is that master simon has met with a sad rebuff since my christmas visit to the hall he used at that time to be joked about a widow a fine dashing woman as he privately informed me i had supposed the pleasure he betrayed on these occasions resulted from the usual fondness of old bachelors for being teased about getting married and about flirting and being fickle and falsehearted i am assured however that master simon had really persuaded himself the widow had a kindness for him in consequence of which he had been at some extraordinary expense in new clothes and had actually got frank bracebridge to order him a coat from stultz he began to throw out hints about the importance of a mans settling himself in life before he grew old he would look grave whenever the widow and matrimony were mentioned in the same sentence and privately asked the opinion of the squire and parson about the prudence of marrying a widow with a rich jointure but who had several children  an important member of a great family connexion cannot harp much upon the theme of matrimony without its taking wind and it soon got buzzed about that mr simon bracebridge was actually gone to doncaster races with a new horse but that he meant to return in a curricle with a lady by his side master simon did indeed go to the races and that with a new horse and the dashing widow did make her appearance in a curricle but it was unfortunately driven by a strapping young irish dragoon with whom even master simons selfcomplacency would not allow him to venture into competition and to whom she was married shortly after  it was a matter of sore chagrin to master simon for several months having never before been fully committed the dullest head in the family had a joke upon him and there is no one that likes less to be bantered than an absolute joker he took refuge for a time at lady lillycrafts until the matter should blow over and occupied himself by looking over her accounts regulating the village choir and inculcating loyalty into a pet bulfinch by teaching him to whistle god save the king  he has now pretty nearly recovered from the mortification holds up his head and laughs as much as any one again affects to pity married men and is particularly facetious about widows when lady lillycraft is not by his only time of trial is when the general gets hold of him who is infinitely heavy and persevering in his waggery and will interweave a dull joke through the various topics of a whole dinnertime master simon often parries these attacks by a stanza from his old work of cupids solicitor for love    tis in vain to wooe a widow over long   in once or twice her mind you may perceive   widows are subtle be they old or young   and by their wiles young men they will deceive     lovecharms    come do not weep my girl   forget him pretty pensiveness there will   come others every day as good as he    sir j suckling   the approach of a wedding in a family is always an event of great importance but particularly so in a household like this in a retired part of the country master simon who is a pervading spirit and through means of the butler and housekeeper knows every thing that goes forward tells me that the maidservants are continually trying their fortunes and that the servantshall has of late been quite a scene of incantation  it is amusing to notice how the oddities of the head of a family flow down through all the branches the squire in the indulgence of his love of every thing that smacks of old times has held so many grave conversations with the parson at table about popular superstitions and traditional rites that they have been carried from the parlour to the kitchen by the listening domestics and being apparently sanctioned by such high authority the whole house has become infected by them  the servants are all versed in the common modes of trying luck and the charms to insure constancy they read their fortunes by drawing strokes in the ashes or by repeating a form of words and looking in a pail of water st marks eve i am told was a busy time with them being an appointed night for certain mystic ceremonies several of them sowed hempseed to be reaped by their true lovers and they even ventured upon the solemn and fearful preparation of the dumbcake this must be done fasting and in silence the ingredients are handed down in traditional form an eggshell full of salt an eggshell full of malt and an eggshell full of barleymeal when the cake is ready it is put upon a pan over the fire and the future husband will appear turn the cake and retire but if a word is spoken or a fast is broken during this awful ceremony there is no knowing what horrible consequences would ensue  the experiments in the present instance came to no result they that sowed the hempseed forgot the magic rhyme that they were to pronounceso the true lover never appeared and as to the dumbcake what between the awful stillness they had to keep and the awfulness of the midnight hour their hearts failed them when they had put the cake in the pan so that on the striking of the great houseclock in the servantshall they were seized with a sudden panic and ran out of the room to which they did not return until morning when they found the mystic cake burnt to a cinder  the most persevering at these spells however is phoebe wilkins the housekeepers niece as she is a kind of privileged personage and rather idle she has more time to occupy herself with these matters she has always had her head full of love and matrimony she knows the dreambook by heart and is quite an oracle among the little girls of the family who always come to her to interpret their dreams in the mornings  during the present gayety of the house however the poor girl has worn a face full of trouble and to use the housekeepers words has fallen into a sad hystericky way lately it seems that she was born and brought up in the village where her father was parishclerk and she was an early playmate and sweetheart of young jack tibbets since she has come to live at the hall however her head has been a little turned being very pretty and naturally genteel she has been much noticed and indulged and being the housekeepers niece she has held an equivocal station between a servant and a companion she has learnt something of fashions and notions among the young ladies which have effected quite a metamorphosis insomuch that her finery at church on sundays has given mortal offence to her former intimates in the village this has occasioned the misrepresentations which have awakened the implacable family pride of dame tibbets but what is worse phoebe having a spice of coquetry in her disposition showed it on one or two occasions to her lover which produced a downright quarrel and jack being very proud and fiery has absolutely turned his back upon her for several successive sundays  the poor girl is full of sorrow and repentance and would fain make up with her lover but he feels his security and stands aloof in this he is doubtless encouraged by his mother who is continually reminding him what he owes to his family for this same family pride seems doomed to be the eternal bane of lovers  as i hate to see a pretty face in trouble i have felt quite concerned for the luckless phoebe ever since i heard her story it is a sad thing to be thwarted in love at any time but particularly so at this tender season of the year when every living thing even to the very butterfly is sporting with its mate and the green fields and the budding groves and the singing of the birds and the sweet smell of the flowers are enough to turn the head of a lovesick girl i am told that the coolness of young readymoney lies very heavy at poor phoebes heart instead of singing about the house as formerly she goes about pale and sighing and is apt to break into tears when her companions are full of merriment  mrs hannah the vestal gentlewoman of my lady lillycraft has had long talks and walks with phoebe up and down the avenue of an evening and has endeavoured to squeeze some of her own verjuice into the others milky nature she speaks with contempt and abhorrence of the whole sex and advises phoebe to despise all the men as heartily as she does but phoebes loving temper is not to be curdled she has no such thing as hatred or contempt for mankind in her whole composition she has all the simple fondness of heart of poor weak loving woman and her only thoughts at present are how to conciliate and reclaim her wayward swain  the spells and lovecharms which are matters of sport to the other domestics are serious concerns with this lovestricken damsel she is continually trying her fortune in a variety of ways i am told that she has absolutely fasted for six wednesdays and three fridays successively having understood that it was a sovereign charm to insure being married to ones liking within the year she carries about also a lock of her sweethearts hair and a riband he once gave her being a mode of producing constancy in a lover she even went so far as to try her fortune by the moon which has always had much to do with lovers dreams and fancies for this purpose she went out in the night of the full moon knelt on a stone in the meadow and repeated the old traditional rhyme    all hail to thee moon all hail to thee   i pray thee good moon now show to me   the youth who my future husband shall be  when she came back to the house she was faint and pale and went immediately to bed the next morning she told the porters wife that she had seen some one close by the hedge in the meadow which she was sure was young tibbets at any rate she had dreamt of him all night both of which the old dame assured her were most happy signs it has since turned out that the person in the meadow was old christy the huntsman who was walking his nightly rounds with the great staghound so that phoebes faith in the charm is completely shaken     the library   yesterday the fair julia made her first appearance downstairs since her accident and the sight of her spread an universal cheerfulness through the household she was extremely pale however and could not walk without pain and difficulty she was assisted therefore to a sofa in the library which is pleasant and retired looking out among trees and so quiet that the little birds come hopping upon the windows and peering curiously into the apartment here several of the family gathered round and devised means to amuse her and make the day pass pleasantly lady lillycraft lamented the want of some new novel to while away the time and was almost in a pet because the author of waverley had not produced a work for the last three months  there was a motion made to call on the parson for some of his old legends or ghost stories but to this lady lillycraft objected as they were apt to give her the vapours general harbottle gave a minute account for the sixth time of the disaster of a friend in india who had his leg bitten off by a tiger whilst he was hunting and was proceeding to menace the company with a chapter or two about tippoo saib  at length the captain bethought himself and said he believed he had a manuscript tale lying in one corner of his campaigning trunk which if he could find and the company were desirous he would read to them the offer was eagerly accepted he retired and soon returned with a roll of blotted manuscript in a very gentlemanlike but nearly illegible hand and a great part written on cartridgepaper  it is one of the scribblings said he of my poor friend charles lightly of the dragoons he was a curious romantic studious fanciful fellow the favourite and often the unconscious butt of his fellowofficers who entertained themselves with his eccentricities he was in some of the hardest service in the peninsula and distinguished himself by his gallantry when the intervals of duty permitted he was fond of roving about the country visiting noted places and was extremely fond of moorish ruins when at his quarters he was a great scribbler and passed much of his leisure with his pen in his hand  as i was a much younger officer and a very young man he took me in a manner under his care and we became close friends he used often to read his writings to me having a great confidence in my taste for i always praised them poor fellow he was shot down close by me at waterloo we lay wounded together for some time during a hard contest that took place near at hand as i was least hurt i tried to relieve him and to stanch the blood which flowed from a wound in his breast he lay with his head in my lap and looked up thankfully in my face but shook his head faintly and made a sign that it was all over with him and indeed he died a few minutes afterwards just as our men had repulsed the enemy and came to our relief i have his favourite dog and his pistols to this day and several of his manuscripts which he gave to me at different times the one i am now going to read is a tale which he said he wrote in spain during the time that he lay ill of a wound received at salamanca  we now arranged ourselves to hear the story the captain seated himself on the sofa beside the fair julia who i had noticed to be somewhat affected by the picture he had carelessly drawn of wounds and dangers in a field of battle she now leaned her arm fondly on his shoulder and her eye glistened as it rested on the manuscript of the poor literary dragoon lady lillycraft buried herself in a deep wellcushioned elbowchair her dogs were nestled on soft mats at her feet and the gallant general took his station in an armchair at her side and toyed with her elegantly ornamented workbag the rest of the circle being all equally well accommodated the captain began his story a copy of which i have procured for the benefit of the reader     the student of salamanca    what a life do i lead with my master nothing but blowing of   bellowes beating of spirits and scraping of croslets it is a   very secret science for none almost can understand the language   of it sublimation almigation calcination rubification   albification and fermentation with as many termes unpossible to   be uttered as the arte to be compassed    lillys gallathea   once upon a time in the ancient city of granada there sojourned a young man of the name of antonio de castros he wore the garb of a student of salamanca and was pursuing a course of reading in the library of the university and at intervals of leisure indulging his curiosity by examining those remains of moorish magnificence for which granada is renowned  whilst occupied in his studies he frequently noticed an old man of a singular appearance who was likewise a visitor to the library he was lean and withered though apparently more from study than from age his eyes though bright and visionary were sunk in his head and thrown into shade by overhanging eyebrows his dress was always the same a black doublet a short black cloak very rusty and threadbare a small ruff and a large overshadowing hat  his appetite for knowledge seemed insatiable he would pass whole days in the library absorbed in study consulting a multiplicity of authors as though he were pursuing some interesting subject through all its ramifications so that in general when evening came he was almost buried among books and manuscripts  the curiosity of antonio was excited and he inquired of the attendants concerning the stranger no one could give him any information excepting that he had been for some time past a casual frequenter of the library that his reading lay chiefly among works treating of the occult sciences and that he was particularly curious in his inquiries after arabian manuscripts they added that he never held communication with any one excepting to ask for particular works that after a fit of studious application he would disappear for several days and even weeks and when he revisited the library he would look more withered and haggard than ever the student felt interested by this account he was leading rather a desultory life and had all that capricious curiosity which springs up in idleness he determined to make himself acquainted with this bookworm and find out who and what he was  the next time that he saw the old man at the library he commenced his approaches by requesting permission to look into one of the volumes with which the unknown appeared to have done the latter merely bowed his head in token of assent after pretending to look through the volume with great attention he returned it with many acknowledgments  the stranger made no reply  may i ask senor said antonio with some hesitation may i ask what you are searching after in all these books  the old man raised his head with an expression of surprise at having his studies interrupted for the first time and by so intrusive a question he surveyed the student with a side glance from head to foot wisdom my son said he calmly and the search requires every moment of my attention he then cast his eyes upon his book and resumed his studies  but father said antonio cannot you spare a moment to point out the road to others it is to experienced travellers like you that we strangers in the paths of knowledge must look for directions on our journey  the stranger looked disturbed i have not time enough my son to learn said he much less to teach i am ignorant myself of the path of true knowledge how then can i show it to others  well but father  senor said the old man mildly but earnestly you must see that i have but few steps more to the grave in that short space have i to accomplish the whole business of my existence i have no time for words every word is as one grain of sand of my glass wasted suffer me to be alone  there was no replying to so complete a closing of the door of intimacy the student found himself calmly but totally repulsed though curious and inquisitive yet he was naturally modest and on afterthoughts he blushed at his own intrusion his mind soon became occupied by other objects he passed several days wandering among the mouldering piles of moorish architecture those melancholy monuments of an elegant and voluptuous people he paced the deserted halls of the alhambra the paradise of the moorish kings he visited the great court of the lions famous for the perfidious massacre of the gallant abencerrages he gazed with admiration at its mosaic cupolas gorgeously painted in gold and azure its basins of marble its alabaster vase supported by lions and storied with inscriptions  his imagination kindled as he wandered among these scenes they were calculated to awaken all the enthusiasm of a youthful mind most of the halls have anciently been beautified by fountains the fine taste of the arabs delighted in the sparkling purity and reviving freshness of water and they erected as it were altars on every side to that delicate element poetry mingles with architecture in the alhambra it breathes along the very walls wherever antonio turned his eye he beheld inscriptions in arabic wherein the perpetuity of moorish power and splendour within these walls was confidently predicted  alas how has the prophecy been falsified many of the basins where the fountains had once thrown up their sparkling showers were dry and dusty some of the palaces were turned into gloomy convents and the barefoot monk paced through these courts which had once glittered with the array and echoed to the music of moorish chivalry  in the course of his rambles the student more than once encountered the old man of the library he was always alone and so full of thought as not to notice any one about him he appeared to be intent upon studying those halfburied inscriptions which are found here and there among the moorish ruins and seem to murmur from the earth the tale of former greatness the greater part of these have since been translated but they were supposed by many at the time to contain symbolical revelations and golden maxims of the arabian sages and astrologers as antonio saw the stranger apparently deciphering these inscriptions he felt an eager longing to make his acquaintance and to participate in his curious researches but the repulse he had met with at the library deterred him from making any further advances  he had directed his steps one evening to the sacred mount which overlooks the beautiful valley watered by the darro the fertile plain of the vega and all that rich diversity of vale and mountain that surrounds granada with an earthly paradise it was twilight when he found himself at the place where at the present day are situated the chapels known by the name of the sacred furnaces they are so called from grottoes in which some of the primitive saints are said to have been burnt at the time of antonios visit the place was an object of much curiosity in an excavation of these grottoes several manuscripts had recently been discovered engraved on plates of lead they were written in the arabian language excepting one which was in unknown characters the pope had issued a bull forbidding any one under pain of excommunication to speak of these manuscripts the prohibition had only excited the greater curiosity and many reports were whispered about that these manuscripts contained treasures of dark and forbidden knowledge  as antonio was examining the place from whence these mysterious manuscripts had been drawn he again observed the old man of the library wandering among the ruins his curiosity was now fully awakened the time and place served to stimulate it he resolved to watch this groper after secret and forgotten lore and to trace him to his habitation there was something like adventure in the thing that charmed his romantic disposition he followed the stranger therefore at a little distance at first cautiously but he soon observed him to be so wrapped in his own thoughts as to take little heed of external objects  they passed along the skirts of the mountain and then by the shady banks of the darro they pursued their way for some distance from granada along a lonely road that led among the hills the gloom of evening was gathering and it was quite dark when the stranger stopped at the portal of a solitary mansion  it appeared to be a mere wing or ruined fragment of what had once been a pile of some consequence the walls were of great thickness the windows narrow and generally secured by iron bars the door was of planks studded with iron spikes and had been of great strength though at present it was much decayed at one end of the mansion was a ruinous tower in the moorish style of architecture the edifice had probably been a country retreat or castle of pleasure during the occupation of granada by the moors and rendered sufficiently strong to withstand any casual assault in those warlike times  the old man knocked at the portal a light appeared at a small window just above it and a female head looked out it might have served as a model for one of raphaels saints the hair was beautifully braided and gathered in a silken net and the complexion as well as could be judged from the light was that soft rich brunette so becoming in southern beauty  it is i my child said the old man the face instantly disappeared and soon after a wicketdoor in the large portal opened antonio who had ventured near to the building caught a transient sight of a delicate female form a pair of fine black eyes darted a look of surprise at seeing a stranger hovering near and the door was precipitately closed  there was something in this sudden gleam of beauty that wonderfully struck the imagination of the student it was like a brilliant flashing from its dark casket he sauntered about regarding the gloomy pile with increasing interest a few simple wild notes from among some rocks and trees at a little distance attracted his attention he found there a group of gitanas a vagabond gipsy race which at that time abounded in spain and lived in hovels and caves of the hills about the neighbourhood of granada some were busy about a fire and others were listening to the uncouth music which one of their companions seated on a ledge of the rock was making with a split reed  antonio endeavoured to obtain some information of them concerning the old building and its inhabitants the one who appeared to be their spokesman was a gaunt fellow with a subtle gait a whispering voice and a sinister roll of the eye he shrugged his shoulders on the students inquiries and said that all was not right in that building an old man inhabited it whom nobody knew and whose family appeared to be only a daughter and a female servant he and his companions he added lived up among the neighbouring hills and as they had been about at night they had often seen strange lights and heard strange sounds from the tower some of the country people who worked in the vineyards among the hills believed the old man to be one that dealt in the black art and were not overfond of passing near the tower at night but for our parts said the gitano we are not a people that trouble ourselves much with fears of that kind  the student endeavoured to gain more precise information but they had none to furnish him they began to be solicitous for a compensation for what they had already imparted and recollecting the loneliness of the place and the vagabond character of his companions he was glad to give them a gratuity and to hasten homewards  he sat down to his studies but his brain was too full of what he had seen and heard his eye was upon the page but his fancy still returned to the tower and he was continually picturing the little window with the beautiful head peeping out or the door half open and the nymphlike form within he retired to bed but the same object haunted his dreams he was young and susceptible and the excited state of his feelings from wandering among the abodes of departed grace and gallantry had predisposed him for a sudden impression from female beauty  the next morning he strolled again in the direction of the tower it was still more forlorn by the broad glare of day than in the gloom of evening the walls were crumbling and weeds and moss were growing in every crevice it had the look of a prison rather than a dwellinghouse in one angle however he remarked a window which seemed an exception to the surrounding squalidness there was a curtain drawn within it and flowers standing on the windowstone whilst he was looking at it the curtain was partially withdrawn and a delicate white arm of the most beautiful roundness was put forth to water the flowers  the student made a noise to attract the attention of the fair florist he succeeded the curtain was further drawn and he had a glance of the same lovely face he had seen the evening before it was but a mere glancethe curtain again fell and the casement closed all this was calculated to excite the feelings of a romantic youth had he seen the unknown under other circumstances it is probable that he would not have been struck with her beauty but this appearance of being shut up and kept apart gave her the value of a treasured gem he passed and repassed before the house several times in the course of the day but saw nothing more he was there again in the evening the whole aspect of the house was dreary the narrow windows emitted no rays of cheerful light to indicate that there was social life within antonio listened at the portal but no sound of voices reached his ear just then he heard the clapping to of a distant door and fearing to be detected in the unworthy act of eavesdropping he precipitately drew off to the opposite side of the road and stood in the shadow of a ruined archway  he now remarked a light from a window in the tower it was fitful and changeable commonly feeble and yellowish as if from a lamp with an occasional glare of some vivid metallic colour followed by a dusky glow a column of dense smoke would now and then rise in the air and hang like a canopy over the tower there was altogether such a loneliness and seeming mystery about the building and its inhabitants that antonio was half inclined to indulge the country peoples notions and to fancy it the den of some powerful sorcerer and the fair damsel he had seen to be some spellbound beauty  after some time had elapsed a light appeared in the window where he had seen the beautiful arm the curtain was down but it was so thin that he could perceive the shadow of some one passing and repassing between it and the light he fancied that he could distinguish that the form was delicate and from the alacrity of its movements it was evidently youthful he had not a doubt but this was the bedchamber of his beautiful unknown  presently he heard the sound of a guitar and a female voice singing he drew near cautiously and listened it was a plaintive moorish ballad and he recognized in it the lamentations of one of the abencerrages on leaving the walls of lovely granada it was full of passion and tenderness it spoke of the delights of early life the hours of love it had enjoyed on the banks of the darro and among the blissful abodes of the alhambra it bewailed the fallen honours of the abencerrages and imprecated vengeance on their oppressors antonio was affected by the music it singularly coincided with the place it was like the voice of past times echoed in the present and breathing among the monuments of its departed glory  the voice ceased after a time the light disappeared and all was still she sleeps said antonio fondly he lingered about the building with the devotion with which a lover lingers about the bower of sleeping beauty the rising moon threw its silver beams on the gray walls and glittered on the casement the late gloomy landscape gradually became flooded with its radiance finding therefore that he could no longer move about in obscurity and fearful that his loiterings might be observed he reluctantly retired  the curiosity which had at first drawn the young man to the tower was now seconded by feelings of a more romantic kind his studies were almost entirely abandoned he maintained a kind of blockade of the old mansion he would take a book with him and pass a great part of the day under the trees in its vicinity keeping a vigilant eye upon it and endeavouring to ascertain what were the walks of his mysterious charmer he found however that she never went out except to mass when she was accompanied by her father he waited at the door of the church and offered her the holy water in the hope of touching her hand a little office of gallantry common in catholic countries she however modestly declined without raising her eyes to see who made the offer and always took it herself from the font she was attentive in her devotion her eyes were never taken from the altar or the priest and on returning home her countenance was almost entirely concealed by her mantilla  antonio had now carried on the pursuit for several days and was hourly getting more and more interested in the chase but never a step nearer to the game his lurkings about the house had probably been noticed for he no longer saw the fair face at the window nor the white arm put forth to water the flowers his only consolation was to repair nightly to his post of observation and listen to her warbling and if by chance he could catch a sight of her shadow passing and repassing before the window he thought himself most fortunate  as he was indulging in one of these evening vigils which were complete revels of the imagination the sound of approaching footsteps made him withdraw into the deep shadow of the ruined archway opposite to the tower a cavalier approached wrapped in a large spanish cloak he paused under the window of the tower and after a little while began a serenade accompanied by his guitar in the usual style of spanish gallantry his voice was rich and manly he touched the instrument with skill and sang with amorous and impassioned eloquence the plume of his hat was buckled by jewels that sparkled in the moonbeams and as he played on the guitar his cloak falling off from one shoulder showed him to be richly dressed it was evident that he was a person of rank  the idea now flashed across antonios mind that the affections of his unknown beauty might be engaged she was young and doubtless susceptible and it was not in the nature of spanish females to be deaf and insensible to music and admiration the surmise brought with it a feeling of dreariness there was a pleasant dream of several days suddenly dispelled he had never before experienced any thing of the tender passion and as its morning dreams are always delightful he would fain have continued in the delusion  but what have i to do with her attachments thought he i have no claim on her heart nor even on her acquaintance how do i know that she is worthy of affection or if she is must not so gallant a lover as this with his jewels his rank and his detestable music have completely captivated her what idle humour is this that i have fallen into i must again to my books study study will soon chase away all these idle fancies  the more he thought however the more he became entangled in the spell which his lively imagination had woven round him and now that a rival had appeared in addition to the other obstacles that environed this enchanted beauty she appeared ten times more lovely and desirable it was some slight consolation to him to perceive that the gallantry of the unknown met with no apparent return from the tower the light at the window was extinguished the curtain remained undrawn and none of the customary signals were given to intimate that the serenade was accepted  the cavalier lingered for some time about the place and sang several other tender airs with a taste and feeling that made antonios heart ache at length he slowly retired the student remained with folded arms leaning against the ruined arch endeavouring to summon up resolution enough to depart but there was a romantic fascination that still enchained him to the place it is the last time said he willing to compromise between his feelings and his judgment it is the last time then let me enjoy the dream a few moments longer  as his eye ranged about the old building to take a farewell look he observed the strange light in the tower which he had noticed on a former occasion it kept beaming up and declining as before a pillar of smoke rose in the air and hung in sable volumes it was evident the old man was busied in some of those operations that had gained him the reputation of a sorcerer throughout the neighbourhood  suddenly an intense and brilliant glare shone through the casement followed by a loud report and then a fierce and ruddy glow a figure appeared at the window uttering cries of agony or alarm but immediately disappeared and a body of smoke and flame whirled out of the narrow aperture antonio rushed to the portal and knocked at it with vehemence he was only answered by loud shrieks and found that the females were already in helpless consternation with an exertion of desperate strength he forced the wicket from its hinges and rushed into the house  he found himself in a small vaulted hall and by the light of the moon which entered at the door he saw a staircase to the left he hurried up it to a narrow corridor through which was rolling a volume of smoke he found here the two females in a frantic state of alarm one of them clasped her hands and implored him to save her father  the corridor terminated in a spiral flight of steps leading up to the tower he sprang up it to a small door through the chinks of which came a glow of light and smoke was spuming out he burst it open and found himself in an antique vaulted chamber furnished with a furnace and various chemical apparatus a shattered retort lay on the stone floor a quantity of combustibles nearly consumed with various halfburnt books and papers were sending up an expiring flame and filling the chamber with stifling smoke just within the threshold lay the reputed conjurer he was bleeding his clothes were scorched and he appeared lifeless antonio caught him up and bore him down the stairs to a chamber in which there was a light and laid him on a bed the female domestic was despatched for such appliances as the house afforded but the daughter threw herself frantically beside her parent and could not be reasoned out of her alarm her dress was all in disorder her dishevelled hair hung in rich confusion about her neck and bosom and never was there beheld a lovelier picture of terror and affliction  the skilful assiduities of the scholar soon produced signs of returning animation in his patient the old mans wounds though severe were not dangerous they had evidently been produced by the bursting of the retort in his bewilderment he had been enveloped in the stifling metallic vapours which had overpowered his feeble frame and had not antonio arrived to his assistance it is possible he might never have recovered  by slow degrees he came to his senses he looked about with a bewildered air at the chamber the agitated group around and the student who was leaning over him  where am i said he wildly  at the sound of his voice his daughter uttered a faint exclamation of delight my poor inez said he embracing her then putting his hand to his head and taking it away stained with blood he seemed suddenly to recollect himself and to be overcome with emotion  ah cried he all is over with me all gone all vanished gone in a moment the labour of a lifetime lost  his daughter attempted to soothe him but he became slightly delirious and raved incoherently about malignant demons and about the habitation of the green lion being destroyed his wounds being dressed and such other remedies administered as his situation required he sunk into a state of quiet antonio now turned his attention to the daughter whose sufferings had been little inferior to those of her father having with great difficulty succeeded in tranquillizing her fears he endeavoured to prevail upon her to retire and seek the repose so necessary to her frame proffering to remain by her father until morning i am a stranger said he it is true and my offer may appear intrusive but i see you are lonely and helpless and i cannot help venturing over the limits of mere ceremony should you feel any scruple or doubt however say but a word and i will instantly retire  there was a frankness a kindness and a modesty mingled in antonios deportment that inspired instant confidence and his simple scholars garb was a recommendation in the house of poverty the females consented to resign the sufferer to his care as they would be the better able to attend to him on the morrow on retiring the old domestic was profuse in her benedictions the daughter only looked her thanks but as they shone through the tears that filled her fine black eyes the student thought them a thousand times the most eloquent  here then he was by a singular turn of chance completely housed within this mysterious mansion when left to himself and the bustle of the scene was over his heart throbbed as he looked round the chamber in which he was sitting it was the daughters room the promised land toward which he had cast so many a longing gaze the furniture was old and had probably belonged to the building in its prosperous days but every thing was arranged with propriety the flowers that he had seen her attend stood in the window a guitar leaned against a table on which stood a crucifix and before it lay a missal and a rosary there reigned an air of purity and serenity about this little nestlingplace of innocence it was the emblem of a chaste and quiet mind some few articles of female dress lay on the chairs and there was the very bed on which she had sleptthe pillow on which her soft cheek had reclined the poor scholar was treading enchanted ground for what fairy land has more of magic in it than the bedchamber of innocence and beauty  from various expressions of the old man in his ravings and from what he had noticed on a subsequent visit to the tower to see that the fire was extinguished antonio had gathered that his patient was an alchymist the philosophers stone was an object eagerly sought after by visionaries in those days but in consequence of the superstitious prejudices of the times and the frequent persecutions of its votaries they were apt to pursue their experiments in secret in lonely houses in caverns and ruins or in the privacy of cloistered cells  in the course of the night the old man had several fits of restlessness and delirium he would call out upon theophrastus and geber and albertus magnus and other sages of his art and anon would murmur about fermentation and projection until toward daylight he once more sunk into a salutary sleep when the morning sun darted his rays into the casement the fair inez attended by the female domestic came blushing into the chamber the student now took his leave having himself need of repose but obtaining ready permission to return and inquire after the sufferer  when he called again he found the alchymist languid and in pain but apparently suffering more in mind than in body his delirium had left him and he had been informed of the particulars of his deliverance and of the subsequent attentions of the scholar he could do little more than look his thanks but antonio did not require them his own heart repaid him for all that he had done and he almost rejoiced in the disaster that had gained him an entrance into this mysterious habitation the alchymist was so helpless as to need much assistance antonio remained with him therefore the greater part of the day he repeated his visit the next day and the next every day his company seemed more pleasing to the invalid and every day he felt his interest in the latter increasing perhaps the presence of the daughter might have been at the bottom of this solicitude  he had frequent and long conversations with the alchymist he found him as men of his pursuits were apt to be a mixture of enthusiasm and simplicity of curious and extensive reading on points of little utility with great inattention to the everyday occurrences of life and profound ignorance of the world he was deeply versed in singular and obscure branches of knowledge and much given to visionary speculations antonio whose mind was of a romantic cast had himself given some attention to the occult sciences and he entered upon these themes with an ardour that delighted the philosopher their conversations frequently turned upon astrology divination and the great secret the old man would forget his aches and wounds rise up like a spectre in his bed and kindle into eloquence on his favourite topics when gently admonished of his situation it would but prompt him to another sally of thought  alas my son he would say is not this very decrepitude and suffering another proof of the importance of those secrets with which we are surrounded why are we trammelled by disease withered by old age and our spirits quenched as it were within us but because we have lost those secrets of life and youth which were known to our parents before their fall to regain these have philosophers been ever since aspiring but just as they are on the point of securing the precious secrets for ever the brief period of life is at an end they die and with them all their wisdom and experience nothing as de nuysment observes nothing is wanting for mans perfection but a longer life less crossed with sorrows and maladies to the attaining of the full and perfect knowledge of things  at length antonio so far gained on the heart of his patient as to draw from him the outlines of his story  felix de vasques the alchymist was a native of castile and of an ancient and honourable line early in life he had married a beautiful female a descendant from one of the moorish families the marriage displeased his father who considered the pure spanish blood contaminated by this foreign mixture it is true the lady traced her descent from one of the abencerrages the most gallant of moorish cavaliers who had embraced the christian faith on being exiled from the walls of granada  the injured pride of the father however was not to be appeased he never saw his son afterwards and on dying left him but a scanty portion of his estate bequeathing the residue in the piety and bitterness of his heart to the erection of convents and the performance of masses for souls in purgatory don felix resided for a long time in the neighbourhood of valladolid in a state of embarrassment and obscurity he devoted himself to intense study having while at the university of salamanca imbibed a taste for the secret sciences he was enthusiastic and speculative he went on from one branch of knowledge to another until he became zealous in the search after the grand arcanum  he had at first engaged in the pursuit with the hopes of raising himself from his present obscurity and resuming the rank and dignity to which his birth entitled him but as usual it ended in absorbing every thought and becoming the business of his existence he was at length aroused from this mental abstraction by the calamities of his household a malignant fever swept off his wife and all his children excepting an infant daughter these losses for a time overwhelmed and stupefied him his home had in a manner died away from around him and he felt lonely and forlorn when his spirit revived within him he determined to abandon the scene of his humiliation and disaster to bear away the child that was still left him beyond the scene of contagion and never to return to castile until he should be enabled to reclaim the honours of his line  he had ever since been wandering and unsettled in his abodesometimes the resident of populous cities at other times of absolute solitudes he had searched libraries meditated on inscriptions visited adepts of different countries and sought to gather and concentrate the rays which had been thrown by various minds upon the secrets of alchymy he had at one time travelled quite to padua to search for the manuscripts of pietro dabano and to inspect an urn which had been dug up near este supposed to have been buried by maximus olybius and to have contained the grand elixir7  footnote 7 this urn was found in 1533 it contained a lesser one in which was a burning lamp betwixt two small vials the one of gold the other of silver both of them full of a very clear liquor on the largest was an inscription stating that maximus olybius shut up in this small vessel elements which he had prepared with great toil there were many disquisitions among the learned on the subject it was the most received opinion that this maximus olybius was an inhabitant of padua that he had discovered the great secret and that these vessels contained liquor one to transmute metals to gold and other to silver the peasants who found the urns imagining this precious liquor to be common water spilt every drop so that the art of transmuting metals remains as much a secret as ever  while at padua he had met with an adept versed in arabian lore who talked of the invaluable manuscripts that must remain in the spanish libraries preserved from the spoils of the moorish academies and universities of the probability of meeting with precious unpublished writings of geber and alfarabius and avicenna the great physicians of the arabian schools who it was well known had treated much of alchymy but above all he spoke of the arabian tablets of lead which had recently been dug up in the neighbourhood of granada and which it was confidently believed among adepts contained the lost secrets of the art  the indefatigable alchymist once more bent his steps for spain full of renovated hope he had made his way to granada he had wearied himself in the study of arabic in deciphering inscriptions in rummaging libraries and exploring every possible trace left by the arabian sages  in all his wanderings he had been accompanied by inez through the rough and the smooth the pleasant and the adverse never complaining but rather seeking to soothe his cares by her innocent and playful caresses her instruction had been the employment and the delight of his hours of relaxation she had grown up while they were wandering and had scarcely ever known any home but by his side he was family friends home everything to her he had carried her in his arms when they first began their wayfaring had nestled her as an eagle does its young among the rocky heights of the sierra morena she had sported about him in childhood in the solitudes of the bateucas had followed him as a lamb does the shepherd over the rugged pyrenees and into the fair plains of languedoc and now she was grown up to support his feeble steps among the ruined abodes of her maternal ancestors  his property had gradually wasted away in the course of his travels and his experiments still hope the constant attendant of the alchymist had led him on ever on the point of reaping the reward of his labours and ever disappointed with the credulity that often attended his art he attributed many of his disappointments to the machination of the malignant spirits that beset the paths of the alchymist and torment him in his solitary labours it is their constant endeavour he observed to close up every avenue to those sublime truths which would enable man to rise above the abject state into which he has fallen and to return to his original perfection to the evil offices of these demons he attributed his late disaster he had been on the very verge of the glorious discovery never were the indications more completely auspicious all was going on prosperously when at the critical moment which should have crowned his labours with success and have placed him at the very summit of human power and felicity the bursting of a retort had reduced his laboratory and himself to ruins  i must now said he give up at the very threshold of success my books and papers are burnt my apparatus is broken i am too old to bear up against these evils the ardour that once inspired me is gone my poor frame is exhausted by study and watchfulness and this last misfortune has hurried me towards the grave he concluded in a tone of deep dejection antonio endeavoured to comfort and reassure him but the poor alchymist had for once awakened to a consciousness of the worldly ills that were gathering around him and had sunk into despondency after a pause and some thoughtfulness and perplexity of brow antonio ventured to make a proposal  i have long said he been filled with a love for the secret sciences but have felt too ignorant and diffident to give myself up to them you have acquired experience you have amassed the knowledge of a lifetime it were a pity it should be thrown away you say you are too old to renew the toils of the laboratory suffer me to undertake them add your knowledge to my youth and activity and what shall we not accomplish as a probationary fee and a fund on which to proceed i will bring into the common stock a sum of gold the residue of a legacy which has enabled me to complete my education a poor scholar cannot boast much but i trust we shall soon put ourselves beyond the reach of want and if we should fail why i must depend like other scholars upon my brains to carry me through the world  the philosophers spirits however were more depressed than the student had imagined this last shock following in the rear of so many disappointments had almost destroyed the reaction of his mind the fire of an enthusiast however is never so low but that it may be blown again into a flame by degrees the old man was cheered and reanimated by the buoyancy and ardour of his sanguine companion he at length agreed to accept of the services of the student and once more to renew his experiments he objected however to using the students gold notwithstanding that his own was nearly exhausted but this objection was soon overcome the student insisted on making it a common stock and common causeand then how absurd was any delicacy about such a trifle with men who looked forward to discovering the philosophers stone  while therefore the alchymist was slowly recovering the student busied himself in getting the laboratory once more in order it was strewed with the wrecks of retorts and alembics with old crucibles boxes and phials of powders and tinctures and halfburnt books and manuscripts  as soon as the old man was sufficiently recovered the studies and experiments were renewed the student became a privileged and frequent visitor and was indefatigable in his toils in the laboratory the philosopher daily derived new zeal and spirits from the animation of his disciple he was now enabled to prosecute the enterprise with continued exertion having so active a coadjutor to divide the toil while he was poring over the writings of sandivogius and philalethes and dominus de nuysment and endeavouring to comprehend the symbolical language in which they have locked up their mysteries antonio would occupy himself among the retorts and crucibles and keep the furnace in a perpetual glow  with all his zeal however for the discovery of the golden art the feelings of the student had not cooled as to the object that first drew him to this ruinous mansion during the old mans illness he had frequent opportunities of being near the daughter and every day made him more sensible to her charms there was a pure simplicity and an almost passive gentleness in her manners yet with all this was mingled something whether mere maiden shyness or a consciousness of high descent or a dash of castilian pride or perhaps all united that prevented undue familiarity and made her difficult of approach the danger of her father and the measures to be taken for his relief had at first overcome this coyness and reserve but as he recovered and her alarm subsided she seemed to shrink from the familiarity she had indulged with the youthful stranger and to become every day more shy and silent  antonio had read many books but this was the first volume of womankind that he had ever studied he had been captivated with the very titlepage but the further he read the more he was delighted she seemed formed to love her soft black eye rolled languidly under its long silken lashes and wherever it turned it would linger and repose there was tenderness in every beam to him alone she was reserved and distant now that the common cares of the sickroom were at an end he saw little more of her than before his admission to the house sometimes he met her on his way to and from the laboratory and at such times there was ever a smile and a blush but after a simple salutation she glided on and disappeared  tis plain thought antonio my presence is indifferent if not irksome to her she has noticed my admiration and is determined to discourage it nothing but a feeling of gratitude prevents her treating me with marked distasteand then has she not another lover rich gallant splendid musical how can i suppose she would turn her eyes from so brilliant a cavalier to a poor obscure student raking among the cinders of her fathers laboratory  indeed the idea of the amorous serenader continually haunted his mind he felt convinced that he was a favoured lover yet if so why did he not frequent the towerwhy did he not make his approaches by noonday there was mystery in this eavesdropping and musical courtship surely inez could not be encouraging a secret intrigue oh no she was too artless too pure too ingenuous but then the spanish females were so prone to love and intrigue and music and moonlight were so seductive and inez had such a tender soul languishing in every lookoh would the poor scholar exclaim clasping his hands oh that i could but once behold those loving eyes beaming on me with affection  it is incredible to those who have not experienced it on what scanty aliment human life and human love may be supported a dry crust thrown now and then to a starving man will give him a new lease of existence and a faint smile or a kind look bestowed at casual intervals will keep a lover loving on when a man in his sober senses would despair  when antonio found himself alone in the laboratory his mind would be haunted by one of these looks or smiles which he had received in passing he would set it in every possible light and argue on it with all the selfpleasing selfteasing logic of a lover  the country around him was enough to awaken that voluptuousness of feeling so favourable to the growth of passion the window of the tower rose above the trees of the romantic valley of the darro and looked down upon some of the loveliest scenery of the vega where groves of citron and orange were refreshed by cool springs and brooks of the purest water  the xenel and the darro wound their shining streams along the plain and gleamed from among its bowers the surrounding hills were covered with vineyards and the mountains crowned with snow seemed to melt into the blue sky the delicate airs that played about the tower were perfumed by the fragrance of myrtle and orangeblossoms and the ear was charmed with the fond warbling of the nightingale which in these happy regions sings the whole day long sometimes too there was the idle song of the muleteer sauntering along the solitary road or the notes of the guitar from some group of peasants dancing in the shade all these were enough to fill the head of the young lover with poetic fancies and antonio would picture to himself how he could loiter among those happy groves and wander by those gentle rivers and love away his life with inez  he felt at times impatient at his own weakness and would endeavour to brush away these cobwebs of the mind he would turn his thoughts with sudden effort to his occult studies or occupy himself in some perplexing process but often when he had partially succeeded in fixing his attention the sound of inezs lute or the soft notes of her voice would come stealing upon the stillness of the chamber and as it were floating round the tower there was no great art in her performance but antonio thought he had never heard music comparable to this it was perfect witchcraft to hear her warble forth some of her national melodies those little spanish romances and moorish ballads that transport the hearer in idea to the banks of the guadalquivir or the walls of the alhambra and make him dream of beauties and balconies and moonlight serenades  never was poor student more sadly beset than antonio love is a troublesome companion in a study at the best of tunes but in the laboratory of an alchymist his intrusion is terribly disastrous instead of attending to the retorts and crucibles and watching the process of some experiment intrusted to his charge the student would get entranced in one of these lovedreams from which he would often be aroused by some fatal catastrophe the philosopher on returning from his researches in the libraries would find every thing gone wrong and antonio in despair over the ruins of the whole days work the old man however took all quietly for his had been a life of experiment and failure  we must have patience my son would he say as all the great masters that have gone before us have had errors and accidents and delays are what we have to contend with did not pontanus err two hundred times before he could obtain even the matter on which to found his experiments the great flamel too did he not labour fourandtwenty years before he ascertained the first agent what difficulties and hardships did not cartilaceus encounter at the very threshold of his discoveries and bernard de treves even after he had attained a knowledge of all the requisites was he not delayed full three years what you consider accidents my son are the machinations of our invisible enemies the treasures and golden secrets of nature are surrounded by spirits hostile to man the air about us teems with them they lurk in the fire of the furnace in the bottom of the crucible and the alembic and are ever on the alert to take advantage of those moments when our minds are wandering from intense meditation on the great truth that we are seeking we must only strive the more to purify ourselves from those gross and earthly feelings which becloud the soul and prevent her from piercing into natures arcana  alas thought antonio if to be purified from all earthly feeling requires that i should cease to love inez i fear i shall never discover the philosophers stone  in this way matters went on for some time at the alchymists day after day was sending the students gold in vapour up the chimney every blast of the furnace made him a ducat the poorer without apparently helping him a jot nearer to the golden secret still the young man stood by and saw piece after piece disappearing without a murmur he had daily an opportunity of seeing inez and felt as if her favour would be better than silver or gold and that every smile was worth a ducat  sometimes in the cool of the evening when the toils of the laboratory happened to be suspended he would walk with the alchymist in what had once been a garden belonging to the mansion there were still the remains of terraces and balustrades and here and there a marble urn or mutilated statue overturned and buried among weeds and flowers run wild it was the favourite resort of the alchymist in his hours of relaxation where he would give full scope to his visionary flights his mind was tinctured with the rosicrucian doctrines he believed in elementary beings some favourable others adverse to his pursuits and in the exaltation of his fancy had often imagined that he held communion with them in his solitary walks about the whispering groves and echoing walls of this old garden  when accompanied by antonio he would prolong these evening recreations indeed he sometimes did it out of consideration for his disciple for he feared lest his too close application and his incessant seclusion in the tower should be injurious to his health he was delighted and surprised by this extraordinary zeal and perseverance in so young a tyro and looked upon him as destined to be one of the great luminaries of the art lest the student should repine at the time lost in these relaxations the good alchymist would fill them up with wholesome knowledge in matters connected with their pursuits and would walk up and down the alleys with his disciple imparting oral instruction like an ancient philosopher in all his visionary schemes these breathed a spirit of lofty though chimerical philanthropy that won the admiration of the scholar nothing sordid nor sensual nothing petty nor selfish seemed to enter into his views in respect to the grand discoveries he was anticipating on the contrary his imagination kindled with conceptions of widely dispensated happiness he looked forward to the time when he should be able to go about the earth relieving the indigent comforting the distressed and by his unlimited means devising and executing plans for the complete extirpation of poverty and all its attendant sufferings and crimes never were grander schemes for general good for the distribution of boundless wealth and universal competence devised than by this poor indigent alchymist in his ruined tower  antonio would attend these peripatetic lectures with all the ardour of a devotee but there was another circumstance which may have given a secret charm to them the garden was the resort also of inez where she took her walks of recreation the only exercise that her secluded life permitted as antonio was duteously pacing by the side of his instructor he would often catch a glimpse of the daughter walking pensively about the alleys in the soft twilight sometimes they would meet her unexpectedly and the heart of the student would throb with agitation a blush too would crimson the cheek of inez but still she passed on and never joined them  he had remained one evening until rather a late hour with the alchymist in this favourite resort it was a delightful night after a sultry day and the balmy air of the garden was peculiarly reviving the old man was seated on a fragment of a pedestal looking like a part of the ruin on which he sat he was edifying his pupil by long lessons of wisdom from the stars as they shone out with brilliant lustre in the darkblue vault of a southern sky for he was deeply versed in behmen and other of the rosicrucians and talked much of the signature of earthly things and passing events which may be discerned in the heavens of the power of the stars over corporeal beings and their influence on the fortunes of the sons of men  by degrees the moon rose and shed her gleaming light among the groves antonio apparently listened with fixed attention to the sage but his ear was drinking in the melody of inezs voice who was singing to her lute in one of the moonlight glades of the garden the old man having exhausted his theme sat gazing in silent reverie at the heavens antonio could not resist an inclination to steal a look at this coy beauty who was thus playing the part of the nightingale so sequestered and musical leaving the alchymist in his celestial reverie he stole gently along one of the alleys the music had ceased and he thought he heard the sound of voices he came to an angle of a copse that had screened a kind of green recess ornamented by a marble fountain the moon shone full upon the place and by its light he beheld his unknown serenading rival at the feet of inez he was detaining her by the hand which he covered with kisses but at sight of antonio he started up and half drew his sword while inez disengaged fled back to the house  all the jealous doubts and fears of antonio were now confirmed he did not remain to encounter the resentment of his happy rival at being thus interrupted but turned from the place in sudden wretchedness of heart that inez should love another would have been misery enough but that she should be capable of a dishonourable amour shocked him to the soul the idea of deception in so young and apparently artless a being brought with it that sudden distrust in human nature so sickening to a youthful and ingenuous mind but when he thought of the kind simple parent she was deceiving whose affections all centred in her he felt for a moment a sentiment of indignation and almost of aversion  he found the alchymist still seated in his visionary contemplation of the moon come hither my son said he with his usual enthusiasm come read with me in this vast volume of wisdom thus nightly unfolded for our perusal wisely did the chaldean sages affirm that the heaven is as a mystic page uttering speech to those who can rightly understand warning them of good and evil and instructing them in the secret decrees of fate  the students heart ached for his venerable master and for a moment he felt the futility of his occult wisdom alas poor old man thought he of what avails all thy study little dost thou dream while busied in airy speculations among the stars what a treason against thy happiness is going on under thine eyes as it were in thy very bosomoh inez inez where shall we look for truth and innocence where shall we repose confidence in woman if even you can deceive  it was a trite apostrophe such as every lover makes when he finds his mistress not quite such a goddess as he had painted her with the student however it sprung from honest anguish of heart he returned to his lodgings in pitiable confusion of mind he now deplored the infatuation that had led him on until his feelings were so thoroughly engaged he resolved to abandon his pursuits at the tower and trust to absence to dispel the fascination by which he had been spellbound he no longer thirsted after the discovery of the grand elixir the dream of alchymy was over for without inez what was the value of the philosophers stone  he rose after a sleepless night with the determination of taking his leave of the alchymist and tearing himself from granada for several days did he rise with the same resolution and every night saw him come back to his pillow to repine at his want of resolution and to make fresh determinations for the morrow in the meanwhile he saw less of inez than ever she no longer walked in the garden but remained almost entirely in her apartment when she met him she blushed more than usual and once hesitated as if she would have spoken but after a temporary embarrassment and still deeper blushes she made some casual observation and retired antonio read in this confusion a consciousness of fault and of that faults being discovered what could she have wished to communicate perhaps to account for the scene in the gardenbut how can she account for it or why should she account for it to me what am i to heror rather what is she to me exclaimed he impatiently with a new resolution to break through these entanglements of the heart and fly from this enchanted spot for ever  he was returning that very night to his lodgings full of this excellent determination when in a shadowy part of the road he passed a person whom he recognized by his height and form for his rival he was going in the direction of the tower if any lingering doubts remained here was an opportunity of settling them completely he determined to follow this unknown cavalier and under favour of the darkness observe his movements if he obtained access to the tower or in any way a favourable reception antonio felt as if it would be a relief to his mind and would enable him to fix his wavering resolution  the unknown as he came near the tower was more cautious and stealthy in his approaches he was joined under a clump of trees by another person and they had much whispering together a light was burning in the chamber of inez the curtain was down but the casement was left open as the night was warm after some time the light was extinguished a considerable interval elapsed the cavalier and his companion remained under covert of the trees as if keeping watch at length they approached the tower with silent and cautious steps the cavalier received a darklantern from his companion and threw off his cloak the other then softly brought something from the clump of trees which antonio perceived to be a light ladder he placed it against the wall and the serenader gently ascended a sickening sensation came over antonio here was indeed a confirmation of every fear he was about to leave the place never to return when he heard a stifled shriek from inezs chamber  in an instant the fellow that stood at the foot of the ladder lay prostrate on the ground antonio wrested a stiletto from his nerveless hand and hurried up the ladder he sprang in at the window and found inez struggling in the grasp of his fancied rival the latter disturbed from his prey caught up his lantern turned its light full upon antonio and drawing his sword made a furious assault luckily the student saw the light gleam along the blade and parried the thrust with the stiletto a fierce but unequal combat ensued antonio fought exposed to the full glare of the light while his antagonist was in shadow his stiletto too was but a poor defence against a rapier he saw that nothing would save him but closing with his adversary and getting within his weapon he rushed furiously upon him and gave him a severe blow with the stiletto but received a wound in return from the shortened sword at the same moment a blow was inflicted from behind by the confederate who had ascended the ladder it felled him to the floor and his antagonists made their escape  by this time the cries of inez had brought her father and the domestic into the room antonio was found weltering in his blood and senseless he was conveyed to the chamber of the alchymist who now repaid in kind the attentions which the student had once bestowed upon him among his varied knowledge he possessed some skill in surgery which at this moment was of more value than even his chymical lore he stanched and dressed the wounds of his disciple which on examination proved less desperate than he had at first apprehended for a few days however his case was anxious and attended with danger the old man watched over him with the affection of a parent he felt a double debt of gratitude towards him on account of his daughter and himself he loved him too as a faithful and zealous disciple and he dreaded lest the world should be deprived of the promising talents of so aspiring an alchymist  an excellent constitution soon medicined his wounds and there was a balsam in the looks and words of inez that had a healing effect on the still severer wounds which he carried in his heart she displayed the strongest interest in his safety she called him her deliverer her preserver it seemed as if her grateful disposition sought in the warmth of its acknowledgments to repay him for past coldness but what most contributed to antonios recovery was her explanation concerning his supposed rival it was some time since he had first beheld her at church and he had ever since persecuted her with his attentions he had beset her in her walks until she had been obliged to confine herself to the house except when accompanied by her father he had besieged her with letters serenades and every art by which he could urge a vehement but clandestine and dishonourable suit the scene in the garden was as much of a surprise to her as to antonio her persecutor had been attracted by her voice and had found his way over a ruined part of the wall he had come upon her unawares was detaining her by force and pleading his insulting passion when the appearance of the student interrupted him and enabled her to make her escape she had forborne to mention to her father the persecution which she suffered she wished to spare him unavailing anxiety and distress and had determined to confine herself more rigorously to the house though it appeared that even here she had not been safe from his daring enterprise  antonio inquired whether she knew the name of this impetuous admirer she replied that he had made his advances under a fictitious name but that she had heard him once called by the name of don ambrosio de loxa  antonio knew him by report for one of the most determined and dangerous libertines in all granada artful accomplished and if he chose to be so insinuating but daring and headlong in the pursuit of his pleasures violent and implacable in his resentments he rejoiced to find that inez had been proof against his seductions and had been inspired with aversion by his splendid profligacy but he trembled to think of the dangers she had run and he felt solicitude about the dangers that must yet environ her  at present however it was probable the enemy had a temporary quietus the traces of blood had been found for some distance from the ladder until they were lost among thickets and as nothing had been heard or seen of him since it was concluded that he had been seriously wounded  as the student recovered from his wounds he was enabled to join inez and her father in their domestic intercourse the chamber in which they usually met had probably been a saloon of state in former times the floor was of marble the walls partially covered with remains of tapestry the chairs richly carved and gilt were crazed with age and covered with tarnished and tattered brocade against the wall hung a long rusty rapier the only relic that the old man retained of the chivalry of his ancestors there might have been something to provoke a smile in the contrast between the mansion and its inhabitants between present poverty and the graces of departed grandeur but the fancy of the student had thrown so much romance about the edifice and its inmates that every thing was clothed with charms the philosopher with his brokendown pride and his strange pursuits seemed to comport with the melancholy ruin he inhabited and there was a native elegance of spirit about the daughter that showed she would have graced the mansion in its happier days  what delicious moments were these to the student inez was no longer coy and reserved she was naturally artless and confiding though the kind of persecution she had experienced from one admirer had rendered her for a time suspicious and circumspect toward the other she now felt an entire confidence in the sincerity and worth of antonio mingled with an overflowing gratitude when her eyes met his they beamed with sympathy and kindness and antonio no longer haunted by the idea of a favoured rival once more aspired to success  at these domestic meetings however he had little opportunity of paying his court except by looks the alchymist supposing him like himself absorbed in the study of alchymy endeavoured to cheer the tediousness of his recovery by long conversations on the art he even brought several of his halfburnt volumes which the student had once rescued from the flames and rewarded him for their preservation by reading copious passages he would entertain him with the great and good acts of flamel which he effected through means of the philosophers stone relieving widows and orphans founding hospitals building churches and what not or with the interrogatories of king kalid and the answers of morienus the roman hermit of jerusalem or the profound questions which elardus a necromancer of the province of catalonia put to the devil touching the secrets of alchymy and the devils replies  all these were couched in occult language almost unintelligible to the unpractised ear of the disciple indeed the old man delighted in the mystic phrases and symbolical jargon in which the writers that have treated of alchymy have wrapped their communications rendering them incomprehensible except to the initiated with what rapture would he elevate his voice at a triumphant passage announcing the grand discovery thou shalt see would he exclaim in the words of henry kuhnrade8 the stone of the philosophers our king go forth of the bedchamber of his glassy sepulchre into the theatre of this world that is to say regenerated and made perfect a shining carbuncle a most temperate splendour whose most subtle and depurated parts are inseparable united into one with a concordial mixture exceeding equal transparent as chrystal shining red like a ruby permanently colouring or ringing fixt in all temptations or tryals yea in the examination of the burning sulphur itself and the devouring waters and in the most vehement persecution of the fire always incombustible and permanent as a salamander  footnote 8 amphitheatre of the eternal wisdom  the student had a high veneration for the fathers of alchymy and a profound respect for his instructor but what was henry kuhnrade geber lully or even albertus magnus himself compared to the countenance of inez which presented such a page of beauty to his perusal while therefore the good alchymist was doling out knowledge by the hour his disciple would forget books alchymy every thing but the lovely object before him inez too unpractised in the science of the heart was gradually becoming fascinated by the silent attentions of her lover day by day she seemed more and more perplexed by the kindling and strangely pleasing emotions of her bosom her eye was often cast down in thought blushes stole to her cheek without any apparent cause and light halfsuppressed sighs would follow these short fits of musing her little ballads though the same that she had always sung yet breathed a more tender spirit either the tones of her voice were more soft and touching or some passages were delivered with a feeling she had never before given them antonio beside his love for the abstruse sciences had a pretty turn for music and never did philosopher touch the guitar more tastefully as by degrees he conquered the mutual embarrassment that kept them asunder he ventured to accompany inez in some of her songs he had a voice full of fire and tenderness as he sang one would have thought from the kindling blushes of his companion that he had been pleading his own passion in her ear let those who would keep two youthful hearts asunder beware of music oh this leaning over chairs and conning the same musicbook and entwining of voices and melting away in harmoniesthe german waltz is nothing to it  the worthy alchymist saw nothing of all this his mind could admit of no idea that was not connected with the discovery of the grand arcanum and he supposed his youthful coadjutor equally devoted he was a mere child as to human nature and as to the passion of love whatever he might once have felt of it he had long since forgotten that there was such an idle passion in existence but while he dreamed the silent amour went on the very quiet and seclusion of the place were favourable to the growth of romantic passion the opening bud of love was able to put forth leaf by leaf without an adverse wind to check its growth there was neither officious friendship to chill by its advice nor insidious envy to wither by its sneers nor an observing world to look on and stare it out of countenance there was neither declaration nor vow nor any other form of cupids canting school their hearts mingled together and understood each other without the aid of language they lapsed into the full current of affection unconscious of its depth and thoughtless of the rocks that might lurk beneath its surface happy lovers who wanted nothing to make their felicity complete but the discovery of the philosophers stone  at length antonios health was sufficiently restored to enable him to return to his lodgings in granada he felt uneasy however at leaving the tower while lurking danger might surround its almost defenceless inmates he dreaded lest don ambrosio recovered from his wounds might plot some new attempt by secret art or open violence from all that he had heard he knew him to be too implacable to suffer his defeat to pass unavenged and too rash and fearless when his arts were unavailing to stop at any daring deed in the accomplishment of his purposes he urged his apprehensions to the alchymist and his daughter and proposed that they should abandon the dangerous vicinity of granada  i have relations said he in valentia poor indeed but worthy and affectionate among them you will find friendship and quiet and we may there pursue our labours unmolested he went on to paint the beauties and delights of valentia with all the fondness of a native and all the eloquence with which a lover paints the fields and groves which he is picturing as the future scenes of his happiness his eloquence backed by the apprehensions of inez was successful with the alchymist who indeed had led too unsettled a life to be particular about the place of his residence and it was determined that as soon as antonios health was perfectly restored they should abandon the tower and seek the delicious neighbourhood of valentia9  footnote 9 here are the strongest silks the sweetest wines the excellentst almonds the best oyls and beautifullst females of all spain the very bruit animals make themselves beds of rosemary and other fragrant flowers hereabouts and when one is at sea if the winde blow from the shore he may smell this soyl before he comes in sight of it many leagues off by the strong odoriferous scent it casts as it is the most pleasant so it is also the temperatst clime of all spain and they commonly call it the second italy which made the moors whereof many thousands were disterrd and banishd hence to barbary to think that paradise was in that part of the heavens which hung over this citiehowells letters  to recruit his strength the student suspended his toils in the laboratory and spent the few remaining days before departure in taking a farewell look at the enchanting environs of granada he felt returning health and vigour as he inhaled the pure temperate breezes that play about its hills and the happy state of his mind contributed to his rapid recovery inez was often the companion of his walks her descent by the mothers side from one of the ancient moorish families gave her an interest in this once favourite seat of arabian power she gazed with enthusiasm upon its magnificent monuments and her memory was filled with the traditional tales and ballads of moorish chivalry indeed the solitary life she had led and the visionary turn of her fathers mind had produced an effect upon her character and given it a tinge of what in modern days would be termed romance all this was called into full force by this new passage for when a woman first begins to love life is all romance to her  in one of their evening strolls they had ascended to the mountain of the sun where is situated the generaliffe the palace of pleasure in the days of moorish dominion but now a gloomy convent of capuchins they had wandered about its garden among groves of orange citron and cypress where the waters leaping in torrents or gushing in fountains or tossed aloft in sparkling jets fill the air with music and freshness  there is a melancholy mingled with all the beauties of this garden that gradually stole over the feelings of the lovers the place is full of the sad story of past times it was the favourite abode of the lovely queen of granada where she was surrounded by the delights of a gay and voluptuous court it was here too amidst her own bowers of roses that her slanderers laid the base story of her dishonour and struck a fatal blow to the line of the gallant abencerrages  the whole garden has a look of ruin and neglect many of the fountains are dry and broken the streams have wandered from their marble channels and are choked by weeds and yellow leaves the reed whistles to the wind where it had once sported among roses and shaken perfume from the orangeblossom the conventbell flings its sullen sound or the drowsy vesperhymn floats along these solitudes which once resounded with the song and the dance and the lovers serenade well may the moors lament over the loss of this earthly paradise well may they remember it in their prayers and beseech heaven to restore it to the faithful well may their ambassadors smite their breasts when they behold these monuments of their race and sit down and weep among the fading glories of granada  it is impossible to wander about these scenes of departed love and gayety and not feel the tenderness of the heart awakened it was then that antonio first ventured to breathe his passion and to express by words what his eyes had long since so eloquently revealed he made his avowal with fervour but with frankness he had no gay prospects to hold out he was a poor scholar dependent on his good spirits to feed and clothe him but a woman in love is no interested calculator inez listened to him with downcast eyes but in them was a humid gleam that showed her heart was with him she had no prudery in her nature and she had not been sufficiently in society to acquire it she loved him with all the absence of worldliness of a genuine woman and amidst timid smiles and blushes he drew from her a modest acknowledgment of her affection  they wandered about the garden with that sweet intoxication of the soul which none but happy lovers know the world about them was all fairy land and indeed it spread forth one of its fairest scenes before their eyes as if to fulfil their dream of earthly happiness they looked out from between groves of orange upon the towers of granada below them the magnificent plain of the vega beyond streaked with evening sunshine and the distant hills tinted with rosy and purple hues it seemed an emblem of the happy future that love and hope were decking out for them  as if to make the scene complete a group of andalusians struck up a dance in one of the vistas of the garden to the guitars of two wandering musicians the spanish music is wild and plaintive yet the people dance to it with spirit and enthusiasm the picturesque figures of the dancers the girls with their hair in silken nets that hung in knots and tassels down their backs their mantillas floating round their graceful forms their slender feet peeping from under their basquinas their arms tossed up in the air to play the castanets had a beautiful effect on this airy height with the rich evening landscape spreading out below them  when the dance was ended two of the parties approached antonio and inez one of them began a soft and tender moorish ballad accompanied by the other on the lute it alluded to the story of the garden the wrongs of the fair queen of granada and the misfortunes of the abencerrages it was one of those old ballads that abound in this part of spain and live like echoes about the ruins of moorish greatness the heart of inez was at that moment open to every tender impression the tears rose into her eyes as she listened to the tale the singer approached nearer to her she was striking in her appearanceyoung beautiful with a mixture of wildness and melancholy in her fine black eyes she fixed them mournfully and expressively on inez and suddenly varying her manner sang another ballad which treated of impending danger and treachery all this might have passed for a mere accidental caprice of the singer had there not been something in her look manner and gesticulation that made it pointed and startling  inez was about to ask the meaning of this evidently personal application of the song when she was interrupted by antonio who gently drew her from the place whilst she had been lost in attention to the music he had remarked a group of men in the shadows of the trees whispering together they were enveloped in the broad hats and great cloaks so much worn by the spanish and while they were regarding himself and inez attentively seemed anxious to avoid observation not knowing what might be their character or intention he hastened to quit a place where the gathering shadows of evening might expose them to intrusion and insult on their way down the hill as they passed through the wood of elms mingled with poplars and oleanders that skirts the road leading from the alhambra he again saw these men apparently following at a distance and he afterwards caught sight of them among the trees on the banks of the darro he said nothing on the subject to inez nor her father for he would not awaken unnecessary alarm but he felt at a loss how to ascertain or to avert any machinations that might be devising against the helpless inhabitants of the tower  he took his leave of them late at night full of this perplexity as he left the dreary old pile he saw some one lurking in the shadow of the wall apparently watching his movements he hastened after the figure but it glided away and disappeared among some ruins shortly after he heard a low whistle which was answered from a little distance he had no longer a doubt but that some mischief was on foot and turned to hasten back to the tower and put its inmates on their guard he had scarcely turned however before he found himself suddenly seized from behind by some one of herculean strength his struggles were in vain he was surrounded by armed men one threw a mantle over him that stifled his cries and enveloped him in its folds and he was hurried off with irresistible rapidity  the next day passed without the appearance of antonio at the alchymists another and another day succeeded and yet he did not come nor had any thing been heard of him at his lodgings his absence caused at first surprise and conjecture and at length alarm inez recollected the singular intimations of the balladsinger upon the mountain which seemed to warn her of impending danger and her mind was full of vague forebodings she sat listening to every sound at the gate or footstep on the stairs she would take up her guitar and strike a few notes but it would not do her heart was sickening with suspense and anxiety she had never before felt what it was to be really lonely she now was conscious of the force of that attachment which had taken possession of her breast for never do we know how much we love never do we know how necessary the object of our love is to our happiness until we experience the weary void of separation  the philosopher too felt the absence of his disciple almost as sensibly as did his daughter the animating buoyancy of the youth had inspired him with new ardour and had given to his labours the charm of full companionship however he had resources and consolations of which his daughter was destitute his pursuits were of a nature to occupy every thought and keep the spirits in a state of continual excitement certain indications too had lately manifested themselves of the most favourable nature forty days and forty nights had the process gone on successfully the old mans hopes were constantly rising and he now considered the glorious moment once more at hand when he should obtain not merely the major lunaria but likewise the tinctura solaris the means of multiplying gold and of prolonging existence he remained therefore continually shut up in his laboratory watching his furnace for a moments inadvertency might once more defeat all his expectations  he was sitting one evening at one of his solitary vigils wrapped up in meditation the hour was late and his neighbour the owl was hooting from the battlement of the tower when he heard the door open behind him supposing it to be his daughter coming to take her leave of him for the night as was her frequent practice he called her by name but a harsh voice me this ear in reply he was grasped by the arms and looking up perceived three strange men in the chamber he attempted to shake them off but in vain he called for help but they scoffed at his cries peace dotard cried one thinkst thou the servants of the most holy inquisition are to be daunted by thy clamours comrades away with him  without heeding his remonstrances and entreaties they seized upon his books and papers took some note of the apartment and the utensils and then bore him off a prisoner  inez left to herself had passed a sad and lonely evening seated by a casement which looked into the garden she had pensively watched star after star sparkle out of the blue depths of the sky and was indulging a crowd of anxious thoughts about her lover until the rising tears began to flow she was suddenly alarmed by the sound of voices that seemed to come from a distant part of the mansion there was not long after a noise of several persons descending the stairs surprised at these unusual sounds in their lonely habitation she remained for a few moments in a state of trembling yet indistinct apprehension when the servant rushed into the room with terror in her countenance and informed her that her father was carried off by armed men  inez did not stop to hear further but flew downstairs to overtake them she had scarcely passed the threshold when she found herself in the grasp of strangersawayaway cried she wildly do not stop melet me follow my father  we come to conduct you to him senora said one of the men respectfully  where is he then  he is gone to granada replied the man an unexpected circumstance requires his presence there immediately but he is among friends  we have no friends in granada said inez drawing back but then the idea of antonio rushed into her mind something relating to him might have call her father thither is senor antonio de castros with him demanded she with agitation  i know not senora replied the man it is very possible i only know that your father is among friends and is anxious for you to follow him  let us go then cried she eagerly the men led her a little distance to where a mule was waiting and assisting her to mount they conducted her slowly towards the city  granada was on that evening a scene of fanciful revel it was one of the festivals of the maestranza an association of the nobility to keep up some of the gallant customs of ancient chivalry there had been a representation of a tournament in one of the squares the streets would still occasionally resound with the beat of a solitary drum or the bray of a trumpet from some straggling party of revellers sometimes they were met by cavaliers richly dressed in ancient costumes attended by their squires and at one time they passed in sight of a palace brilliantly illuminated from whence came the mingled sounds of music and the dance shortly after they came to the square where the mock tournament had been held it was thronged by the populace recreating themselves among booths and stalls where refreshments were sold and the glare of torches showed the temporary galleries and gaycoloured awnings and armorial trophies and other paraphernalia of the show the conductors of inez endeavoured to keep out of observation and to traverse a gloomy part of the square but they were detained at one place by the pressure of a crowd surrounding a party of wandering musicians singing one of those ballads of which the spanish populace are so passionately fond the torches which were held by some of the crowd threw a strong mass of light upon inez and the sight of so beautiful a being without mantilla or veil looking so bewildered and conducted by men who seemed to take no gratification in the surrounding gayety occasioned expressions of curiosity one of the balladsingers approached and striking her guitar with peculiar earnestness began to sing a doleful air full of sinister forebodings inez started with surprise it was the same balladsinger that had addressed her in the garden of the generaliffe  it was the same air that she had then sung it spoke of impending dangers they seemed indeed to be thickening around her she was anxious to speak with the girl and to ascertain whether she really had a knowledge of any definite evil that was threatening her but as she attempted to address her the mule on which she rode was suddenly seized and led forcibly through the throng by one of her conductors while she saw another addressing menacing words to the balladsinger the latter raised her hand with a warning gesture as inez lost sight of her  while she was yet lost in perplexity caused by this singular occurrence they stopped at the gate of a large mansion one of her attendants knocked the door was opened and they entered a paved court where are we demanded inez with anxiety at the house of a friend senora replied the man ascend this staircase with me and in a moment you will meet your father  they ascended a staircase that led to a suite of splendid apartments they passed through several until they came to an inner chamber the door openedsome one approached but what was her terror at perceiving not her father but don ambrosio  the men who had seized upon the alchymist had at least been more honest in their professions they were indeed familiars of the inquisition he was conducted in silence to the gloomy prison of that horrible tribunal it was a mansion whose very aspect withered joy and almost shut out hope it was one of those hideous abodes which the bad passions of men conjure up in this fair world to rival the fancied dens of demons and the accursed  day after day went heavily by without anything to mark the lapse of time but the decline and reappearance of the light that feebly glimmered through the narrow window of the dungeon in which the unfortunate alchymist was buried rather than confined his mind was harassed with uncertainties and fears about his daughter so helpless and inexperienced he endeavoured to gather tidings of her from the man who brought his daily portion of food the fellow stared as if astonished at being asked a question in that mansion of silence and mystery but departed without saying a word every succeeding attempt was equally fruitless  the poor alchymist was oppressed by many griefs and it was not the least that he had been again interrupted in his labours on the very point of success never was alchymist so near attaining the golden secreta little longer and all his hopes would have been realized the thoughts of these disappointments afflicted him more even than the fear of all that he might suffer from the merciless inquisition his waking thoughts would follow him into his dreams he would be transported in fancy to his laboratory busied again among retorts and alembics and surrounded by lully by dabano by olybius and the other masters of the sublime art the moment of projection would arrive a seraphic form would rise out of the furnace holding forth a vessel containing the precious elixir but before he could grasp the prize he would awake and find himself in a dungeon  all the devices of inquisitorial ingenuity were employed to ensnare the old man and to draw from him evidence that might be brought against himself and might corroborate certain secret information that had been given against him he had been accused of practising necromancy and judicial astrology and a cloud of evidence had been secretly brought forward to substantiate the charge it would be tedious to enumerate all the circumstances apparently corroborative which had been industriously cited by the secret accuser the silence which prevailed about the tower its desolateness the very quiet of its inhabitants had been adduced as proofs that something sinister was perpetrated within the alchymists conversations and soliloquies in the garden had been overheard and misrepresented the lights and strange appearances at night in the tower were given with violent exaggerations shrieks and yells were said to have been heard from thence at midnight when it was confidently asserted the old man raised familiar spirits by his incantations and even compelled the dead to rise from their graves and answer to his questions  the alchymist according to the custom of the inquisition was kept in complete ignorance of his accuser of the witnesses produced against him even of the crimes of which he was accused he was examined generally whether he knew why he was arrested and was conscious of any guilt that might deserve the notice of the holy office he was examined as to his country his life his habits his pursuits his actions and opinions the old man was frank and simple in his replies he was conscious of no guilt capable of no art practised in no dissimulation after receiving a general admonition to bethink himself whether he had not committed any act deserving of punishment and to prepare by confession to secure the well known mercy of the tribunal he was remanded to his cell  he was now visited in his dungeon by crafty familiars of the inquisition who under pretence of sympathy and kindness came to beguile the tediousness of his imprisonment with friendly conversation they casually introduced the subject of alchymy on which they touched with great caution and pretended indifference there was no need of such craftiness the honest enthusiast had no suspicion in his nature the moment they touched upon his favourite theme he forgot his misfortunes and imprisonment and broke forth into rhapsodies about the divine science  the conversation was artfully turned to the discussion of elementary beings the alchymist readily avowed his belief in them and that there had been instances of their attending upon philosophers and administering to their wishes he related many miracles said to have been performed by apollonius thyaneus through the aid of spirits or demons insomuch that he was set up by the heathens in opposition to the messiah and was even regarded with reverence by many christians the familiars eagerly demanded whether he believed apollonius to be a true and worthy philosopher the unaffected piety of the alchymist protected him even in the midst of his simplicity for he condemned apollonius as a sorcerer and an impostor no art could draw from him an admission that he had ever employed or invoked spiritual agencies in the prosecution of his pursuits though he believed himself to have been frequently impeded by their invisible interference  the inquisitors were sorely vexed at not being able to inveigle him into a confession of a criminal nature they attributed their failure to craft to obstinacy to every cause but the right one namely that the harmless visionary had nothing guilty to confess they had abundant proof of a secret nature against him but it was the practice of the inquisition to endeavour to procure confession from the prisoners an auto da fé was at hand the worthy fathers were eager for his conviction for they were always anxious to have a good number of culprits condemned to the stake to grace these solemn triumphs he was at length brought to a final examination  the chamber of trial was spacious and gloomy at one end was a huge crucifix the standard of the inquisition a long table extended through the centre of the room at which sat the inquisitors and their secretary at the other end a stool was placed for the prisoner  he was brought in according to custom bareheaded and barelegged he was enfeebled by confinement and affliction by constantly brooding over the unknown fate of his child and the disastrous interruption of his experiments he sat bowed down and listless his head sunk upon his breast his whole appearance that of one past hope abandoned and by himself given over  the accusation alleged against him was now brought forward in a specific form he was called upon by name felix de vasquez formerly of castile to answer to the charges of necromancy and demonology he was told that the charges were amply substantiated and was asked whether he was ready by full confession to throw himself upon the wellknown mercy of the holy inquisition  the philosopher testified some slight surprise at the nature of the accusation but simply replied i am innocent  what proof have you to give of your innocence  it rather remains for you to prove your charges said the old man i am a stranger and a sojourner in the land and know no one out of the doors of my dwelling i can give nothing in my vindication but the word of a nobleman and a castilian  the inquisitor shook his head and went on to repeat the various inquiries that had before been made as to his mode of life and pursuits the poor alchymist was too feeble and too weary at heart to make any but brief replies he requested that some man of science might examine his laboratory and all his books and papers by which it would be made abundantly evident that he was merely engaged in the study of alchymy  to this the inquisitor observed that alchymy had become a mere covert for secret and deadly sins that the practisers of it were apt to scruple at no means to satisfy their inordinate greediness of gold some had been known to use spells and impious ceremonies to conjure the aid of evil spirits nay even to sell their souls to the enemy of mankind so that they might riot in boundless wealth while living  the poor alchymist had heard all patiently or at least passively he had disdained to vindicate his name otherwise than by his word he had smiled at the accusations of sorcery when applied merely to himself but when the sublime art which had been the study and passion of his life was assailed he could no longer listen in silence his head gradually rose from his bosom a hectic colour came in faint streaks to his cheek played about there disappeared returned and at length kindled into a burning glow the clammy dampness dried from his forehead his eyes which had nearly been extinguished lighted up again and burned with their wonted and visionary fires he entered into a vindication of his favourite art his voice at first was feeble and broken but it gathered strength as he proceeded until it rolled in a deep and sonorous volume he gradually rose from his seat as he rose with his subject he threw back the scanty black mantle which had hitherto wrapped his limbs the very uncouthness of his form and looks gave an impressive effect to what he uttered it was as though a corpse had become suddenly animated  he repelled with scorn the aspersions cast upon alchymy by the ignorant and vulgar he affirmed it to be the mother of all art and science citing the opinions of paracelsus sandivogius raymond lully and others in support of his assertions he maintained that it was pure and innocent and honourable both in its purposes and means what were its objects the perpetuation of life and youth and the production of gold the elixir vitae said he is no charmed potion but merely a concentration of those elements of vitality which nature has scattered through her works the philosophers stone or tincture or powder as it is variously called is no necromantic talisman but consists simply of those particles which gold contains within itself for its reproduction for gold like other things has its seed within itself though bound up with inconceivable firmness from the vigour of innate fixed salts and sulphurs in seeking to discover the elixir of life then continued he we seek only to apply some of natures own specifics against the disease and decay to which our bodies are subjected and what else does the physician when he tasks his art and uses subtle compounds and cunning distillations to revive our languishing powers and avert the stroke of death for a season  in seeking to multiply the precious metals also we seek but to germinate and multiply by natural means a particular species of natures productions and what else does the husbandman who consults times and seasons and by what might be deemed a natural magic from the mere scattering of his hand covers a whole plain with golden vegetation the mysteries of our art it is true are deeply and darkly hidden but it requires so much the more innocence and purity of thought to penetrate unto them no father the true alchymist must be pure in mind and body he must be temperate patient chaste watchful meek humble devout my son says hermes trismegestes the great master of our art my son i recommend you above all things to fear god and indeed it is only by devout castigation of the senses and purification of the soul that the alchymist is enabled to enter into the sacred chambers of truth labour pray and read is the motto of our science as de nuysment well observes these high and singular favours are granted unto none save only unto the sons of god that is to say the virtuous and devout who under his paternal benediction have obtained the opening of the same by the helping hand of the queen of arts divine philosophy indeed so sacred has the nature of this knowledge been considered that we are told it has four times been expressly communicated by god to man having made a part of that cabalistical wisdom which was revealed to adam to console him for the loss of paradise and to moses in the bush and to solomon in a dream and to esdras by the angel  so far from demons and malign spirits being the friends and abettors of the alchymist they are the continual foes with which he has to contend it is their constant endeavour to shut up the avenues to those truths which would enable him to rise above the abject state into which he has fallen and return to that excellence which was his original birthright for what would be the effect of this length of days and this abundant wealth but to enable the possessor to go on from art to art from science to science with energies unimpaired by sickness uninterrupted by death for this have sages and philosophers shut themselves up in cells and solitudes buried themselves in caves and dens of the earth turning from the joys of life and the pleasance of the world enduring scorn poverty persecution for this was raymond lully stoned to death in mauritania for this did the immortal pietro dabano suffer persecution at padua and when he escaped from his oppressors by death was despitefully burnt in effigy for this have illustrious men of all nations intrepidly suffered martyrdom for this if unmolested have they assiduously employed the latest hour of life the expiring throb of existence hoping to the last that they might yet seize upon the prize for which they had struggled and pluck themselves back even from the very jaws of the grave  for when once the alchymist shall have attained the object of his toils when the sublime secret shall be revealed to his gaze how glorious will be the change in his condition how will he emerge from his solitary retreat like the sun breaking forth from the darksome chamber of the night and darting his beams throughout the earth gifted with perpetual youth and boundless riches to what heights of wisdom may he attain how may he carry on uninterrupted the thread of knowledge which has hitherto been snapped at the death of each philosopher and as the increase of wisdom is the increase of virtue how may he become the benefactor of his fellowmen dispensing with liberal but cautious and discriminating hand that inexhaustible wealth which is at his disposal banishing poverty which is the cause of so much sorrow and wickedness encouraging the arts promoting discoveries and enlarging all the means of virtuous enjoyment his life will be the connecting band of generations history will live in his recollection distant ages will speak with his tongue the nations of the earth will look to him as their preceptor and kings will sit at his feet and learn wisdom oh glorious oh celestial alchymy  here he was interrupted by the inquisitor who had suffered him to go on thus far in hopes of gathering something from his unguarded enthusiasm senor said he this is all rambling visionary talk you are charged with sorcery and in defence you give us a rhapsody about alchymy have you nothing better than this to offer in your defence  the old man slowly resumed his seat but did not deign a reply the fire that had beamed in his eye gradually expired his cheek resumed its wonted paleness but he did not relapse into inanity he sat with a steady serene patient look like one prepared not to contend but to suffer  his trial continued for a long time with cruel mockery of justice for no witnesses were ever in this court confronted with the accused and the latter had continually to defend himself in the dark some unknown and powerful enemy had alleged charges against the unfortunate alchymist but who he could not imagine stranger and sojourner as he was in the land solitary and harmless in his pursuits how could he have provoked such hostility the tide of secret testimony however was too strong against him he was convicted of the crime of magic and condemned to expiate his sins at the stake at the approaching auto da fé  while the unhappy alchymist was undergoing his trial at the inquisition his daughter was exposed to trials no less severe don ambrosio into whose hands she had fallen was as has before been intimated one of the most daring and lawless profligates in all granada he was a man of hot blood and fiery passions who stopped at nothing in the gratification of his desires yet with all this he possessed manners address and accomplishments that had made him eminently successful among the sex from the palace to the cottage he had extended his amorous enterprises his serenades harassed the slumbers of half the husbands in granada no balcony was too high for his adventurous attempts nor any cottage too lowly for his perfidious seductions yet he was as fickle as he was ardent success had made him vain and capricious he had no sentiment to attach him to the victim of his arts and many a pale cheek and fading eye languishing amidst the sparkling of jewels and many a breaking heart throbbing under the rustic bodice bore testimony to his triumphs and his faithlessness  he was sated however by easy conquests and wearied of a life of continual and prompt gratification there had been a degree of difficulty and enterprise in the pursuit of inez that he had never before experienced it had aroused him from the monotony of mere sensual life and stimulated him with the charm of adventure he had become an epicure in pleasure and now that he had this coy beauty in his power he was determined to protract his enjoyment by the gradual conquest of her scruples and downfall of her virtue he was vain of his person and address which he thought no woman could long withstand and it was a kind of trial of skill to endeavour to gain by art and fascination what he was secure of obtaining at any time by violence  when inez therefore was brought into his presence by his emissaries he affected not to notice her terror and surprise but received her with formal and stately courtesy he was too wary a fowler to flutter the bird when just entangled in the net to her eager and wild inquiries about her father he begged her not to be alarmed that he was safe and had been there but was engaged elsewhere in an affair of moment from which he would soon return in the meantime he had left word that she should await his return in patience after some stately expressions of general civility don ambrosio made a ceremonious bow and retired  the mind of inez was full of trouble and perplexity the stately formality of don ambrosio was so unexpected as to check the accusations and reproaches that were springing to her lips had he had evil designs would he have treated her with such frigid ceremony when he had her in his power but why then was she brought to his house was not the mysterious disappearance of antonio connected with this a thought suddenly darted into her mind antonio had again met with don ambrosiothey had foughtantonio was woundedperhaps dying it was him to whom her father had goneit was at his request that don ambrosio had sent for them to soothe his dying moments these and a thousand such horrible suggestions harassed her mind but she tried in vain to get information from the domestics they knew nothing but that her father had been there had gone and would soon return  thus passed a night of tumultuous thought and vague yet cruel apprehensions she knew not what to do or what to believewhether she ought to fly or to remain but if to fly how was she to extricate herselfand where was she to seek her father as the day dawned without any intelligence of him her alarm increased at length a message was brought from him saying that circumstances prevented his return to her but begging her to hasten to him without delay  with an eager and throbbing heart did she set forth with the men that were to conduct her she little thought however that she was merely changing her prisonhouse don ambrosio had feared lest she should be traced to his residence in granada or that he might be interrupted there before he could accomplish his plan of seduction he had her now conveyed therefore to a mansion which he possessed in one of the mountain solitudes in the neighbourhood of granada a lonely but beautiful retreat in vain on her arrival did she look around for her father or antonio none but strange faces met her eye menials profoundly respectful but who knew nor saw anything but what their master pleased  she had scarcely arrived before don ambrosio made his appearance less stately in his manner but still treating her with the utmost delicacy and deference inez was too much agitated and alarmed to be baffled by his courtesy and became vehement in her demand to be conducted to her father  don ambrosio now put on an appearance of the greatest embarrassment and emotion after some delay and much pretended confusion he at length confessed that the seizure of her father was all a stratagem a mere false alarm to procure him the present opportunity of having access to her and endeavouring to mitigate that obduracy and conquer that repugnance which he declared had almost driven him to distraction  he assured her that her father was again at home in safety and occupied in his usual pursuits having been fully satisfied that his daughter was in honourable hands and would soon be restored to him it was in vain that she threw herself at his feet and implored to be set at liberty he only replied by gentle entreaties that she would pardon the seeming violence he had to use and that she would trust a little while to his honour you are here said he absolute mistress of every thing nothing shall be said or done to offend you i will not even intrude upon your ear the unhappy passion that is devouring my heart should you require it i will even absent myself from your presence but to part with you entirely at present with your mind full of doubts and resentments would be worse than death to me no beautiful inez you must first know me a little better and know by my conduct that my passion for you is as delicate and respectful as it is vehement  the assurance of her fathers safety had relieved inez from one cause of torturing anxiety only to render her fears the more violent on her own account don ambrosio however continued to treat her with artful deference that insensibly lulled her apprehensions it is true she found herself a captive but no advantage appeared to be taken of her helplessness she soothed herself with the idea that a little while would suffice to convince don ambrosio of the fallacy of his hopes and that he would be induced to restore her to her home her transports of terror and affliction therefore subsided in a few days into a passive yet anxious melancholy with which she awaited the hopedfor event  in the meanwhile all those artifices were employed that are calculated to charm the senses ensnare the feelings and dissolve the heart into tenderness don ambrosio was a master of the subtle arts of seduction his very mansion breathed an enervating atmosphere of languor and delight it was here amidst twilight saloons and dreamy chambers buried among groves of orange and myrtle that he shut himself up at times from the prying world and gave free scope to the gratification of his pleasures  the apartments were furnished in the most sumptuous and voluptuous manner the silken couches swelled to the touch and sunk in downy softness beneath the slightest pressure the paintings and statues all told some classic tale of love managed however with an insidious delicacy which while it banished the grossness that might disgust was the more calculated to excite the imagination there the blooming adonis was seen not breaking away to pursue the boisterous chase but crowned with flowers and languishing in the embraces of celestial beauty there acis wooed his galatea in the shade with the sicilian sea spreading in halcyon serenity before them there were depicted groups of fauns and dryads fondly reclining in summer bowers and listening to the liquid piping of the reed or the wanton satyrs surprising some woodnymph during her noontide slumber there too on the storied tapestry might be seen the chaste diana stealing in the mystery of moonlight to kiss the sleeping endymion while cupid and psyche entwined in immortal marble breathed on each others lips the early kiss of love  the ardent rays of the sun were excluded from these balmy halls soft and tender music from unseen musicians floated around seeming to mingle with the perfumes that were exhaled from a thousand flowers at night when the moon shed a fairy light over the scene the tender serenade would rise from among the bowers of the garden in which the fine voice of don ambrosio might often be distinguished or the amorous flute would be heard along the mountain breathing in its pensive cadences the very soul of a lovers melancholy  various entertainments were also devised to dispel her loneliness and to charm away the idea of confinement groups of andalusian dancers performed in the splendid saloons the various picturesque dances of their country or represented little amorous ballets which turned upon some pleasing scene of pastoral coquetry and courtship sometimes there were bands of singers who to the romantic guitar warbled forth ditties full of passion and tenderness  thus all about her enticed to pleasure and voluptuousnesss but the heart of inez turned with distaste from this idle mockery the tears would rush into her eyes as her thoughts reverted from this scene of profligate splendour to the humble but virtuous home from whence she had been betrayed or if the witching power of music ever soothed her into a tender reverie it was to dwell with fondness on the image of antonio but if don ambrosio deceived by this transient calm should attempt at such time to whisper his passion she would start as from a dream and recoil from him with involuntary shuddering  she had passed one long day of more than ordinary sadness and in the evening a band of these hired performers were exerting all the animating powers of song and dance to amuse her but while the lofty saloon resounded with their warblings and the light sound of feet upon its marble pavement kept time to the cadence of the song poor inez with her face buried in the silken couch on which she reclined was only rendered more wretched by the sound of gayety  at length her attention was caught by the voice of one of the singers that brought with it some indefinite recollections she raised her head and cast an anxious look at the performers who as usual were at the lower end of the saloon  one of them advanced a little before the others it was a female dressed in a fanciful pastoral garb suited to the character she was sustaining but her countenance was not to be mistaken it was the same balladsinger that had twice crossed her path and given her mysterious intimations of the lurking mischief that surrounded her when the rest of the performances were concluded she seized a tambourine and tossing it aloft danced alone to the melody of her own voice in the course of her dancing she approached to where inez reclined and as she struck the tambourine contrived dexterously to throw a folded paper on the couch inez seized it with avidity and concealed it in her bosom the singing and dancing were at an end the motley crew retired and inez left alone hastened with anxiety to unfold the paper thus mysteriously conveyed it was written in an agitated and almost illegible handwriting be on your guard you are surrounded by treachery trust not to the forbearance of don ambrosio you are marked out for his prey an humble victim to his perfidy gives you this warning she is encompassed by too many dangers to be more explicityour father is in the dungeons of the inquisition  the brain of inez reeled as she read this dreadful scroll she was less filled with alarm at her own danger than horror at her fathers situation the moment don ambrosio appeared she rushed and threw herself at his feet imploring him to save her father don ambrosio stared with astonishment but immediately regaining his selfpossession endeavoured to soothe her by his blandishments and by assurances that her father was in safety she was not to be pacified her fears were too much aroused to be trifled with she declared her knowledge of her fathers being a prisoner of the inquisition and reiterated her frantic supplications that he would save him  don ambrosio paused for a moment in perplexity but was too adroit to be easily confounded that your father is a prisoner replied he i have long known i have concealed it from you to save you from fruitless anxiety you now know the real reason of the restraint i have put upon your liberty i have been protecting instead of detaining you every exertion has been made in your fathers favour but i regret to say the proofs of the offences of which he stands charged have been too strong to be controverted still added he i have it in my power to save him i have influence i have means at my beck it may involve me it is true in difficulties perhaps in disgrace but what would i not do in the hope of being rewarded by your favour speak beautiful inez said he his eyes kindling with sudden eagerness it is with you to say the word that seals your fathers fate one kind wordsay but you will be mine and you will behold me at your feet your father at liberty and in affluence and we shall all be happy  inez drew back from him with scorn and disbelief my father exclaimed she is too innocent and blameless to be convicted of crime this is some base some cruel artifice don ambrosio repeated his asseverations and with them also his dishonourable proposals but his eagerness overshot its mark her indignation and her incredulity were alike awakened by his base suggestions and he retired from her presence checked and awed by the sudden pride and dignity of her demeanour  the unfortunate inez now became a prey to the most harrowing anxieties don ambrosio saw that the mask had fallen from his face and that the nature of his machinations was revealed he had gone too far to retrace his steps and assume the affectation of tenderness and respect indeed he was mortified and incensed at her insensibility to his attractions and now only sought to subdue her through her fears he daily represented to her the dangers that threatened her father and that it was in his power alone to avert them inez was still incredulous she was too ignorant of the nature of the inquisition to know that even innocence was not always a protection from its cruelties and she confided too surely in the virtue of her father to believe that any accusation could prevail against him  at length don ambrosio to give an effectual blow to her confidence brought her the proclamation of the approaching auto da fé in which the prisoners were enumerated she glanced her eye over it and beheld her fathers name condemned to the stake for sorcery  for a moment she stood transfixed with horror don ambrosio seized upon the transient calm think now beautiful inez said he with a tone of affected tenderness his life is still in your hands one word from you one kind word and i can yet save him  monster wretch cried she coming to herself and recoiling from him with insuperable abhorrence tis you that are the cause of thistis you that are his murderer then wringing her hands she broke forth into exclamations of the most frantic agony  the perfidious ambrosio saw the torture of her soul and anticipated from it a triumph he saw that she was in no mood during her present paroxysm to listen to his words but he trusted that the horrors of lonely rumination would break down her spirit and subdue her to his will in this however he was disappointed many were the vicissitudes of mind of the wretched inez at one time she would embrace his knees with piercing supplications at another she would shrink with nervous horror at his very approach but any intimation of his passion only excited the same emotion of loathing and detestation  at length the fatal day drew nigh tomorrow said don ambrosio as he left her one evening tomorrow is the auto da fé tomorrow you will hear the sound of the bell that tolls your father to his death you will almost see the smoke that rises from the funeral pile i leave you to yourself it is yet in my power to save him think whether you can stand tomorrows horrors without shrinking think whether you can endure the afterreflection that you were the cause of his death and that merely through a perversity in refusing proffered happiness  what a night was it to inezher heart already harassed and almost broken by repeated and protracted anxieties her strength wasted and enfeebled on every side horrors awaited her her fathers death her own dishonourthere seemed no escape from misery or perdition is there no relief from manno pity in heaven exclaimed she what what have we done that we should be thus wretched  as the dawn approached the fever of her mind arose to agony a thousand times did she try the doors and windows of her apartment in the desperate hope of escaping alas with all the splendour of her prison it was too faithfully secured for her weak hands to work deliverance like a poor bird that beats its wings against its gilded cage until it sinks panting in despair so she threw herself on the floor in hopeless anguish her blood grew hot in her veins her tongue was parched her temples throbbed with violence she gasped rather than breathed it seemed as if her brain was on fire blessed virgin exclaimed she clasping her hands and turning up her strained eyes look down with pity and support me in this dreadful hour  just as the day began to dawn she heard a key turn softly in the door of her apartment she dreaded lest it should be don ambrosio and the very thought of him gave her a sickening pang it was a female clad in a rustic dress with her face concealed by her mantilla she stepped silently into the room looked cautiously round and then uncovering her face revealed the wellknown features of the balladsinger inez uttered an exclamation of surprise almost of joy the unknown started back pressed her finger on her lips enjoining silence and beckoned her to follow she hastily wrapped herself in her veil and obeyed they passed with quick but noiseless steps through an antechamber across a spacious hall and along a corridor all was silent the household was yet locked in sleep they came to a door to which the unknown applied a key inezs heart misgave her she knew not but some new treachery was menacing her she laid her cold hand on the strangers arm whither are you leading me said she to liberty replied the other in a whisper  do you know the passages about this mansion  but too well replied the girl with a melancholy shake of the head there was an expression of sad veracity in her countenance that was not to be distrusted the door opened on a small terrace which was overlooked by several windows of the mansion  we must move across this quickly said the girl or we may be observed  they glided over it as if scarce touching the ground a flight of steps led down into the garden a wicket at the bottom was readily unbolted they passed with breathless velocity along one of the alleys still in sight of the mansion in which however no person appeared to be stirring at length they came to a low private door in the wall partly hidden by a figtree it was secured by rusty bolts that refused to yield to their feeble efforts  holy virgin exclaimed the stranger what is to be done one moment more and we may be discovered  she seized a stone that lay near by a few blows and the bolt flew back the door grated harshly as they opened it and the next moment they found themselves in a narrow road  now said the stranger for granada as quickly as possible the nearer we approach it the safer we shall be for the road will be more frequented  the imminent risk they ran of being pursued and taken gave supernatural strength to their limbs they flew rather than ran the day had dawned the crimson streaks on the edge of the horizon gave tokens of the approaching sunrise already the light clouds that floated in the western sky were tinged with gold and purple though the broad plain of the vega which now began to open upon their view was covered with the dark haze of morning as yet they only passed a few straggling peasants on the road who could have yielded them no assistance in case of their being overtaken they continued to hurry forward and had gained a considerable distance when the strength of inez which had only been sustained by the fever of her mind began to yield to fatigue she slackened her pace and faltered  alas said she my limbs fail me i can go no farther  bear up bear up replied her companion cheeringly a little farther and we shall be safe look yonder is granada just showing itself in the valley below us a little farther and we shall come to the main road and then we shall find plenty of passengers to protect us  inez encouraged made fresh efforts to get forward but her weary limbs were unequal to the eagerness of her mind her mouth and throat were parched by agony and terror she gasped for breath and leaned for support against a rock it is all in vain exclaimed she i feel as though i should faint  lean on me said the other let us get into the shelter of yon thicket that will conceal us from the view i hear the sound of water which will refresh you  with much difficulty they reached the thicket which overhung a small mountainstream just where its sparkling waters leaped over the rock and fell into a natural basin here inez sank upon the ground exhausted her companion brought water in the palms of her hands and bathed her pallid temples the cooling drops revived her she was enabled to get to the margin of the stream and drink of its crystal current then reclining her head on the bosom of her deliverer she was first enabled to murmur forth her heartfelt gratitude  alas said the other i deserve no thanks i deserve not the good opinion you express in me you behold a victim of don ambrosios arts in early years he seduced me from the cottage of my parents look at the foot of yonder blue mountain in the distance lies my native village but it is no longer a home for me from thence he lured me when i was too young for reflection he educated me taught me various accomplishments made me sensible to love to splendour to refinement then having grown weary of me he neglected me and cast me upon the world happily the accomplishments he taught me have kept me from utter want and the love with which he inspired me has kept me from farther degradation yes i confess my weakness all his perfidy and wrongs cannot efface him from my heart i have been brought up to love him i have no other idol i know him to be base yet i cannot help adoring him i am content to mingle among the hireling throng that administer to his amusements that i may still hover about him and linger in those halls where i once reigned mistress what merit then have i in assisting your escape i scarce know whether i am acting from sympathy and a desire to rescue another victim from his power or jealousy and an eagerness to remove too powerful a rival  while she was yet speaking the sun rose in all its splendour first lighting up the mountain summits then stealing down height by height until its rays gilded the domes and towers of granada which they could partially see from between the trees below them just then the heavy tones of a bell came sounding from a distance echoing in sullen clang along the mountain inez turned pale at the sound she knew it to be the great bell of the cathedral rung at sunrise on the day of the auto da fé to give note of funeral preparation every stroke beat upon her heart and inflicted an absolute corporeal pang she started up wildly let us begone cried she there is not a moment for delay  stop exclaimed the other yonder are horsemen coming over the brow of that distant height if i mistake not don ambrosio is at their headalas tis he we are lost hold continued she give me your scarf and veil wrap yourself in this mantilla i will fly up yon footpath that leads to the heights i will let the veil flutter as i ascend perhaps they may mistake me for you and they must dismount to follow me do you hasten forward you will soon reach the main road you have jewels on your fingers bribe the first muleteer you meet to assist you on your way  all this was said with hurried and breathless rapidity the exchange of garments was made in an instant the girl darted up the mountainpath her white veil fluttering among the dark shrubbery while inez inspired with new strength or rather new terror flew to the road and trusted to providence to guide her tottering steps to granada  all granada was in agitation on the morning of this dismal day the heavy bell of the cathedral continued to utter its clanging tones that pervaded every part of the city summoning all persons to the tremendous spectacle that was about to be exhibited the streets through which the procession was to pass were crowded with the populace the windows the roofs every place that could admit a face or a foothold were alive with spectators in the great square a spacious scaffolding like an amphitheatre was erected where the sentences of the prisoners were to be read and the sermon of faith to be preached and close by were the stakes prepared where the condemned were to be burnt to death seats were arranged for the great the gay the beautiful for such is the horrible curiosity of human nature that this cruel sacrifice was attended with more eagerness than a theatre or even a bullfeast  as the day advanced the scaffolds and balconies were filled with expecting multitudes the sun shone brightly upon fair faces and gallant dresses one would have thought it some scene of elegant festivity instead of an exhibition of human agony and death but what a different spectacle and ceremony was this from those which granada exhibited in the days of her moorish splendour her galas her tournaments her sports of the ring her fêtes of st john her music her zambras and admirable tilts of canes her serenades her concerts her songs in generaliffe the costly liveries of the abencerrages their exquisite inventions the skill and valour of the alabaces the superb dresses of the zegries mazas and gomeles10all these were at an end the days of chivalry were over instead of the prancing cavalcade with neighing steed and lively trumpet with burnished lance and helm and buckler with rich confusion of plume and scarf and banner where purple and scarlet and green and orange and every gay colour were mingled with cloth of gold and fair embroidery instead of this crept on the gloomy pageant of superstition in cowl and sackcloth with cross and coffin and frightful symbols of human suffering in place of the frank hardy knight open and brave with his ladys favour in his casque and amorous motto on his shield looking by gallant deeds to win the smile of beauty came the shaven unmanly monk with downcast eyes and head and heart bleached in the cold cloister secretly exulting in this bigot triumph  footnote 10 rodds civil wars of granada  the sound of the bells gave notice that the dismal procession was advancing it passed slowly through the principal streets of the city bearing in advance the awful banner of the holy office the prisoners walked singly attended by confessors and guarded by familiars of the inquisition they were clad in different garments according to the nature of their punishments those who were to suffer death wore the hideous samarra painted with flames and demons the procession was swelled by choirs of boys different religious orders and public dignitaries and above all by the fathers of the faith moving with slow pace and profound gravity truly triumphing as becomes the principal generals of that great victory11  footnote 11 gonsalvius p 135  as the sacred banner of the inquisition advanced the countless throng sunk on their knees before it they bowed their faces to the very earth as it passed and then slowly rose again like a great undulating billow a murmur of tongues prevailed as the prisoners approached and eager eyes were strained and fingers pointed to distinguish the different orders of penitents whose habits denoted the degree of punishment they were to undergo but as those drew near whose frightful garb marked them as destined to the flames the noise of the rabble subsided they seemed almost to hold in their breath filled with that strange and dismal interest with which we contemplate a human being on the verge of suffering and death  it is an awful thinga voiceless noiseless multitude the hushed and gazing stillness of the surrounding thousands heaped on walls and gates and roofs and hanging as it were in clusters heightened the effect of the pageant that moved drearily on the low murmuring of the priests could now be heard in prayer and exhortation with the faint responses of the prisoners and now and then the voices of the choir at a distance chanting the litanies of the saints  the faces of the prisoners were ghastly and disconsolate even those who had been pardoned and wore the sanbenito or penitential garment bore traces of the horrors they had undergone some were feeble and tottering from long confinement some crippled and distorted by various tortures every countenance was a dismal page on which might be read the secrets of their prisonhouse but in the looks of those condemned to death there was something fierce and eager they seemed men harrowed up by the past and desperate as to the future they were anticipating with spirits fevered by despair and fixed and clenched determination the vehement struggle with agony and death which they were shortly to undergo some cast now and then a wild and anguished look about them upon the shining day the sunbright palaces the gay the beautiful world which they were soon to quit for ever or a glance of sudden indignation at the thronging thousands happy in liberty and life who seemed in contemplating their frightful situation to exult in their own comparative security  one among the condemned however was an exception to these remarks it was an aged man somewhat bowed down with a serene though dejected countenance and a beaming melancholy eye it was the alchymist the populace looked upon him with a degree of compassion which they were not prone to feel towards criminals condemned by the inquisition but when they were told that he was convicted of the crime of magic they drew back with awe and abhorrence  the procession had reached the grand square the first part had already mounted the scaffolding and the condemned were approaching the press of the populace became excessive and was repelled as it were in billows by the guards just as the condemned were entering the square a shrieking was heard among the crowd a female pale frantic dishevelled was seen struggling through the multitude my father my father was all the cry she uttered but it thrilled through every heart the crowd instinctively drew back and made way for her as she advanced  the poor alchymist had made his peace with heaven and by a hard struggle had closed his heart upon the world when the voice of his child called him once more back to worldly thought and agony he turned towards the wellknown voice his knees smote together he endeavoured to stretch forth his pinioned arms and felt himself clasped in the embraces of his child the emotions of both were too agonizing for utterance convulsive sobs and broken exclamations and embraces more of anguish than tenderness were all that passed between them the procession was interrupted for a moment the astonished monks and familiars were filled with involuntary respect at the agony of natural affection ejaculations of pity broke from the crowd touched by the filial piety the extraordinary and hopeless anguish of so young and beautiful a being  every attempt to soothe her and prevail on her to retire was unheeded at length they endeavoured to separate her from her father by force the movement roused her from her temporary abandonment with a sudden paroxysm of fury she snatched a sword from one of the familiars her late pale countenance was flushed with rage and fire flashed from her once soft and languishing eyes the guards shrunk back with awe there was something in this filial frenzy this feminine tenderness wrought up to desperation that touched even their hardened hearts they endeavoured to pacify her but in vain her eye was eager and quick as the shewolfs guarding her young with one arm she pressed her father to her bosom with the other she menaced every one that approached  the patience of the guards was soon exhausted they had held back in awe but not in fear with all her desperation the weapon was soon wrested from her feeble hand and she was borne shrieking and struggling among the crowd the rabble murmured compassion but such was the dread inspired by the inquisition that no one attempted to interfere  the procession again resumed its march inez was ineffectually struggling to release herself from the hands of the familiars that detained her when suddenly she saw don ambrosio before her wretched girl exclaimed he with fury why have you fled from your friends deliver her said he to the familiars to my domestics she is under my protection  his creatures advanced to seize her oh no oh no cried she with new terrors and clinging to the familiars i have fled from no friends he is not my protector he is the murderer of my father  the familiars were perplexed the crowd pressed on with eager curiosity stand off cried the fiery ambrosio dashing the throng from around him then turning to the familiars with sudden moderation my friends said he deliver this poor girl to me her distress has turned her brain she has escaped from her friends and protectors this morning but a little quiet and kind treatment will restore her to tranquillity  i am not mad i am not mad cried she vehemently oh save mesave me from these men i have no protector on earth but my father and him they are murdering  the familiars shook their heads her wildness corroborated the assertions of don ambrosio and his apparent rank commanded respect and belief they relinquished their charge to him and he was consigning the struggling inez to his creatures  let go your hold villain cried a voice from among the crowdand antonio was seen eagerly tearing his way through the press of people  seize him seize him cried don ambrosio to the familiars tis an accomplice of the sorcerers  liar retorted antonio as he thrust the mob to the right and left and forced himself to the spot  the sword of don ambrosio flashed in an instant from the scabbard the student was armed and equally alert there was a fierce clash of weapons the crowd made way for them as they fought and closed again so as to hide them from the view of inez all was tumult and confusion for a moment when there was a kind of shout from the spectators and the mob again opening she beheld as she thought antonio weltering in his blood  this new shock was too great for her already overstrained intellect a giddiness seized upon her every thing seemed to whirl before her eyes she gasped some incoherent words and sunk senseless upon the ground  daysweeks elapsed before inez returned to consciousness at length she opened her eyes as if out of a troubled sleep she was lying upon a magnificent bed in a chamber richly furnished with pierglasses and massive tables inlaid with silver of exquisite workmanship the walls were covered with tapestry the cornices richly gilded through the door which stood open she perceived a superb saloon with statues and crystal lustres and a magnificent suite of apartments beyond the casements of the room were open to admit the soft breath of summer which stole in laden with perfumes from a neighbouring garden from whence also the refreshing sound of fountains and the sweet notes of birds came in mingled music to her ear  female attendants were moving with noiseless step about the chamber but she feared to address them she doubted whether this was not all delusion or whether she was not still in the palace of don ambrosio and that her escape and all its circumstances had not been but a feverish dream she closed her eyes again endeavouring to recall the past and to separate the real from the imaginary the last scenes of consciousness however rushed too forcibly with all their horrors to her mind to be doubted and she turned shuddering from the recollection to gaze once more on the quiet and serene magnificence around her as she again opened her eyes they rested on an object that at once dispelled every alarm at the head of her bed sat a venerable form watching over her with a look of fond anxietyit was her father  i will not attempt to describe the scene that ensued nor the moments of rapture which more than repaid all the sufferings that her affectionate heart had undergone as soon as their feelings had become more calm the alchymist stepped out of the room to introduce a stranger to whom he was indebted for his life and liberty he returned leading in antonio no longer in his poor scholars garb but in the rich dress of a nobleman  the feelings of inez were almost overpowered by these sudden reverses and it was some time before she was sufficiently composed to comprehend the explanation of this seeming romance  it appeared that the lover who had sought her affections in the lowly guise of a student was only son and heir of a powerful grandee of valentia he had been placed at the university of salamanca but a lively curiosity and an eagerness for adventure had induced him to abandon the university without his fathers consent and to visit various parts of spain his rambling inclination satisfied he had remained incognito for a time at granada until by farther study and selfregulation he could prepare himself to return home with credit and atone for his transgressions against paternal authority  how hard he had studied does not remain on record all that we know is his romantic adventure of the tower it was at first a mere youthful caprice excited by a glimpse of a beautiful face in becoming a disciple of the alchymist he probably thought of nothing more than pursuing a light love affair farther acquaintance however had completely fixed his affections and he had determined to conduct inez and her father to valentia and to trust to her merits to secure his fathers consent to their union  in the meantime he had been traced to his concealment his father had received intelligence of his being entangled in the snares of a mysterious adventurer and his daughter and likely to become the dupe of the fascinations of the latter trusty emissaries had been despatched to seize upon him by main force and convey him without delay to the paternal home  what eloquence he had used with his father to convince him of the innocence the honour and the high descent of the alchymist and of the exalted worth of his daughter does not appear all that we know is that the father though a very passionate was a very reasonable man as appears by his consenting that his son should return to granada and conduct inez as his affianced bride to valentia  away then don antonio hurried back full of joyous anticipations he still forbore to throw off his disguise fondly picturing to himself what would be the surprise of inez when having won her heart and hand as a poor wandering scholar he should raise her and her father at once to opulence and splendour  on his arrival he had been shocked at finding the tower deserted by its inhabitants in vain he sought for intelligence concerning them a mystery hung over their disappearance which he could not penetrate until he was thunderstruck on accidentally reading a list of the prisoners at the impending auto da fé to find the name of his venerable master among the condemned  it was the very morning of the execution the procession was already on its way to the grand square not a moment was to be lost the grand inquisitor was a relation of don antonio though they had never met his first impulse was to make himself known to exert all his family influence the weight of his name and the power of his eloquence in vindication of the alchymist but the grand inquisitor was already proceeding in all his pomp to the place where the fatal ceremony was to be performed how was he to be approached antonio threw himself into the crowd in a fever of anxiety and was forcing his way to the scene of horror where he arrived just in time to rescue inez as has been mentioned  it was don ambrosio that fell in their contest being desperately wounded and thinking his end approaching he had confessed to an attending father of the inquisition that he was the sole cause of the alchymists condemnation and that the evidence on which it was grounded was altogether false the testimony of don antonio came in corroboration of this avowal and his relationship to the grand inquisitor had in all probability its proper weight thus was the poor alchymist snatched in a manner from the very flames and so great had been the sympathy awakened in his case that for once a populace rejoiced at being disappointed of an execution  the residue of the story may readily be imagined by every one versed in this valuable kind of history don antonio espoused the lovely inez and took her and her father with him to valentia as she had been a loving and dutiful daughter so she proved a true and tender wife it was not long before don antonio succeeded to his fathers titles and estates and he and his fair spouse were renowned for being the handsomest and happiest couple in all valentia  as to don ambrosio he partially recovered to the enjoyment of a broken constitution and a blasted name and hid his remorse and disgrace in a convent while the poor victim of his arts who had assisted inez in her escape unable to conquer the early passion that he had awakened in her bosom though convinced of the baseness of the object retired from the world and became an humble sister in a nunnery  the worthy alchymist took up his abode with his children a pavilion in the garden of their palace was assigned to him as a laboratory where he resumed his researches with renovated ardour after the grand secret he was now and then assisted by his soninlaw but the latter slackened grievously in his zeal and diligence after marriage still he would listen with profound gravity and attention to the old mans rhapsodies and his quotations from paracelsus sandivogius and pietro dabano which daily grew longer and longer in this way the good alchymist lived on quietly and comfortably to what is called a good old age that is to say an age that is good for nothing and unfortunately for mankind was hurried out of life in his ninetieth year just as he was on the point of discovering the philosophers stone                                       such was the story of the captains friend with which we whiled away the morning the captain was every now and then interrupted by questions and remarks which i have not mentioned lest i should break the continuity of the tale he was a little disturbed also once or twice by the general who fell asleep and breathed rather hard to the great horror and annoyance of lady lillycraft in a long and tender love scene also which was particularly to her ladyships taste the unlucky general having his head a little sunk upon his breast kept making a sound at regular intervals very much like the word pish long drawn out at length he made an odd abrupt guttural sound that suddenly awoke him he hemmed looked about with a slight degree of consternation and then began to play with her ladyships workbag which however she rather pettishly withdrew the steady sound of the captains voice was still too potent a soporific for the poor general he kept gleaming up and sinking in the socket until the cessation of the tale again roused him when he started awake put his foot down upon lady lillycrafts cur the sleeping beauty which yelped and seized him by the leg and in a moment the whole library resounded with yelpings and exclamations never did man more completely mar his fortunes while he was asleep silence being at length restored the company expressed their thanks to the captain and gave various opinions of the story the parsons mind i found had been continually running upon the leaden manuscripts mentioned in the beginning as dug up at granada and he put several eager questions to the captain on the subject the general could not well make out the drift of the story but thought it a little confused i am glad however said he that they burnt the old chap of the tower i have no doubt he was a notorious impostor  end of vol one     bracebridge hall  or  the humourists  a medley  by geoffrey crayon gent  volume second    under this cloud i walk gentlemen pardon my rude   assault i am a traveller who having surveyed most of   the terrestrial angles of this globe am hither arrived   to peruse this little spot    christmas ordinary     english country gentlemen    his certain life that never can deceive him     is full of thousand sweets and rich content   the smoothleaved beeches in the field receive him     with coolest shade till noontides heat be spent   his life is neither tost in boisterous seas     or the vexatious world or lost in slothful ease   pleased and full blest he lives when he his god can please    phineas fletcher   i take great pleasure in accompanying the squire in his perambulations about his estate in which he is often attended by a kind of cabinet council his prime minister the steward is a very worthy and honest old man that assumes a right of way that is to say a right to have his own way from having lived time out of mind on the place he loves the estate even better than he does the squire and thwarts the latter sadly in many of his projects of improvement being a little prone to disapprove of every plan that does not originate with himself  in the course of one of these perambulations i have known the squire to point out some important alteration which he was contemplating in the disposition or cultivation of the grounds this of course would be opposed by the steward and a long argument would ensue over a stile or on a rising piece of ground until the squire who has a high opinion of the others ability and integrity would be fain to give up the point this concession i observed would immediately mollify the old man and after walking over a field or two in silence with his hands behind his back chewing the cud of reflection he would suddenly turn to the squire and observe that he had been turning the matter over in his mind and upon the whole he believed he would take his honours advice  christy the huntsman is another of the squires occasional attendants to whom he continually refers in all matters of local history as to a chronicle of the estate having in a manner been acquainted with many of the trees from the very time that they were acorns old nimrod as has been shown is rather pragmatical in those points of knowledge on which he values himself but the squire rarely contradicts him and is in fact one of the most indulgent potentates that ever was henpecked by his ministry  he often laughs about it himself and evidently yields to these old men more from the bent of his own humour than from any want of proper authority he likes this honest independence of old age and is well aware that these trusty followers love and honour him in their hearts he is perfectly at ease about his own dignity and the respect of those around him nothing disgusts him sooner than any appearance of fawning or sycophancy  i really have seen no display of royal state that could compare with one of the squires progresses about his paternal fields and through his hereditary woodlands with several of these faithful adherents about him and followed by a bodyguard of dogs he encourages a frankness and manliness of deportment among his dependants and is the personal friend of his tenants inquiring into their concerns and assisting them in times of difficulty and hardship this has rendered him one of the most popular and of course one of the happiest of landlords  indeed i do not know a more enviable condition of life than that of an english gentleman of sound judgment and good feelings who passes the greater part of his time on an hereditary estate in the country from the excellence of the roads and the rapidity and exactness of the public conveyances he is enabled to command all the comforts and conveniences all the intelligence and novelties of the capital while he is removed from its hurry and distraction he has ample means of occupation and amusement within his own domains he may diversify his time by rural occupations by rural sports by study and by the delights of friendly society collected within his own hospitable halls  or if his views and feelings are of a more extensive and liberal nature he has it greatly in his power to do good and to have that good immediately reflected back upon himself he can render essential services to his country by assisting in the disinterested administration of the laws by watching over the opinions and principles of the lower orders around him by diffusing among them those lights which may be important to their welfare by mingling frankly among them gaining their confidence becoming the immediate auditor of their complaints informing himself of their wants making himself a channel through which their grievances may be quietly communicated to the proper sources of mitigation and relief or by becoming if need be the intrepid and incorruptible guardian of their libertiesthe enlightened champion of their rights  all this it appears to me can be done without any sacrifice of personal dignity without any degrading arts of popularity without any truckling to vulgar prejudices or concurrence in vulgar clamour but by the steady influence of sincere and friendly counsel of fair upright and generous deportment whatever may be said of english mobs and english demagogues i have never met with a people more open to reason more considerate in their tempers more tractable by argument in the roughest times than the english they are remarkably quick at discerning and appreciating whatever is manly and honourable they are by nature and habit methodical and orderly and they feel the value of all that is regular and respectable they may occasionally be deceived by sophistry and excited into turbulence by public distresses and the misrepresentations of designing men but open their eyes and they will eventually rally round the landmarks of steady truth and deliberate good sense they are fond of established customs they are fond of longestablished names and that love of order and quiet which characterizes the nation gives a vast influence to the descendants of the old families whose forefathers have been lords of the soil from time immemorial  it is when the rich and welleducated and highlyprivileged classes neglect their duties when they neglect to study the interests and conciliate the affections and instruct the opinions and champion the rights of the people that the latter become discontented and turbulent and fall into the hands of demagogues the demagogue always steps in where the patriot is wanting there is a common highhanded cant among the highfeeding and as they fancy themselves highminded men about putting down the mob but all true physicians know that it is better to sweeten the blood than attack the tumour to apply the emollient rather than the cautery it is absurd in a country like england where there is so much freedom and such a jealousy of right for any man to assume an aristocratical tone and to talk superciliously of the common people there is no rank that makes him independent of the opinions and affections of his fellowmen there is no rank nor distinction that severs him from his fellowsubjects and if by any gradual neglect or assumption on the one side and discontent and jealousy on the other the orders of society should really separate let those who stand on the eminence beware that the chasm is not mining at their feet the orders of society in all wellconstituted governments are mutually bound together and important to each other there can be no such thing in a free government as a vacuum and whenever one is likely to take place by the drawing off of the rich and intelligent from the poor the bad passions of society will rush in to fill up the space and rend the whole asunder  though born and brought up in a republic and more and more confirmed in republican principles by every years observation and experience yet i am not insensible to the excellence that may exist in other forms of government nor to the fact that they may be more suitable to the situation and circumstances of the countries in which they exist i have endeavoured rather to look at them as they are and to observe how they are calculated to effect the end which they propose considering therefore the mixed nature of the government of this country and its representative form i have looked with admiration at the manner in which the wealth and influence and intelligence were spread over its whole surface not as in some monarchies drained from the country and collected in towns and cities i have considered the great rural establishments of the nobility and the lesser establishments of the gentry as so many reservoirs of wealth and intelligence distributed about the kingdom apart from the towns to irrigate freshen and fertilize the surrounding country i have looked upon them too as the august retreat of patriots and statesmen where in the enjoyment of honourable independence and elegant leisure they might train up their minds to appear in those legislative assemblies whose debates and decisions form the study and precedents of other nations and involve the interests of the world  i have been both surprised and disappointed therefore at finding that on this subject i was often indulging in an utopian dream rather than a wellfounded opinion i have been concerned at finding that these fine estates were too often involved and mortgaged or placed in the hands of creditors and the owners exiled from their paternal lands there is an extravagance i am told that runs parallel with wealth a lavish expenditure among the great a senseless competition among the aspiring a heedless joyless dissipation among all the upper ranks that often beggars even these splendid establishments breaks down the pride and principles of their possessors and makes too many of them mere placehunters or shifting absentees it is thus that so many are thrown into the hands of government and a court which ought to be the most pure and honourable in europe is so often degraded by noble but importunate timeservers it is thus too that so many become exiles from their native land crowding the hotels of foreign countries and expending upon thankless strangers the wealth so hardly drained from their laborious peasantry i have looked upon these latter with a mixture of censure and concern knowing the almost bigoted fondness of an englishman for his native home i can conceive what must be their compunction and regret when amidst the sunburnt plains of france they call to mind the green fields of england the hereditary groves which they have abandoned and the hospitable roof of their fathers which they have left desolate or to be inhabited by strangers but retrenchment is no plea for abandonment of country they nave risen with the prosperity of the land let them abide its fluctuations and conform to its fortunes it is not for the rich to fly because the country is suffering let them share in their relative proportion the common lot they owe it to the land that has elevated them to honour and affluence when the poor have to diminish their scanty morsels of bread when they have to compound with the cravings of nature and study with how little they can do and not be starved it is not then for the rich to fly and diminish still farther the resources of the poor that they themselves may live in splendour in a cheaper country let them rather retire to their estates and there practise retrenchment let them return to that noble simplicity that practical good sense that honest pride which form the foundation of true english character and from them they may again rear the edifice of fair and honourable prosperity  on the rural habits of the english nobility and gentry on the manner in which they discharge their duties of their patrimonial possessions depend greatly the virtue and welfare of the nation so long as they pass the greater part of their time in the quiet and purity of the country surrounded by the monuments of their illustrious ancestors surrounded by every thing that can inspire generous pride noble emulation and amiable and magnanimous sentiment so long they are safe and in them the nation may repose its interests and its honour but the moment that they become the servile throngers of court avenues and give themselves up to the political intrigues and heartless dissipations of the metropolis that moment they lose the real nobility of their natures and become the mere leeches of the country  that the great majority of nobility and gentry in england are endowed with high notions of honour and independence i thoroughly believe they have evidenced it lately on very important questions and have given an example of adherence to principle in preference to party and power that must have astonished many of the venal and obsequious courts of europe such are the glorious effects of freedom when infused into a constitution but it seems to me that they are apt to forget the positive nature of their duties and to fancy that their eminent privileges are only so many means of selfindulgence they should recollect that in a constitution like that of england the titled orders are intended to be as useful as they are ornamental and it is their virtues alone that can render them both their duties are divided between the sovereign and the subjects surrounding and giving lustre and dignity to the throne and at the same time tempering and mitigating its rays until they are transmitted in mild and genial radiance to the people born to leisure and opulence they owe the exercise of their talents and the expenditure of their wealth to their native country they may be compared to the clouds which being drawn up by the sun and elevated in the heavens reflect and magnify his splendour while they repay the earth from which they derive their sustenance by returning their treasures to its bosom in fertilizing showers     a bachelors confessions    ill live a private pensive single life    the collier of croydon   i was sitting in my room a morning or two since reading when some one tapped at the door and master simon entered he had an unusually fresh appearance he had put on a bright green ridingcoat with a bunch of violets in the buttonhole and had the air of an old bachelor trying to rejuvenate himself he had not however his usual briskness and vivacity but loitered about the room with somewhat of absence of manner humming the old songgo lovely rose tell her that wastes her time and me and then leaning against the window and looking upon the landscape he uttered a very audible sigh as i had not been accustomed to see master simon in a pensive mood i thought there might be some vexation preying on his mind and i endeavoured to introduce a cheerful strain of conversation but he was not in the vein to follow it up and proposed that we should take a walk  it was a beautiful morning of that soft vernal temperature that seems to thaw all the frost out of ones blood and to set all nature in a ferment the very fishes felt its influence the cautious trout ventured out of his dark hole to seek his mate the roach and the dace rose up to the surface of the brook to bask in the sunshine and the amorous frog piped from among the rushes if ever an oyster can really fall in love as has been said or sung it must be on such a morning  the weather certainly had its effect even upon master simon for he seemed obstinately bent upon the pensive mood instead of stepping briskly along smacking his dogwhip whistling quaint ditties or telling sporting anecdotes he leaned on my arm and talked about the approaching nuptials from whence he made several digressions upon the character of womankind touched a little upon the tender passion and made sundry very excellent though rather trite observations upon disappointments in love it was evident that he had something on his mind which he wished to impart but felt awkward in approaching it i was curious to see to what this strain would lead but was determined not to assist him indeed i mischievously pretended to turn the conversation and talked of his usual topics dogs horses and hunting but he was very brief in his replies and invariably got back by hook or by crook into the sentimental vein  at length we came to a clump of trees that overhung a whispering brook with a rustic bench at their feet the trees were grievously scored with letters and devices which had grown out of all shape and size by the growth of the bark and it appeared that this grove had served as a kind of register of the family loves from time immemorial here master simon made a pause pulled up a tuft of flowers threw them one by one into the water and at length turning somewhat abruptly upon me asked me if i had ever been in love i confess the question startled me a little as i am not overfond of making confessions of my amorous follies and above all should never dream of choosing my friend master simon for a confidant he did not wait however for a reply the inquiry was merely a prelude to a confession on his own part and after several circumlocutions and whimsical preambles he fairly disburthened himself of a very tolerable story of his having been crossed in love  the reader will very probably suppose that it related to the gay widow who jilted him not long since at doncaster racesno such thing it was about a sentimental passion that he once had for a most beautiful young lady who wrote poetry and played on the harp he used to serenade her and indeed he described several tender and gallant scenes in which he was evidently picturing himself in his minds eye as some elegant hero of romance though unfortunately for the tale i only saw him as he stood before me a dapper little old bachelor with a face like an apple that has dried with the bloom on it  what were the particulars of this tender tale i have already forgotten indeed i listened to it with a heart like a very pebblestone having hard work to repress a smile while master simon was putting on the amorous swain uttering every now and then a sigh and endeavouring to look sentimental and melancholy  all that i recollect is that the lady according to his account was certainly a little touched for she used to accept all the music that he copied for her harp and all the patterns that he drew for her dresses and he began to flatter himself after a long course of delicate attentions that he was gradually fanning up a gentle flame in her heart when she suddenly accepted the hand of a rich boisterous foxhunting baronet without either music or sentiment who carried her by storm after a fortnights courtship  master simon could not help concluding by some observation about modest merit and the power of gold over the sex as a remembrance of his passion he pointed out a heart carved on the bark of one of the trees but which in the process of time had grown out into a large excrescence and he showed me a lock of her hair which he wore in a truelovers knot in a large gold brooch  i have seldom met with an old bachelor that had not at some time or other his nonsensical moment when he would become tender and sentimental talk about the concerns of the heart and have some confession of a delicate nature to make almost every man has some little trait of romance in his life which he looks back to with fondness and about which he is apt to grow garrulous occasionally he recollects himself as he was at the time young and gamesome and forgets that his hearers have no other idea of the hero of the tale but such as he may appear at the time of telling it peradventure a withered whimsical spindleshanked old gentleman with married men it is true this is not so frequently the case their amorous romance is apt to decline after marriage why i cannot for the life of me imagine but with a bachelor though it may slumber it never dies it is always liable to break out again in transient flashes and never so much as on a spring morning in the country or on a winter evening when seated in his solitary chamber stirring up the fire and talking of matrimony  the moment that master simon had gone through his confession and to use the common phrase had made a clean breast of it he became quite himself again he had settled the point which had been worrying his mind and doubtless considered himself established as a man of sentiment in my opinion before we had finished our mornings stroll he was singing as blithe as a grasshopper whistling to his dogs and telling droll stories and i recollect that he was particularly facetious that day at dinner on the subject of matrimony and uttered several excellent jokes not to be found in joe miller that made the bride elect blush and look down but set all the old gentlemen at the table in a roar and absolutely brought tears into the generals eyes     english gravity    merrie england    ancient phrase   there is nothing so rare as for a man to ride his hobby without molestation i find the squire has not so undisturbed an indulgence in his humours as i had imagined but has been repeatedly thwarted of late and has suffered a kind of wellmeaning persecution from a mr faddy an old gentleman of some weight at least of purse who has recently moved into the neighbourhood he is a worthy and substantial manufacturer who having accumulated a large fortune by dint of steamengines and spinningjennies has retired from business and set up for a country gentleman he has taken an old countryseat and refitted it and painted and plastered it until it looks not unlike his own manufactory he has been particularly careful in mending the walls and hedges and putting up notices of springguns and mantraps in every part of his premises indeed he shows great jealousy about his territorial rights having stopped up a footpath that led across his fields and given warning in staring letters that whoever was found trespassing on those grounds would be prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law he has brought into the country with him all the practical maxims of town and the bustling habits of business and is one of those sensible useful prosing troublesome intolerable old gentlemen that go about wearying and worrying society with excellent plans for public utility  he is very much disposed to be on intimate terms with the squire and calls on him every now and then with some project for the good of the neighbourhood which happens to run diametrically opposite to some one or other of the squires peculiar notions but which is too sensible a measure to be openly opposed he has annoyed him excessively by enforcing the vagrant laws persecuting the gipsies and endeavouring to suppress country wakes and holiday games which he considers great nuisances and reprobates as causes of the deadly sin of idleness  there is evidently in all this a little of the ostentation of newlyacquired consequence the tradesman is gradually swelling into the aristocrat and he begins to grow excessively intolerant of every thing that is not genteel he has a great deal to say about the common people talks much of his park his preserves and the necessity of enforcing the gamelaws more strictly and makes frequent use of the phrase the gentry of the neighbourhood  he came to the hall lately with a face full of business that he and the squire to use his own words might lay their heads together to hit upon some mode of putting a stop to the frolicking at the village on the approaching mayday it drew he said idle people together from all parts of the neighbourhood who spent the day fiddling dancing and carousing instead of staying at home to work for their families  now as the squire unluckily is at the bottom of these mayday revels it may be supposed that the suggestions of the sagacious mr faddy were not received with the best grace in the world it is true the old gentleman is too courteous to show any temper to a guest in his own house but no sooner was he gone than the indignation of the squire found vent at having his poetical cobwebs invaded by this buzzing bluebottle fly of traffic in his warmth he inveighed against the whole race of manufacturers who i found were sore disturbers of his comfort sir said he with emotion it makes my heart bleed to see all our fine streams dammed up and bestrode by cottonmills our valleys smoking with steamengines and the din of the hammer and the loom scaring away all our rural delight whats to become of merry old england when its manorhouses are all turned into manufactories and its sturdy peasantry into pinmakers and stockingweavers i have looked in vain for merry sherwood and all the greenwood haunts of robin hood the whole country is covered with manufacturing towns i have stood on the ruins of dudley castle and looked round with an aching heart on what were once its feudal domains of verdant and beautiful country sir i beheld a mere campus phlegrae a region of fire reeking with coalpits and furnaces and smeltinghouses vomiting forth flames and smoke the pale and ghastly people toiling among vile exhalations looked more like demons than human beings the clanking wheels and engines seen through the murky atmosphere looked like instruments of torture in this pandemonium what is to become of the country with these evils rankling in its very core sir these manufacturers will be the ruin of our rural manners they will destroy the national character they will not leave materials for a single line of poetry  the squire is apt to wax eloquent on such themes and i could hardly help smiling at this whimsical lamentation over national industry and public improvement i am told however that he really grieves at the growing spirit of trade as destroying the charm of life he considers every new shorthand mode of doing things as an inroad of snug sordid method and thinks that this will soon become a mere matteroffact world where life will be reduced to a mathematical calculation of conveniences and every thing will be done by steam  he maintains also that the nation has declined in its free and joyous spirit in proportion as it has turned its attention to commerce and manufactures and that in old times when england was an idler it was also a merrier little island in support of this opinion he adduces the frequency and splendour of ancient festivals and merrymakings and the hearty spirit with which they were kept up by all classes of people his memory is stored with the accounts given by stow in his survey of london of the holiday revels at the inns of court the christmas mummeries and the masquings and bonfires about the streets london he says in those days resembled the continental cities in its picturesque manners and amusements the court used to dance after dinner on public occasions after the coronation dinner of richard ii for example the king the prelates the nobles the knights and the rest of the company danced in westminster hall to the music of the minstrels the example of the court was followed by the middling classes and so down to the lowest and the whole nation was a dancing jovial nation he quotes a lively city picture of the times given by stow which resembles the lively scenes one may often see in the gay city of paris for he tells us that on holidays after evening prayers the maidens in london used to assemble before the door in sight of their masters and dames and while one played on a timbrel the others danced for garlands hanged athwart the street  where will we meet with such merry groups nowadays the squire will exclaim shaking his head mournfullyand then as to the gayety that prevailed in dress throughout all ranks of society and made the very streets so fine and picturesque i have myself says gervaise markham met an ordinary tapster in his silk stockings garters deep fringed with gold lace the rest of his apparel suitable with cloak lined with velvet nashe too who wrote in 1593 exclaims at the finery of the nation england the players stage of gorgeous attire the ape of all nations superfluities the continual masquer in outlandish habiliments  such are a few of the authorities quoted by the squire by way of contrasting what he supposes to have been the former vivacity of the nation with its present monotonous character john bull he will say was then a gay cavalier with his sword by his side and a feather in his cap but he is now a plodding citizen in snuffcoloured coat and gaiters  by the by there really appears to have been some change in the national character since the days of which the squire is so fond of talking those days when this little island acquired its favourite old title of merry england this may be attributed in part to the growing hardships of the times and the necessity of turning the whole attention to the means of subsistence but englands gayest customs prevailed at times when her common people enjoyed comparatively few of the comforts and conveniences that they do at present it may be still more attributed to the universal spirit of gain and the calculating habits that commerce has introduced but i am inclined to attribute it chiefly to the gradual increase of the liberty of the subject and the growing freedom and activity of opinion  a free people are apt to be grave and thoughtful they have high and important matters to occupy their minds they feel that it is their right their interest and their duty to mingle in public concerns and to watch over the general welfare the continual exercise of the mind on political topics gives intenser habits of thinking and a more serious and earnest demeanour a nation becomes less gay but more intellectually active and vigorous it evinces less play of the fancy but more power of the imagination less taste and elegance but more grandeur of mind less animated vivacity but deeper enthusiasm  it is when men are shut out of the regions of manly thought by a despotic government when every grave and lofty theme is rendered perilous to discussion and almost to reflection it is then that they turn to the safer occupations of taste and amusement trifles rise to importance and occupy the craving activity of intellect no being is more void of care and reflection than the slave none dances more gayly in his intervals of labour but make him free give him rights and interests to guard and he becomes thoughtful and laborious  the french are a gayer people than the english why partly from temperament perhaps but greatly because they have been accustomed to governments which surrounded the free exercise of thought with danger and where he only was safe who shut his eyes and ears to public events and enjoyed the passing pleasure of the day within late years they have had more opportunity of exercising their minds and within late years the national character has essentially changed never did the french enjoy such a degree of freedom as they do at this moment and at this moment the french are comparatively a grave people     gipsies    whats that to absolute freedom such as the very beggars have   to feast and revel here today and yonder tomorrow next day   where they please and so on still the whole country or   kingdom over theres liberty the birds of the air can take   no more    jovial crew  since the meeting with the gipsies which i have related in a former paper i have observed several of them haunting the purlieus of the hall in spite of a positive interdiction of the squire they are part of a gang that has long kept about this neighbourhood to the great annoyance of the farmers whose poultryyards often suffer from their nocturnal invasions they are however in some measure patronized by the squire who considers the race as belonging to the good old times which to confess the private truth seem to have abounded with goodfornothing characters  this roving crew is called starlight toms gang from the name of its chieftain a notorious poacher i have heard repeatedly of the misdeeds of this minion of the moon for every midnight depredation that takes place in park or fold or farmyard is laid to his charge starlight tom in fact answers to his name he seems to walk in darkness and like a fox to be traced in the morning by the mischief he has done he reminds me of that fearful personage in the nursery rhyme    who goes round the house at night     none but bloody tom   who steals all the sheep at night     none but one by one  in short starlight tom is the scapegoat of the neighbourhood but so cunning and adroit that there is no detecting him old christy and the gamekeeper have watched many a night in hopes of entrapping him and christy often patrols the park with his dogs for the purpose but all in vain it is said that the squire winks hard at his misdeeds having an indulgent feeling towards the vagabond because of his being very expert at all kinds of games a great shot with the crossbow and the best morrisdancer in the country  the squire also suffers the gang to lurk unmolested about the skirts of his estate on condition that they do not come about the house the approaching wedding however has made a kind of saturnalia at the hall and has caused a suspension of all sober rule it has produced a great sensation throughout the female part of the household not a housemaid but dreams of wedding favours and has a husband running in her head such a time is a harvest for the gipsies there is a public footpath leading across one part of the park by which they have free ingress and they are continually hovering about the grounds telling the servantgirls fortunes or getting smuggled in to the young ladies  i believe the oxonian amuses himself very much by furnishing them with hints in private and bewildering all the weak brains in the house with their wonderful revelations the general certainly was very much astonished by the communications made to him the other evening by the gipsy girl he kept a wary silence towards us on the subject and affected to treat it lightly but i have noticed that he has since redoubled his attentions to lady lillycraft and her dogs  i have seen also phoebe wilkins the housekeepers pretty and lovesick niece holding a long conference with one of these old sibyls behind a large tree in the avenue and often looking round to see that she was not observed i make no doubt that she was endeavouring to get some favourable augury about the result of her lovequarrel with young readymoney as oracles have always been more consulted on love affairs than upon any thing else i fear however that in this instance the response was not so favourable as usual for i perceived poor phoebe returning pensively towards the house her head hanging down her hat in her hand and the riband trailing along the ground  at another time as i turned a corner of a terrace at the bottom of the garden just by a clump of trees and a large stone urn i came upon a bevy of the young girls of the family attended by this same phoebe wilkins i was at a loss to comprehend the meaning of their blushing and giggling and their apparent agitation until i saw the red cloak of a gipsy vanishing among the shrubbery a few moments after i caught sight of master simon and the oxonion stealing along one of the walks of the garden chuckling and laughing at their successful waggery having evidently put the gipsy up to the thing and instructed her what to say  after all there is something strangely pleasing in these tamperings with the future even where we are convinced of the fallacy of the prediction it is singular how willingly the mind will half deceive itself and with what a degree of awe we will listen to these babblers about futurity for my part i cannot feel angry with these poor vagabonds that seek to deceive us into bright hopes and expectations i have always been something of a castlebuilder and have found my liveliest pleasures to arise from the illusions which fancy has cast over commonplace realities as i get on in life i find it more difficult to deceive myself in this delightful manner and i should be thankful to any prophet however false that would conjure the clouds which hang over futurity into palaces and all its doubtful regions into fairyland  the squire who as i have observed has a private goodwill towards gipsies has suffered considerable annoyance on their account not that they requite his indulgence with ingratitude for they do not depredate very flagrantly on his estate but because their pilferings and misdeeds occasion loud murmurs in the village i can readily understand the old gentlemans humour on this point i have a great toleration for all kinds of vagrant sunshiny existence and must confess i take a pleasure in observing the ways of gipsies the english who are accustomed to them from childhood and often suffer from their petty depredations consider them as mere nuisances but i have been very much struck with their peculiarities i like to behold their clear olive complexions their romantic black eyes their raven locks their lithe slender figures and hear them in low silver tones dealing forth magnificent promises of honours and estates of worlds wealth and ladies love  their mode of life too has something in it very fanciful and picturesque they are the free denizens of nature and maintain a primitive independence in spite of law and gospel of county gaols and country magistrates it is curious to see this obstinate adherence to the wild unsettled habits of savage life transmitted from generation to generation and preserved in the midst of one of the most cultivated populous and systematic countries in the world they are totally distinct from the busy thrifty people about them they seem to be like the indians of america either above or below the ordinary cares and anxieties of mankind heedless of power of honours of wealth and indifferent to the fluctuations of times the rise or fall of grain or stock or empires they seem to laugh at the tolling fretting world around them and to live according to the philosophy of the old song    who would ambition shun   and loves to lie i the sun   seeking the food he eats   and pleased with what he gets   come hither come hither come hither       here shall he see       no enemy   but winter and rough weather  in this way they wander from county to county keeping about the purlieus of villages or in plenteous neighbourhoods where there are fat farms and rich countryseats their encampments are generally made in some beautiful spoteither a green shady nook of a road or on the border of a common under a sheltering hedge or on the skirts of a fine spreading wood they are always to be found lurking about fairs and races and rustic gatherings wherever there is pleasure and throng and idleness they are the oracles of milkmaids and simple servinggirls and sometimes have even the honour of perusing the white hands of gentlemens daughters when rambling about their fathers grounds they are the bane of good housewives and thrifty farmers and odious in the eyes of country justices but like all other vagabond beings they have something to commend them to the fancy they are among the last traces in these matteroffact days of the motley population of former times and are whimsically associated in my mind with fairies and witches robin goodfellow robin hood and the other fantastical personages of poetry     mayday customs    happy the age and harmless were the dayes     for then true love and amity was found   when every village did a maypole raise     and whitsun ales and maygames did abound   and all the lusty yonkers in a rout   with merry lasses dauncd the rod about   then friendship to their banquets bid the guests   and poore men fard the better for their feasts    pasquils palinodia   the month of april has nearly passed away and we are fast approaching that poetical day which was considered in old times as the boundary that parted the frontiers of winter and summer with all its caprices however i like the month of april i like these laughing and crying days when sun and shade seem to run in billows over the landscape i like to see the sudden shower coursing over the meadow and giving all nature a greener smile and the bright sunbeams chasing the flying cloud and turning all its drops into diamonds  i was enjoying a morning of the kind in company with the squire in one of the finest parts of the park we were skirting a beautiful grove and he was giving me a kind of biographical account of several of his favourite forest trees when he heard the strokes of an axe from the midst of a thick copse the squire paused and listened with manifest signs of uneasiness he turned his steps in the direction of the sound the strokes grew louder and louder as we advanced there was evidently a vigorous arm wielding the axe the squire quickened his pace but in vain a loud crack and a succeeding crash told that the mischief had been done and some child of the forest laid low when we came to the place we found master simon and several others standing about a tall and beautifully straight young tree which had just been felled  the squire though a man of most harmonious dispositions was completely put out of tune by this circumstance he felt like a monarch witnessing the murder of one of his liege subjects and demanded with some asperity the meaning of the outrage it turned out to be an affair of master simons who had selected the tree from its height and straightness for a maypole the old one which stood on the village green being unfit for farther service if any thing could have soothed the ire of my worthy host it would have been the reflection that his tree had fallen for so good a cause and i saw that there was a great struggle between his fondness for his groves and his devotion to mayday he could not contemplate the prostrate tree however without indulging in lamentation and making a kind of funeral eulogy like mark antony over the body of caesar and he forbade that any tree should thenceforward be cut down on his estate without a warrant from himself being determined he said to hold the sovereign power of life and death in his own hands  this mention of the maypole struck my attention and i inquired whether the old customs connected with it were really kept up in this part of the country the squire shook his head mournfully and i found i had touched on one of his tender points for he grew quite melancholy in bewailing the total decline of old mayday though it is regularly celebrated in the neighbouring village yet it has been merely resuscitated by the worthy squire and is kept up in a forced state of existence at his expense he meets with continual discouragements and finds great difficulty in getting the country bumpkins to play their parts tolerably he manages to have every year a queen of the may but as to robin hood friar tuck the dragon the hobbyhorse and all the other motley crew that used to enliven the day with their mummery he has not ventured to introduce them  still i looked forward with some interest to the promised shadow of old mayday even though it be but a shadow and i feel more and more pleased with the whimsical yet harmless hobby of my host which is surrounding him with agreeable associations and making a little world of poetry about him brought up as i have been in a new country i may appreciate too highly the faint vestiges of ancient customs which i now and then meet with and the interest i express in them may provoke a smile from those who are negligently suffering them to pass away but with whatever indifference they may be regarded by those to the manner born yet in my mind the lingering flavour of them imparts a charm to rustic life which nothing else could readily supply  i shall never forget the delight i felt on first seeing a maypole it was on the banks of the dee close by the picturesque old bridge that stretches across the river from the quaint little city of chester i had already been carried back into former days by the antiquities of that venerable place the examination of which is equal to turning over the pages of a blackletter volume or gazing on the pictures in froissart the maypole on the margin of that poetic stream completed the illusion my fancy adorned it with wreaths of flowers and peopled the green bank with all the dancing revelry of mayday the mere sight of this maypole gave a glow to my feelings and spread a charm over the country for the rest of the day and as i traversed a part of the fair plain of cheshire and the beautiful borders of wales and looked from among swelling hills down a long green valley through which the deva wound its wizard stream my imagination turned all into a perfect arcadia  whether it be owing to such poetical associations early instilled into my mind or whether there is as it were a sympathetic revival and budding forth of the feelings at this season certain it is that i always experience wherever i may be placed a delightful expansion of the heart at the return of may it is said that birds about this time will become restless in their cages as if instinct with the season conscious of the revelry that is going on in the groves and impatient to break from their bondage and join in the jubilee of the year in like manner i have felt myself excited even in the midst of the metropolis when the windows which had been churlishly closed all winter were again thrown open to receive the balmy breath of may when the sweets of the country were breathed into the town and flowers were cried about the streets i have considered the treasures of flowers thus poured in as so many missives from nature inviting us forth to enjoy the virgin beauty of the year before its freshness is exhaled by the heats of sunny summer  one can readily imagine what a gay scene it must have been in jolly old london when the doors were decorated with flowering branches when every hat was decked with hawthorn and robin hood friar tuck maid marian the morrisdancers and all the other fantastic masks and revellers were performing their antics about the maypole in every part of the city  i am not a bigoted admirer of old times and old customs merely because of their antiquity but while i rejoice in the decline of many of the rude usages and coarse amusements of former days i cannot but regret that this innocent and fanciful festival has fallen into disuse it seemed appropriate to this verdant and pastoral country and calculated to light up the too pervading gravity of the nation i value every custom that tends to infuse poetical feeling into the common people and to sweeten and soften the rudeness of rustic manners without destroying their simplicity indeed it is to the decline of this happy simplicity that the decline of this custom may be traced and the rural dance on the green and the homely mayday pageant have gradually disappeared in proportion as the peasantry have become expensive and artificial in their pleasures and too knowing for simple enjoyment  some attempts the squire informs me have been made of late years by men of both taste and learning to rally back the popular feeling to these standards of primitive simplicity but the time has gone by the feeling has become chilled by habits of gain and traffic the country apes the manners and amusements of the town and little is heard of mayday at present except from the lamentations of authors who sigh after it from among the brick walls of the city  for o for o the hobbyhorse is forgot     village worthies    nay i tell you i am so well beloved in our town that not   the worst dog in the street will hurt my little finger    collier of croydon   as the neighbouring village is one of those outoftheway but gossiping little places where a small matter makes a great stir it is not to be supposed that the approach of a festival like that of mayday can be regarded with indifference especially since it is made a matter of such moment by the great folks at the hall master simon who is the faithful factotum of the worthy squire and jumps with his humour in every thing is frequent just now in his visits to the village to give directions for the impending fête and as i have taken the liberty occasionally of accompanying him i have been enabled to get some insight into the characters and internal politics of this very sagacious little community  master simon is in fact the caesar of the village it is true the squire is the protecting power but his factotum is the active and busy agent he intermeddles in all its concerns is acquainted with all the inhabitants and their domestic history gives counsel to the old folks in their business matters and the young folks in their love affairs and enjoys the proud satisfaction of being a great man in a little world  he is the dispenser too of the squires charity which is bounteous and to do master simon justice he performs this part of his functions with great alacrity indeed i have been entertained with the mixture of bustle importance and kindheartedness which he displays he is of too vivacious a temperament to comfort the afflicted by sitting down moping and whining and blowing noses in concert but goes whisking about like a sparrow chirping consolation into every hole and corner of the village i have seen an old woman in a red cloak hold him for half an hour together with some long phthisical tale of distress which master simon listened to with many a bob of the head smack of his dogwhip and other symptoms of impatience though he afterwards made a most faithful and circumstantial report of the case to the squire i have watched him too during one of his pop visits into the cottage of a superannuated villager who is a pensioner of the squire where he fidgeted about the room without sitting down made many excellent offhand reflections with the old invalid who was propped up in his chair about the shortness of life the certainty of death and the necessity of preparing for that awful change quoted several texts of scripture very incorrectly but much to the edification of the cottagers wife and on coming out pinched the daughters rosy cheek and wondered what was in the young men that such a pretty face did not get a husband  he has also his cabinet counsellors in the village with whom he is very busy just now preparing for the mayday ceremonies among these is the village tailor a palefaced fellow that plays the clarionet in the church choir and being a great musical genius has frequent meetings of the band at his house where they make night hideous by their concerts he is in consequence high in favour with master simon and through his influence has the making or rather marring of all the liveries of the hall which generally look as though they had been cut out by one of those scientific tailors of the flying island of laputa who took measure of their customers with a quadrant the tailor in fact might rise to be one of the moneyed men of the village were he not rather too prone to gossip and keep holidays and give concerts and blow all his substance real and personal through his clarionet which literally keeps him poor both in body and estate he has for the present thrown by all his regular work and suffered the breeches of the village to go unmade and unmended while he is occupied in making garlands of partycoloured rags in imitation of flowers for the decoration of the maypole  another of master simons counsellors is the apothecary a short and rather fat man with a pair of prominent eyes that diverge like those of a lobster he is the village wise man very sententious and full of profound remarks on shallow subjects master simon often quotes his sayings and mentions him as rather an extraordinary man and even consults him occasionally in desperate cases of the dogs and horses indeed he seems to have been overwhelmed by the apothecarys philosophy which is exactly one observation deep consisting of indisputable maxims such as may be gathered from the mottoes of tobaccoboxes i had a specimen of his philosophy in my very first conversation with him in the course of which he observed with great solemnity and emphasis that man is a compound of wisdom and folly upon which master simon who had hold of my arm pressed very hard upon it and whispered in my ear thats a devilish shrewd remark     the schoolmaster    there will be no mosse stick to the stone of sisiphus no   grasse hang on the heeles of mercury no butter cleave on the   bread of a traveller for as the eagle at every flight loseth   a feather which maketh her bauld in her age so the traveller   in every country loseth some fleece which maketh him a beggar   in his youth by buying that for a pound which he cannot sell   again for a pennyrepentance    lillys euphues   among the worthies of the village that enjoy the peculiar confidence of master simon is one who has struck my fancy so much that i have thought him worthy of a separate notice it is slingsby the schoolmaster a thin elderly man rather threadbare and slovenly somewhat indolent in manner and with an easy goodhumoured look not often met with in his craft i have been interested in his favour by a few anecdotes which i have picked up concerning him  he is a native of the village and was a contemporary and playmate of readymoney jack in the days of their boyhood indeed they carried on a kind of league of mutual good offices slingsby was rather puny and withal somewhat of a coward but very apt at his learning jack on the contrary was a bullyboy out of doors but a sad laggard at his books slingsby helped jack therefore to all his lessons jack fought all slingsbys battles and they were inseparable friends this mutual kindness continued even after they left the school notwithstanding the dissimilarity of their characters jack took to ploughing and reaping and prepared himself to till his paternal acres while the other loitered negligently on in the path of learning until he penetrated even into the confines of latin and mathematics  in an unlucky hour however he took to reading voyages and travels and was smitten with a desire to see the world this desire increased upon him as he grew up so early one bright sunny morning he put all his effects in a knapsack slung it on his back took staff in hand and called in his way to take leave of his early schoolmate jack was just going out with the plough the friends shook hands over the farmhouse gate jack drove his team afield and slingsby whistled over the hills and far away and sallied forth gayly to seek his fortune  years and years passed by and young tom slingsby was forgotten when one mellow sunday afternoon in autumn a thin man somewhat advanced in life with a coat out at elbows a pair of old nankeen gaiters and a few things tied in a handkerchief and slung on the end of a stick was seen loitering through the village he appeared to regard several houses attentively to peer into the windows that were open to eye the villagers wistfully as they returned from church and then to pass some time in the churchyard reading the tombstones  at length he found his way to the farmhouse of readymoney jack but paused ere he attempted the wicket contemplating the picture of substantial independence before him in the porch of the house sat readymoney jack in his sunday dress with his hat upon his head his pipe in his mouth and his tankard before him the monarch of all he surveyed beside him lay his fat housedog the varied sounds of poultry were heard from the wellstocked farmyard the bees hummed from their hives in the garden the cattle lowed in the rich meadow while the crammed barns and ample stacks bore proof of an abundant harvest  the stranger opened the gate and advanced dubiously toward the house the mastiff growled at the sight of the suspiciouslooking intruder but was immediately silenced by his master who taking his pipe from his mouth awaited with inquiring aspect the address of this equivocal personage the stranger eyed old jack for a moment so portly in his dimensions and decked out in gorgeous apparel then cast a glance upon his own threadbare and starveling condition and the scanty bundle which he held in his hand then giving his shrunk waistcoat a twitch to make it meet its receding waistband and casting another look half sad half humorous at the sturdy yeoman i suppose said he mr tibbets you have forgot old times and old playmates  the latter gazed at him with scrutinizing look but acknowledged that he had no recollection of him  like enough like enough said the stranger every body seems to have forgotten poor slingsby  why no sure it cant be tom slingsby  yes but it is though replied the stranger shaking his head  readymoney jack was on his feet in a twinkling thrust out his hand gave his ancient crony the gripe of a giant and slapping the other hand on a bench sit down there cried he tom slingsby  a long conversation ensued about old times while slingsby was regaled with the best cheer that the farmhouse afforded for he was hungry as well as wayworn and had the keen appetite of a poor pedestrian the early playmates then talked over their subsequent lives and adventures jack had but little to relate and was never good at a long story a prosperous life passed at home has little incident for narrative it is only poor devils that are tossed about the world that are the true heroes of story jack had stuck by the paternal farm followed the same plough that his forefathers had driven and had waxed richer and richer as he grew older as to tom slingsby he was an exemplification of the old proverb a rolling stone gathers no moss he had sought his fortune about the world without ever finding it being a thing oftener found at home than abroad he had been in all kinds of situations and had learned a dozen different modes of making a living but had found his way back to his native village rather poorer than when he left it his knapsack having dwindled down to a scanty bundle  as luck would have it the squire was passing by the farmhouse that very evening and called there as is often his custom he found the two schoolmates still gossiping in the porch and according to the good old scottish song taking a cup of kindness yet for auld lang syne the squire was struck by the contrast in appearance and fortunes of these early playmates readymoney jack seated in lordly state surrounded by the good things of this life with golden guineas hanging to his very watchchain and the poor pilgrim slingsby thin as a weasel with all his worldly effects his bundle hat and walkingstaff lying on the ground beside him  the good squires heart warmed towards the luckless cosmopolite for he is a little prone to like such halfvagrant characters he cast about in his mind how he should contrive once more to anchor slingsby in his native village honest jack had already offered him a present shelter under his roof in spite of the hints and winks and half remonstrances of the shrewd dame tibbets but how to provide for his permanent maintenance was the question luckily the squire bethought himself that the village school was without a teacher a little further conversation convinced him that slingsby was as fit for that as for any thing else and in a day or two he was seen swaying the rod of empire in the very schoolhouse where he had often been horsed in the days of his boyhood  here he has remained for several years and being honoured by the countenance of the squire and the fast friendship of mr tibbets he has grown into much importance and consideration in the village i am told however that he still shows now and then a degree of restlessness and a disposition to rove abroad again and see a little more of the world an inclination which seems particularly to haunt him about springtime there is nothing so difficult to conquer as the vagrant humour when once it has been fully indulged  since i have heard these anecdotes of poor slingsby i have more than once mused upon the picture presented by him and his schoolmate readymoney jack on their coming together again after so long a separation it is difficult to determine between lots in life where each one is attended with its peculiar discontents he who never leaves his home repines at his monotonous existence and envies the traveller whose life is a constant tissue of wonder and adventure while he who is tossed about the world looks back with many a sigh to the safe and quiet shore which he has abandoned i cannot help thinking however that the man that stays at home and cultivates the comforts and pleasures daily springing up around him stands the best chance for happiness there is nothing so fascinating to a young mind as the idea of travelling and there is very witchcraft in the old phrase found in every nursery tale of going to seek ones fortune a continual change of place and change of object promises a continual succession of adventure and gratification of curiosity but there is a limit to all our enjoyments and every desire bears its death in its very gratification curiosity languishes under repeated stimulants novelties cease to excite surprise until at length we cannot wonder even at a miracle  he who has sallied forth into the world like poor slingsby full of sunny anticipations finds too soon how different the distant scene becomes when visited the smooth place roughens as he approaches the wild place becomes tame and barren the fairy tints that beguiled him on still fly to the distant hill or gather upon the land he has left behind and every part of the landscape seems greener than the spot he stands on     the school    but to come down from great men and higher matters to my   little children and poor schoolhouse again i will god   willing go forward orderly as i purposed to instruct children   and young men both for learning and manners    roger ascham   having given the reader a slight sketch of the village schoolmaster he may be curious to learn something concerning his school as the squire takes much interest in the education of the neighbouring children he put into the hands of the teacher on first installing him in office a copy of roger aschams schoolmaster and advised him moreover to con over that portion of old peacham which treats of the duty of masters and which condemns the favourite method of making boys wise by flagellation  he exhorted slingsby not to break down or depress the free spirit of the boys by harshness and slavish fear but to lead them freely and joyously on in the path of knowledge making it pleasant and desirable in their eyes he wished to see the youth trained up in the manners and habitudes of the peasantry of the good old times and thus to lay a foundation for the accomplishment of his favorite object the revival of old english customs and character he recommended that all the ancient holidays should be observed and that the sports of the boys in their hours of play should be regulated according to the standard authorities laid down in strutt a copy of whose invaluable work decorated with plates was deposited in the schoolhouse above all he exhorted the pedagogue to abstain from the use of birch an instrument of instruction which the good squire regards with abhorrence as fit only for the coercion of brute natures that cannot be reasoned with  mr slingsby has followed the squires instructions to the best of his disposition and abilities he never flogs the boys because he is too easy goodhumoured a creature to inflict pain on a worm he is bountiful in holidays because he loves holidays himself and has a sympathy with the urchins impatience of confinement from having divers times experienced its irksomeness during the time that he was seeing the world as to sports and pastimes the boys are faithfully exercised in all that are on record quoits races prisonbars tipcat trapball bandyball wrestling leaping and what not the only misfortune is that having banished the birch honest slingsby has not studied roger ascham sufficiently to find out a substitute or rather he has not the management in his nature to apply one his school therefore though one of the happiest is one of the most unruly in the country and never was a pedagogue more liked or less heeded by his disciples than slingsby  he has lately taken a coadjutor worthy of himself being another stray sheep that has returned to the village fold this is no other than the son of the musical tailor who had bestowed some cost upon his education hoping to see him one day arrive at the dignity of an exciseman or at least of a parish clerk the lad grew up however as idle and musical as his father and being captivated by the drum and fife of a recruiting party he followed them off to the army he returned not long since out of money and out at the elbows the prodigal son of the village he remained for some time lounging about the place in halftattered soldiers dress with a foragingcap on one side of his head jerking stones across the brook or loitering about the taverndoor a burthen to his father and regarded with great coldness by all warm householders  something however drew honest slingsby towards the youth it might be the kindness he bore to his father who is one of the schoolmasters great cronies it might be that secret sympathy which draws men of vagrant propensities towards each other for there is something truly magnetic in the vagabond feeling or it might be that he remembered the time when he himself had come back like this youngster a wreck to his native place at any rate whatever the motive slingsby drew towards the youth they had many conversations in the village taproom about foreign parts and the various scenes and places they had witnessed during their wayfaring about the world the more slingsby talked with him the more he found him to his taste and finding him almost as learned as himself he forthwith engaged him as an assistant or usher in the school under such admirable tuition the school as may be supposed flourishes apace and if the scholars do not become versed in all the holiday accomplishments of the good old times to the squires hearts content it will not be the fault of their teachers the prodigal son has become almost as popular among the boys as the pedagogue himself his instructions are not limited to school hours and having inherited the musical taste and talents of his father he has bitten the whole school with the mania he is a great hand at beating a drum which is often heard rumbling from the rear of the schoolhouse he is teaching half the boys of the village also to play the fife and the pandean pipes and they weary the whole neighbourhood with their vague pipings as they sit perched on stiles or loitering about the barndoors in the evenings among the other exercises of the school also he has introduced the ancient art of archery one of the squires favourite themes with such success that the whipsters roam in truant bands about the neighbourhood practising with their bows and arrows upon the birds of the air and the beasts of the field and not unfrequently making a foray into the squires domains to the great indignation of the gamekeepers in a word so completely are the ancient english customs and habits cultivated at this school that i should not be surprised if the squire should live to see one of his poetic visions realized and a brood reared up worthy successors to robin hood and his merry gang of outlaws     a village politician    i am a rogue if i do not think i was designed for the helm of   state i am so full of nimble stratagems that i should have   ordered affairs and carried it against the stream of a faction   with as much ease as a skipper would laver against the wind    the goblins   in one of my visits to the village with master simon he proposed that we should stop at the inn which he wished to show me as a specimen of a real country inn the headquarters of village gossips i had remarked it before in my perambulations about the place it has a deep oldfashioned porch leading into a large hall which serves for taproom and travellersroom having a wide fireplace with highbacked settles on each side where the wise men of the village gossip over their ale and hold their sessions during the long winter evenings the landlord is an easy indolent fellow shaped a little like one of his own beerbarrels and is apt to stand gossiping at his door with his wig on one side and his hands in his pockets whilst his wife and daughter attend to customers his wife however is fully competent to manage the establishment and indeed from long habitude rules over all the frequenters of the taproom as completely as if they were her dependants instead of her patrons not a veteran alebibber but pays homage to her having no doubt been often in her arrears i have already hinted that she is on very good terms with readymoney jack he was a sweetheart of hers in early life and has always countenanced the tavern on her account indeed he is quite the cock of the walk at the taproom  as we approached the inn we heard some one talking with great volubility and distinguished the ominous words taxes poors rates and agricultural distress it proved to be a thin loquacious fellow who had penned the landlord up in one corner of the porch with his hands in his pockets as usual listening with an air of the most vacant acquiescence  the sight seemed to have a curious effect on master simon as he squeezed my arm and altering his course sheered wide of the porch as though he had not had any idea of entering this evident evasion induced me to notice the orator more particularly he was meagre but active in his make with a long pale bilious face a black beard so illshaven as to bloody his shirtcollar a feverish eye and a hat sharpened up at the sides into a most pragmatical shape he had a newspaper in his hand and seemed to be commenting on its contents to the thorough conviction of mine host  at sight of master simon the landlord was evidently a little flurried and began to rub his hands edge away from his corner and make several profound publican bows while the orator took no other notice of my companion than to talk rather louder than before and with as i thought something of an air of defiance master simon however as i have before said sheered off from the porch and passed on pressing my arm within his and whispering as we got by in a tone of awe and horror thats a radical he reads cobbett  i endeavoured to get a more particular account of him from my companion but he seemed unwilling even to talk about him answering only in general terms that he was a cursed busy fellow that had a confounded trick of talking and was apt to bother one about the national debt and such nonsense from which i suspected that master simon had been rendered wary of him by some accidental encounter on the field of argument for these radicals are continually roving about in quest of wordy warfare and never so happy as when they can tilt a gentleman logician out of his saddle  on subsequent inquiry my suspicions have been confirmed i find the radical has but recently found his way into the village where he threatens to commit fearful devastations with his doctrines he has already made two or three complete converts or new lights has shaken the faith of several others and has grievously puzzled the brains of many of the oldest villagers who had never thought about politics or scarce any thing else during their whole lives  he is lean and meagre from the constant restlessness of mind and body worrying about with newspapers and pamphlets in his pockets which he is ready to pull out on all occasions he has shocked several of the staunchest villagers by talking lightly of the squire and his family and hinting that it would be better the park should be cut into small farms and kitchengardens or feed good mutton instead of worthless deer  he is a great thorn in the side of the squire who is sadly afraid that he will introduce politics into the village and turn it into an unhappy thinking community he is a still greater grievance to master simon who has hitherto been able to sway the political opinions of the place without much cost of learning or logic but has been much puzzled of late to weed out the doubts and heresies already sown by this champion of reform  indeed the latter has taken complete command at the taproom of the tavern not so much because he has convinced as because he has outtalked all the oldestablished oracles the apothecary with all his philosophy was as nought before him he has convinced and converted the landlord at least a dozen times who however is liable to be convinced and converted the other way by the next person with whom he talks it is true the radical has a violent antagonist in the landlady who is vehemently loyal and thoroughly devoted to the king master simon and the squire she now and then comes out upon the reformer with all the fierceness of a catomountain and does not spare her own softheaded husband for listening to what she terms such lowlived politics what makes the good woman the more violent is the perfect coolness with which the radical listens to her attacks drawing his face up into a provoking supercilious smile and when she has talked herself out of breath quietly asking her for a taste of her homebrewed  the only person that is in any way a match for this redoubtable politician is readymoney jack tibbets who maintains his stand in the taproom in defiance of the radical and all his works jack is one of the most loyal men in the country without being able to reason about the matter he has that admirable quality for a tough arguer also that he never knows when he is beat he has halfadozen old maxims which he advances on all occasions and though his antagonist may overturn them never so often yet he always brings them anew to the field he is like the robber in ariosto who though his head might be cut off halfahundred times yet whipped it on his shoulders again in a twinkling and returned as sound a man as ever to the charge  whatever does not square with jacks simple and obvious creed he sets down for french politics for notwithstanding the peace he cannot be persuaded that the french are not still laying plots to ruin the nation and to get hold of the bank of england the radical attempted to overwhelm him one day by a long passage from a newspaper but jack neither reads nor believes in newspapers in reply he gave him one of the stanzas which he has by heart from his favourite and indeed only author old tusser and which he calls his golden rules    leave princes affairs undescanted on   and tend to such doings as stand thee upon   fear god and offend not the king nor his laws   and keep thyself out of the magistrates claws  when tibbets had pronounced this with great emphasis he pulled out a wellfilled leathern purse took out a handful of gold and silverpaid his score at the bar with great punctuality returned his money piece by piece into his purse his purse into his pocket which he buttoned up and then giving his cudgel a stout thump upon the floor and bidding the radical goodmorning sir with the tone of a man who conceives he has completely done for his antagonist he walked with lionlike gravity out of the house two or three of jacks admirers who were present and had been afraid to take the field themselves looked upon this as a perfect triumph and winked at each other when the radicals back was turned ay ay said mine host as soon as the radical was out of hearing let old jack alone ill warrant hell give him his own     the rookery    but cawing rooks and kites that swim sublime   in still repeated circles screaming loud   the jay the pie and een the boding owl   that hails the rising moon have charms for me    cowper   in a grove of tall oaks and beeches that crowns a terracewalk just on the skirts of the garden is an ancient rookery which is one of the most important provinces in the squires rural domains the old gentleman sets great store by his rooks and will not suffer one of them to be killed in consequence of which they have increased amazingly the treetops are loaded with their nests they have encroached upon the great avenue and have even established in times long past a colony among the elms and pines of the churchyard which like other distant colonies has already thrown off allegiance to the mother country  the rooks are looked up by the squire as a very ancient and honourable line of gentry highly aristocratical in their notions fond of place and attached to church and state as their building so loftily keeping about churches and cathedrals and in the venerable groves of old castles and manorhouses sufficiently manifests the good opinion thus expressed by the squire put me upon observing more narrowly these very respectable birds for i confess to my shame i had been apt to confound them with their cousinsgerman the crows to whom at the first glance they bear so great a family resemblance nothing it seems could be more unjust or injurious than such a mistake the rooks and crows are among the feathered tribes what the spaniards and portuguese are among nations the least loving in consequence of their neighbourhood and similarity the rooks are old established housekeepers highminded gentlefolk that have had their hereditary abodes time out of mind but as to the poor crows they are a kind of vagabond predatory gipsy race roving about the country without any settled home their hands are against every body and every bodys against them and they are gibbeted in every cornfield master simon assures me that a female rook that should so far forget herself as to consort with a crow would inevitably be disinherited and indeed would he totally discarded by all her genteel acquaintance  the squire is very watchful over the interests and concerns of his sable neighbours as to master simon he even pretends to know many of them by sight and to have given names to them he points out several which he says are old heads of families and compares them to worthy old citizens beforehand in the world that wear cocked hats and silver buckles in their shoes notwithstanding the protecting benevolence of the squire and their being residents in his empire they seem to acknowledge no allegiance and to hold no intercourse or intimacy their airy tenements are built almost out of the reach of gunshot and notwithstanding their vicinity to the hall they maintain a most reserved and distrustful shyness of mankind  there is one season of the year however which brings all birds in a manner to a level and tames the pride of the loftiest highflyerwhich is the season of building their nests this takes place early in the spring when the forest trees first begin to show their buds the long withy ends of the branches to turn green when the wild strawberry and other herbage of the sheltered woodlands put forth their tender and tinted leaves and the daisy and the primrose peep from under the hedges at this time there is a general bustle among the feathered tribes an incessant fluttering about and a cheerful chirping indicative like the germination of the vegetable world of the reviving life and fecundity of the year  it is then that the rooks forget their usual stateliness and their shy and lofty habits instead of keeping up in the high regions of the air swinging on the breezy treetops and looking down with sovereign contempt upon the humble crawlers upon earth they are fain to throw off for a time the dignity of the gentleman to come down to the ground and put on the painstaking and industrious character of a labourer they now lose their natural shyness become fearless and familiar and may be seen plying about in all directions with an air of great assiduity in search of building materials every now and then your path will be crossed by one of these busy old gentlemen worrying about with awkward gait as if troubled with the gout or with corns on his toes casting about many a prying look turning down first one eye then the other in earnest consideration upon every straw he meets with until espying some mighty twig large enough to make a rafter for his aircastle he will seize upon it with avidity and hurry away with it to the treetop fearing apparently lest you should dispute with him the invaluable prize  like other castlebuilders these airy architects seem rather fanciful in the materials with which they build and to like those most which come from a distance thus though there are abundance of dry twigs on the surrounding trees yet they never think of making use of them but go foraging in distant lands and come sailing home one by one from the ends of the earth each bearing in his bill some precious piece of timber  nor must i avoid mentioning what i grieve to say rather derogates from the grave and honourable character of these ancient gentlefolk that during the architectural season they are subject to great dissensions among themselves that they make no scruple to defraud and plunder each other and that sometimes the rookery is a scene of hideous brawl and commotion in consequence of some delinquency of the kind one of the partners generally remains on the nest to guard it from depredation and i have seen severe contests when some sly neighbour has endeavoured to filch away a tempting rafter that has captivated his eye as i am not willing to admit any suspicion hastily that should throw a stigma on the general character of so worshipful a people i am inclined to think that these larcenies are very much discountenanced by the higher classes and even rigorously punished by those in authority for i have now and then seen a whole gang of rooks fall upon the nest of some individual pull it all to pieces carry off the spoils and even buffet the luckless proprietor i have concluded this to be some signal punishment inflicted upon him by the officers of the police for some pilfering misdemeanour or perhaps that it was a crew of bailiffs carrying an execution into his house  i have been amused with another of their movements during the building season the steward has suffered a considerable number of sheep to graze on a lawn near the house somewhat to the annoyance of the squire who thinks this an innovation on the dignity of a park which ought to be devoted to deer only be this as it may there is a green knoll not far from the drawingroom window where the ewes and lambs are accustomed to assemble towards evening for the benefit of the setting sun no sooner were they gathered here at the time when these politic birds were building than a stately old rook who master simon assured me was the chief magistrate of this community would settle down upon the head of one of the ewes who seeming conscious of this condescension would desist from grazing and stand fixed in motionless reverence of her august burthen the rest of the rookery would then come wheeling down in imitation of their leader until every ewe had two or three of them cawing and fluttering and battling upon her back whether they requited the submission of the sheep by levying a contribution upon their fleece for the benefit of the rookery i am not certain though i presume they followed the usual custom of protecting powers  the latter part of may is the time of great tribulation among the rookeries when the young are just able to leave their nests and balance themselves on the neighbouring branches now comes on the season of rook shooting a terrible slaughter of the innocents the squire of course prohibits all invasion of the kind on his territories but i am told that a lamentable havoc takes place in the colony about the old church upon this devoted commonwealth the village charges with all its chivalry every idle wight that is lucky enough to possess an old gun or blunderbuss together with all the archery of slingsbys school take the field on the occasion in vain does the little parson interfere or remonstrate in angry tones from his study window that looks into the churchyard there is a continual popping from morning till night being no great marksmen their shots are not often effective but every now and then a great shout from the besieging army of bumpkins makes known the downfall of some unlucky squab rook which comes to the ground with the emphasis of a squashed appledumpling  nor is the rookery entirely free from other troubles and disasters in so aristocratical and loftyminded a community which boasts so much ancient blood and hereditary pride it is natural to suppose that questions of etiquette will sometimes arise and affairs of honour ensue in fact this is very often the case bitter quarrels break out between individuals which produce sad scufflings on treetops and i have more than once seen a regular duel take place between two doughty heroes of the rookery their field of battle is generally the air and their contest is managed in the most scientific and elegant manner wheeling round and round each other and towering higher and higher to get the vantageground until they sometimes disappear in the clouds before the combat is determined  they have also fierce combats now and then with an invading hawk and will drive him off from their territories by a posse comitatus they are also extremely tenacious of their domains and will suffer no other bird to inhabit the grove or its vicinity there was a very ancient and respectable old bachelor owl that had long had his lodgings in a corner of the grove but has been fairly ejected by the rooks and has retired disgusted with the world to a neighbouring wood where he leads the life of a hermit and makes nightly complaints of his illtreatment  the hootings of this unhappy gentleman may generally be heard in the still evenings when the rooks are all at rest and i have often listened to them of a moonlight night with a kind of mysterious gratification this graybearded misanthrope of course is highly respected by the squire but the servants have superstitious notions about him and it would be difficult to get the dairymaid to venture after dark near to the wood which he inhabits  beside the private quarrels of the rooks there are other misfortunes to which they are liable and which often bring distress into the most respectable families of the rookery having the true baronial spirit of the good old feudal times they are apt now and then to issue forth from their castles on a foray and to lay the plebeian fields of the neighbouring country under contribution in the course of which chivalrous expeditions they now and then get a shot from the rusty artillery of some refractory farmer occasionally too while they are quietly taking the air beyond the park boundaries they have the incaution to come within the reach of the truant bowman of slingsbys school and receive a flight shot from some unlucky urchins arrow in such case the wounded adventurer will sometimes have just strength enough to bring himself home and giving up the ghost at the rookery will hang dangling all abroad on a bough like a thief on a gibbetan awful warning to his friends and an object of great commiseration to the squire  but maugre all these untoward incidents the rooks have upon the whole a happy holiday life of it when their young are reared and fairly launched upon their native element the air the cares of the old folks seem over and they resume all their aristocratical dignity and idleness i have envied them the enjoyment which they appear to have in their ethereal heights sporting with clamorous exultation about their lofty bowers sometimes hovering over them sometimes partially alighting upon the topmost branches and there balancing with outstretched wings and swinging in the breeze sometimes they seem to take a fashionable drive to the church and amuse themselves by circling in airy rings about its spire at other times a mere garrison is left at home to mount guard in their stronghold at the grove while the rest roam abroad to enjoy the fine weather about sunset the garrison gives notice of their return their faint cawing will be heard from a great distance and they will be seen far off like a sable cloud and then nearer and nearer until they all come soaring home then they perform several grand circuits in the air over the hall and garden wheeling closer and closer until they gradually settle down when a prodigious cawing takes place as though they were relating their days adventures  i like at such times to walk about these dusky groves and hear the various sounds of these airy people roosted so high above me as the gloom increases their conversation subsides and they seem to be gradually dropping asleep but every now and then there is a querulous note as if some one was quarrelling for a pillow or a little more of the blanket it is late in the evening before they completely sink to repose and then their old anchorite neighbour the owl begins his lonely hooting from his bachelorshall in the wood     mayday    it is the choice time of the year   for the violets now appear   now the rose receives its birth   and pretty primrose decks the earth     then to the maypole come away     for it is now a holiday    acteon and diana   as i was lying in bed this morning enjoying one of those half dreams half reveries which are so pleasant in the country when the birds are singing about the window and the sunbeams peeping through the curtains i was roused by the sound of music on going downstairs i found a number of villagers dressed in their holiday clothes bearing a pole ornamented with garlands and ribands and accompanied by the village band of music under the direction of the tailor the pale fellow who plays on the clarionet they had all sprigs of hawthorn or as it is called the may in their hats and had brought green branches and flowers to decorate the hall door and windows they had come to give notice that the maypole was reared on the green and to invite the household to witness the sports the hall according to custom became a scene of hurry and delighted confusion the servants were all agog with may and music and there was no keeping either the tongues or the feet of the maids quiet who were anticipating the sports of the green and the evening dance  i repaired to the village at an early hour to enjoy the merrymaking the morning was pure and sunny such as a may morning is always described the fields were white with daisies the hawthorn was covered with its fragrant blossoms the bee hummed about every bank and the swallow played high in the air about the village steeple it was one of those genial days when we seem to draw in pleasure with the very air we breathe and to feel happy we know not why whoever has felt the worth of worthy man or has doted on lovely woman will on such a day call them tenderly to mind and feel his heart all alive with longburied recollections for thenne says the excellent romance of king arthur lovers call ageyne to their mynde old gentilnes and old servyse and many kind dedes that were forgotten by neglygence  before reaching the village i saw the maypole towering above the cottages with its gay garlands and streamers and heard the sound of music i found that there had been booths set up near it for the reception of company and a bower of green branches and flowers for the queen of may a fresh rosycheeked girl of the village  a band of morrisdancers were capering on the green in their fantastic dresses jingling with hawks bells with a boy dressed up as maid marian and the attendant fool rattling his box to collect contributions from the bystanders the gipsywomen too were already plying their mystery in bycorners of the village reading the hands of the simple country girls and no doubt promising them all good husbands and tribes of children  the squire made his appearance in the course of the morning attended by the parson and was received with loud acclamations he mingled among the country people throughout the day giving and receiving pleasure wherever he went the amusements of the day were under the management of slingsby the schoolmaster who is not merely lord of misrule in his school but master of the revels to the village he was bustling about with the perplexed and anxious air of a man who has the oppressive burthen of promoting other peoples merriment upon his mind he had involved himself in a dozen scrapes in consequence of a politic intrigue which bytheby master simon and the oxonian were at the bottom of which had for object the election of the queen of may he had met with violent opposition from a faction of aledrinkers who were in favour of a bouncing barmaid the daughter of the innkeeper but he had been too strongly backed not to carry his point though it shows that these rural crowns like all others are objects of great ambition and heartburning i am told that master simon takes great interest though in an underhand way in the election of these mayday queens and that the chaplet is generally secured for some rustic beauty that has found favour in his eyes  in the course of the day there were various games of strength and agility on the green at which a knot of village veterans presided as judges of the lists among these i perceived that readymoney jack took the lead looking with a learned and critical eye on the merits of the different candidates and though he was very laconic and sometimes merely expressed himself by a nod yet it was evident that his opinions far outweighed those of the most loquacious  young jack tibbets was the hero of the day and carried off most of the prizes though in some of the feats of agility he was rivalled by the prodigal son who appeared much in his element on this occasion but his most formidable competitor was the notorious gipsy the redoubtable starlight tom i was rejoiced at having an opportunity of seeing this minion of the moon in broad daylight i found him a tall swarthy goodlooking fellow with a lofty air something like what i have seen in an indian chieftain and with a certain lounging easy and almost graceful carriage which i have often remarked in beings of the lazzaroni order that lead an idle loitering life and have a gentlemanlike contempt of labour  master simon and the old general reconnoitred the ground together and indulged a vast deal of harmless raking among the buxom country girls master simon would give some of them a kiss on meeting with them and would ask after their sisters for he is acquainted with most of the farmers families sometimes he would whisper and affect to talk mischievously with them and if bantered on the subject would turn it off with a laugh though it was evident he liked to be suspected of being a gay lothario amongst them  he had much to say to the farmers about their farms and seemed to know all their horses by name there was an old fellow with round ruddy face and a nightcap under his hat the village wit who took several occasions to crack a joke with him in the hearing of his companions to whom he would turn and wink hard when master simon had passed  the harmony of the day however had nearly at one time been interrupted by the appearance of the radical on the ground with two or three of his disciples he soon got engaged in argument in the very thick of the throng above which i could hear his voice and now and then see his meagre hand half a mile out of the sleeve elevated in the air in violent gesticulation and flourishing a pamphlet by way of truncheon he was decrying these idle nonsensical amusements in time of public distress when it was every ones business to think of other matters and to be miserable the honest village logicians could make no stand against him especially as he was seconded by his proselytes when to their great joy master simon and the general came drifting down into the field of action i saw that master simon was for making off as soon as he found himself in the neighbourhood of this fireship but the general was too loyal to suffer such talk in his hearing and thought no doubt that a look and a word from a gentleman would be sufficient to shut up so shabby an orator the latter however was no respecter of persons but rather seemed to exult in having such important antagonists he talked with greater volubility than ever and soon drowned them in declamation on the subject of taxes poors rates and the national debt master simon endeavoured to brush along in his usual excursive manner which had always answered amazingly well with the villagers but the radical was one of those pestilent fellows that pin a man down to facts and indeed he had two or three pamphlets in his pocket to support every thing he advanced by printed documents the general too found himself betrayed into a more serious action than his dignity could brook and looked like a mighty dutch indiaman grievously peppered by a petty privateer it was in vain that he swelled and looked big and talked large and endeavoured to make up by pomp of manner for poverty of matter every homethrust of the radical made him wheeze like a bellows and seemed to let a volume of wind out of him  in a word the two worthies from the hall were completely dumbfounded and this too in the presence of several of master simons staunch admirers who had always looked up to him as infallible i do not know how he and the general would have managed to draw their forces decently from the field had there not been a match at grinning through a horsecollar announced whereupon the radical retired with great expression of contempt and as soon as his back was turned the argument was carried against him all hollow  did you ever hear such a pack of stuff general said master simon theres no talking with one of these chaps when he once gets that confounded cobbett in his head  sblood sir said the general wiping his forehead such fellows ought all to be transported  in the latter part of the day the ladies from the hall paid a visit to the green the fair julia made her appearance leaning on her lovers arm and looking extremely pale and interesting as she is a great favourite in the village where she has been known from childhood and as her late accident had been much talked about the sight of her caused very manifest delight and some of the old women of the village blessed her sweet face as she passed  while they were walking about i noticed the schoolmaster in earnest conversation with the young girl that represented the queen of may evidently endeavouring to spirit her up to some formidable undertaking at length as the party from the hall approached her bower she came forth faltering at every step until she reached the spot where the fair julia stood between her lover and lady lillycraft the little queen then took the chaplet of flowers from her head and attempted to put it on that of the bride elect but the confusion of both was so great that the wreath would have fallen to the ground had not the officer caught it and laughing placed it upon the blushing brows of his mistress there was something charming in the very embarrassment of these two young creatures both so beautiful yet so different in their kinds of beauty master simon told me afterwards that the queen of may was to have spoken a few verses which the schoolmaster had written for her but that she had neither wit to understand nor memory to recollect them besides added he between you and i she murders the kings english abominably so she has acted the part of a wise woman in holding her tongue and trusting to her pretty face  among the other characters from the hall was mrs hannah my lady lillycrafts gentlewoman to my surprise she was escorted by old christy the huntsman and followed by his ghost of a grayhound but i find they are very old acquaintances being drawn together by some sympathy of disposition mrs hannah moved about with starched dignity among the rustics who drew back from her with more awe than they did from her mistress her mouth seemed shut as with a clasp excepting that i now and then heard the word fellows escape from between her lips as she got accidentally jostled in the crowd  but there was one other heart present that did not enter into the merriment of the scene which was that of the simple phoebe wilkins the housekeepers niece the poor girl has continued to pine and whine for some time past in consequence of the obstinate coldness of her lover never was a little flirtation more severely punished she appeared this day on the green gallanted by a smart servant out of livery and had evidently resolved to try the hazardous experiment of awakening the jealousy of her lover she was dressed in her very best affected an air of great gayety talked loud and girlishly and laughed when there was nothing to laugh at there was however an aching heavy heart in the poor baggages bosom in spite of all her levity her eye turned every now and then in quest of her reckless lover and her cheek grew pale and her fictitious gayety vanished on seeing him paying his rustic homage to the little mayday queen  my attention was now diverted by a fresh stir and bustle music was heard from a distance a banner was seen advancing up the road preceded by a rustic band playing something like a march and followed by a sturdy throng of country lads the chivalry of a neighbouring and rival village  no sooner had they reached the green than they challenged the heroes of the day to new trials of strength and activity several gymnastic contests ensued for the honour of the respective villages in the course of these exercises young tibbets and the champion of the adverse party had an obstinate match at wrestling they tugged and strained and panted without either getting the mastery until both came to the ground and rolled upon the green just then the disconsolate phoebe came by she saw her recreant lover in fierce contest as she thought and in danger in a moment pride pique and coquetry were forgotten she rushed into the ring seized upon the rival champion by the hair and was on the point of wreaking on him her puny vengeance when a buxom strapping country lass the sweetheart of the prostrate swain pounced upon her like a hawk and would have stripped her of her fine plumage in a twinkling had she also not been seized in her turn  a complete tumult ensued the chivalry of the two villages became embroiled blows began to be dealt and sticks to be flourished phoebe was carried off from the field in hysterics  in vain did the sages of the village interfere the sententious apothecary endeavoured to pour the soothing oil of his philosophy upon this tempestuous sea of passion but was tumbled into the dust slingsby the pedagogue who is a great lover of peace went into the midst of the throng as marshal of the day to put an end to the commotion but was rent in twain and came out with his garment hanging in two strips from his shoulders upon which the prodigal son dashed in with fury to revenge the insult which his patron had sustained the tumult thickened i caught glimpses of the jockeycap of old christy like the helmet of a chieftain bobbing about in the midst of the scuffle whilst mistress hannah separated from her doughty protector was squalling and striking at right and left with a faded parasol being tossed and tousled about by the crowd in such wise as never happened to maiden gentle woman before  at length i beheld old readymoney jack making his way into the very thickest of the throng tearing it as it were apart and enforcing peace vi et armis it was surprising to see the sudden quiet that ensued the storm settled down at once into tranquillity the parties having no real grounds of hostility were readily pacified and in fact were a little at a loss to know why and how they had got by the ears slingsby was speedily stitched together again by his friend the tailor and resumed his usual goodhumour mrs hannah drew on one side to plume her rumpled feathers and old christy having repaired his damages took her under his arm and they swept back again to the hall ten times more bitter against mankind than ever  the tibbets family alone seemed slow in recovering from the agitation of the scene young jack was evidently very much moved by the heroism of the unlucky phoebe his mother who had been summoned to the field of action by news of the affray was in a sad panic and had need of all her management to keep him from following his mistress and coming to a perfect reconciliation  what heightened the alarm and perplexity of the good managing dame was that the matter had aroused the slow apprehension of old readymoney himself who was very much struck by the intrepid interference of so pretty and delicate a girl and was sadly puzzled to understand the meaning of the violent agitation in his family  when all this came to the ears of the squire he was grievously scandalized that his mayday fête should have been disgraced by such a brawl he ordered phoebe to appear before him but the girl was so frightened and distressed that she came sobbing and trembling and at the first question he asked fell again into hysterics lady lillycraft who had understood that there was an affair of the heart at the bottom of this distress immediately took the girl into great favour and protection and made her peace with the squire  this was the only thing that disturbed the harmony of the day if we except the discomfiture of master simon and the general by the radical upon the whole therefore the squire had very fair reason to be satisfied that he had ridden his hobby throughout the day without any other molestation  the reader learned in these matters will perceive that all this was but a faint shadow of the once gay and fanciful rites of may the peasantry have lost the proper feeling for these rites and have grown almost as strange to them as the boom of la mancha were to the customs of chivalry in the days of the valorous don quixote indeed i considered it a proof of the discretion with which the squire rides his hobby that he had not pushed the thing any farther nor attempted to revive many obsolete usages of the day which in the present matteroffact times would appear affected and absurd i must say though i do it under the rose the general brawl in which this festival had nearly terminated has made me doubt whether these rural customs of the good old times were always so very loving and innocent as we are apt to fancy them and whether the peasantry in those times were really so arcadian as they have been fondly represented i begin to fear    those days were never airy dream   sat for the picture and the poets hand   imparting substance to an empty shade   imposed a gay delirium for a truth   grant it i still must envy them an age   that favourd such a dream     the manuscript   yesterday was a day of quiet and repose after the bustle of mayday during the morning i joined the ladies in a small sittingroom the windows of which came down to the floor and opened upon a terrace of the garden which was set out with delicate shrubs and flowers the soft sunshine that fell into the room through the branches of trees that overhung the windows the sweet smell of the flowers and the singing of the birds seemed to produce a pleasing yet calming effect on the whole party for some time elapsed without any one speaking lady lillycraft and miss templeton were sitting by an elegant worktable near one of the windows occupied with some pretty ladylike work the captain was on a stool at his mistress feet looking over some music and poor phoebe wilkins who has always been a kind of pet among the ladies but who has risen vastly in favour with lady lillycraft in consequence of some tender confessions sat in one corner of the room with swoln eyes working pensively at some of the fair julias wedding ornaments  the silence was interrupted by her ladyship who suddenly proposed a task to the captain i am in your debt said she for that tale you read to us the other day i will now furnish one in return if youll read it and it is just suited to this sweet may morning for it is all about love  the proposition seemed to delight every one present the captain smiled assent her ladyship rung for her page and despatched him to her room for the manuscript as the captain said she gave us an account of the author of his story it is but right i should give one of mine it was written by the parson of the parish where i reside he is a thin elderly man of a delicate constitution but positively one of the most charming men that ever lived he lost his wife a few years since one of the sweetest women you ever saw he has two sons whom he educates himself both of whom already write delightful poetry his parsonage is a lovely place close by the church all overrun with ivy and honeysuckles with the sweetest flowergarden about it for you know our country clergymen are almost always fond of flowers and make their parsonages perfect pictures  his living is a very good one and he is very much beloved and does a great deal of good in the neighbourhood and among the poor and then such sermons as he preaches oh if you could only hear one taken from a text in solomons song all about love and matrimony one of the sweetest things you ever heard he preaches it at least once a year in springtime for he knows i am fond of it he always dines with me on sundays and often brings me some of the sweetest pieces of poetry all about the pleasures of melancholy and such subjects that make me cry so you cant think i wish he would publish i think he has some things as sweet as any thing of moore or lord byron  he fell into very ill health some time ago and was advised to go to the continent and i gave him no peace until he went and promised to take care of his two boys until he returned  he was gone for above a year and was quite restored when he came back he sent me the tale im going to show youoh here it is said she as the page put in her hands a beautiful box of satinwood she unlocked it and from among several parcels of notes on embossed paper cards of charades and copies of verses she drew out a crimson velvet case that smelt very much of perfumes from this she took a manuscript daintily written on giltedged vellum paper and stitched a light blue riband this she handed to the captain who read the following tale which i have procured for the entertainment of the reader     annette delarbre    the soldier frae the war returns   and the merchant from the main   but i hae parted with my love   and neer to meet again                 my dear   and neer to meet again   when day is gone and night is come   and a are boun to sleep   i think on them thats far awa   the leelang night and weep                 my dear   the leelang night and weep    old scotch ballad   in the course of a tour that i once made in lower normandy i remained for a day or two at the old town of honfleur which stands near the mouth of the seine it was the time of a fête and all the world was thronging in the evening to dance at the fair held before the chapel of our lady of grace as i like all kinds of innocent merrymaking i joined the throng  the chapel is situated at the top of a high hill or promontory from whence its bell may be heard at a distance by the mariner at night it is said to have given the name to the port of havredegrace which lies directly opposite on the other side of the seine the road up to the chapel went in a zigzag course along the brow of the steep coast it was shaded by trees from between which i had beautiful peeps at the ancient towers of honfleur below the varied scenery of the opposite shore the white buildings of havre in the distance and the wide sea beyond the road was enlivened by groups of peasant girls in their bright crimson dresses and tall caps and i found all the flower of the neighbourhood assembled on the green that crowns the summit of the hill  the chapel of notre dame de grace is a favourite resort of the inhabitants of honfleur and its vicinity both for pleasure and devotion at this little chapel prayers are put up by the mariners of the port previous to their voyages and by their friends during their absence and votive offerings are hung about its walls in fulfilment of vows made during times of shipwreck and disaster the chapel is surrounded by trees over the portal is an image of the virgin and child with an inscription which struck me as being quite poetical    etoile de la mer priez pour nous   star of the sea pray for us  on a level spot near the chapel under a grove of noble trees the populace dance on fine summer evenings and here are held frequent fairs and fêtes which assemble all the rustic beauty of the loveliest parts of lower normandy the present was an occasion of the kind booths and tents were erected among the trees there were the usual displays of finery to tempt the rural coquette and of wonderful shows to entice the curious mountebanks were exerting their eloquence jugglers and fortunetellers astonishing the credulous while whole rows of grotesque saints in wood and waxwork were offered for the purchase of the pious  the fête had assembled in one view all the picturesque costumes of the pays dauge and the coté de caux i beheld tall stately caps and trim bodices according to fashions which have been handed down from mother to daughter for centuries the exact counterparts of those worn in the time of the conqueror and which surprised me by their faithful resemblance to those which i had seen in the old pictures of froissarts chronicles and in the paintings of illuminated manuscripts any one also that has been in lower normandy must have remarked the beauty of the peasantry and that air of native elegance that prevails among them it is to this country undoubtedly that the english owe their good looks it was from hence that the bright carnation the fine blue eye the light auburn hair passed over to england in the train of the conqueror and filled the land with beauty  the scene before me was perfectly enchanting the assemblage of so many fresh and blooming faces the gay groups in fanciful dresses some dancing on the green others strolling about or seated on the grass the fine clumps of trees in the foreground bordering the brow of this airy height and the broad green sea sleeping in summer tranquillity in the distance  whilst i was regarding this animated picture i was struck with the appearance of a beautiful girl who passed through the crowd without seeming to take any interest in their amusements she was slender and delicate in her form she had not the bloom upon her cheek that is usual among the peasantry of normandy and her blue eyes had a singular and melancholy expression she was accompanied by a venerablelooking man whom i presumed to be her father there was a whisper among the bystanders and a wistful look after her as she passed the young men touched their hats and some of the children followed her at a little distance watching her movements she approached the edge of the hill where there is a little platform from whence the people of honfleur look out for the approach of vessels here she stood for some time waving her handkerchief though there was nothing to be seen but two or three fishingboats like mere specks on the bosom of the distant ocean  these circumstances excited my curiosity and i made some inquiries about her which were answered with readiness and intelligence by a priest of the neighbouring chapel our conversation drew together several of the bystanders each of whom had something to communicate and from them all i gathered the following particulars  annette delarbre was the only daughter of one of the higher order of farmers or small proprietors as they are called who lived at pont leveque a pleasant village not far from honfleur in that rich pastoral part of lower normandy called the pays dauge annette was the pride and delight of her parents and was brought up with the fondest indulgence she was gay tender petulant and susceptible all her feelings were quick and ardent and having never experienced contradiction or restraint she was little practised in selfcontrol nothing but the native goodness of her heart kept her from running continually into error  even while a child her susceptibility was evinced in an attachment which she formed to a playmate eugene la forgue the only son of a widow who lived in the neighbourhood their childish love was an epitome of maturer passion it had its caprices and jealousies and quarrels and reconciliations it was assuming something of a graver character as annette entered her fifteenth and eugene his nineteenth year when he was suddenly carried off to the army by the conscription  it was a heavy blow to his widowed mother for he was her only pride and comfort but it was one of those sudden bereavements which mothers were perpetually doomed to feel in france during the time that continual and bloody wars were incessantly draining her youth it was a temporary affliction also to annette to lose her lover with tender embraces half childish half womanish she parted from him the tears streamed from her blue eyes as she bound a braid of her fair hair round his wrist but the smiles still broke through for she was yet too young to feel how serious a thing is separation and how many chances there are when parting in this wide world against our ever meeting again  weeks months years flew by annette increased in beauty as she increased in years and was the reigning belle of the neighbourhood her time passed innocently and happily her father was a man of some consequence in the rural community and his house was the resort of the gayest of the village annette held a kind of rural court she was always surrounded by companions of her own age among whom she alone unrivalled much of their time was passed in making lace the prevalent manufacture of the neighbourhood as they sat at this delicate and feminine labour the merry tale and sprightly song went round none laughed with a lighter heart than annette and if she sang her voice was perfect melody their evenings were enlivened by the dance or by those pleasant social games so prevalent among the french and when she appeared at the village ball on sunday evenings she was the theme of universal admiration  as she was a rural heiress she did not want for suitors many advantageous offers were made her but she refused them all she laughed at the pretended pangs of her admirers and triumphed over them with the caprice of buoyant youth and conscious beauty with all her apparent levity however could any one have read the story of her heart they might have traced in it some fond remembrance of her early playmate not so deeply graven as to be painful but too deep to be easily obliterated and they might have noticed amidst all her gayety the tenderness that marked her manner towards the mother of eugene she would often steal away from her youthful companions and their amusements to pass whole days with the good widow listening to her fond talk about her boy and blushing with secret pleasure when his letters were read at finding herself a constant theme of recollection and inquiry  at length the sudden return of peace which sent many a warrior to his native cottage brought back eugene a young sunburnt soldier to the village i need not say how rapturously his return was greeted by his mother who saw in him the pride and staff of her old age he had risen in the service by his merits but brought away little from the wars excepting a soldierlike air a gallant name and a scar across the forehead he brought back however a nature unspoiled by the camp he was frank open generous and ardent his heart was quick and kind in its impulses and was perhaps a little softer from having suffered it was full of tenderness for annette he had received frequent accounts of her from his mother and the mention of her kindness to his lonely parent had rendered her doubly dear to him he had been wounded he had been a prisoner he had been in various troubles but had always preserved the braid of her hair which she had bound round his arm it had been a kind of talisman to him he had many a time looked upon it as he lay on the hard ground and the thought that he might one day see annette again and the fair fields about his native village had cheered his heart and enabled him to bear up against every hardship  he had left annette almost a childhe found her a blooming woman if he had loved her before he now adored her annette was equally struck with the improvement which time had made in her lover she noticed with secret admiration his superiority to the other young men of the village the frank lofty military air that distinguished him from all the rest at their rural gatherings the more she saw him the more her light playful fondness of former years deepened into ardent and powerful affection but annette was a rural belle  she had tasted the sweets of dominion and had been rendered wilful and capricious by constant indulgence at home and admiration abroad she was conscious of her power over eugene and delighted in exercising it she sometimes treated him with petulant caprice enjoying the pain which she inflicted by her frowns from the idea how soon she would chase it away again by her smiles she took a pleasure in alarming his fears by affecting a temporary preference to some one or other of his rivals and then would delight in allaying them by an ample measure of returning kindness perhaps there was some degree of vanity gratified by all this it might be a matter of triumph to show her absolute power over the young soldier who was the universal object of female admiration eugene however was of too serious and ardent a nature to be trifled with he loved too fervently not to be filled with doubt he saw annette surrounded by admirers and full of animation the gayest among the gay at all their rural festivities and apparently most gay when he was most dejected every one saw through this caprice but himself everyone saw that in reality she doted on him but eugene alone suspected the sincerity of her affection for some time he bore this coquetry with secret impatience and distrust but his feelings grew sore and irritable and overcame his selfcommand a slight misunderstanding took place a quarrel ensued annette unaccustomed to be thwarted and contradicted and full of the insolence of youthful beauty assumed an air of disdain she refused all explanations to her lover and they parted in anger  that very evening eugene saw her full of gayety dancing with one of his rivals and as her eye caught his fixed on her with unfeigned distress it sparkled with more than usual vivacity it was a finishing blow to his hopes already so much impaired by secret distrust pride and resentment both struggled in his breast and seemed to rouse his spirit to all its wonted energy he retired from her presence with the hasty determination never to see her again  a woman is more considerate in affairs of love than a man because love is more the study and business of her life annette soon repented of her indiscretion she felt that she had used her lover unkindly she felt that she had trifled with his sincere and generous natureand then he looked so handsome when he parted after their quarrelhis fine features lighted up by indignation she had intended making up with him at the evening dance but his sudden departure prevented her she now promised herself that when next they met she would amply repay him by the sweets of a perfect reconciliation and that thenceforward she would nevernever tease him more that promise was not to be fulfilled day after day passedbut eugene did not make his appearance sunday evening came the usual time when all the gayety of the village assembledbuteugene was not there she inquired after him he had left the village she now became alarmed and forgetting all coyness and affected indifference called on eugenes mother for an explanation she found her full of affliction and learnt with surprise and consternation that eugene had gone to sea  while his feelings were yet smarting with her affected disdain and his heart a prey to alternate indignation and despair he had suddenly embraced an invitation which had repeatedly been made him by a relation who was fitting out a ship from the port of honfleur and who wished him to be the companion of his voyage absence appeared to him the only cure for his unlucky passion and in the temporary transports of his feelings there was something gratifying in the idea of having half the world intervene between them the hurry necessary for his departure left no time for cool reflection it rendered him deaf to the remonstrances of his afflicted mother he hastened to honfleur just in time to make the needful preparations for the voyage and the first news that annette received of this sudden determination was a letter delivered by his mother returning her pledges of affection particularly the longtreasured braid of her hair and bidding her a last farewell in terms more full of sorrow and tenderness than upbraiding  this was the first stroke of real anguish that annette had ever received and it overcame her the vivacity of her spirits was apt to hurry her to extremes she for a time gave way to ungovernable transports of affliction and remorse and manifested in the violence of her grief the real ardour of her affection the thought occurred to her that the ship might not yet have sailed she seized on the hope with eagerness and hastened with her father to honfleur the ship had sailed that very morning from the heights above the town she saw it lessening to a speck on the broad bosom of the ocean and before evening the white sail had faded from her sight she turned full of anguish to the neighbouring chapel of our lady of grace and throwing herself on the pavement poured out prayers and tears for the safe return of her lover  when she returned home the cheerfulness of her spirits was at an end she looked back with remorse and selfupbraiding at her past caprices she turned with distaste from the adulation of her admirers and had no longer any relish for the amusements of the village with humiliation and diffidence she sought the widowed mother of eugene but was received by her with an overflowing heart for she only beheld in annette one who could sympathize in her doting fondness for her son it seemed some alleviation of her remorse to sit by the mother all day to study her wants to beguile her heavy hours to hang about her with the caressing endearments of a daughter and to seek by every means if possible to supply the place of the son whom she reproached herself with having driven away  in the mean time the ship made a prosperous voyage to her destined port eugenes mother received a letter from him in which he lamented the precipitancy of his departure the voyage had given him time for sober reflection if annette had been unkind to him he ought not to have forgotten what was due to his mother who was now advanced in years he accused himself of selfishness in only listening to the suggestions of his own inconsiderate passions he promised to return with the ship to make his mind up to his disappointment and to think of nothing but making his mother happyand when he does return said annette clasping her hands with transport it shall not be my fault if he ever leaves us again  the time approached for the ships return she was daily expected when the weather became dreadfully tempestuous day after day brought news of vessels foundered or driven on shore and the coast was strewed with wrecks intelligence was received of the lookedfor ship having been seen dismasted in a violent storm and the greatest fears were entertained for her safety  annette never left the side of eugenes mother she watched every change of her countenance with painful solicitude and endeavoured to cheer her with hopes while her own mind was racked by anxiety she tasked her efforts to be gay but it was a forced and unnatural gayety a sigh from the mother would completely check it and when she could no longer restrain the rising tears she would hurry away and pour out her agony in secret every anxious look every anxious inquiry of the mother whenever a door opened or a strange face appeared was an arrow to her soul she considered every disappointment as a pang of her own infliction and her heart sickened under the careworn expression of the maternal eye at length this suspense became insupportable she left the village and hastened to honfleur hoping every hour every moment to receive some tidings of her lover she paced the pier and wearied the seamen of the port with her inquiries she made a daily pilgrimage to the chapel of our lady of grace hung votive garlands on the wall and passed hours either kneeling before the altar or looking out from the brow of the hill upon the angry sea  at length word was brought that the longwishedfor vessel was in sight she was seen standing into the mouth of the seine shattered and crippled bearing marks of having been sadly tempesttost there was a general joy diffused by her return and there was not a brighter eye nor a lighter heart than annettes in the little port of honfleur the ship came to anchor in the river and shortly after a boat put off for the shore the populace crowded down to the pierhead to welcome it annette stood blushing and smiling and trembling and weeping for a thousand painfullypleasing emotions agitated her breast at the thoughts of the meeting and reconciliation about to take place  her heart throbbed to pour itself out and atone to her gallant lover for all its errors at one moment she would place herself in a conspicuous situation where she might catch his view at once and surprise him by her welcome but the next moment a doubt would come across her mind and she would shrink among the throng trembling and faint and gasping with her emotions her agitation increased as the boat drew near until it became distressing and it was almost a relief to her when she perceived that her lover was not there she presumed that some accident had detained him on board of the ship and she felt that the delay would enable her to gather more selfpossession for the meeting as the boat neared the shore many inquiries were made and laconic answers returned  at length annette heard some inquiries after her lover her heart palpitatedthere was a moments pause the reply was brief but awful he had been washed from the deck with two of the crew in the midst of a stormy night when it was impossible to render any assistance a piercing shriek broke from among the crowd and annette had nearly fallen into the waves  the sudden revulsion of feelings after such a transient gleam of happiness was too much for her harassed frame she was carried home senseless her life was for some time despaired of and it was months before she recovered her health but she never had perfectly recovered her mind it still remained unsettled with respect to her lovers fate  the subject continued my informant is never mentioned in her hearing but she sometimes speaks of it herself and it seems as though there were some vague train of impressions in her mind in which hope and fear are strangely mingledsome imperfect idea of her lovers shipwreck and yet some expectation of his return  her parents have tried every means to cheer her and to banish these gloomy images from her thoughts they assemble round her the young companions in whose society she used to delight and they will work and chat and sing and laugh as formerly but she will sit silently among them and will sometimes weep in the midst of their gayety and if spoken to will make no reply but look up with streaming eyes and sing a dismal little song which she has learned somewhere about a shipwreck it makes every ones heart ache to see her in this way for she used to be the happiest creature in the village  she passes the greater part of the time with eugenes mother whose only consolation is her society and who dotes on her with a mothers tenderness she is the only one that has perfect influence over annette in every mood the poor girl seems as formerly to make an effort to be cheerful in her company but will sometimes gaze upon her with the most piteous look and then kiss her gray hairs and fall on her neck and weep  she is not always melancholy however she has occasional intervals when she will be bright and animated for days together but there is a degree of wildness attending these fits of gayety that prevents their yielding any satisfaction to her friends at such times she will arrange her room which is all covered with pictures of ships and legends of saints and will wreathe a white chaplet as if for a wedding and prepare wedding ornaments she will listen anxiously at the door and look frequently out at the window as if expecting some ones arrival it is supposed that at such times she is looking for her lovers return but as no one touches upon the theme nor mentions his name in her presence the current of her thoughts is mere matter of conjecture now and then she will make a pilgrimage to the chapel of notre dame de grace where she will pray for hours at the altar and decorate the images with wreaths that she had woven or will wave her handkerchief from the terrace as you have seen if there is any vessel in the distance  upwards of a year he informed me had now elapsed without effacing from her mind this singular taint of insanity still her friends hoped it might gradually wear away they had at one time removed her to a distant part of the country in hopes that absence from the scenes connected with her story might have a salutary effect but when her periodical melancholy returned she became more restless and wretched than usual and secretly escaping from her friends set out on foot without knowing the road on one of her pilgrimages to the chapel  this little story entirely drew my attention from the gay scene of the fête and fixed it upon the beautiful annette while she was yet standing on the terrace the vesperbell was rung from the neighbouring chapel she listened for a moment and then drawing a small rosary from her bosom walked in that direction several of the peasantry followed her in silence and i felt too much interested not to do the same  the chapel as i said before is in the midst of a grove on the high promontory the inside is hung round with little models of ships and rude paintings of wrecks and perils at sea and providential deliverancesthe votive offerings of captains and crews that have been saved on entering annette paused for a moment before a picture of the virgin which i observed had recently been decorated with a wreath of artificial flowers when she reached the middle of the chapel she knelt down and those who followed her involuntarily did the same at a little distance the evening sun shone softly through the checkered grove into one window of the chapel a perfect stillness reigned within and this stillness was the more impressive contrasted with the distant sound of music and merriment from the fair i could not take my eyes off from the poor suppliant her lips moved as she told her beads but her prayers were breathed in silence it might have been mere fancy excited by the scene that as she raised her eyes to heaven i thought they had an expression truly seraphic but i am easily affected by female beauty and there was something in this mixture of love devotion and partial insanity that was inexpressibly touching  as the poor girl left the chapel there was a sweet serenity in her looks and i was told that she would return home and in all probability be calm and cheerful for days and even weeks in which time it was supposed that hope predominated in her mental malady and that when the dark side of her mind as her friends call it was about to turn up it would be known by her neglecting her distaff or her lace singing plaintive songs and weeping in silence  she passed on from the chapel without noticing the fête but smiling and speaking to many as she passed i followed her with my eye as she descended the winding road towards honfleur leaning on her fathers arm heaven thought i has ever its store of balms for the hurt mind and wounded spirit and may in time rear up this broken flower to be once more the pride and joy of the valley the very delusion in which the poor girl walks may be one of those mists kindly diffused by providence over the regions of thought when they become too fruitful of misery the veil may gradually be raised which obscures the horizon of her mind as she is enabled steadily and calmly to contemplate the sorrows at present hidden in mercy from her view  on my return from paris about a year afterwards i turned off from the beaten route at rouen to revisit some of the most striking scenes of lower normandy having passed through the lovely country of the pays dauge i reached honfleur on a fine afternoon intending to cross to havre the next morning and embark for england as i had no better way of passing the evening i strolled up the hill to enjoy the fine prospect from the chapel of notre dame de grace and while there i thought of inquiring after the fate of poor annette delarbre the priest who had told me her story was officiating at vespers after which i accosted him and learnt from him the remaining circumstances he told me that from the time i had seen her at the chapel her disorder took a sudden turn for the worse and her health rapidly declined her cheerful intervals became shorter and less frequent and attended with more incoherency she grew languid silent and moody in her melancholy her form was wasted her looks pale and disconsolate and it was feared she would never recover she became impatient of all sounds of gayety and was never so contented as when eugenes mother was near her the good woman watched over her with patient yearning solicitude and in seeking to beguile her sorrows would half forget her own sometimes as she sat looking upon her pallid face the tears would fill her eyes which when annette perceived she would anxiously wipe them away and tell her not to grieve for that eugene would soon return and then she would affect a forced gayety as in former times and sing a lively air but a sudden recollection would come over her and she would burst into tears hang on the poor mothers neck and entreat her not to curse her for having destroyed her son  just at this time to the astonishment of every one news was received of eugene who it appeared was still living when almost drowned he had fortunately seized upon a spar which had been washed from the ships deck finding himself nearly exhausted he had fastened himself to it and floated for a day and night until all sense had left him on recovering he had found himself on board a vessel bound to india but so ill as not to move without assistance his health had continued precarious throughout the voyage on arriving in india he had experienced many vicissitudes and had been transferred from ship to ship and hospital to hospital his constitution had enabled him to struggle through every hardship and he was now in a distant port waiting only for the sailing of a ship to return home  great caution was necessary in imparting these tidings to the mother and even then she was nearly overcome by the transports of her joy but how to impart them to annette was a matter of still greater perplexity her state of mind had been so morbid she had been subject to such violent changes and the cause of her derangement had been of such an inconsolable and hopeless kind that her friends had always forborne to tamper with her feelings they had never even hinted at the subject of her griefs nor encouraged the theme when she adverted to it but had passed it over in silence hoping that time would gradually wear the traces of it from her recollection or at least would render them less painful they now felt at a loss how to undeceive her even in her misery lest the sudden recurrence of happiness might confirm the estrangement of her reason or might overpower her enfeebled frame they ventured however to probe those wounds which they formerly did not dare to touch for they now had the balm to pour into them they led the conversation to those topics which they had hitherto shunned and endeavoured to ascertain the current of her thoughts in those varying moods that had formerly perplexed them they found however that her mind was even more affected than they had imagined all her ideas were confused and wandering her bright and cheerful moods which now grew seldomer than ever were all the effects of mental delusion at such times she had no recollection of her lovers having been in danger but was only anticipating his arrival when the winter has passed away said she and the trees put on their blossoms and the swallow comes back over the sea he will return when she was drooping and desponding it was in vain to remind her of what she had said in her gayer moments and to assure her that eugene would indeed return shortly she wept on in silence and appeared insensible to their words but at times her agitation became violent when she would upbraid herself with having driven eugene from his mother and brought sorrow on her gray hairs her mind admitted but one leading idea at a time which nothing could divert or efface or if they ever succeeded in interrupting the current of her fancy it only became the more incoherent and increased the feverishness that preyed upon both mind and body her friends felt more alarm for her than ever for they feared that her senses were irrecoverably gone and her constitution completely undermined  in the mean time eugene returned to the village he was violently affected when the story of annette was told him with bitterness of heart he upbraided his own rashness and infatuation that had hurried him away from her and accused himself as the author of all her woes his mother would describe to him all the anguish and remorse of poor annette the tenderness with which she clung to her and endeavoured even in the midst of her insanity to console her for the loss of her son and the touching expressions of affection that were mingled with her most incoherent wanderings of thought until his feelings would be wound up to agony and he would entreat her to desist from the recital they did not dare as yet to bring him into annettes sight but he was permitted to see her when she was sleeping the tears streamed down his sunburnt cheeks as he contemplated the ravages which grief and malady had made and his heart swelled almost to breaking as he beheld round her neck the very braid of hair which she once gave him in token of girlish affection and which he had returned to her in anger  at length the physician that attended her determined to adventure upon an experiment to take advantage of one of those cheerful moods when her mind was visited by hope and to endeavour to engraft as it were the reality upon the delusions of her fancy these moods had now become very rare for nature was sinking under the continual pressure of her mental malady and the principle of reaction was daily growing weaker every effort was tried to bring on a cheerful interval of the kind several of her most favourite companions were kept continually about her they chatted gayly they laughed and sang and danced but annette reclined with languid frame and hollow eye and took no part in their gayety at length the winter was gone the trees put forth their leaves the swallows began to build in the eaves of the house and the robin and wren piped all day beneath the window annettes spirits gradually revived she began to deck her person with unusual care and bringing forth a basket of artificial flowers she went to work to wreathe a bridal chaplet of white roses her companions asked her why she prepared the chaplet what said she with a smile have you not noticed the trees putting on their wedding dresses of blossoms has not the swallow flown back over the sea do you not know that the time is come for eugene to return that he will be home tomorrow and that on sunday we are to be married  her words were repeated to the physician and he seized on them at once he directed that her idea should be encouraged and acted upon her words were echoed through the house every one talked of the return of eugene as a matter of course they congratulated her upon her approaching happiness and assisted her in her preparations the next morning the same theme was resumed she was dressed out to receive her lover every bosom fluttered with anxiety a cabriolet drove into the village eugene is coming was the cry she saw him alight at the door and rushed with a shriek into his arms  her friends trembled for the result of this critical experiment but she did not sink under it for her fancy had prepared her for his return she was as one in a dream to whom a tide of unlookedfor prosperity that would have overwhelmed his waking reason seems but the natural current of circumstances her conversation however showed that her senses were wandering there was an absolute forgetfulness of all past sorrowa wild and feverish gayety that at times was incoherent  the next morning she awoke languid and exhausted all the occurrences of the preceding day had passed away from her mind as though they had been the mere illusions of her fancy she rose melancholy and abstracted and as she dressed herself was heard to sing one of her plaintive ballads when she entered the parlour her eyes were swoln with weeping she heard eugenes voice without and started she passed her hand across her forehead and stood musing like one endeavouring to recall a dream eugene entered the room and advanced towards her she looked at him with an eager searching look murmured some indistinct words and before he could reach her sank upon the floor  she relapsed into a wild and unsettled state of mind but now that the first shock was over the physician ordered that eugene should keep continually in her sight sometimes she did not know him at other times she would talk to him as if he were going to sea and would implore him not to part from her in anger and when he was not present she would speak of him as if buried in the ocean and would sit with clasped hands looking upon the ground the picture of despair as the agitation of her feelings subsided and her frame recovered from the shock which it had received she became more placid and coherent eugene kept almost continually near her he formed the real object round which her scattered ideas once more gathered and which linked them once more with the realities of life but her changeful disorder now appeared to take a new turn she became languid and inert and would sit for hours silent and almost in a state of lethargy if roused from this stupor it seemed as if her mind would make some attempts to follow up a train of thought but would soon become confused she would regard every one that approached her with an anxious and inquiring eye that seemed continually to disappoint itself sometimes as her lover sat holding her hand she would look pensively in his face without saying a word until his heart was overcome and after these transient fits of intellectual exertion she would sink again into lethargy  by degrees this stupor increased her mind appeared to have subsided into a stagnant and almost deathlike calm for the greater part of the time her eyes were closed her face almost as fixed and passionless as that of a corpse she no longer took any notice of surrounding objects there was an awfulness in this tranquillity that filled her friends with apprehensions the physician ordered that she should be kept perfectly quiet or that if she evinced any agitation she should be gently lulled like a child by some favourite tune  she remained in this state for hours hardly seeming to breathe and apparently sinking into the sleep of death her chamber was profoundly still the attendants moved about it with noiseless tread every thing was communicated by signs and whispers her lover sat by her side watching her with painful anxiety and fearing that every breath which stole from her pale lips would be the last  at length she heaved a deep sigh and from some convulsive motions appeared to be troubled in her sleep her agitation increased accompanied by an indistinct moaning one of her companions remembering the physicians instructions endeavoured to lull her by singing in a low voice a tender little air which was a particular favourite of annettes probably it had some connexion in her mind with her own story for every fond girl has some ditty of the kind linked in her thoughts with sweet and sad remembrances  as she sang the agitation of annette subsided a streak of faint colour came into her cheeks her eyelids became swoln with rising tears which trembled there for a moment and then stealing forth coursed down her pallid cheek when the song was ended she opened her eyes and looked about her as one awakening in a strange place  oh eugene eugene said she it seems as if i have had a long and dismal dream what has happened and what has been the matter with me  the questions were embarrassing and before they could be answered the physician who was in the next room entered she took him by the hand looked up in his face and made the same inquiry he endeavoured to put her off with some evasive answerno no cried she i know i have been ill and i have been dreaming strangely i thought eugene had left usand that he had gone to seaand thatand that he was drownedbut he has been to sea added she earnestly as recollection kept flashing upon her and he has been wreckedand we were all so wretchedand he came home again one bright morningandoh said she pressing her hand against her forehead with a sickly smile i see how it is all has not been right here i begin to recollectbut it is all past noweugene is here and his mother is happyand we shall nevernever part againshall we eugene  she sunk back in her chair exhausted the tears streamed down her cheeks her companions hovered round her not knowing what to make of this sudden dawn of reason her lover sobbed aloud she opened her eyes again and looked upon them with an air of the sweetest acknowledgment you are all so good to me said she faintly  the physician drew the father aside your daughters mind is restored said he she is sensible that she has been deranged she is growing conscious of the past and conscious of the present all that now remains is to keep her calm and quiet until her health is reestablished and then let her be married in gods name  the wedding took place continued the good priest but a short time since they were here at the last fête during their honeymoon and a handsomer and happier couple was not to be seen as they danced under yonder trees the young man his wife and mother now live on a fine farm at pont leveque and that model of a ship which you see yonder with white flowers wreathed round it is annettes offering of thanks to our lady of grace for having listened to her prayers and protected her lover in the hour of peril  the captain having finished there was a momentary silence the tenderhearted lady lillycraft who knew the story by heart had led the way in weeping and indeed had often begun to shed tears before they had come to the right place  the fair julia was a little flurried at the passage where wedding preparations were mentioned but the auditor most affected was the simple phoebe wilkins she had gradually dropt her work in her lap and sat sobbing through the latter part of the story until towards the end when the happy reverse had nearly produced another scene of hysterics go take this case to my room again child said lady lillycraft kindly and dont cry so much  i wont ant please your ladyship if i can help itbut im glad they made all up again and were married  by the way the case of this lovelorn damsel begins to make some talk in the household especially among certain little ladies not far in their teens of whom she has made confidants she is a great favourite with them all but particularly so since she has confided to them her love secrets they enter into her concerns with all the violent zeal and overwhelming sympathy with which little boardingschool ladies engage in the politics of a love affair  i have noticed them frequently clustering about her in private conferences or walking up and down the garden terrace under my window listening to some long and dolorous story of her afflictions of which i could now and then distinguish the everrecurring phrases says he and says she  i accidentally interrupted one of these little councils of war when they were all huddled together under a tree and seemed to be earnestly considering some interesting document the flutter at my approach showed that there were some secrets under discussion and i observed the disconsolate phoebe crumpling into her bosom either a loveletter or an old valentine and brushing away the tears from her cheeks  the girl is a good girl of a soft melting nature and shows her concern at the cruelty of her lover only in tears and drooping looks but with the little ladies who have espoused her cause it sparkles up into fiery indignation and i have noticed on sunday many a glance darted at the pew of the tibbetss enough even to melt down the silver buttons on old ready moneys jacket     travelling    a citizen for recreation sake   to see the country would a journey take   some dozen mile or very little more   taking his leave with friends two months before   with drinking healths and shaking by the hand   as he had travaild to some newfound land    doctor merrieman 1609   the squire has lately received another shock in the saddle and been almost unseated by his marplot neighbour the indefatigable mr faddy who rides his jogtrot hobby with equal zeal and is so bent upon improving and reforming the neighbourhood that the squire thinks in a little while it will be scarce worth living in the enormity that has thus discomposed my worthy host is an attempt of the manufacturer to have a line of coaches established that shall diverge from the old route and pass through the neighbouring village  i believe i have mentioned that the hall is situated in a retired part of the country at a distance from any great coachroad insomuch that the arrival of a traveller is apt to make every one look out of the window and to cause some talk among the aledrinkers at the little inn i was at a loss therefore to account for the squires indignation at a measure apparently fraught with convenience and advantage until i found that the conveniences of travelling were among his greatest grievances  in fact he rails against stagecoaches postchaises and turnpikeroads as serious causes of the corruption of english rural manners they have given facilities he says to every humdrum citizen to trundle his family about the kingdom and have sent the follies and fashions of town whirling in coachloads to the remotest parts of the island the whole country he says is traversed by these flying cargoes every byroad is explored by enterprising tourists from cheapside and the poultry and every gentlemans park and lawns invaded by cockney sketchers of both sexes with portable chairs and portfolios for drawing  he laments over this as destroying the charm of privacy and interrupting the quiet of country life but more especially as affecting the simplicity of the peasantry and filling their heads with halfcity notions a great coachinn he says is enough to ruin the manners of a whole village it creates a horde of sots and idlers makes gapers and gazers and newsmongers of the common people and knowing jockeys of the country bumpkins  the squire has something of the old feudal feeling he looks back with regret to the good old times when journeys were only made on horseback and the extraordinary difficulties of travelling owing to bad roads bad accommodations and highway robbers seemed to separate each village and hamlet from the rest of the world the lord of the manor was then a kind of monarch in the little realm around him he held his court in his paternal hall and was looked up to with almost as much loyalty and deference as the king himself every neighbourhood was a little world within itself having its local manners and customs its local history and local opinions the inhabitants were fonder of their homes and thought less of wandering it was looked upon as an expedition to travel out of sight of the parish steeple and a man that had been to london was a village oracle for the rest of his life  what a difference between the mode of travelling in those days and at present at that time when a gentleman went on a distant visit he sallied forth like a knighterrant on an enterprise and every family excursion was a pageant how splendid and fanciful must one of those domestic cavalcades have been where the beautiful dames were mounted on palfreys magnificently caparisoned with embroidered harness all tinkling with silver bells attended by cavaliers richly attired on prancing steeds and followed by pages and servingmen as we see them represented in old tapestry the gentry as they travelled about in those days were like moving pictures they delighted the eyes and awakened the admiration of the common people and passed before them like superior beings and indeed they were so there was a hardy and healthful exercise connected with this equestrian style that made them generous and noble  in his fondness for the old style of travelling the squire makes most of his journeys on horseback though he laments the modern deficiency of incident on the road from the want of fellowwayfarers and the rapidity with which every one else is whirled along in coaches and postchaises in the good old times on the contrary a cavalier jogged on through bog and mire from town to town and hamlet to hamlet conversing with friars and franklins and all other chance companions of the road beguiling the way with travellers tales which then were truly wonderful for every thing beyond ones neighbourhood was full of marvel and romance stopping at night at some hostel where the bush over the door proclaimed good wine or a pretty hostess made bad wine palatable meeting at supper with travellers or listening to the song or merry story of the host who was generally a boon companion and presided at his own board for according to old tussers innholders posie    at meales my friend who vitleth here     and sitteth with his host   shall both be sure of better cheere     and scape with lesser cost  the squire is fond too of stopping at those inns which may be met with here and there in ancient houses of wood and plaster or calimanco houses as they are called by antiquaries with deep porches diamondpaned bowwindows pannelled rooms and great fireplaces he will prefer them to more spacious and modern inns and would cheerfully put up with bad cheer and bad accommodations in the gratification of his humour they give him he says the feelings of old times insomuch that he almost expects in the dusk of the evening to see some party of weary travellers ride up to the door with plumes and mantles trunkhose wide boots and long rapiers  the good squires remarks brought to mind a visit that i once paid to the tabbard inn famous for being the place of assemblage from whence chaucers pilgrims set forth for canterbury it is in the borough of southwark not far from london bridge and bears at present the name of the talbot it has sadly declined in dignity since the days of chaucer being a mere rendezvous and packingplace of the great wagons that travel into kent the courtyard which was anciently the musteringplace of the pilgrims previous to their departure was now lumbered with huge wagons crates boxes hampers and baskets containing the good things of town and country were piled about them while among the straw and litter the motherly hens scratched and clucked with their hungry broods at their heels instead of chaucers motley and splendid throng i only saw a group of wagoners and stableboys enjoying a circulating pot of ale while a longbodied dog sat by with head on one side ear cocked up and wistful gaze as if waiting for his turn at the tankard  notwithstanding this grievous declension however i was gratified at perceiving that the present occupants were not unconscious of the poetical renown of their mansion an inscription over the gateway proclaimed it to be the inn where chaucers pilgrims slept on the night previous to their departure and at the bottom of the yard was a magnificent sign representing them in the act of sallying forth i was pleased too at noticing that though the present inn was comparatively modern yet the form of the old inn was preserved there were galleries round the yard as in old times on which opened the chambers of the guests to these ancient inns have antiquaries ascribed the present forms of our theatres plays were originally acted in innyards the guests lolled over the galleries which answered to our modern dresscircle the critical mob clustered in the yard instead of the pit and the groups gazing from the garretwindows were no bad representatives of the gods of the shilling gallery when therefore the drama grew important enough to have a house of its own the architects took a hint for its construction from the yard of the ancient hostel  i was so well pleased at finding these remembrances of chaucer and his poem that i ordered my dinner in the little parlour of the talbot whilst it was preparing i sat at the window musing and gazing into the courtyard and conjuring up recollections of the scenes depicted in such lovely colours by the poet until by degrees boxes bales and hampers boys wagoners and dogs faded from sight and my fancy peopled the place with the motley throng of canterbury pilgrims the galleries once more swarmed with idle gazers in the rich dresses of chaucers time and the whole cavalcade seemed to pass before me there was the stately knight on sober steed who had ridden in christendom and heathenesse and had foughten for our faith at tramisseneand his son the young squire a lover and a lusty bachelor with curled locks and gay embroidery a bold rider a dancer and a writer of verses singing and fluting all day long and fresh as the month of mayand his knotheaded yeoman a bold forester in green with horn and baudrick and dagger a mighty bow in hand and a sheaf of peacock arrows shining beneath his beltand the coy smiling simple nun with her gray eyes her small red mouth and fair forehead her dainty person clad in featly cloak and ypinched wimple her choral beads about her arm her golden brooch with a love motto and her pretty oath by saint eloyand the merchant solemn in speech and high on horse with forked beard and flaundrish bever hatand the lusty monk full fat and in good point with berry brown palfrey his hood fastened with gold pin wrought with a loveknot his bald head shining like glass and his face glistening as though it had been anointed and the lean logical sententious clerk of oxenforde upon his halfstarved scholarlike horseand the bowsing sompnour with fiery cherub face all knobbed with pimples an eater of garlic and onions and drinker of strong wine red as blood that carried a cake for a buckler and babbled latin in his cups of whose brimstone visage children were sore aferdand the buxom wife of bath the widow of five husbands upon her ambling nag with her hat broad as a buckler her red stockings and sharp spursand the slender choleric reeve of norfolk bestriding his good gray stot with closeshaven beard his hair cropped round his ears long lean calfless legs and a rusty blade by his sideand the jolly limitour with lisping tongue and twinkling eye wellbeloved franklins and housewives a great promoter of marriages among young women known at the taverns in every town and by every hosteler and gay tapstere in short before i was roused from my reverie by the less poetical but more substantial apparition of a smoking beefsteak i had seen the whole cavalcade issue forth from the hostelgate with the brawny doublejointed redhaired miller playing the bagpipes before them and the ancient host of the tabbard giving them his farewell godsend to canterbury  when i told the squire of the existence of this legitimate descendant of the ancient tabbard inn his eyes absolutely glistened with delight he determined to hunt it up the very first time he visited london and to eat a dinner there and drink a cup of mine hosts best wine in memory of old chaucer the general who happened to be present immediately begged to be of the party for he liked to encourage these longestablished houses as they are apt to have choice old wines     popular superstitions    farewell rewards and fairies     good housewives now may say   for now fowle sluts in dairies     do fare as well as they   and though they sweepe their hearths no lease     than maids were wont to doo   yet who of late for cleanlinesse     finds sixpence in her shooe    bishop corbet   i have mentioned the squires fondness for the marvellous and his predilection for legends and romances his library contains a curious collection of old works of this kind which bear evident marks of having been much read in his great love for all that is antiquated he cherishes popular superstitions and listens with very grave attention to every tale however strange so that through his countenance the household and indeed the whole neighbourhood is well stocked with wonderful stories and if ever a doubt is expressed of any one of them the narrator will generally observe that the squire thinks theres something in it  the hall of course comes in for its share the common people having always a propensity to furnish a great superannuated building of the kind with supernatural inhabitants the gloomy galleries of such old family mansions the stately chambers adorned with grotesque carvings and faded paintings the sounds that vaguely echo about them the moaning of the wind the cries of rooks and ravens from the trees and chimneytops all produce a state of mind favourable to superstitious fancies  in one chamber of the hall just opposite a door which opens upon a dusky passage there is a fulllength portrait of a warrior in armour when on suddenly turning into the passage i have caught a sight of the portrait thrown into strong relief by the dark pannelling against which it hangs i have more than once been startled as though it were a figure advancing towards me  to superstitious minds therefore predisposed by the strange and melancholy stories that are connected with family paintings it needs but little stretch of fancy on a moonlight night or by the flickering light of a candle to set the old pictures on the walls in motion sweeping in their robes and trains about the galleries  to tell the truth the squire confesses that he used to take a pleasure in his younger days in setting marvellous stories afloat and connecting them with the lonely and peculiar places of the neighbourhood whenever he read any legend of a striking nature he endeavoured to transplant it and give it a local habitation among the scenes of his boyhood many of these stories took root and he says he is often amused with the odd shapes in which they will come back to him in some old womans narrative after they have been circulating for years among the peasantry and undergoing rustic additions and amendments among these may doubtless be numbered that of the crusaders ghost which i have mentioned in the account of my christmas visit and another about the hardriding squire of yore the family nimrod who is sometimes heard in stormy winter nights galloping with hound and horn over a wild moor a few miles distant from the hall this i apprehend to have had its origin in the famous story of the wild huntsman the favourite goblin in german tales though bytheby as i was talking on the subject with master simon the other evening in the dark avenue he hinted that he had himself once or twice heard odd sounds at night very like a pack of hounds in cry and that once as he was returning rather late from a hunting dinner he had seen a strange figure galloping along this same moor but as he was riding rather fast at the time and in a hurry to get home he did not stop to ascertain what it was  popular superstitions are fast fading away in england owing to the general diffusion of knowledge and the bustling intercourse kept up throughout the country still they have their strongholds and lingering places and a retired neighbourhood like this is apt to be one of them the parson tells me that he meets with many traditional beliefs and notions among the common people which he has been able to draw from them in the course of familiar conversation though they are rather shy of avowing them to strangers and particularly to the gentry who are apt to laugh at them he says there are several of his old parishioners who remember when the village had its barguest or barghosta spirit supposed to belong to a town or village and to predict any impending misfortune by midnight shrieks and wailings the last time it was heard was just before the death of mr bracebridges father who was much beloved throughout the neighbourhood though there are not wanting some obstinate unbelievers who insisted that it was nothing but the howling of a watchdog i have been greatly delighted however at meeting with some traces of my old favourite robin goodfellow though under a different appellation from any of those by which i have heretofore heard him called the parson assures me that many of the peasantry believe in household goblins called dubbies which live about particular farms and houses in the same way that robin goodfellow did of old sometimes they haunt the barns and outhouses and now and then will assist the farmer wonderfully by getting in all his hay or corn in a single night in general however they prefer to live within doors and are fond of keeping about the great hearths and basking at night after the family have gone to bed by the glowing embers when put in particular goodhumour by the warmth of their lodgings and the tidiness of the housemaids they will overcome their natural laziness and do a vast deal of household work before morning churning the cream brewing the beer or spinning all the good dames flax all this is precisely the conduct of robin goodfellow described so charmingly by milton    tells how the drudging goblin sweat   to earn his creambowl duly get   when in one night ere glimpse of morn   his shadowy flail had threshd the corn   that ten daylabourers could not end   then lays him down the lubberfiend   and stretchd out all the chimneys length   basks at the fire his hairy strength   and cropfull out of door he flings   ere the first cock his matin rings  but beside these household dubbies there are others of a more gloomy and unsocial nature that keep about lonely barns at a distance from any dwellinghouse or about ruins and old bridges these are full of mischievous and often malignant tricks and are fond of playing pranks upon benighted travellers there is a story among the old people of one that haunted a ruined mill just by a bridge that crosses a small stream how that late one night as a traveller was passing on horseback the dubbie jumped up behind him and grasped him so close round the body that he had no power to help himself but expected to be squeezed to death luckily his heels were loose with which he plied the sides of his steed and was carried with the wonderful instinct of a travellers horse straight to the village inn had the inn been at any greater distance there is no doubt but he would have been strangled to death as it was the good people were a long time in bringing him to his senses and it was remarked that the first sign he showed of returning consciousness was to call for a bottom of brandy  these mischievous dubbies bear much resemblance in their natures and habits to those sprites which heywood in his heirarchie calls pugs or hobgoblins    their dwellings be   in corners of old houses least frequented   or beneath stacks of wood and these convented   make fearfull noise in butteries and in dairies   robin goodfellow some some call them fairies   in solitarie rooms these uprores keep   and beate at doores to wake men from their slape   seeming to force lockes be they nere so strong   and keeping christmasse gambols all night long   pots glasses trenchers dishes pannes and kettles   they will make dance about the shelves and settles   as if about the kitchen tost and cast   yet in the morning nothing found misplact   others such houses to their use have fitted   in which base murthers have been once committed   some have their fearful habitations taken   in desolate houses ruind and forsaken  in the account of our unfortunate hawking expedition i mentioned an instance of one of these sprites supposed to haunt the ruined grange that stands in a lonely meadow and has a remarkable echo the parson informs me also that the belief was once very prevalent that a household dubbie kept about the old farmhouse of the tibbets it has long been traditional he says that one of these goodnatured goblins is attached to the tibbets family and came with them when they moved into this part of the country for it is one of the peculiarities of these household sprites that they attach themselves to the fortunes of certain families and follow them in all their removals  there is a large oldfashioned fireplace in the farmhouse which affords fine quarters for a chimneycorner sprite that likes to lie warm especially as readymoney jack keeps up rousing fires in the wintertime the old people of the village recollect many stories about this goblin that were current in their young days it was thought to have brought good luck to the house and to be the reason why the tibbets were always beforehand in the world and why their farm was always in better order their hay got in sooner and their corn better stacked than that of their neighbours the present mrs tibbets at the time of her courtship had a number of these stories told her by the country gossips and when married was a little fearful about living in a house where such a hobgoblin was said to haunt jack however who has always treated this story with great contempt assured her that there was no spirit kept about his house that he could not at any time lay in the red sea with one flourish of his cudgel still his wife has never got completely over her notions on the subject but has a horseshoe nailed on the threshold and keeps a branch of rauntry or mountain ash with its red berries suspended from one of the great beams in the parloura sure protection from all evil spirits  these stories however as i before observed are fast fading away and in another generation or two will probably be completely forgotten there is something however about these rural superstitions that is extremely pleasing to the imagination particularly those which relate to the goodhumoured race of household demons and indeed to the whole fairy mythology the english have given an inexplicable charm to these superstitions by the manner in which they have associated them with whatever is most homefelt and delightful in nature i do not know a more fascinating race of beings than these little fabled people that haunted the southern sides of hills and mountains lurked in flowers and about fountainheads glided through keyholes into ancient halls watched over farmhouses and dairies danced on the green by summer moonlight and on the kitchenhearth in winter they seem to accord with the nature of english housekeeping and english scenery i always have them in mind when i see a fine old english mansion with its wide hall and spacious kitchen or a venerable farmhouse in which there is so much fireside comfort and good housewifery there was something of national character in their love of order and cleanliness in the vigilance with which they watched over the economy of the kitchen and the functions of the servants munificently rewarding with silver sixpence in shoe the tidy housemaid but venting their direful wrath in midnight bobs and pinches upon the sluttish dairymaid i think i can trace the good effects of this ancient fairy sway over household concerns in the care that prevails to the present day among english housemaids to put their kitchens in order before they go to bed  i have said too that these fairy superstitions seemed to me to accord with the nature of english scenery they suit these small landscapes which are divided by honeysuckled hedges into sheltered fields and meadows where the grass is mingled with daisies buttercups and harebells when i first found myself among english scenery i was continually reminded of the sweet pastoral images which distinguish their fairy mythology and when for the first time a circle in the grass was pointed out to me as one of the rings where they were formerly supposed to have held their moonlight revels it seemed for a moment as if fairyland were no longer a fable brown in his britannias pastorals gives a picture of the kind of scenery to which i allude    a pleasant mead   where fairies often did their measures tread   which in the meadows make such circles green   as if with garlands it had crowned been   within one of these rounds was to be seen   a hillock rise where oft the fairy queen   at twilight sat  and there is another picture of the same in a poem ascribed to ben jonson    bywells and rills in meadows green     we nightly dance our heyday guise   and to our fairy king and queen     we chant our moonlight minstrelsies  indeed it seems to me that the older british poets with that true feeling for nature which distinguishes them have closely adhered to the simple and familiar imagery which they found in these popular superstitions and have thus given to their fairy mythology those continual allusions to the farmhouse and the dairy the green meadow and the fountainhead that fill our minds with the delightful associations of rural life it is curious to observe how the most beautiful fictions have their origin among the rude and ignorant there is an indescribable charm about the illusions with which chimerical ignorance once clothed every subject these twilight views of nature are often more captivating than any which are revealed by the rays of enlightened philosophy the most accomplished and poetical minds therefore have been fain to search back into these accidental conceptions of what are termed barbarous ages and to draw from them their finest imagery and machinery if we look through our most admired poets we shall find that their minds have been impregnated by these popular fancies and that those have succeeded best who have adhered closest to the simplicity of their rustic originals such is the case with shakspeare in his midsummernights dream which so minutely describes the employments and amusements of fairies and embodies all the notions concerning them which were current among the vulgar it is thus that poetry in england has echoed back every rustic note softened into perfect melody it is thus that it has spread its charms over everyday life displacing nothing taking things as it found them but tinting them up with its own magical hues until every green hill and fountainhead every fresh meadow nay every humble flower is full of song and story  i am dwelling too long perhaps upon a threadbare subject yet it brings up with it a thousand delicious recollections of those happy days of childhood when the imperfect knowledge i have since obtained had not yet dawned upon my mind and when a fairy tale was true history to me i have often been so transported by the pleasure of these recollections as almost to wish that i had been born in the days when the fictions of poetry were believed even now i cannot look upon those fanciful creations of ignorance and credulity without a lurking regret that they have all passed away the experience of my early days tells me that they were sources of exquisite delight and i sometimes question whether the naturalist who can dissect the flowers of the field receives half the pleasure from contemplating them that he did who considered them the abode of elves and fairies i feel convinced that the true interests and solid happiness of man are promoted by the advancement of truth yet i cannot but mourn over the pleasant errors which it has trampled down in its progress the fauns and sylphs the household sprite the moonlight revel oberon queen mab and the delicious realms of fairyland all vanish before the light of true philosophy but who does not sometimes turn with distaste from the cold realities of morning and seek to recall the sweet visions of the night     the culprit    from fire from water and all things amies   deliver the house of an honest justice    the widow   the serenity of the hall has been suddenly interrupted by a very important occurrence in the course of this morning a posse of villagers was seen trooping up the avenue with boys shouting in advance as it drew near we perceived readymoney jack tibbets striding along wielding his cudgel in one hand and with the other grasping the collar of a tall fellow whom on still nearer approach we recognized for the redoubtable gipsy hero starlight tom he was now however completely cowed and crestfallen and his courage seemed to have quailed in the iron gripe of the lionhearted jack  the whole gang of gipsy women and children came dragging in the rear some in tears others making a violent clamour about the ears of old readymoney who however trudged on in silence with his prey heeding their abuse as little as a hawk that has pounced upon a barndoor hero regards the outcries and cacklings of his whole feathered seraglio  he had passed through the village on his way to the hall and of course had made a great sensation in that most excitable place where every event is a matter of gaze and gossip the report flew like wildfire that starlight tom was in custody the aledrinkers forthwith abandoned the taproom slingsbys school broke loose and master and boys swelled the tide that came rolling at the heels of old readymoney and his captive  the uproar increased as they approached the hall it aroused the whole garrison of dogs and the crew of hangerson the great mastiff barked from the doghouse the staghound and the grayhound and the spaniel issued barking from the halldoor and my lady lillycrafts little dogs ramped and barked from the parlour window i remarked however that the gipsy dogs made no reply to all these menaces and insults but crept close to the gang looking round with a guilty poaching air and now and then glancing up a dubious eye to their owners which shows that the moral dignity even of dogs may be ruined by bad company  when the throng reached the front of the house they were brought to a halt by a kind of advanced guard composed of old christy the gamekeeper and two or three servants of the house who had been brought out by the noise the common herd of the village fell back with respect the boys were driven back by christy and his compeers while readymoney jack maintained his ground and his hold of the prisoner and was surrounded by the tailor the schoolmaster and several other dignitaries of the village and by the clamorous brood of gipsies who were neither to be silenced nor intimidated  by this time the whole household were brought to the doors and windows and the squire to the portal an audience was demanded by readymoney jack who had detected the prisoner in the very act of sheepstealing on his domains and had borne him off to be examined before the squire who is in the commission of the peace  a kind of tribunal was immediately held in the servants hall a large chamber with a stone floor and a long table in the centre at one end of which just under an enormous clock was placed the squires chair of justice while master simon took his place at the table as clerk of the court an attempt had been made by old christy to keep out the gipsy gang but in vain and they with the village worthies and the household half filled the hall the old housekeeper and the butler were in a panic at this dangerous irruption they hurried away all the valuable things and portable articles that were at hand and even kept a dragon watch on the gipsies lest they should carry off the house clock or the deal table  old christy and his faithful coadjutor the gamekeeper acted as constables to guard the prisoner triumphing in having at last got this terrible offender in their clutches indeed i am inclined to think the old man bore some peevish recollection of having been handled rather roughly by the gipsy in the chancemedley affair of mayday  silence was now commanded by master simon but it was difficult to be enforced in such a motley assemblage there was a continual snarling and yelping of dogs and as fast as it was quelled in one corner it broke out in another the poor gipsy curs who like errant thieves could not hold up their heads in an honest house were worried and insulted by the gentlemen dogs of the establishment without offering to make resistance the very curs of my lady lillycraft bullied them with impunity  the examination was conducted with great mildness and indulgence by the squire partly from the kindness of his nature and partly i suspect because his heart yearned towards the culprit who had found great favour in his eyes as i have already observed from the skill he had at various times displayed in archery morrisdancing and other obsolete accomplishments proofs however were too strong readymoney jack told his story in a straightforward independent way nothing daunted by the presence in which he found himself he had suffered from various depredations on his sheepfold and poultryyard and had at length kept watch and caught the delinquent in the very act of making off with a sheep on his shoulders  tibbets was repeatedly interrupted in the course of his testimony by the culprits mother a furious old beldame with an insufferable tongue and who in fact was several times kept with some difficulty from flying at him tooth and nail the wife too of the prisoner whom i am told he does not beat above halfadozen times a week completely interested lady lillycraft in her husbands behalf by her tears and supplications and several of the other gipsy women were awakening strong sympathy among the young girls and maidservants in the background the pretty blackeyed gipsy girl whom i have mentioned on a former occasion as the sibyl that read the fortunes of the general endeavoured to wheedle that doughty warrior into their interests and even made some approaches to her old acquaintance master simon but was repelled by the latter with all the dignity of office having assumed a look of gravity and importance suitable to the occasion  i was a little surprised at first to find honest slingsby the schoolmaster rather opposed to his old crony tibbets and coming forward as a kind of advocate for the accused it seems that he had taken compassion on the forlorn fortunes of starlight tom and had been trying his eloquence in his favour the whole way from the village but without effect during the examination of readymoney jack slingsby had stood like dejected pity at his side seeking every now and then by a soft word to soothe any exacerbation of his ire or to qualify any harsh expression he now ventured to make a few observations to the squire in palliation of the delinquents offence but poor slingsby spoke more from the heart than the head and was evidently actuated merely by a general sympathy for every poor devil in trouble and a liberal toleration for all kinds of vagabond existence  the ladies too large and small with the kindheartedness of the sex were zealous on the side of mercy and interceded strenuously with the squire insomuch that the prisoner finding himself unexpectedly surrounded by active friends once more reared his crest and seemed disposed for a time to put on the air of injured innocence the squire however with all his benevolence of heart and his lurking weakness towards the prisoner was too conscientious to swerve from the strict path of justice there was abundant concurring testimony that made the proof of guilt incontrovertible and starlight toms mittimus was made out accordingly  the sympathy of the ladies was now greater than ever they even made some attempts to mollify the ire of readymoney jack but that sturdy potentate had been too much incensed by the repeated incursions that had been made into his territories by the predatory band of starlight tom and he was resolved he said to drive the varment reptiles out of the neighbourhood to avoid all further importunities as soon as the mittimus was made out he girded up his loins and strode back to his seat of empire accompanied by his interceding friend slingsby and followed by a detachment of the gipsy gang who hung on his rear assailing him with mingled prayers and execrations  the question now was how to dispose of the prisonera matter of great moment in this peaceful establishment where so formidable a character as starlight tom was like a hawk entrapped in a dovecote as the hubbub and examination had occupied a considerable time it was too late in the day to send him to the county prison and that of the village was sadly out of repair from long want of occupation old christy who took great interest in the affair proposed that the culprit should be committed for the night to an upper loft of a kind of tower in one of the outhouses where he and the gamekeeper would mount guard after much deliberation this measure was adopted the premises in question were examined and made secure and christy and his trusty ally the one armed with a fowlingpiece the other with an ancient blunderbuss turned out as sentries to keep watch over this donjonkeep  such is the momentous affair that has just taken place and it is an event of too great moment in this quiet little world not to turn it completely topsyturvy labour is at a stand the house has been a scene of confusion the whole evening it has been beleagured by gipsy women with their children on their backs wailing and lamenting while the old virago of a mother has cruised up and down the lawn in front shaking her head and muttering to herself or now and then breaking into a paroxysm of rage brandishing her fist at the hall and denouncing illluck upon readymoney jack and even upon the squire himself  lady lillycraft has given repeated audiences to the culprits weeping wife at the hall door and the servant maids have stolen out to confer with the gipsy women under the trees as to the little ladies of the family they are all outrageous on readymoney jack whom they look upon in the light of a tyrannical giant of fairy tale phoebe wilkins contrary to her usual nature is the only one that is pitiless in the affair she thinks mr tibbets quite in the right and thinks the gipsies deserve to be punished severely for meddling with the sheep of the tibbetss  in the mean time the females of the family evinced all the provident kindness of the sex ever ready to soothe and succour the distressed right or wrong lady lillycraft has had a mattress taken to the outhouse and comforts and delicacies of all kinds have been taken to the prisoner even the little girls have sent their cakes and sweetmeats so that ill warrant the vagabond has never fared so well in his life before old christy it is true looks upon every thing with a wary eye struts about with his blunderbuss with the air of a veteran campaigner and will hardly allow himself to be spoken to  the gipsy women dare not come within gunshot and every tatterdemalion of a boy has been frightened from the park the old fellow is determined to lodge starlight tom in prison with his own hands and hopes he says to see one of the poaching crew made an example of  i doubt after all whether the worthy squire is not the greatest sufferer in the whole affair his honourable sense of duty obliges him to be rigid but the overflowing kindness of his nature makes this a grievous trial to him  he is not accustomed to have such demands upon his justice in his truly patriarchal domain and it wounds his benevolent spirit that while prosperity and happiness are flowing in thus bounteously upon him he should have to inflict misery upon a fellowbeing  he has been troubled and cast down the whole evening took leave of the family on going to bed with a sigh instead of his usual hearty and affectionate tone and will in all probability have a far more sleepless night than his prisoner indeed this unlucky affair has cast a damp upon the whole household as there appears to be an universal opinion that the unlucky culprit will come to the gallows  morningthe clouds of last evening are all blown over a load has been taken from the squires heart and every face is once more in smiles the gamekeeper made his appearance at an early hour completely shamefaced and crestfallen starlight tom had made his escape in the night how he had got out of the loft no one could tell the devil they think must have assisted him old christy was so mortified that he would not show his face but had shut himself up in his stronghold at the dogkennel and would not be spoken with what has particularly relieved the squire is that there is very little likelihood of the culprits being retaken having gone off on one of the old gentlemans best hunters     family misfortunes    the night has been unruly where we lay   the chimneys were blown down    macbeth   we have for a day or two past had a flow of unruly weather which has intruded itself into this fair and flowery month and for a time has quite marred the beauty of the landscape last night the storm attained its crisis the rain beat in torrents against the casements and the wind piped and blustered about the old hall with quite a wintry vehemence the morning however dawned clear and serene the face of the heavens seemed as if newly washed and the sun shone with a brightness that was undimmed by a single vapour nothing overhead gave traces of the recent storm but on looking from my window i beheld sad ravage among the shrubs and flowers the gardenwalks had formed the channels for little torrents trees were lopped of their branches and a small silver stream that wound through the park and ran at the bottom of the lawn had swelled into a turbid yellow sheet of water  in an establishment like this where the mansion is vast ancient and somewhat afflicted with the infirmities of age and where there are numerous and extensive dependencies a storm is an event of a very grave nature and brings in its train a multiplicity of cares and disasters  while the squire was taking his breakfast in the great hall he was continually interrupted by some bearer of illtidings from some part or other of his domains he appeared to me like the commander of a besieged city after some grand assault receiving at his headquarters reports of damages sustained in the various quarters of the place at one time the housekeeper brought him intelligence of a chimney blown down and a desperate leak sprung in the roof over the picture gallery which threatened to obliterate a whole generation of his ancestors then the steward came in with a doleful story of the mischief done in the woodlands while the gamekeeper bemoaned the loss of one of his finest bucks whose bloated carcass was seen floating along the swoln current of the river  when the squire issued forth he was accosted before the door by the old paralytic gardener with a face full of trouble reporting as i supposed the devastation of his flowerbeds and the destruction of his wallfruit i remarked however that his intelligence caused a peculiar expression of concern not only with the squire and master simon but with the fair julia and lady lillycraft who happened to be present from a few words which reached my ear i found there was some tale of domestic calamity in the case and that some unfortunate family had been rendered houseless by the storm many ejaculations of pity broke from the ladies i heard the expressions of poor helpless beings and unfortunate little creatures several times repeated to which the old gardener replied by very melancholy shakes of the head  i felt so interested that i could not help calling to the gardener as he was retiring and asking what unfortunate family it was that had suffered so severely the old man touched his hat and gazed at me for an instant as if hardly comprehending my question family replied he there be no family in the case your honour but here have been sad mischief done in the rookery  i had noticed the day before that the high and gusty winds which prevailed had occasioned great disquiet among these airy householders their nests being all filled with young who were in danger of being tilted out of their treerocked cradles indeed the old birds themselves seemed to have hard work to maintain a foothold some kept hovering and cawing in the air or if they ventured to alight they had to hold fast flap their wings and spread their tails and thus remain seesawing on the topmost twigs  in the course of the night however an awful calamity had taken place in this most sage and politic community there was a great tree the tallest in the grove which seemed to have been a kind of courtend of the metropolis and crowded with the residence of those whom master simon considers the nobility and gentry a decayed limb of this tree had given way with the violence of this storm and had come down with all its aircastles  one should be well aware of the humours of the good squire and his household to understand the general concern expressed at this disaster it was quite a public calamity in this rural empire and all seemed to feel for the poor rooks as for fellowcitizens in distress  the ground had been strewed with the callow young which were now cherished in the aprons and bosoms of the maidservants and the little ladies of the family i was pleased with this touch of nature this feminine sympathy in the sufferings of the offspring and the maternal anxiety of the parent birds  it was interesting too to witness the general agitation and distress that seemed to prevail throughout the feathered community the common cause that was made of it and the incessant hovering and fluttering and lamenting that took place in the whole rookery there is a cord of sympathy that runs through the whole feathered race as to any misfortunes of the young and the cries of a wounded bird in the breeding season will throw a whole grove in a flutter and an alarm indeed why should i confine it to the feathered tribe nature seems to me to have implanted an exquisite sympathy on this subject which extends through all her works it is an invariable attribute of the female heart to melt at the cry of early helplessness and to take an instinctive interest in the distresses of the parent and its young on the present occasion the ladies of the family were full of pity and commiseration and i shall never forget the look that lady lillycraft gave the general on his observing that the young birds would make an excellent curry or an especial good rookpie     lovers troubles    the poor soul sat singing by a sycamore tree   sing all a green willow   her hand on her bosom her head on her knee   sing willow willow willow   sing all a green willow must be my garland    old song   the fair julia having nearly recovered from the effects of her hawking disaster it begins to be thought high time to appoint a day for the wedding as every domestic event in a venerable and aristocratic family connexion like this is a matter of moment the fixing upon this important day has of course given rise to much conference and debate  some slight difficulties and demurs have lately sprung up originating in the peculiar humours that are prevalent at the hall thus i have overheard a very solemn consultation between lady lillycraft the parson and master simon as to whether the marriage ought not to be postponed until the coming month  with all the charms of the flowery month of may there is i find an ancient prejudice against it as a marrying month an old proverb says to wed in may is to wed poverty now as lady lillycraft is very much given to believe in lucky and unlucky times and seasons and indeed is very superstitious on all points relating to the tender passion this old proverb seems to have taken great hold upon her mind she recollects two or three instances in her own knowledge of matches that took place in this month and proved very unfortunate indeed an own cousin of hers who married on a mayday lost her husband by a fall from his horse after they had lived happily together for twenty years  the parson appeared to give great weight to her ladyships objections and acknowledged the existence of a prejudice of the kind not merely confined to modern times but prevalent likewise among the ancients in confirmation of this he quoted a passage from ovid which had a great effect on lady lillycraft being given in a language which she did not understand even master simon was staggered by it for he listened with a puzzled air and then shaking his head sagaciously observed that ovid was certainly a very wise man  from this sage conference i likewise gathered several other important pieces of information relative to weddings such as that if two were celebrated in the same church on the same day the first would be happy the second unfortunate if on going to church the bridal party should meet the funeral of a female it was an omen that the bride would die first if of a male the bridegroom if the newlymarried couple were to dance together on their weddingday the wife would thenceforth rule the roast with many other curious and unquestionable facts of the same nature all which made me ponder more than ever upon the perils which surround this happy state and the thoughtless ignorance of mortals as to the awful risks they run in venturing upon it i abstain however from enlarging upon this topic having no inclination to promote the increase of bachelors  notwithstanding the due weight which the squire gives to traditional saws and ancient opinions yet i am happy to find that he makes a firm stand for the credit of this loving month and brings to his aid a whole legion of poetical authorities all which i presume have been conclusive with the young couple as i understand they are perfectly willing to marry in may and abide the consequences in a few days therefore the wedding is to take place and the hall is in a buzz of anticipation the housekeeper is bustling about from morning till night with a look full of business and importance having a thousand arrangements to make the squire intending to keep open house on the occasion and as to the housemaids you cannot look one of them in the face but the rogue begins to colour up and simper  while however this leading love affair is going on with a tranquillity quite inconsistent with the rules of romance i cannot say that the underplots are equally propitious the opening bud of love between the general and lady lillycraft seems to have experienced some blight in the course of this genial season i do not think the general has ever been able to retrieve the ground he lost when he fell asleep during the captains story indeed master simon thinks his case is completely desperate her ladyship having determined that he is quite destitute of sentiment  the season has been equally unpropitious to the lovelorn phoebe wilkins i fear the reader will be impatient at having this humble amour so often alluded to but i confess i am apt to take a great interest in the love troubles of simple girls of this class few people have an idea of the world of care and perplexity that these poor damsels have in managing the affairs of the heart  we talk and write about the tender passion we give it all the colourings of sentiment and romance and lay the scene of its influence in high life but after all i doubt whether its sway is not more absolute among females of an humbler sphere how often could we but look into the heart should we find the sentiment throbbing in all its violence in the bosom of the poor ladysmaid rather than in that of the brilliant beauty she is decking out for conquest whose brain is probably bewildered with beaux ballrooms and waxlight chandeliers  with these humble beings love is an honest engrossing concern they have no ideas of settlements establishments equipages and pinmoney the heartthe heart is allinall with them poor things there is seldom one of them but has her love cares and love secrets her doubts and hopes and fears equal to those of any heroine of romance and ten times as sincere and then too there is her secret hoard of love documentsthe broken sixpence the gilded brooch the lock of hair the unintelligible love scrawl all treasured up in her box of sunday finery for private contemplation  how many crosses and trials is she exposed to from some lynxeyed dame or staid old vestal of a mistress who keeps a dragon watch over her virtue and scouts the lover from the door but then how sweet are the little love scenes snatched at distant intervals of holiday and fondly dwelt on through many a long day of household labour and confinement if in the country it is the dance at the fair or wake the interview in the churchyard after service or the evening stroll in the green lane if in town it is perhaps merely a stolen moment of delicious talk between the bars of the area fearful every instant of being seen and then how lightly will the simple creature carol all day afterwards at her labour  poor baggage after all her crosses and difficulties when she marries what is it but to exchange a life of comparative ease and comfort for one of toil and uncertainty perhaps too the lover for whom in the fondness of her nature she has committed herself to fortunes freaks turns out a worthless churl the dissolute hardhearted husband of low life who taking to the alehouse leaves her to a cheerless home to labour penury and childbearing  when i see poor phoebe going about with drooping eye and her head hanging all o one side i cannot help calling to mind the pathetic little picture drawn by desdemona    my mother had a maid called barbara   she was in love and he she loved proved mad   and did forsake her she had a song of willow   an old thing twas but it expressd her fortune   and she died singing it  i hope however that a better lot is in reserve for phoebe wilkins and that she may yet rule the roast in the ancient empire of the tibbets she is not fit to battle with hard hearts or hard times she was i am told the pet of her poor mother who was proud of the beauty of her child and brought her up more tenderly than a village girl ought to be and ever since she has been left an orphan the good ladies at the hall have completed the softening and spoiling of her  i have recently observed her holding long conferences in the churchyard and up and down one of the lanes near the village with slingsby the schoolmaster i at first thought the pedagogue might be touched with the tender malady so prevalent in these parts of late but i did him injustice honest slingsby it seems was a friend and crony of her late father the parish clerk and is on intimate terms with the tibbets family prompted therefore by his goodwill towards all parties and secretly instigated perhaps by the managing dame tibbets he has undertaken to talk with phoebe upon the subject he gives her however but little encouragement slingsby has a formidable opinion of the aristocratical feeling of old readymoney and thinks if phoebe were even to make the matter up with the son she would find the father totally hostile to the match the poor damsel therefore is reduced almost to despair and slingsby who is too goodnatured not to sympathize in her distress has advised her to give up all thoughts of young jack and has proposed as a substitute his learned coadjutor the prodigal son he has even in the fullness of his heart offered to give up the schoolhouse to them though it would leave him once more adrift in the wide world     the historian    hermione pray you sit by us               and tells a tale    mamilius merry or sad shallt be    hermione as merry as you will    mamilius a sad tales best for winter               i have one of sprites and goblins    hermione lets have that sir    winters tale   as this is a storytelling age i have been tempted occasionally to give the reader one of the many tales that are served up with supper at the hall i might indeed have furnished a series almost equal in number to the arabian nights but some were rather hackneyed and tedious others i did not feel warranted in betraying into print and many more were of the old generals relating and turned principally upon tigerhunting elephantriding and seringapatam enlivened by the wonderful deeds of tippoo saib and the excellent jokes of major pendergast  i had all along maintained a quiet post at a corner of the table where i had been able to indulge my humour undisturbed listening attentively when the story was very good and dozing a little when it was rather dull which i consider the perfection of auditorship  i was roused the other evening from a slight trance into which i had fallen during one of the generals histories by a sudden call from the squire to furnish some entertainment of the kind in my turn having been so profound a listener to others i could not in conscience refuse but neither my memory nor invention being ready to answer so unexpected a demand i begged leave to read a manuscript tale from the pen of my fellowcountryman the late mr diedrich knickerbocker the historian of newyork as this ancient chronicler may not be better known to my readers than he was to the company at the hall a word or two concerning him may not be amiss before proceeding to his manuscript  diedrich knickerbocker was a native of newyork a descendant from one of the ancient dutch families which originally settled that province and remained there after it was taken possession of by the english in 1664 the descendants of these dutch families still remain in villages and neighbourhoods in various parts of the country retaining with singular obstinacy the dresses manners and even language of their ancestors and forming a very distinct and curious feature in the motley population of the state in a hamlet whose spire may be seen from newyork rising from above the brow of a hill on the opposite side of the hudson many of the old folks even at the present day speak english with an accent and the dominie preaches in dutch and so completely is the hereditary love of quiet and silence maintained that in one of these drowsy villages in the middle of a warm summers day the buzzing of a stout bluebottle fly will resound from one end of the place to the other  with the laudable hereditary feeling thus kept up among these worthy people did mr knickerbocker undertake to write a history of his native city comprising the reign of its three dutch governors during the time that it was yet under the domination of the hogenmogens of holland in the execution of this design the little dutchman has displayed great historical research and a wonderful consciousness of the dignity of his subject his work however has been so little understood as to be pronounced a mere work of humour satirizing the follies of the times both in politics and morals and giving whimsical views of human nature  be this as it mayamong the papers left behind him were several tales of a lighter nature apparently thrown together from materials which he had gathered during his profound researches for his history and which he seems to have cast by with neglect as unworthy of publication some of these have fallen into my hands by an accident which it is needless at present to mention and one of these very stories with its prelude in the words of mr knickerbocker i undertook to read by way of acquitting myself of the debt which i owed to the other storytellers at the hall i subjoin it for such of my readers as are fond of stories12  footnote 12 i find that the tale of rip van winkle given in the sketchbook has been discovered by divers writers in magazines to have been founded on a little german tradition and the matter has been revealed to the world as if it were a foul instance of plagiarism marvellously brought to light in a note which follows that tale i had alluded to the superstition on which it was founded and i thought a mere allusion was sufficient as the tradition was so notorious as to be inserted in almost every collection of german legends i had seen it myself in three i could hardly have hoped therefore in the present age when every source of ghost and goblin story is ransacked that the origin of the tale would escape discovery in fact i had considered popular traditions of the kind as fair foundations for authors of fiction to build upon and made use of the one in question accordingly i am not disposed to contest the matter however and indeed consider myself so completely overpaid by the public for my trivial performances that i am content to submit to any deduction which in their afterthoughts they may think proper to make     the haunted house  from the mss of the late diedrich knickerbocker    formerly almost every place had a house of this kind if a house   was seated on some melancholy place or built in some old romantic   manner or if any particular accident had happened in it such as   murder sudden death or the like to be sure that house had a mark   set upon it and was afterwards esteemed the habitation of a   ghost    bournes antiquities   in the neighbourhood of the ancient city of the manhattoes there stood not very many years since an old mansion which when i was a boy went by the name of the haunted house it was one of the very few remains of the architecture of the early dutch settlers and must have been a house of some consequence at the time when it was built it consisted of a centre and two wings the gableends of which were shaped like stairs it was built partly of wood and partly of small dutch bricks such as the worthy colonists brought with them from holland before they discovered that bricks could be manufactured elsewhere the house stood remote from the road in the centre of a large field with an avenue of old locust13 trees leading up to it several of which had been shivered by lightning and two or three blown down a few appletrees grow straggling about the field there were traces also of what had been a kitchengarden but the fences were broken down the vegetables had disappeared or had grown wild and turned to little better than weeds with here and there a ragged rosebush or a tall sunflower shooting up from among brambles and hanging its head sorrowfully as if contemplating the surrounding desolation part of the roof of the old house had fallen in the windows were shattered the panels of the doors broken and mended with rough boards and there were two rusty weathercocks at the ends of the house which made a great jingling and whistling as they whirled about but always pointed wrong the appearance of the whole place was forlorn and desolate at the best of times but in unruly weather the howling of the wind about the crazy old mansion the screeching of the weathercocks the slamming and banging of a few loose windowshutters had altogether so wild and dreary an effect that the neighbourhood stood perfectly in awe of the place and pronounced it the rendezvous of hobgoblins i recollect the old building well for i remember how many times when an idle unlucky urchin i have prowled round its precincts with some of my graceless companions on holiday afternoons when out on a freebooting cruise among the orchards there was a tree standing near the house that bore the most beautiful and tempting fruit but then it was on enchanted ground for the place was so charmed by frightful stories that we dreaded to approach it sometimes we would venture in a body and get near the hesperian tree keeping an eye upon the old mansion and darting fearful glances into its shattered window when just as we were about to seize upon our prize an exclamation from some one of the gang or an accidental noise would throw us all into a panic and we would scamper headlong from the place nor stop until we had got quite into the road then there were sure to be a host of fearful anecdotes told of strange cries and groans or of some hideous face suddenly seen staring out of one of the windows by degrees we ceased to venture into these lonely grounds but would stand at a distance and throw stones at the building and there was something fearfully pleasing in the sound as they rattled along the roof or sometimes struck some jingling fragments of glass out of the windows  footnote 13 acacias  the origin of this house was lost in the obscurity that covers the early period of the province while under the government of their high mightinesses the statesgeneral some reported it to have been a country residence of wilhelmus kieft commonly called the testy one of the dutch governors of newamsterdam others said that it had been built by a naval commander who served under van tromp and who on being disappointed of preferment retired from the service in disgust became a philosopher through sheer spite and brought over all his wealth to the province that he might live according to his humour and despise the world the reason of its having fallen to decay was likewise a matter of dispute some said that it was in chancery and had already cost more than its worth in legal expenses but the most current and of course the most probable account was that it was haunted and that nobody could live quietly in it there can in fact be very little doubt that this last was the case there were so many corroborating stories to prove itnot an old woman in the neighbourhood but could furnish at least a score there was a grayheaded curmudgeon of a negro that lived hard by who had a whole budget of them to tell many of which had happened to himself i recollect many a time stopping with my schoolmates and getting him to relate some the old crone lived in a hovel in the midst of a small patch of potatoes and indian corn which his master had given him on setting him free he would come to us with his hoe in his hand and as we sat perched like a row of swallows on the rail of the fence in the mellow twilight of a summer evening he would tell us such fearful stories accompanied by such awful rollings of his white eyes that we were almost afraid of our own footsteps as we returned home afterwards in the dark  poor old pompey many years are past since he died and went to keep company with the ghosts he was so fond of talking about he was buried in a comer of his own little potatopatch the plough soon passed over his grave and levelled it with the rest of the field and nobody thought any more of the grayheaded negro by a singular chance i was strolling in that neighbourhood several years afterwards when i had grown up to be a young man and i found a knot of gossips speculating on a skull which had just been turned up by a ploughshare they of course determined it to be the remains of some one that had been murdered and they had raked up with it some of the traditionary tales of the haunted house i knew it at once to be the relic of poor pompey but i held my tongue for i am too considerate of other peoples enjoyment ever to mar a story of a ghost or a murder i took care however to see the bones of my old friend once more buried in a place where they were not likely to be disturbed as i sat on the turf and watched the interment i fell into a long conversation with an old gentleman of the neighbourhood john josse vandermoere a pleasant gossiping man whose whole life was spent in hearing and telling the news of the province he recollected old pompey and his stories about the haunted house but he assured me he could give me one still more strange than any that pompey had related and on my expressing a great curiosity to hear it he sat down beside me on the turf and told the following tale i have endeavoured to give it as nearly as possible in his words but it is now many years since and i am grown old and my memory is not overgood i cannot therefore vouch for the language but i am always scrupulous as to facts     dolph heyliger    i take the town of concord where i dwell   all

the english governor lord cornbury who carried his cruelties towards the dutch inhabitants so far as to allow no dominie or schoolmaster to officiate in their language without his special license about this time there lived in the jolly little old city of the manhattoes a kind motherly dame known by the name of dame heyliger she was the widow of a dutch seacaptain who died suddenly of a fever in consequence of working too hard and eating too heartily at the time when all the inhabitants turned out in a panic to fortify the place against the invasion of a small french privateer14 he left her with very little money and one infant son the only survivor of several children the good woman had need of much management to make both ends meet and keep up a decent appearance however as her husband had fallen a victim to his zeal for the public safety it was universally agreed that something ought to be done for the widow and on the hopes of this something she lived tolerably for some years in the meantime every body pitied and spoke well of her and that helped along  footnote 14 1705  she lived in a small house in a small street called gardenstreet very probably from a garden which may have flourished there some time or other as her necessities every year grew greater and the talk of the public about doing something for her grew less she had to cast about for some mode of doing something for herself by way of helping out her slender means and maintaining her independence of which she was somewhat tenacious  living in a mercantile town she had caught something of the spirit and determined to venture a little in the great lottery of commerce on a sudden therefore to the great surprise of the street there appeared at her window a grand array of gingerbread kings and queens with their arms stuck akimbo after the invariable royal manner there were also several broken tumblers some filled with sugarplums some with marbles there were moreover cakes of various kinds and barley sugar and holland dolls and wooden horses with here and there giltcovered picturebooks and now and then a skein of thread or a dangling pound of candles at the door of the house sat the good old dames cat a decent demurelooking personage that seemed to scan every body that passed to criticise their dress and now and then to stretch her neck and look out with sudden curiosity to see what was going on at the other end of the street but if by chance any idle vagabond dog came by and offered to be uncivilhoitytoityhow she would bristle up and growl and spit and strike out her paws she was as indignant as ever was an ancient and ugly spinster on the approach of some graceless profligate  but though the good woman had to come down to these humble means of subsistence yet she still kept up a feeling of family pride having descended from the vanderspiegels of amsterdam and she had the family arms painted and framed and hung over her mantelpiece she was in truth much respected by all the poorer people of the place her house was quite a resort of the old wives of the neighbourhood they would drop in there of a winters afternoon as she sat knitting on one side of her fireplace her cat purring on the other and the teakettle singing before it and they would gossip with her until late in the evening there was always an armchair for peter de groodt sometimes called long peter and sometimes peter longlegs the clerk and sexton of the little lutheran church who was her great crony and indeed the oracle of her fireside nay the dominie himself did not disdain now and then to step in converse about the state of her mind and take a glass of her special good cherrybrandy indeed he never failed to call on newyears day and wish her a happy new year and the good dame who was a little vain on some points always piqued herself on giving him as large a cake as any one in town  i have said that she had one son he was the child of her old age but could hardly be called the comfortfor of all unlucky urchins dolph heyliger was the most mischievous not that the whipster was really vicious he was only full of fun and frolic and had that daring gamesome spirit which is extolled in a rich mans child but execrated in a poor mans he was continually getting into scrapes his mother was incessantly harassed with complaints of some waggish pranks which he had played off bills were sent in for windows that he had broken in a word he had not reached his fourteenth year before he was pronounced by all the neighbourhood to be a wicked dog the wickedest dog in the street nay one old gentleman in a claretcoloured coat with a thin red face and ferret eyes went so far as to assure dame heyliger that her son would one day or other come to the gallows  yet notwithstanding all this the poor old soul loved her boy it seemed as though she loved him the better the worse he behaved and that he grew more in her favour the more he grew out of favour with the world mothers are foolish fondhearted beings theres no reasoning them out of their dotage and indeed this poor womans child was all that was left to love her in this worldso we must not think it hard that she turned a deaf ear to her good friends who sought to prove to her that dolph would come to a halter  to do the varlet justice too he was strongly attached to his parent he would not willingly have given her pain on any account and when he had been doing wrong it was but for him to catch his poor mothers eye fixed wistfully and sorrowfully upon him to fill his heart with bitterness and contrition but he was a heedless youngster and could not for the life of him resist any new temptation to fun and mischief though quick at his learning whenever he could be brought to apply himself yet he was always prone to be led away by idle company and would play truant to hunt after birdsnests to rob orchards or to swim in the hudson  in this way he grew up a tall lubberly boy and his mother began to be greatly perplexed what to do with him or how to put him in a way to do for himself for he had acquired such an unlucky reputation that no one seemed willing to employ him  many were the consultations that she held with peter de groodt the clerk and sexton who was her prime counsellor peter was as much perplexed as herself for he had no great opinion of the boy and thought he would never come to good he at one time advised her to send him to seaa piece of advice only given in the most desperate cases but dame heyliger would not listen to such an idea she could not think of letting dolph go out of her sight she was sitting one day knitting by her fireside in great perplexity when the sexton entered with an air of unusual vivacity and briskness he had just come from a funeral it had been that of a boy of dolphs years who had been apprentice to a famous german doctor and had died of a consumption it is true there had been a whisper that the deceased had been brought to his end by being made the subject of the doctors experiments on which he was apt to try the effects of a new compound or a quieting draught this however it is likely was a mere scandal at any rate peter de groodt did not think it worth mentioning though had we time to philosophize it would be a curious matter for speculation why a doctors family is apt to be so lean and cadaverous and a butchers so jolly and rubicund  peter de groodt as i said before entered the house of dame heyliger with unusual alacrity he was full of a bright idea that had popped into his head at the funeral and over which he had chuckled as he shovelled the earth into the grave of the doctors disciple it had occurred to him that as the situation of the deceased was vacant at the doctors it would be the very place for dolph the boy had parts and could pound a pestle and run an errand with any boy in the townand what more was wanted in a student  the suggestion of the sage peter was a vision of glory to the mother she already saw dolph in her minds eye with a cane at his nose a knocker at his door and an md at the end of his nameone of the established dignitaries of the town  the matter once undertaken was soon effected the sexton had some influence with the doctor they having had much dealing together in the way of their separate professions and the very next morning he called and conducted the urchin clad in his sunday clothes to undergo the inspection of dr karl lodovick knipperhausen  they found the doctor seated in an elbowchair in one corner of his study or laboratory with a large volume in german print before him he was a short fat man with a dark square face rendered more dark by a black velvet cap he had a little knobbed nose not unlike the ace of spades with a pair of spectacles gleaming on each side of his dusky countenance like a couple of bowwindows  dolph felt struck with awe on entering into the presence of this learned man and gazed about him with boyish wonder at the furniture of this chamber of knowledge which appeared to him almost as the den of a magician in the centre stood a clawfooted table with pestle and mortar phials and gallipots and a pair of small burnished scales at one end was a heavy clothespress turned into a receptacle for drugs and compounds against which hung the doctors hat and cloak and goldheaded cane and on the top grinned a human skull along the mantelpiece were glass vessels in which were snakes and lizards and a human foetus preserved in spirits a closet the doors of which were taken off contained three whole shelves of books and some too of mighty folio dimensionsa collection the like of which dolph had never before beheld as however the library did not take up the whole of the closet the doctors thrifty housekeeper had occupied the rest with pots of pickles and preserves and had hung about the room among awful implements of the healing art strings of red pepper and corpulent cucumbers carefully preserved for seed  peter de groodt and his protégé were received with great gravity and stateliness by the doctor who was a very wise dignified little man and never smiled he surveyed dolph from head to foot above and under and through his spectacles and the poor lads heart quailed as these great glasses glared on him like two full moons the doctor heard all that peter de groodt had to say in favour of the youthful candidate and then wetting his thumb with the end of his tongue he began deliberately to turn over page after page of the great black volume before him at length after many hums and haws and strokings of the chin and all that hesitation and deliberation with which a wise man proceeds to do what he intended to do from the very first the doctor agreed to take the lad as a disciple to give him bed board and clothing and to instruct him in the healing art in return for which he was to have his services until his twentyfirst year  behold then our hero all at once transformed from an unlucky urchin running wild about the streets to a student of medicine diligently pounding a pestle under the auspices of the learned doctor karl lodovick knipperhausen it was a happy transition for his fond old mother she was delighted with the idea of her boys being brought up worthy of his ancestors and anticipated the day when he would be able to hold up his head with the lawyer that lived in the large house opposite or peradventure with the dominie himself  doctor knipperhausen was a native of the palatinate of germany from whence in company with many of his countrymen he had taken refuge in england on account of religious persecution he was one of nearly three thousand palatines who came over from england in 1710 under the protection of governor hunter where the doctor had studied how he had acquired his medical knowledge and where he had received his diploma it is hard at present to say for nobody knew at the time yet it is certain that his profound skill and abstruse knowledge were the talk and wonder of the common people far and near  his practice was totally different from that of any other physician consisting in mysterious compounds known only to himself in the preparing and administering of which it was said he always consulted the stars so high an opinion was entertained of his skill particularly by the german and dutch inhabitants that they always resorted to him in desperate cases he was one of those infallible doctors that are always effecting sudden and surprising cures when the patient has been given up by all the regular physicians unless as is shrewdly observed the case has been left too long before it was put into their hands the doctors library was the talk and marvel of the neighbourhood i might almost say of the entire burgh the good people looked with reverence at a man that had read three whole shelves full of books and some of them too as large as a family bible there were many disputes among the members of the little lutheran church as to which was the wiser man the doctor or the dominie some of his admirers even went so far as to say that he knew more than the governor himselfin a word it was thought that there was no end to his knowledge  no sooner was dolph received into the doctors family than he was put in possession of the lodging of his predecessor it was a garretroom of a steeproofed dutch house where the rain patted on the shingles and the lightning gleamed and the wind piped through the crannies in stormy weather and where whole troops of hungry rats like don cossacks galloped about in defiance of traps and ratsbane  he was soon up to his ears in medical studies being employed morning noon and night in rolling pills filtering tinctures or pounding the pestle and mortar in one corner of the laboratory while the doctor would take his seat in another corner when he had nothing else to do or expected visitors and arrayed in his morninggown and velvet cap would pore over the contents of some folio volume it is true that the regular thumping of dolphs pestle or perhaps the drowsy buzzing of the summer flies would now and then lull the little man into a slumber but then his spectacles were always wide awake and studiously regarding the book  there was another personage in the house however to whom dolph was obliged to pay allegiance though a bachelor and a man of such great dignity and importance yet the doctor was like many other wise men subject to petticoat government he was completely under the sway of his housekeeper a spare busy fretting housewife in a little round quilted german cap with a huge bunch of keys jingling at the girdle of an exceedingly long waist frau ilsé or frow ilsy as it was pronounced had accompanied him in his various migrations from germany to england and from england to the province managing his establishment and himself too ruling him it is true with a gentle hand but carrying a high hand with all the world beside how she had acquired such ascendency i do not pretend to say people it is true did talkbut have not people been prone to talk ever since the world began who can tell how women generally contrive to get the upper hand a husband it is true may now and then be master in his own house but who ever knew a bachelor that was not managed by his housekeeper  indeed frau ilsys power was not confined to the doctors household she was one of those prying gossips that know every ones business better than they do themselves and whose allseeing eyes and alltelling tongues are terrors throughout a neighbourhood  nothing of any moment transpired in the world of scandal of this little burgh but it was known to frau ilsy she had her crew of cronies that were perpetually hurrying to her little parlour with some precious bit of news nay she would sometimes discuss a whole volume of secret history as she held the streetdoor ajar and gossiped with one of these garrulous cronies in the very teeth of a december blast  between the doctor and the housekeeper it may easily be supposed that dolph had a busy life of it as frau ilsy kept the keys and literally ruled the roast it was starvation to offend her though he found the study of her temper more perplexing even than that of medicine when not busy in the laboratory she kept him running hither and thither on her errands and on sundays he was obliged to accompany her to and from church and carry her bible many a time has the poor varlet stood shivering and blowing his fingers or holding his frostbitten nose in the churchyard while ilsy and her cronies were huddled together wagging their heads and tearing some unlucky character to pieces  with all his advantages however dolph made very slow progress in his art this was no fault of the doctors certainly for he took unwearied pains with the lad keeping him close to the pestle and mortar or on the trot about town with phials and pillboxes and if he ever flagged in his industry which he was rather apt to do the doctor would fly into a passion and ask him if he ever expected to learn his profession unless he applied himself closer to the study the fact is he still retained the fondness for sport and mischief that had marked his childhood the habit indeed had strengthened with his years and gained force from being thwarted and constrained he daily grew more and more untractable and lost favour in the eyes both of the doctor and the housekeeper  in the meantime the doctor went on waxing wealthy and renowned he was famous for his skill in managing cases not laid down in the books he had cured several old women and young girls of witchcraft a terrible complaint nearly as prevalent in the province in those days as hydrophobia is at present he had even restored one strapping country girl to perfect health who had gone so far as to vomit crooked pins and needles which is considered a desperate stage of the malady it was whispered also that he was possessed of the art of preparing lovepowders and many applications had he in consequence from lovesick patients of both sexes but all these cases formed the mysterious part of his practice in which according to the cant phrase secrecy and honour might be depended on dolph therefore was obliged to turn out of the study whenever such consultations occurred though it is said he learnt more of the secrets of the art at the keyhole than by all the rest of his studies put together  as the doctor increased in wealth he began to extend his possessions and to look forward like other great men to the time when he should retire to the repose of a countryseat for this purpose he had purchased a farm or as the dutch settlers called it a bowerie a few miles from town it had been the residence of a wealthy family that had returned some time since to holland a large mansionhouse stood in the centre of it very much out of repair and which in consequence of certain reports had received the appellation of the haunted house either from these reports or from its actual dreariness the doctor had found it impossible to get a tenant and that the place might not fall to ruin before he could reside in it himself he had placed a country boor with his family in one wing with the privilege of cultivating the farm on shares  the doctor now felt all the dignity of a landholder rising within him he had a little of the german pride of territory in his composition and almost looked upon himself as owner of a principality he began to complain of the fatigue of business and was fond of riding out to look at his estate his little expeditions to his lands were attended with a bustle and parade that created a sensation throughout the neighbourhood his walleyed horse stood stamping and whisking off the flies for a full hour before the house then the doctors saddlebags would be brought out and adjusted then after a little while his cloak would be rolled up and strapped to the saddle then his umbrella would be buckled to the cloak while in the meantime a group of ragged boys that observant class of beings would gather before the door at length the doctor would issue forth in a pair of jackboots that reached above his knees and a cocked hat flapped down in front as he was a short fat man he took some time to mount into the saddle and when there he took some time to have the saddle and stirrups properly adjusted enjoying the wonder and admiration of the urchin crowd even after he had set off he would pause in the middle of the street or trot back two or three times to give some parting orders which were answered by the housekeeper from the door or dolph from the study or the black cook from the cellar or the chambermaid from the garretwindow and there were generally some last words bawled after him just as he was turning the corner  the whole neighbourhood would be aroused by this pomp and circumstance the cobbler would leave his last the barber would thrust out his frizzed head with a comb sticking in it a knot would collect at the grocers door and the word would be buzzed from one end of the street to the other the doctors riding out to his countryseat  these were golden moments for dolph no sooner was the doctor out of sight than pestle and mortar were abandoned the laboratory was left to take care of itself and the student was off on some madcap frolic  indeed it must be confessed the youngster as he grew up seemed in a fair way to fulfil the prediction of the old claretcoloured gentleman he was the ringleader of all holiday sports and midnight gambols ready for all kinds of mischievous pranks and harebrained adventures  there is nothing so troublesome as a hero on a small scale or rather a hero in a small town dolph soon became the abhorrence of all drowsy housekeeping old citizens who hated noise and had no relish for waggery the good dames too considered him as little better than a reprobate gathered their daughters under their wings whenever he approached and pointed him out as a warning to their sons no one seemed to hold him in much regard excepting the wild striplings of the place who were captivated by his openhearted daring manners and the negroes who always look upon every idle donothing youngster as a kind of gentleman even the good peter de groodt who had considered himself a kind of patron of the lad began to despair of him and would shake his head dubiously as he listened to a long complaint from the housekeeper and sipped a glass of her raspberry brandy  still his mother was not to be wearied out of her affection by all the waywardness of her boy nor disheartened by the stories of his misdeeds with which her good friends were continually regaling her she had it is true very little of the pleasure which rich people enjoy in always hearing their children praised but she considered all this illwill as a kind of persecution which he suffered and she liked him the better on that account she saw him growing up a fine tall goodlooking youngster and she looked at him with the secret pride of a mothers heart it was her great desire that dolph should appear like a gentleman and all the money she could save went towards helping out his pocket and his wardrobe she would look out of the window after him as he sallied forth in his best array and her heart would yearn with delight and once when peter de groodt struck with the youngsters gallant appearance on a bright sunday morning observed well after all dolph does grow a comely fellow the tear of pride started into the mothers eye ah neighbour neighbour exclaimed she they may say what they please poor dolph will yet hold up his head with the best of them  dolph heyliger had now nearly attained his oneandtwentieth year and the term of his medical studies was just expiring yet it must be confessed that he knew little more of the profession than when he first entered the doctors doors this however could not be from want of quickness of parts for he showed amazing aptness in mastering other branches of knowledge which he could only have studied at intervals he was for instance a sure marksman and won all the geese and turkeys at christmas holidays he was a bold rider he was famous for leaping and wrestling he played tolerably on the fiddle could swim like a fish and was the best hand in the whole place at fives or ninepins  all these accomplishments however procured him no favour in the eyes of the doctor who grew more and more crabbed and intolerant the nearer the term of apprenticeship approached frau ilsy too was for ever finding some occasion to raise a windy tempest about his ears and seldom encountered him about the house without a clatter of the tongue so that at length the jingling of her keys as she approached was to dolph like the ringing of the prompters bell that gives notice of a theatrical thunderstorm nothing but the infinite goodhumour of the heedless youngster enabled him to bear all this domestic tyranny without open rebellion it was evident that the doctor and his housekeeper were preparing to beat the poor youth out of the nest the moment his term should have expired a shorthand mode which the doctor had of providing for useless disciples  indeed the little man had been rendered more than usually irritable lately in consequence of various cares and vexations which his country estate had brought upon him the doctor had been repeatedly annoyed by the rumours and tales which prevailed concerning the old mansion and found it difficult to prevail even upon the countryman and his family to remain there rentfree every time he rode out to the farm he was teased by some fresh complaint of strange noises and fearful sights with which the tenants were disturbed at night and the doctor would come home fretting and fuming and vent his spleen upon the whole household it was indeed a sore grievance that affected him both in pride and purse he was threatened with an absolute loss of the profits of his property and then what a blow to his territorial consequence to be the landlord of a haunted house  it was observed however that with all his vexation the doctor never proposed to sleep in the house himself nay he could never be prevailed upon to remain in the premises after dark but made the best of his way for town as soon as the bats began to flit about in the twilight the fact was the doctor had a secret belief in ghosts having passed the early part of his life in a country where they particularly abound and indeed the story went that when a boy he had once seen the devil upon the hartz mountains in germany  at length the doctors vexations on this head were brought to a crisis one morning as he sat dozing over a volume in his study he was suddenly started from his slumbers by the bustling in of the housekeeper  heres a fine to do cried she as she entered the room heres claus hopper come in bag and baggage from the farm and swears hell have nothing more to do with it the whole family have been frightened out of their wits for theres such racketing and rummaging about the old house that they cant sleep quiet in their beds  donner und blitzen cried the doctor impatiently will they never have done chattering about that house what a pack of fools to let a few rats and mice frighten them out of good quarters  nay nay said the housekeeper wagging her head knowingly and piqued at having a good ghost story doubted theres more in it than rats and mice all the neighbourhood talks about the house and then such sights have been seen in it peter de groodt tells me that the family that sold you the house and went to holland dropped several strange hints about it and said they wished you joy of your bargain and you know yourself theres no getting any family to live in it  peter de groodts a ninnyan old woman said the doctor peevishly ill warrant hes been filling these peoples heads full of stories its just like his nonsense about the ghost that haunted the church belfry as an excuse for not ringing the bell that cold night when hermanus brinkerhoffs house was on fire send claus to me  claus hopper now made his appearance a simple country lout full of awe at finding himself in the very study of dr knipperhausen and too much embarrassed to enter into much detail of the matters that had caused his alarm he stood twirling his hat in one hand resting sometimes on one leg sometimes on the other looking occasionally at the doctor and now and then stealing a fearful glance at the deathshead that seemed ogling him from the top of the clothespress  the doctor tried every means to persuade him to return to the farm but all in vain he maintained a dogged determination on the subject and at the close of every argument or solicitation would make the same brief inflexible reply ich kan nicht mynheer the doctor was a little pot and soon hot his patience was exhausted by these continual vexations about his estate the stubborn refusal of claus hopper seemed to him like flat rebellion his temper suddenly boiled over and claus was glad to make a rapid retreat to escape scalding  when the bumpkin got to the housekeepers room he found peter de groodt and several other true believers ready to receive him here he indemnified himself for the restraint he had suffered in the study and opened a budget of stories about the haunted house that astonished all his hearers the housekeeper believed them all if it was only to spite the doctor for having received her intelligence so uncourteously peter de groodt matched them with many a wonderful legend of the times of the dutch dynasty and of the devils steppingstones and of the pirate that was hanged at gibbet island and continued to swing there at night long after the gallows was taken down and of the ghost of the unfortunate governor leisler who was hanged for treason which haunted the old fort and the government house the gossiping knot dispersed each charged with direful intelligence the sexton disburdened himself at a vestry meeting that was held that very day and the black cook forsook her kitchen and spent half the day at the street pump that gossiping place of servants dealing forth the news to all that came for water in a little time the whole town was in a buzz with tales about the haunted house some said that claus hopper had seen the devil while others hinted that the house was haunted by the ghosts of some of the patients whom the doctor had physicked out of the world and that was the reason why he did not venture to live in it himself  all this put the little doctor in a terrible fume he threatened vengeance on any one who should affect the value of his property by exciting popular prejudices he complained loudly of thus being in a manner dispossessed of his territories by mere bugbears but he secretly determined to have the house exorcised by the dominie great was his relief therefore when in the midst of his perplexities dolph stepped forward and undertook to garrison the haunted house the youngster had been listening to all the stories of claus hopper and peter de groodt he was fond of adventure he loved the marvellous and his imagination had become quite excited by these tales of wonder besides he had led such an uncomfortable life at the doctors being subjected to the intolerable thraldom of early hours that he was delighted at the prospect of having a house to himself even though it should be a haunted one his offer was eagerly accepted and it was determined that he should mount guard that very night his only stipulation was that the enterprise should be kept secret from his mother for he knew the poor soul would not sleep a wink if she knew that her son was waging war with the powers of darkness  when night came on he set out on this perilous expedition the old black cook his only friend in the household had provided him with a little mess for supper and a rushlight and she tied round his neck an amulet given her by an african conjurer as a charm against evil spirits dolph was escorted on his way by the doctor and peter de groodt who had agreed to accompany him to the house and to see him safe lodged the night was overcast and it was very dark when they arrived at the grounds which surrounded the mansion the sexton led the way with a lantern as they walked along the avenue of acacias the fitful light catching from bush to bush and tree to tree often startled the doughty peter and made him fall back upon his followers and the doctor grabbed still closer hold of dolphs arm observing that the ground was very slippery and uneven at one time they were nearly put to a total rout by a bat which came flitting about the lantern and the notes of the insects from the trees and the frogs from a neighbouring pond formed a most drowsy and doleful concert  the front door of the mansion opened with a grating sound that made the doctor turn pale they entered a tolerably large hall such as is common in american countryhouses and which serves for a sittingroom in warm weather from hence they went up a wide staircase that groaned and creaked as they trod every step making its particular note like the key of a harpsichord this led to another hall on the second story from whence they entered the room where dolph was to sleep it was large and scantily furnished the shutters were closed but as they were much broken there was no want of a circulation of air it appeared to have been that sacred chamber known among dutch housewives by the name of the best bedroom which is the best furnished room in the house but in which scarce any body is ever permitted to sleep its splendour however was all at an end there were a few broken articles of furniture about the room and in the centre stood a heavy deal table and a large armchair both of which had the look of being coeval with the mansion the fireplace was wide and had been faced with dutch tiles representing scripture stories but some of them had fallen out of their places and lay shattered about the hearth the sexton had lit the rushlight and the doctor looking fearfully about the room was just exhorting dolph to be of good cheer and to pluck up a stout heart when a noise in the chimney like voices and struggling struck a sudden panic into the sexton he took to his heels with the lantern the doctor followed hard after him the stairs groaned and creaked as they hurried down increasing their agitation and speed by its noises the front door slammed after them and dolph heard them scrabbling down the avenue till the sound of their feet was lost in the distance that he did not join in this precipitate retreat might have been owing to his possessing a little more courage than his companions or perhaps that he had caught a glimpse of the cause of their dismay in a nest of chimney swallows that came tumbling down into the fireplace  being now left to himself he secured the front door by a strong bolt and bar and having seen that the other entrances were fastened he returned to his desolate chamber having made his supper from the basket which the good old cook had provided he locked the chamber door and retired to rest on a mattress in one corner the night was calm and still and nothing broke upon the profound quiet but the lonely chirping of a cricket from the chimney of a distant chamber the rushlight which stood in the centre of the deal table shed a feeble yellow ray dimly illumining the chamber and making uncouth shapes and shadows on the walls from the clothes which dolph had thrown over a chair  with all his boldness of heart there was something subduing in this desolate scene and he felt his spirits flag within him as he lay on his hard bed and gazed about the room he was turning over in his mind his idle habits his doubtful prospects and now and then heaving a heavy sigh as he thought on his poor old mother for there is nothing like the silence and loneliness of night to bring dark shadows over the brightest mind byandby he thought he heard a sound as if some one was walking below stairs he listened and distinctly heard a step on the great staircase it approached solemnly and slowly tramptramptramp it was evidently the tread of some heavy personage and yet how could he have got into the house without making a noise he had examined all the fastenings and was certain that every entrance was secure still the steps advanced tramptramptramp it was evident that the person approaching could not be a robberthe step was too loud and deliberate a robber would either be stealthy or precipitate and now the footsteps had ascended the staircase they were slowly advancing along the passage resounding through the silent and empty apartments the very cricket had ceased its melancholy note and nothing interrupted their awful distinctness the door which had been locked on the inside slowly swung open as if selfmoved the footsteps entered the room but no one was to be seen they passed slowly and audibly across it tramptramptramp but whatever made the sound was invisible dolph rubbed his eyes and stared about him he could see to every part of the dimlylighted chamber all was vacant yet still he heard those mysterious footsteps solemnly walking about the chamber they ceased and all was dead silence there was something more appalling in this invisible visitation than there would have been in anything that addressed itself to the eyesight it was awfully vague and indefinite he felt his heart beat against his ribs a cold sweat broke out upon his forehead he lay for some time in a state of violent agitation nothing however occurred to increase his alarm his light gradually burnt down into the socket and he fell asleep when he awoke it was broad daylight the sun was peering through the cracks of the windowshutters and the birds were merrily singing about the house the bright cheery day soon put to flight all the terrors of the preceding night dolph laughed or rather tried to laugh at all that had passed and endeavoured to persuade himself that it was a mere freak of the imagination conjured up by the stories he had heard but he was a little puzzled to find the door of his room locked on the inside notwithstanding that he had positively seen it swing open as the footsteps had entered he returned to town in a state of considerable perplexity but he determined to say nothing on the subject until his doubts were either confirmed or removed by another nights watching his silence was a grievous disappointment to the gossips who had gathered at the doctors mansion they had prepared their minds to hear direful tales and they were almost in a rage at being assured that he had nothing to relate  the next night then dolph repeated his vigil he now entered the house with some trepidation he was particular in examining the fastenings of all the doors and securing them well he locked the door of his chamber and placed a chair against it then having despatched his supper he threw himself on his mattress and endeavoured to sleep it was all in vaina thousand crowding fancies kept him waking the time slowly dragged on as if minutes were spinning out themselves into hours as the night advanced he grew more and more nervous and he almost started from his couch when he heard the mysterious footstep again on the staircase up it came as before solemnly and slowly tramptramptramp it approached along the passage the door again swung open as if there had been neither lock nor impediment and a strangelooking figure stalked into the room it was an elderly man large and robust clothed in the old flemish fashion he had on a kind of short cloak with a garment under it belted round the waist trunk hose with great bunches or bows at the knees and a pair of russet boots very large at top and standing widely from his legs his hat was broad and slouched with a feather trailing over one side his irongray hair hung in thick masses on his neck and he had a short grizzled beard he walked slowly round the room as if examining that all was safe then hanging his hat on a peg beside the door he sat down in the elbowchair and leaning his elbow on the table he fixed his eyes on dolph with an unmoving and deadening stare  dolph was not naturally a coward but he had been brought up in an implicit belief in ghosts and goblins a thousand stories came swarming to his mind that he had heard about this building and as he looked at this strange personage with his uncouth garb his pale visage his grizzly beard and his fixed staring fishlike eye his teeth began to chatter his hair to rise on his head and a cold sweat to break out all over his body how long he remained in this situation he could not tell for he was like one fascinated he could not take his gaze off from the spectre but lay staring at him with his whole intellect absorbed in the contemplation the old man remained seated behind the table without stirring or turning an eye always keeping a dead steady glare upon dolph at length the household cock from a neighbouring farm clapped his wings and gave a loud cheerful crow that rung over the fields at the sound the old man slowly rose and took down his hat from the peg the door opened and closed after him he was heard to go slowly down the staircasetramptramptramp and when he had got to the bottom all was again silent dolph lay and listened earnestly counted every footfall listened and listened if the steps should returnuntil exhausted by watching and agitation he fell into a troubled sleep  daylight again brought fresh courage and assurance he would fain have considered all that had passed as a mere dream yet there stood the chair in which the unknown had seated himself there was the table on which he had leaned there was the peg on which he had hung his hat and there was the door locked precisely as he himself had locked it with the chair placed against it he hastened downstairs and examined the doors and windows all were exactly in the same state in which he had left them and there was no apparent way by which any being could have entered and left the house without leaving some trace behind pooh said dolph to himself it was all a dreambut it would not do the more he endeavoured to shake the scene off from his mind the more it haunted him  though he persisted in a strict silence as to all that he had seen or heard yet his looks betrayed the uncomfortable night that he had passed it was evident that there was something wonderful hidden under this mysterious reserve the doctor took him into the studylocked the door and sought to have a full and confidential communication but he could get nothing out of him frau ilsy took him aside into the pantry but to as little purpose and peter de groodt held him by the button for a full hour in the churchyard the very place to get at the bottom of a ghost story but came off not a whit wiser than the rest it is always the case however that one truth concealed makes a dozen current lies it is like a guinea locked up in a bank that has a dozen paper representatives before the day was over the neighbourhood was full of reports some said that dolph heyliger watched in the haunted house with pistols loaded with silver bullets others that he had a long talk with the spectre without a head others that doctor knipperhausen and the sexton had been hunted down the bowery lane and quite into town by a legion of ghosts of their customers some shook their heads and thought it a shame that the doctor should put dolph to pass the night alone in that dismal house where he might be spirited away no one knew whither while others observed with a shrug that if the devil did carry off the youngster it would be but taking his own  these rumours at length reached the ears of the good dame heyliger and as may be supposed threw her into a terrible alarm for her son to have opposed himself to danger from living foes would have been nothing so dreadful in her eyes as to dare alone the terrors of the haunted house she hastened to the doctors and passed a great part of the day in attempting to dissuade dolph from repeating his vigil she told him a score of tales which her gossiping friends had just related to her of persons who had been carried off when watching alone in old ruinous houses it was all to no effect dolphs pride as well as curiosity was piqued he endeavoured to calm the apprehensions of his mother and to assure her that there was no truth in all the rumours she had heard she looked at him dubiously and shook her head but finding his determination was not to be shaken she brought him a little thick dutch bible with brass clasps to take with him as a sword wherewith to fight the powers of darkness and lest that might not be sufficient the housekeeper gave him the heidelburgh catechism by way of dagger  the next night therefore dolph took up his quarters for the third time in the old mansion whether dream or not the same thing was repeated towards midnight when every thing was still the same sound echoed through the empty hallstramptramptramp the stairs were again ascended the door again swung open the old man entered walked round the room hung up his hat and seated himself by the table the same fear and trembling came over poor dolph though not in so violent a degree he lay in the same way motionless and fascinated staring at the figure which regarded him as before with a dead fixed chilling gaze in this way they remained for a long time till by degrees dolphs courage began gradually to revive whether alive or dead this being had certainly some object in his visitation and he recollected to have heard it said that spirits have no power to speak until they are spoken to summoning up resolution therefore and making two or three attempts before he could get his parched tongue in motion he addressed the unknown in the most solemn form of adjuration that he could recollect and demanded to know what was the motive of his visit  no sooner had he finished than the old man rose took down his hat the door opened and he went out looking back upon dolph just as he crossed the threshold as if expecting him to follow the youngster did not hesitate an instant he took the candle in his hand and the bible under his arm and obeyed the tacit invitation the candle emitted a feeble uncertain ray but still he could see the figure before him slowly descend the stairs he followed trembling when it had reached the bottom of the stairs it turned through the hall towards the back door of the mansion dolph held the light over the balustrades but in his eagerness to catch a sight of the unknown he flared his feeble taper so suddenly that it went out still there was sufficient light from the pale moonbeams that fell through a narrow window to give him an indistinct view of the figure near the door he followed therefore downstairs and turned towards the place but when he had got there the unknown had disappeared the door remained fast barred and bolted there was no other mode of exit yet the being whatever he might be was gone he unfastened the door and looked out into the fields it was a hazy moonlight night so that the eye could distinguish objects at some distance he thought he saw the unknown in a footpath that led from the door he was not mistaken but how had he got out of the house he did not pause to think but followed on the old man proceeded at a measured pace without looking about him his footsteps sounding on the hard ground he passed through the orchard of appletrees that stood near the house always keeping the footpath it led to a well situated in a little hollow which had supplied the farm with water just at this well dolph lost sight of him he rubbed his eyes and looked again but nothing was to be seen of the unknown he reached the well but nobody was there all the surrounding ground was open and clear there was no bush nor hidingplace he looked down the well and saw at a great depth the reflection of the sky in the still water after remaining here for some time without seeing or hearing any thing more of his mysterious conductor he returned to the house full of awe and wonder he bolted the door groped his way back to bed and it was long before he could compose himself to sleep  his dreams were strange and troubled he thought he was following the old man along the side of a great river until they came to a vessel that was on the point of sailing and that his conductor led him on board and vanished he remembered the commander of the tessel a short swarthy manwith crisped black hair blind of one eye and lame of one leg but the rest of his dream was very confused sometimes he was sailing sometimes on shore now amidst storms and tempests and now wandering quietly in unknown streets the figure of the old man was strangely mingled up with the incidents of the dream and the whole distinctly wound up by his finding himself on board of the vessel again returning home with a great bag of money  when he woke the gray cool light of dawn was streaking the horizon and the cocks passing the reveil from farm to farm throughout the country he rose more harassed and perplexed than ever he was singularly confounded by all that he had seen and dreamt and began to doubt whether his mind was not affected and whether all that was passing in his thoughts might not be mere feverish fantasy in his present state of mind he did not feel disposed to return immediately to the doctors and undergo the crossquestioning of the household he made a scanty breakfast therefore on the remains of the last nights provisions and then wandered out into the fields to meditate on all that had befallen him lost in thought he rambled about gradually approaching the town until the morning was far advanced when he was roused by a hurry and bustle around him he found himself near the waters edge in a throng of people hurrying to a pier where there was a vessel ready to make sail he was unconsciously carried along by the impulse of the crowd and found that it was a sloop on the point of sailing up the hudson to albany there was much leavetaking and kissing of old women and children and great activity in carrying on board baskets of bread and cakes and provisions of all kinds notwithstanding the mighty joints of meat that dangled over the stern for a voyage to albany was an expedition of great moment in those days the commander of the sloop was hurrying about and giving a world of orders which were not very strictly attended to one man being busy in lighting his pipe and another in sharpening his snickersnee  the appearance of the commander suddenly caught dolphs attention he was short and swarthy with crisped black hair blind of one eye and lame of one legthe very commander that he had seen in his dream surprised and aroused he considered the scene more attentively and recalled still further traces of his dream the appearance of the vessel of the river and of a variety of other objects accorded with the imperfect images vaguely rising to recollection  as he stood musing on these circumstances the captain suddenly called out to him in dutch step on board young man or youll be left behind he was startled by the sum mons he saw that the sloop was cast loose and was actually moving from the pier it seemed as if he was actuated by some irresistible impulse he sprang upon the deck and the next moment the sloop was hurried off by the wind and tide dolphs thoughts and feelings were all in tumult and confusion he had been strongly worked upon by the events that had recently befallen him and could not but think that there was some connexion between his present situation and his last nights dream he felt as if he was under supernatural influence and he tried to assure himself with an old and favourite maxim of his that one way or other all would turn out for the best for a moment the indignation of the doctor at his departure without leave passed across his mindbut that was matter of little moment then he thought of the distress of his mother at his strange disappearance and the idea gave him a sudden pang he would have entreated to be put on shore but he knew with such wind and tide the entreaty would have been in vain then the inspiring love of novelty and adventure came rushing in full tide through his bosom he felt himself launched strangely and suddenly on the world and under full way to explore the regions of wonder that lay up this mighty river and beyond those blue mountains that had bounded his horizon since childhood while he was lost in this whirl of thought the sails strained to the breeze the shores seemed to hurry away behind him and before he perfectly recovered his selfpossession the sloop was ploughing her way past spikingdevil and yonkers and the tallest chimney of the manhattoes had faded from his sight  i have said that a voyage up the hudson in those days was an undertaking of some moment indeed it was as much thought of as a voyage to europe is at present the sloops were often many days on the way the cautious navigators taking in sail when it blew fresh and coming to anchor at night and stopping to send the boat ashore for milk for tea without which it was impossible for the worthy old lady passengers to subsist and there were the muchtalkedof perils of the tappaan zee and the highlands in short a prudent dutch burgher would talk of such a voyage for months and even years beforehand and never undertook it without putting his affairs in order making his will and having prayers said for him in the low dutch churches  in the course of such a voyage therefore dolph was satisfied he would have time enough to reflect and to make up his mind as to what he should do when he arrived at albany the captain with his blind eye and lame leg would it is true bring his strange dream to mind and perplex him sadly for a few moments but of late his life had been made up so much of dreams and realities his nights and days had been so jumbled together that he seemed to be moving continually in a delusion there is always however a kind of vagabond consolation in a mans having nothing in this world to lose with this dolph comforted his heart and determined to make the most of the present enjoyment  in the second day of the voyage they came to the highlands it was the latter part of a calm sultry day that they floated gently with the tide between these stern mountains there was that perfect quiet which prevails over nature in the languor of summer heat the turning of a plank or the accidental falling of an oar on deck was echoed from the mountain side and reverberated along the shores and if by chance the captain gave a shout of command there were airy tongues that mocked it from every cliff  dolph gazed about him in mute delight and wonder at these scenes of natures magnificence to the left the dunderberg reared its woody precipices height over height forest over forest away into the deep summer sky to the right strutted forth the bold promontory of anthonys nose with a solitary eagle wheeling about it while beyond mountain succeeded to mountain until they seemed to lock their arms together and confine this mighty river in their embraces there was a feeling of quiet luxury in gazing at the broad green bosoms here and there scooped out among the precipices or at woodlands high in air nodding over the edge of some beetling bluff and their foliage all transparent in the yellow sunshine  in the midst of his admiration dolph remarked a pile of bright snowy clouds peering above the western heights it was succeeded by another and another each seemingly pushing onwards its predecessor and towering with dazzling brilliancy in the deepblue atmosphere and now muttering peals of thunder were faintly heard rolling behind the mountains the river hitherto still and glassy reflecting pictures of the sky and land now showed a dark ripple at a distance as the breeze came creeping up it the fishhawks wheeled and screamed and sought their nests on the high dry trees the crows flew clamorously to the crevices of the rocks and all nature seemed conscious of the approaching thundergust  the clouds now rolled in volumes over the mountain tops their summits still bright and snowy but the lower parts of an inky blackness the rain began to patter down in broad and scattered drops the wind freshened and curled up the waves at length it seemed as if the bellying clouds were torn open by the mountain tops and complete torrents of rain came rattling down the lightning leaped from cloud to cloud and streamed quivering against the rocks splitting and rending the stoutest forest trees the thunder burst in tremendous explosions the peals were echoed from mountain to mountain they crashed upon dunderberg and rolled up the long defile of the highlands each headland making a new echo until old bull hill seemed to bellow back the storm  for a time the scudding rack and mist and the sheeted rain almost hid the landscape from the sight there was a fearful gloom illumined still more fearfully by the streams of lightning which glittered among the raindrops never had dolph beheld such an absolute warring of the elements it seemed as if the storm was tearing and rending its way through this mountain defile and had brought all the artillery of heaven into action  the vessel was hurried on by the increasing wind until she came to where the river makes a sudden bend the only one in the whole course of its majestic career15 just as they turned the point a violent flaw of wind came sweeping down a mountain gully bending the forest before it and in a moment lashing up the river into white froth and foam the captain saw the danger and cried out to lower the sail before the order could be obeyed the flaw struck the sloop and threw her on her beamends everything was now fright and confusion the flapping of the sails the whistling and rushing of the wind the bawling of the captain and crew the shrieking of the passengers all mingled with the rolling and bellowing of the thunder in the midst of the uproar the sloop righted at the same time the mainsail shifted the boom came sweeping the quarterdeck and dolph who was gazing unguardedly at the clouds found himself in a moment floundering in the river  footnote 15 this must have been the bend at westpoint  for once in his life one of his idle accomplishments was of use to him the many truant hours which he had devoted to sporting in the hudson had made him an expert swimmer yet with all his strength and skill he found great difficulty in reaching the shore his disappearance from the deck had not been noticed by the crew who were all occupied by their own danger the sloop was driven along with inconceivable rapidity she had hard work to weather a long promontory on the eastern shore round which the river turned and which completely shut her from dolphs view  it was on a point of the western shore that he landed and scrambling up the rocks he threw himself faint and exhausted at the foot of a tree by degrees the thundergust passed over the clouds rolled away to the east where they lay piled in feathery masses tinted with the last rosy rays of the sun the distant play of the lightning might be seen about the dark bases and now and then might be heard the faint muttering of the thunder dolph rose and sought about to see if any path led from the shore but all was savage and trackless the rocks were piled upon each other great trunks of trees lay shattered about as they had been blown down by the strong winds which draw through these mountains or had fallen through age the rocks too were overhung with wild vines and briers which completely matted themselves together and opposed a barrier to all ingress every movement that he made shook down a shower from the dripping foliage he attempted to scale one of these almost perpendicular heights but though strong and agile he found it an herculean undertaking often he was supported merely by crumbling projections of the rock and sometimes he clung to roots and branches of trees and hung almost suspended in the air the woodpigeon came cleaving his whistling flight by him and the eagle screamed from the brow of the impending cliff as he was thus clambering he was on the point of seizing hold of a shrub to aid his ascent when something rustled among the leaves and he saw a snake quivering along like lightning almost from under his hand it coiled itself up immediately in an attitude of defiance with flattened head distended jaws and quicklyvibrating tongue that played like a little flame about its mouth dolphs heart turned faint within him and he had wellnigh let go his hold and tumbled down the precipice the serpent stood on the defensive but for an instant it was an instinctive movement of defence and finding there was no attack it glided away into a cleft of the rock dolphs eye followed with fearful intensity and he saw at a glance that he was in the vicinity of a nest of adders that lay knotted and writhing and hissing in the chasm he hastened with all speed to escape from so frightful a neighbourhood his imagination was full of this new horror he saw an adder in every curling vine and heard the tail of a rattlesnake in every dry leaf that rustled  at length he succeeded in scrambling to the summit of a precipice but it was covered by a dense forest wherever he could gain a lookout between the trees he saw that the coast rose in heights and cliffs one rising beyond another until huge mountains overtopped the whole there were no signs of cultivation nor any smoke curling amongst the trees to indicate a human residence every thing was wild and solitary as he was standing on the edge of a precipice that overlooked a deep ravine fringed with trees his feet detached a great fragment of rock it fell crashing its way through the tree tops down into the chasm a loud whoop or rather yell issued from the bottom of the glen the moment after there was the report of a gun and a ball came whistling over his head cutting the twigs and leaves and burying itself deep in the bark of a chestnuttree  dolph did not wait for a second shot but made a precipitate retreat fearing every moment to hear the enemy in pursuit he succeeded however in returning unmolested to the shore and determined to penetrate no farther into a country so beset with savage perils  he sat himself down dripping disconsolately on a wet stone what was to be done where was he to shelter himself the hour of repose was approaching the birds were seeking their nests the bat began to flit about in the twilight and the nighthawk soaring high in heaven seemed to be calling out the stars night gradually closed in and wrapped every thing in gloom and though it was the latter part of summer yet the breeze stealing along the river and among these dripping forests was chilly and penetrating especially to a halfdrowned man  as he sat drooping and despondent in this comfortless condition he perceived a light gleaming through the trees near the shore where the winding of the river made a deep bay it cheered him with the hopes that here might be some human habitation where he might get something to appease the clamorous cravings of his stomach and what was equally necessary in his shipwrecked condition a comfortable shelter for the night it was with extreme difficulty that he made his way towards the light along ledges of rocks down which he was in danger of sliding into the river and over great trunks of fallen trees some of which had been blown down in the late storm and lay so thickly together that he had to struggle through their branches at length he came to the brow of a rock that overhung a small dell from whence the light proceeded it was from a fire at the foot of a great tree that stood in the midst of a grassy interval or plat among the rocks the fire cast up a red glare among the gray crags and impending trees leaving chasms of deep gloom that resembled entrances to caverns a small brook rippled close by betrayed by the quivering reflection of the flame there were two figures moving about the fire and others squatted before it as they were between him and the light they were in complete shadow but one of them happening to move round to the opposite side dolph was startled at perceiving by the full glare falling on painted features and glittering on silver ornaments that he was an indian he now looked more narrowly and saw guns leaning against a tree and a dead body lying on the ground  dolph began to doubt whether he was not in a worse condition than before here was the very foe that had fired at him from the glen he endeavoured to retreat quietly not caring to entrust himself to these halfhuman beings in so savage and lonely a place it was too late the indian with that eagle quickness of eye so remarkable in his race perceived something stirring among the bushes on the rock he seized one of the guns that leaned against the tree one moment more and dolph might have had his passion for adventure cured by a bullet he hallooed loudly with the indian salutation of friendship the whole party sprang upon their feet the salutation was returned and the straggler was invited to join them at the fire  on approaching he found to his consolation that the party was composed of white men as well as indians one who was evidently the principal personage or commander was seated on the trunk of a tree before the fire he was a large stout man somewhat advanced in life but hale and hearty his face was bronzed almost to the colour of an indians he had strong but rather jovial features an aquiline nose and a mouth shaped like a mastiffs his face was half thrown in shade by a broad hat with a buckstail in it his gray hair hung short in his neck he wore a huntingfrock with indian leggings and moccasons and a tomahawk in the broad wampum belt round his waist as dolph caught a distinct view of his person and features he was struck with something that reminded him of the old man of the haunted house the man before him however was different in his dress and age he was more cheery too in his aspect and it was hard to define where the vague resemblance laybut a resemblance there certainly was dolph felt some degree of awe in approaching him but was assured by the frank hearty welcome with which he was received as he case his eyes about too he was still further encouraged by perceiving that the dead body which had caused him some alarm was that of a deer and his satisfaction was complete in discerning by the savoury steams which issued from a kettle suspended by a hooked stick over the fire that there was a part cooking for the evenings repast  he now found that he had fallen in with a rambling hunting party such as often took place in those days among the settlers along the river the hunter is always hospitable and nothing makes men more social and unceremonious than meeting in the wilderness the commander of the party poured him out a dram of cheering liquor which he gave him with a merry leer to warm his heart arid ordered one of his followers to fetch some garments from a pinnace which was moored in a cove close by while those in which our hero was dripping might be dried before the fire  dolph found as he had suspected that the shot from the glen which had come so near giving him his quietus when on the precipice was from the party before him he had nearly crushed one of them by the fragment of rock which he had detached and the jovial old hunter in the broad hat and bucktail had fired at the place where he saw the bushes move supposing it to be some wild animal he laughed heartily at the blunder it being what is considered an exceeding good joke among hunters but faith my lad said he if i had but caught a glimpse of you to take sight at you would have followed the rock antony vander heyden is seldom known to miss his aim these last words were at once a clue to dolphs curiosity and a few questions let him completely into the character of the man before him and of his band of woodland rangers the commander in the broad hat and huntingfrock was no less a personage than the heer antony vander heyden of albany of whom dolph had many a time heard he was in fact the hero of many a story being a man of singular humours and whimsical habits that were matters of wonder to his quiet dutch neighbours as he was a man of property having had a father before him from whom he inherited large tracts of wild land and whole barrels full of wampum he could indulge his humours without control instead of staying quietly at home eating and drinking at regular meal times amusing himself by smoking his pipe on the bench before the door and then turning into a comfortable bed at night he delighted in all kinds of rough wild expeditions he was never so happy as when on a hunting party in the wilderness sleeping under trees or bark sheds or cruising down the river or on some woodland lake fishing and hunting and living the lord knows how  he was a great friend to indians and to an indian mode of life which he considered true natural liberty and manly enjoyment when at home he had always several indian hangerson who loitered about his house sleeping like hounds in the sunshine or preparing hunting and fishingtackle for some new expedition or shooting at marks with bows and arrows  over these vagrant beings heer antony had as perfect command as a huntsman over his pack though they were great nuisances to the regular people of his neighbourhood as he was a rich man no one ventured to thwart his humours indeed he had a hearty joyous manner about him that made him universally popular he would troll a dutch song as he tramped along the street hail every one a mile off and when he entered a house he would slap the good man familiarly on the back shake him by the hand till he roared and kiss his wife and daughters before his facein short there was no pride nor illhumour about heer antony  besides his indian hangerson he had three or four humble friends among the white men who looked up to him as a patron and had the run of his kitchen and the favour of being taken with him occasionally on his expeditions it was with a medley of such retainers that he was at present on a cruise along the shores of the hudson in a pinnace which he kept for his own recreation there were two white men with him dressed partly in the indian style with moccasons and huntingshirts the rest of his crew consisted of four favourite indians they had been prowling about the river without any definite object until thay found themselves in the highlands where they had passed two or three days hunting the deer which still lingered among these mountains  it is a lucky circumstance young man said antony vander heyden that you happened to be knocked overboard today as tomorrow morning we start early on our return homewards and you might then have looked in vain for a meal among the mountainsbut come lads stir about stir about lets see what prog we have for supper the kettle has boiled long enough my stomach cries cupboard and ill warrant our guest is in no mood to dally with his trencher  there was a bustle now in the little encampment one took off the kettle and turned a part of the contents into a huge wooden bowl another prepared a flat rock for a table while a third brought various utensils from the pinnace which was moored close by and heer antony himself brought a flask or two of precious liquor from his own private lockerknowing his boon companions too well to trust any of them with the key  a rude but hearty repast was soon spread consisting of venison smoking from the kettle with cold bacon boiled indian corn and mighty loaves of good brown household bread never had dolph made a more delicious repast and when he had washed it down with two or three draughts from the heer antonys flask and felt the jolly liquor sending its warmth through his veins and glowing round his very heart he would not have changed his situation no not with the governor of the province  the heer antony too grew chirping and joyous told halfadozen fat stories at which his white followers laughed immoderately though the indians as usual maintained an invincible gravity  this is your true life my boy said he slapping dolph on the shoulder a man is never a man till he can defy wind and weather range woods and wilds sleep under a tree and live on basswood leaves  and then would he sing a stave or two of a dutch drinking song swaying a short squab dutch bottle in his hand while his myrmidons would join in chorus until the woods echoed againas the good old song has it    they all with a shout made the elements ring   so soon as the office was oer   to feasting they went with true merriment   and tippled strong liquor gillore  in the midst of his jovialty however heer antony did not lose sight of discretion though he pushed the bottle without reserve to dolph yet he always took care to help his followers himself knowing the beings he had to deal with and he was particular in granting but a moderate allowance to the indians the repast being ended the indians having drunk their liquor and smoked their pipes now wrapped themselves in their blankets stretched themselves on the ground with their feet to the fire and soon fell asleep like so many tired hounds the rest of the party remained chatting before the fire which the gloom of the forest and the dampness of the air from the late storm rendered extremely grateful and comforting the conversation gradually moderated from the hilarity of suppertime and turned upon hunting adventures and exploits and perils in the wilderness many of which were so strange and improbable that i will not venture to repeat them lest the veracity of antony vander heyden and his comrades should be brought into question there were many legendary tales told also about the river and the settlements on its borders in which valuable kind of lore the heer antony seemed deeply versed as the sturdy bushbeater sat in the twisted root of a tree that served him for a kind of armchair dealing forth these wild stories with the fire gleaming on his stronglymarked visage dolph was again repeatedly perplexed by something that reminded him of the phantom of the haunted house some vague resemblance that could not be fixed upon any precise feature or lineament but which pervaded the general air of his countenance and figure  the circumstance of dolphs falling overboard being again discussed led to the relation of divers disasters and singular mishaps that had befallen voyagers on this great river particularly in the earlier periods of colonial history most of which the heer deliberately attributed to supernatural causes dolph stared at this suggestion but the old gentleman assured him that it was very currently believed by the settlers along the river that these highlands were under the dominion of supernatural and mischievous beings which seemed to have taken some pique against the dutch colonists in the early time of the settlement in consequence of this they have ever since taken particular delight in venting their spleen and indulging their humours upon the dutch skippers bothering them with flaws head winds counter currents and all kinds of impediments insomuch that a dutch navigator was always obliged to be exceedingly wary and deliberate in his proceedings to come to anchor at dusk to drop his peak or take in sail whenever he saw a swagbellied cloud rolling over the mountains in short to take so many precautions that he was often apt to be an incredible time in toiling up the river  some he said believed these mischievous powers of the air to be evil spirits conjured up by the indian wizards in the early times of the province to revenge themselves on the strangers who had dispossessed them of their country they even attributed to their incantations the misadventure which befell the renowned hendrick hudson when he sailed so gallantly up this river in quest of a northwest passage and as he thought run his ship aground which they affirm was nothing more nor less than a spell of these same wizards to prevent his getting to china in this direction  the greater part however heer antony observed accounted for all the extraordinary circumstances attending this river and the perplexities of the skippers which navigated it by the old legend of the stormship which haunted pointnopoint on finding dolph to be utterly ignorant of this tradition the heer stared at him for a moment with surprise and wondered where he had passed his life to be uninformed on so important a point of history to pass away the remainder of the evening therefore he undertook the tale as far as his memory would serve in the very words in which it had been written out by mynheer selyne an early poet of the newnederlandts giving then a stir to the fire that sent up its sparks among the trees like a little volcano he adjusted himself comfortably in his root of a tree and throwing back his head and closing his eyes for a few moments to summon up his recollection he related the following legend     the stormship   in the golden age of the province of the newnetherlands when it was under the sway of wouter van twiller otherwise called the doubter the people of the manhattoes were alarmed one sultry afternoon just about the time of the summer solstice by a tremendous storm of thunder and lightning the rain descended in such torrents as absolutely to spatter up and smoke along the ground it seemed as if the thunder rattled and rolled over the very roofs of the houses the lightning was seen to play about the church of st nicholas and to strive three times in vain to strike its weathercock garret van hornes new chimney was split almost from top to bottom and doffue mildeberger was struck speechless from his baldfaced mare just as he was riding into town in a word it was one of those unparalleled storms that only happen once within the memory of that venerable personage known in all towns by the appellation of the oldest inhabitant  great was the terror of the good old women of the manhattoes they gathered their children together and took refuge in the cellars after having hung a shoe on the iron point of every bedpost lest it should attract the lightning at length the storm abated the thunder sunk into a growl and the setting sun breaking from under the fringed borders of the clouds made the broad bosom of the bay to gleam like a sea of molten gold  the word was given from the fort that a ship was standing up the bay it passed from mouth to mouth and street to street and soon put the little capital in a bustle the arrival of a ship in those early times of the settlement was an event of vast importance to the inhabitants it brought them news from the old world from the land of their birth from which they were so completely severed to the yearly ship too they looked for their supply of luxuries of finery of comforts and almost of necessaries the good vrouw could not have her new cap nor new gown until the arrival of the ship the artist waited for it for his tools the burgomaster for his pipe and his supply of hollands the schoolboy for his top and marbles and the lordly landholder for the bricks with which he was to build his new mansion thus every one rich and poor great and small looked out for the arrival of the ship it was the great yearly event of the town of newamsterdam and from one end of the year to the other the shipthe shipthe shipwas the continual topic of conversation  the news from the fort therefore brought all the populace down to the battery to behold the wishedfor sight it was not exactly the time when she had been expected to arrive and the circumstance was a matter of some speculation many were the groups collected about the battery here and there might be seen a burgomaster of slow and pompous gravity giving his opinion with great confidence to a crowd of old women and idle boys at another place was a knot of old weatherbeaten fellows who had been seamen or fishermen in their times and were great authorities on such occasions these gave different opinions and caused great disputes among their several adherents but the man most looked up to and followed and watched by the crowd was hans van pelt an old dutch seacaptain retired from service the nautical oracle of the place he reconnoitred the ship through an ancient telescope covered with tarry canvas hummed a dutch tune to himself and said nothing a hum however from hans van pelt had always more weight with the public than a speech from another man  in the meantime the ship became more distinct to the naked eye she was a stout round dutchbuilt vessel with high bow and poop and bearing dutch colours the evening sun gilded her bellying canvas as she came riding over the long waving billows the sentinel who had given notice of her approach declared that he first got sight of her when she was in the centre of the bay and that she broke suddenly on his sight just as if she had come out of the bosom of the black thundercloud the bystanders looked at hans van pelt to see what he would say to this report hans van pelt screwed his mouth closer together and said nothing upon which some shook their heads and others shrugged their shoulders  the ship was now repeatedly hailed but made no reply and passing by the fort stood on up the hudson a gun was brought to bear on her and with some difficulty loaded and fired by hans van pelt the garrison not being expert in artillery the shot seemed absolutely to pass through the ship and to skip along the water on the other side but no notice was taken of it what was strange she had all her sails set and sailed right against wind and tide which were both down the river upon this hans van pelt who was likewise harbourmaster ordered his boat and set off to board her but after rowing two or three hours he returned without success sometimes he would get within one or two hundred yards of her and then in a twinkling she would be half a mile off some said it was because his oarsmen who were rather pursy and shortwinded stopped every now and then to take breath and spit on their hands but this it is probable was a mere scandal he got near enough however to see the crew who were all dressed in the dutch style the officers in doublets and high hats and feathers not a word was spoken by any one on board they stood as motionless as so many statues and the ship seemed as if left to her own government thus she kept on away up the river lessening and lessening in the evening sunshine until she faded from sight like a little white cloud melting away in the summer sky  the appearance of this ship threw the governor into one of the deepest doubts that ever beset him in the whole course of his administration fears were entertained for the security of the infant settlements on the river lest this might be an enemys ship in disguise sent to take possession the governor called together his council repeatedly to assist him with their conjectures he sat in his chair of state built of timber from the sacred forest of the hague and smoking his long jasmine pipe and listened to all that his counsellors had to say on a subject about which they knew nothing but in spite of all the conjecturing of the sagest and oldest heads the governor still continued to doubt  messengers were despatched to different places on the river but they returned without any tidingsthe ship had made no port day after day and week after week elapsed but she never returned down the hudson as however the council seemed solicitous for intelligence they had it in abundance the captains of the sloops seldom arrived without bringing some report of having seen the strange ship at different parts of the river sometimes near the palisadoes sometimes off croton point and sometimes in the highlands but she never was reported as having been seen above the highlands the crews of the sloops it is true generally differed among themselves in their accounts of these apparitions but they may have arisen from the uncertain situations in which they saw her sometimes it was by the flashes of the thunderstorm lighting up a pitchy night and giving glimpses of her careering across tappaan zee or the wide waste of haverstraw bay at one moment she would appear close upon them as if likely to run them down and would throw them into great bustle and alarm but the next flash would show her far off always sailing against the wind sometimes in quiet moonlight nights she would be seen under some high bluff of the highlands all in deep shadow excepting her topsails glittering in the moonbeams by the time however that the voyagers would reach the place there would be no ship to be seen and when they had passed on for some distance and looked back behold there she was again with her topsails in tha moonshine her appearance was always just after or just before or just in the midst of unruly weather and she was known by all the skippers and voyagers of the hudson by the name of the stormship  these reports perplexed the governor and his council more than ever and it would be endless to repeat the conjectures and opinions that were uttered on the subject some quoted cases in point of ships seen off the coast of newengland navigated by witches and goblins old hans van pelt who had been more than once to the dutch colony at the cape of good hope insisted that this must be the flying dutchman which had so long haunted table bay but being unable to make port had now sought another harbour others suggested that if it really was a supernatural apparition as there was every natural reason to believe it might be hendrick hudson and his crew of the halfmoon who it was wellknown had once run aground in the upper part of the river in seeking a northwest passage to china this opinion had very little weight with the governor but it passed current out of doors for indeed it had already been reported that hendrick hudson and his crew haunted the kaatskill mountain and it appeared very reasonable to suppose that his ship might infest the river where the enterprise was baffled or that it might bear the shadowy crew to their periodical revels in the mountain  other events occurred to occupy the thoughts and doubts of the sage wouter and his council and the stormship ceased to be a subject of deliberation at the board it continued however to be a matter of popular belief and marvellous anecdote through the whole time of the dutch government and particularly just before the capture of newamsterdam and the subjugation of the province by the english squadron about that time the stormship was repeatedly seen in the tappaan zee and about weehawk and even down as far as hoboken and her appearance was supposed to be ominous of the approaching squall in public affairs and the downfall of dutch domination  since that time we have no authentic accounts of her though it is said she still haunts the highlands and cruises about pointnopoint people who live along the river insist that they sometimes see her in summer moonlight and that in a deep still midnight they have heard the chant of her crew as if heaving the lead but sights and sounds are so deceptive along the mountainous shores and about the wide bays and long reaches of this great river that i confess i have very strong doubts upon the subject  it is certain nevertheless that strange things have been seen in these highlands in storms which are considered as connected with the old story of the ship the captains of the river craft talk of a little bulbousbottomed dutch goblin in trunk hose and sugarloafed hat with a speaking trumpet in his hand which they say keeps about the dunderberg16 they declare they have heard him in stormy weather in the midst of the turmoil giving orders in low dutch for the piping up of a fresh gust of wind or the rattling off of another thunderclap that sometimes he has been seen surrounded by a crew of little imps in broad breeches and short doublets tumbling headoverheels in the rack and mist and playing a thousand gambols in the air or buzzing like a swarm of flies about antonys nose and that at such times the hurryscurry of the storm was always greatest one time a sloop in passing by the dunderberg was overtaken by a thundergust that came scouring round the mountain and seemed to burst just over the vessel though tight and well ballasted yet she laboured dreadfully until the water came over the gunwale all the crew were amazed when it was discovered that there was a little white sugarloaf hat on the masthead which was known at once to be that of the heer of the dunderberg nobody however dared to climb to the masthead and get rid of this terrible hat the sloop continued labouring and rocking as if she would have rolled her mast overboard she seemed in continual danger either of upsetting or of running on shore in this way she drove quite through the highlands until she had passed pollopols island where it is said the jurisdiction of the dunderberg potentate ceases no sooner had she passed this bourne than the little hat all at once spun up into the air like a top whirled up all the clouds into a vortex and hurried them back to the summit of the dunderberg while the sloop righted herself and sailed on as quietly as if in a millpond nothing saved her from utter wreck but the fortunate circumstance of having a horseshoe nailed against the masta wise precaution against evil spirits which has since been adopted by all the dutch captains that navigate this haunted river  footnote 16 ie the thundermountain so called from its echoes  there is another story told of this foulweather urchin by skipper daniel ouslesticker of fishhill who was never known to tell a lie he declared that in a severe squall he saw him seated astride of his bowsprit riding the sloop ashore full butt against antonys nose and that he was exorcised by dominie van gieson of esopus who happened to be on board and who sung the hymn of st nicholas whereupon the goblin threw himself up in the air like a ball and went off in a whirlwind carrying away with him the nightcap of the dominies wife which was discovered the next sunday morning hanging on the weathercock of esopus church steeple at least forty miles off after several events of this kind had taken place the regular skippers of the river for a long time did not venture to pass the dunderberg without lowering their peaks out of homage to the heer of the mountain and it was observed that all such as paid this tribute of respect were suffered to pass unmolested17  footnote 17 among the superstitions which prevailed in the colonies during the early times of the settlements there seems to have been a singular one about phantom ships the superstitious fancies of men are always apt to turn upon those objects which concern their daily occupations the solitary ship which from year to year came like a raven in the wilderness bringing to the inhabitants of a settlement the comforts of life from the world from which they were cut off was apt to be present to their dreams whether sleeping or waking the accidental sight from shore of a sail gliding along the horizon in those as yet lonely seas was apt to be a matter of much talk and speculation there is mention made in one of the early newengland writers of a ship navigated by witches with a great horse that stood by the mainmast i have met with another story somewhere of a ship that drove on shore in fair sunny tranquil weather with sails all set and a table spread in the cabin as if to regale a number of guests yet not a living being on board these phantom ships always sailed in the eye of the wind or ploughed their way with great velocity making the smooth sea foam before their bows when not a breath of air was stirring  moore has finely wrought up one of these legends of the sea into a little tale which within a small compass contains the very essence of this species of supernatural fiction i allude to his spectreship bound to deadmans isle                                       such said antony vander heyden are a few of the stories written down by selyne the poet concerning this stormship which he affirms to have brought this colony of mischievous imps into the province from some old ghostridden country of europe i could give you a host more if necessary for all the accidents that so often befall the river craft in the highlands are said to be tricks played off by these imps of the dunderberg but i see that you are nodding so let us turn in for the night  the moon had just raised her silver horns above the round back of old bullhill and lit up the gray rocks and shagged forests and glittered on the waving bosom of the river the nightdew was falling and the late gloomy mountains began to soften and put on a gray aerial tint in the dewy light the hunters stirred the fire and threw on fresh fuel to qualify the damp of the night air they then prepared a bed of branches and dry leaves under a ledge of rocks for dolph while antony vander heyden wrapping himself up in a huge coat made of skins stretched himself before the fire it was some time however before dolph could close his eyes he lay contemplating the strange scene before him the wild woods and rocks aroundthe fire throwing fitful gleams on the faces of the sleeping savagesand the heer antony too who so singularly yet vaguely reminded him of the nightly visitant to the haunted house now and then he heard the cry of some animal from the forest or the hooting of the owl or the notes of the whippoorwill which seemed to abound among these solitudes or the splash of a sturgeon leaping out of the river and falling back full length on its placid surface he contrasted all this with his accustomed nest in the garretroom of the doctors mansion where the only sounds he heard at night were the churchclock telling the hour the drowsy voice of the watchman drawling out all was well the deep snoring of the doctors clubbed nose from below stairs or the cautious labours of some carpenter rat gnawing in the wainscot his thoughts then wandered to his poor old mother what would she think of his mysterious disappearancewhat anxiety and distress would she not suffer this was the thought that would continually intrude itself to mar his present enjoyment it brought with it a feeling of pain and compunction and he fell asleep with the tears yet standing in his eyes  were this a mere tale of fancy here would be a fine opportunity for weaving in strange adventures among these wild mountains and roving hunters and after involving my hero in a variety of perils and difficulties rescuing him from them all by some miraculous contrivance but as this is absolutely a true story i must content myself with simple facts and keep to probabilities  at an early hour the next day therefore after a hearty mornings meal the encampment broke up and our adventurers embarked in the pinnace of antony vander heyden there being no wind for the sails the indians rowed her gently along keeping time to a kind of chant of one of the white men the day was serene and beautiful the river without a wave and as the vessel cleft the glassy water it left a long undulating track behind the crows who had scented the hunters banquèt were already gathering and hovering in the air just where a column of thin blue smoke rising from among the trees showed the place of their last nights quarters as they coasted along the bases of the mountains the heer antony pointed out to dolph a bald eagle the sovereign of these regions who sat perched on a dry tree that projected over the river and with eye turned upwards seemed to be drinking in the splendour of the morning sun their approach disturbed the monarchs meditations he first spread one wing and then the other balanced himself for a moment and then quitting his perch with dignified composure wheeled slowly over their heads dolph snatched up a gun and sent a whistling ball after him that cut some of the feathers from his wing the report of the gun leaped sharply from rock to rock and awakened a thousand echoes but the monarch of the air sailed calmly on ascending higher and higher and wheeling widely as he ascended soaring up the green bosom of the woody mountain until he disappeared over the brow of a beetling precipice dolph felt in a manner rebuked by this proud tranquillity and almost reproached himself for having so wantonly insulted this majestic bird heer antony told him laughing to remember that he was not yet out of the territories of the lord of the dunderberg and an old indian shook his head and observed that there was bad luck in killing an eaglethe hunter on the contrary should always leave him a portion of his spoils  nothing however occurred to molest them on their voyage they passed pleasantly through magnificent and lonely scenes until they came to where pollopols island lay like a floating bower at the extremity of the highlands here they landed until the heat of the day should abate or a breeze spring up that might supersede the labour of the oar some prepared the midday meal while others reposed under the shade of the trees in luxurious summer indolence looking drowsily forth upon the beauty of the scene on the one side were the highlands vast and cragged feathered to the top with forests and throwing their shadows on the glassy water that dimpled at their feet on the other side was a wide expanse of the river like a broad lake with long sunny reaches and green headlands and the distant line of shawungunk mountains waving along a clear horizon or checkered by a fleecy cloud  but i forbear to dwell on the particulars of their cruise along the river this vagrant amphibious life careering across silver sheets of water coasting wild woodland shores banqueting on shady promontories with the spreading tree overhead the river curling its light foam to ones feet and distant mountain and rock and tree and snowy cloud and deepblue sky all mingling in summer beauty before one all this though never cloying in the enjoyment would be but tedious in narration  when encamped by the waterside some of the party would go into the woods and hunt others would fish sometimes they would amuse themselves by shooting at a mark by leaping by running by wrestling and dolph gained great favour in the eyes of antony vander heyden by his skill and adroitness in all these exercises which the heer considered as the highest of manly accomplishments  thus did they coast jollily on choosing only the pleasant hours for voyaging sometimes in the cool morning dawn sometimes in the sober evening twilight and sometimes when the moonshine spangled the crisp curling waves that whispered along the sides of their little bark never had dolph felt so completely in his element never had he met with any thing so completely to his taste as this wild haphazard life he was the very man to second antony vander heyden in his rambling humours and gained continually on his affections the heart of the old bushwhacker yearned toward the young man who seemed thus growing up in his own likeness and as they approached to the end of their voyage he could not help inquiring a little into his history dolph frankly told him his course of life his severe medical studies his little proficiency and his very dubious prospects the heer was shocked to find that such amazing talents and accomplishments were to be cramped and buried under a doctors wig he had a sovereign contempt for the healing art having never had any other physician than the butcher he bore a mortal grudge to all kinds of study also ever since he had been flogged about an unintelligible book when he was a boy but to think that a young fellow like dolph of such wonderful abilities who could shoot fish run jump ride and wrestle should be obliged to roll pills and administer juleps for a livingtwas monstrous he told dolph never to despair but to throw physic to the dogs for a young fellow of his prodigious talents could never fail to make his way as you seem to have no acquaintance in albany said heer antony you shall go home with me and remain under my roof until you can look about you and in the meantime we can take an occasional bout at shooting and fishing for it is a pity such talents should lie idle  dolph who was at the mercy of chance was not hard to be persuaded indeed on turning over matters in his mind which he did very sagely and deliberately he could not but think that antony vander heyden was some how or other connected with the story of the haunted house that the misadventure in the highlands which had thrown them so strangely together was some how or other to work out something good in short there is nothing so convenient as this some how or other way of accommodating ones self to circumstances it is the mainstay of a heedless actor and tardy reasoner like dolph heyliger and he who can in this loose easy way link foregone evil to anticipated good possesses a secret of happiness almost equal to the philosophers stone  on their arrival at albany the sight of dolphs companion seemed to cause universal satisfaction many were the greetings at the river side and the salutations in the streets the dogs bounded before him the boys whooped as he passed every body seemed to know antony vander heyden dolph followed on in silence admiring the neatness of this worthy burgh for in those days albany was in all its glory and inhabited almost exclusively by the descendants of the original dutch settlers for it had not as yet been discovered and colonized by the restless people of newengland every thing was quiet and orderly every thing was conducted calmly and leisurely no hurry no bustle no struggling and scrambling for existence the grass grew about the unpaved streets and relieved the eye by its refreshing verdure the tall sycamores or pendent willows shaded the houses with caterpillars swinging in long silken strings from their branches or moths fluttering about like coxcombs in joy at their gay transformation the houses were built in the old dutch style with the gableends towards the street the thrifty housewife was seated on a bench before her door in close crimped cap bright flowered gown and white apron busily employed in knitting the husband smoked his pipe on the opposite bench and the little pet negro girl seated on the step at her mistress feet was industriously plying her needle the swallows sported about the eaves or skimmed along the streets and brought back some rich booty for their clamorous young and the little housekeeping wren flew in and out of a lilliputian house or an old hat nailed against the wall the cows were coming home lowing through the streets to be milked at their owners door and if perchance there were any loiterers some negro urchin with a long goad was gently urging them homewards  as dolphs companion passed on he received a tranquil nod from the burghers and a friendly word from their wives all calling him familiarly by the name of antony for it was the custom in this stronghold of the patriarchs where they had all grown up together from childhood to call every one by the christian name the heer did not pause to have his usual jokes with them for he was impatient to reach his home at length they arrived at his mansion it was of some magnitude in the dutch style with large iron figures on the gables that gave the date of its erection and showed that it had been built in the earliest times of the settlement  the news of heer antonys arrival had preceded him and the whole household was on the lookout a crew of negroes large and small had collected in front of the house to receive him the old whiteheaded ones who had grown gray in his service grinned for joy and made many awkward bows and grimaces and the little ones capered about his knees but the most happy being in the household was a little plump blooming lass his only child and the darling of his heart she came bounding out of the house but the sight of a strange young man with her father called up for a moment all the bashfulness of a homebred damsel dolph gazed at her with wonder and delight never had he seen as he thought any thing so comely in the shape of woman she was dressed in the good old dutch taste with long stays and full short petticoats so admirably adapted to show and set off the female form her hair turned up under a small round cap displayed the fairness of her forehead she had fine blue laughing eyes a trim slender waist and soft swellbut in a word she was a little dutch divinity and dolph who never stopt halfway in a new impulse fell desperately in love with her  dolph was now ushered into the house with a hearty welcome in the interior was a mingled display of heer antonys taste and habits and of the opulence of his predecessors the chambers were furnished with good old mahogany the beaufets and cupboards glittered with embossed silver and painted china over the parlour fireplace was as usual the family coatofarms painted and framed above which was a long duck fowlingpiece flanked by an indian pouch and a powder horn the room was decorated with many indian articles such as pipes of peace tomahawks scalpingknives hunting pouches and belts of wampum and there were various kinds of fishing tackle and two or three fowlingpieces in the corners the household affairs seemed to be conducted in some measure after the masters humours corrected perhaps by a little quiet management of the daughters there was a degree of patriarchal simplicity and goodhumoured indulgence the negroes came into the room without being called merely to look at their master and hear of his adventures they would stand listening at the door until he had finished a story and then go off on a broad grin to repeat it in the kitchen a couple of pet negro children were playing about the floor with the dogs and sharing with them their bread and butter all the domestics looked hearty and happy and when the table was set for the evening repast the variety and abundance of good household luxuries bore testimony to the openhanded liberality of the heer and the notable housewifery of his daughter  in the evening there dropped in several of the worthies of the place the van rennsellaers and the gansevoorts and the rosebooms and others of antony vander heydens intimates to hear an account of his expedition for he was the sindbad of albany and his exploits and adventures were favourite topics of conversation among the inhabitants while these sat gossiping together about the door of the hall and telling long twilight stories dolph was cozily seated entertaining the daughter on a windowbench he had already got on intimate terms for those were not times of false reserve and idle ceremony and besides there is something wonderfully propitious to a lovers suit in the delightful dusk of a long summer evening it gives courage to the most timid tongue and hides the blushes of the bashful the stars alone twinkled brightly and now and then a firefly streamed his transient light before the window or wandering into the room flew gleaming about the ceiling  what dolph whispered in her ear that long summer evening it is impossible to say his words were so low and indistinct that they never reached the ear of the historian it is probable however that they were to the purpose for he had a natural talent at pleasing the sex and was never long in company with a petticoat without paying proper court to it in the meantime the visitors one by one departed antony vander heyden who had fairly talked himself silent sat nodding alone in his chair by the door when he was suddenly aroused by a hearty salute with which dolph heyliger had unguardedly rounded off one of his periods and which echoed through the still chamber like the report of a pistol the heer started up rubbed his eyes called for lights and observed that it was high time to go to bed though on parting for the night he squeezed dolph heartily by the hand looked kindly in his face and shook his head knowingly for the heer well remembered what he himself had been at the youngsters age  the chamber in which our hero was lodged was spacious and panelled with oak it was furnished with clothespresses and mighty chests of drawers well waxed and glittering with brass ornaments these contained ample stock of family linen for the dutch housewives had always a laudable pride in showing off their household treasures to strangers  dolphs mind however was too full to take particular note of the objects around him yet he could not help continually comparing the free openhearted cheeriness of this establishment with the starveling sordid joyless housekeeping at doctor knipperhausens still there was something that marred the enjoymentthe idea that he must take leave of his hearty host and pretty hostess and cast himself once more adrift upon the world to linger here would be folly he should only get deeper in love and for a poor varlet like himself to aspire to the daughter of the great heer vander heydenit was madness to think of such a thing the very kindness that the girl had shown towards him prompted him on reflection to hasten his departure it would be a poor return for the frank hospitality of his host to entangle his daughters heart in an injudicious attachment in a word dolph was like many other young reasoners of exceeding good hearts and giddy heads who think after they act and act differently from what they think who make excellent determinations overnight and forget to keep them the next morning  this is a fine conclusion truly of my voyage said he as he almost buried himself in a sumptuous featherbed and drew the fresh white sheets up to his chin here am i instead of finding a bag of money to carry home launched in a strange place with scarcely a stiver in my pocket and what is worse have jumped ashore up to my very ears in love into the bargain however added he after some pause stretching himself and turning himself in bed im in good quarters for the present at least so ill een enjoy the present moment and let the next take care of itself i dare say all will work out some hew or other for the best  as he said these words he reached out his hand to extinguish the candle when he was suddenly struck with astonishment and dismay for he thought he beheld the phantom of the haunted house staring on him from a dusky part of the chamber a second look reassured him as he perceived that what he had taken for the spectre was in fact nothing but a flemish portrait that hung in a shadowy corner just behind a clothespress it was however the precise representation of his nightly visitorthe same cloak and belted jerkin the same grizzled beard and fixed eye the same broad slouched hat with a feather hanging over one side dolph now called to mind the resemblance he had frequently remarked between his host and the old man of the haunted house and was fully convinced that they were in some way connected and that some especial destiny had governed his voyage he lay gazing on the portrait with almost as much awe as he had gazed on the ghostly original until the shrill houseclock warned him of the lateness of the hour he put out the light but remained for a long time turning over these curious circumstances and coincidences in his mind until he fell asleep his dreams partook of the nature of his waking thoughts he fancied that he still lay gazing on the picture until by degrees it became animated that the figure descended from the wall and walked out of the room that he followed it and found himself by the well to which the old man pointed smiled on him and disappeared  in the morning when dolph waked he found his host standing by his bedside who gave him a hearty mornings salutation and asked him how he had slept dolph answered cheerily but took occasion to inquire about the portrait that hung against the wall ah said heer antony thats a portrait of old killian vander spiegel once a burgomaster of amsterdam who on some popular troubles abandoned holland and came over to the province during the government of peter stuyvesant he was my ancestor by the mothers side and an old miserly curmudgeon he was when the english took possession of newamsterdam in 1664 he retired into the country he fell into a melancholy apprehending that his wealth would be taken from him and that he would come to beggary he turned all his property into cash and used to hide it away he was for a year or two concealed in various places fancying himself sought after by the english to strip him of his wealth and finally was found dead in his bed one morning without any one being able to discover where he had concealed the greater part of his money  when his host had left the room dolph remained for some time lost in thought his whole mind was occupied by what he had heard vander spiegel was his mothers family name and he recollected to have heard her speak of this very killian vander spiegel as one of her ancestors he had heard her say too that her father was kollians rightful heir only that the old man died without leaving any thing to be inherited it now appeared that heer antony was likewise a descendant and perhaps an heir also of this poor rich man and that thus the heyligers and the vander heydens were remotely connected what thought he if after all this is the interpretation of my dream that this is the way i am to make my fortune by this voyage to albany and that i am to find the old mans hidden wealth in the bottom of that well but what an odd roundabout mode of communicating the matter why the plague could not the old goblin have told me about the well at once without sending me all the way to albany to hear a story that was to send me all the way back again  these thoughts passed through his mind while he was dressing he descended the stairs full of perplexity when the bright face of marie vander heyden suddenly beamed in smiles upon him and seemed to give him a clue to the whole mystery after all thought he the old goblin is in the right if i am to get his wealth he means that i shall marry his pretty descendant thus both branches of the family will be again united and the property go on in the proper channel  no sooner did this idea enter his head than it carried conviction with it he was now all impatience to hurry back and secure the treasure which he did not doubt lay at the bottom of the well and which he feared every moment might be discovered by some other person who knows thought he but this nightwalking old fellow of the haunted house may be in the habit of haunting every visitor and may give a hint to some shrewder fellow than myself who will take a shorter cut to the well than by the way of albany he wished a thousand times that the babbling old ghost was laid in the red sea and his rambling portrait with him he was in a perfect fever to depart two or three days elapsed before any opportunity presented for returning down the river they were ages to dolph notwithstanding that he was basking in the smiles of the pretty marie and daily getting more and more enamoured  at length the very sloop from which he had been knocked overboard prepared to make sail dolph made an awkward apology to his host for his sudden departure antony vander heyden was sorely astonished he had concerted halfadozen excursions into the wilderness and his indians were actually preparing for a grand expedition to one of the lakes he took dolph aside and exerted his eloquence to get him to abandon all thoughts of business and to remain with himbut in vain and he at length gave up the attempt observing that it was a thousand pities so fine a young man should throw himself away heer antony however gave him a hearty shake by the hand at parting with a favourite fowlingpiece and an invitation to come to his house whenever he revisited albany the pretty little marie said nothing but as he gave her a farewell kiss her dimpled cheek turned pale and a tear stood in her eye  dolph sprang lightly on board of the vessel they hoisted sail the wind was fair they soon lost sight of albany and its green hills and embowered islands they were wafted gayly past the kaatskill mountains whose fairy heights were bright and cloudless they passed prosperously through the highlands without any molestation from the dunderberg goblin and his crew they swept on across haverstraw bay and by croton point and through the tappaan zee and under the palisadoes until in the afternoon of the third day they saw the promontory of hoboken hanging like a cloud in the air and shortly after the roofs of the manhattoes rising out of the water  dolphs first care was to repair to his mothers house for he was continually goaded by the idea of the uneasiness she must experience on his account he was puzzling his brains as he went along to think how he should account for his absence without betraying the secrets of the haunted house in the midst of these cogitations he entered the street in which his mothers house was situated when he was thunderstruck at beholding it a heap of ruins  there had evidently been a great fire which had destroyed several large houses and the humble dwelling of poor dame heyliger had been involved in the conflagration the walls were not so completely destroyed but that dolph could distinguish some traces of the scene of his childhood the fireplace about which he had often played still remained ornamented with dutch tiles illustrating passages in bible history on which he had many a time gazed with admiration among the rubbish lay the wreck of the good dames elbowchair from which she had given him so many a wholesome precept and hard by it was the family bible with brass clasps now alas reduced almost to a cinder  for a moment dolph was overcome by this dismal sight for he was seized with the fear that his mother had perished in the flames he was relieved however from this horrible apprehension by one of the neighbours who happened to come by and who informed him that his mother was yet alive  the good woman had indeed lost every thing by this unlookedfor calamity for the populace had been so intent upon saving the fine furniture of her rich neighbours that the little tenement and the little all of poor dame heyliger had been suffered to consume without interruption nay had it not been for the gallant assistance of her old crony peter de groodt the worthy dame and her cat might have shared the fate of their habitation  as it was she had been overcome with fright and affliction and lay ill in body and sick at heart the public however had showed her its wonted kindness the furniture of her rich neighbours being as far as possible rescued from the flames themselves duly and ceremoniously visited and condoled with on the injury of their property and their ladies commiserated on the agitation of their nerves the public at length began to recollect something about poor dame heyliger she forthwith became again a subject of universal sympathy every body pitied more than ever and if pity could but have been coined into cashgood lord how rich she would have been  it was now determined in good earnest that something ought to be done for her without delay the dominie therefore put up prayers for her on sunday in which all the congregation joined most heartily even cobus groesbeck the alderman and mynheer milledollar the great dutch merchant stood up in their pews and did not spare their voices on the occasion and it was thought the prayers of such great men could not but have their due weight doctor knipperhausen too visited her professionally and gave her abundance of advice gratis and was universally lauded for his charity as to her old friend peter de groodt he was a poor man whose pity and prayers and advice could be of but little avail so he gave her all that was in his powerhe gave her shelter  to the humble dwelling of peter de groodt then did dolph turn his steps on his way thither he recalled all the tenderness and kindness of his simplehearted parent her indulgence of his errors her blindness to his faults and then he bethought himself of his own idle harumscarum life ive been a sad scapegrace said dolph shaking his head sorrowfully ive been a complete sinkpocket thats the truth of itbut added he briskly and clasping his hands only let her liveonly let her liveand ill show myself indeed a son  as dolph approached the house he met peter de groodt coming out of it the old man started back aghast doubting whether it was not a ghost that stood before him it being bright daylight however peter soon plucked up heart satisfied that no ghost dare show his face in such clear sunshine dolph now learned from the worthy sexton the consternation and rumour to which his mysterious disappearance had given rise it had been universally believed that he had been spirited away by those hobgoblin gentry that infested the haunted house and old abraham vandozer who lived by the great buttonwood trees at the threemile stone affirmed that he had heard a terrible noise in the air as he was going home late at night which seemed just as if a flight of wild geese were overhead passing off towards the northward the haunted house was in consequence looked upon with ten times more awe than ever nobody would venture to pass a night in it for the world and even the doctor had ceased to make his expeditions to it in the daytime  it required some preparation before dolphs return could be made known to his mother the poor soul having bewailed him as lost and her spirits having been sorely broken down by a number of comforters who daily cheered her with stories of ghosts and of people carried away by the devil he found her confined to her bed with the other member of the heyliger family the good dames cat purring beside her but sadly singed and utterly despoiled of those whiskers which were the glory of her physiognomy the poor woman threw her arms about dolphs neck my boy my boy art thou still alive for a time she seemed to have forgotten all her losses and troubles in her joy at his return even the sage grimalkin showed indubitable signs of joy at the return of the youngster she saw perhaps that they were a forlorn and undone family and felt a touch of that kindliness which fellowsufferers only know but in truth cats are a slandered people they have more affection in them than the world commonly gives them credit for  the good dames eyes glistened as she saw one being at least beside herself rejoiced at her sons return tib knows thee poor dumb beast said she smoothing down the mottled coat of her favourite then recollecting herself with a melancholy shake of the head ah my poor dolph exclaimed she thy mother can help thee no longer she can no longer help herself what will become of thee my poor boy  mother said dolph dont talk in that strain ive been too long a charge upon you its now my part to take care of you in your old days come be of good heart you and i and tib will all see better days im here you see young and sound and hearty then dont let us despair i dare say things will all some how or other turn out for the best  while this scene was going on with the heyliger family the news was carried to doctor knipperhausen of the safe return of his disciple the little doctor scarcely knew whether to rejoice or be sorry at the tidings he was happy at having the foul reports which had prevailed concerning his country mansion thus disproved but he grieved at having his disciple of whom he had supposed himself fairly disencumbered thus drifting back a heavy charge upon his hands while he was balancing between these two feelings he was determined by the counsels of frau ilsy who advised him to take advantage of the truant absence of the youngster and shut the door upon him for ever  at the hour of bedtime therefore when it was supposed the recreant disciple would seek his old quarters every thing was prepared for his reception dolph having talked his mother into a state of tranquillity sought the mansion of his quondam master and raised the knocker with a faltering hand scarcely however had it given a dubious rap when the doctors head in a red nightcap popped out of one window and the housekeepers in a white nightcap out of another he was now greeted with a tremendous volley of hard names and hard language mingled with invaluable pieces of advice such as are seldom ventured to be given excepting to a friend in distress or a culprit at the bar in a few moments not a window in the street but had its particular nightcap listening to the shrill treble of frau ilsy and the guttural croaking of dr knipperhausen and the word went from window to window ah heres dolph heyliger come back and at his old pranks again in short poor dolph found he was likely to get nothing from the doctor but good advicea commodity so abundant as even to be thrown out of the window so he was fain to beat a retreat and take up his quarters for the night under the lowly roof of honest peter de groodt  the next morning bright and early dolph was at the haunted house every thing looked just as he had left it the fields were grassgrown and matted and it appeared as if nobody had traversed them since his departure with palpitating heart he hastened to the well he looked down into it and saw that it was of great depth with water at the bottom he had provided himself with a strong line such as the fishermen use on the banks of newfoundland at the end was a heavy plummet and a large fishhook with this he began to sound the bottom of the well and to angle about in the water he found that the water was of some depth there appeared also to be much rubbish stones from the top having fallen in several times his hook got entangled and he came near breaking his line now and then too he hauled up mere trash such as the skull of a horse an iron hoop and a shattered ironbound bucket he had now been several hours employed without finding any thing to repay his trouble or to encourage him to proceed he began to think himself a great fool to be thus decoyed into a wildgoosechase by mere dreams and was on the point of throwing line and all into the well and giving up all further angling  one more cast of the line said he and that shall be the last as he sounded he felt the plummet slip as it were through the interstices of loose stones and as he drew back the line he felt that the hook had taken hold of something heavy he had to manage his line with great caution lest it should be broken by the strain upon it by degrees the rubbish that lay upon the article which he had hooked gave way he drew it to the surface of the water and what was his rapture at seeing something like silver glittering at the end of his line almost breathless with anxiety he drew it up to the mouth of the well surprised at its great weight and fearing every instant that his hook would slip from its hold and his prize tumble again to the bottom at length he landed it safe beside the well it was a great silver porringer of an ancient form richly embossed and with armorial bearings similar to those over his mothers mantelpiece engraved on its side  the lid was fastened down by several twists of wire dolph loosened them with a trembling hand and on lifting the lid behold the vessel was filled with broad golden pieces of a coinage which he had never seen before it was evident he had lit on the place where killian vander spiegel had concealed his treasure  fearful of being seen by some straggler he cautiously retired and buried his pot of money in a secret place he now spread terrible stories about the haunted house and deterred every one from approaching it while he made frequent visits to it on stormy days when no one was stirring in the neighbouring fields though to tell the truth he did not care to venture there in the dark for once in his life he was diligent and industrious and followed up his new trade of angling with such perseverance and success that in a little while he had hooked up wealth enough to make him in those moderate days a rich burgher for life  it would be tedious to detail minutely the rest of this storyto tell how he gradually managed to bring his property into use without exciting surprise and inquiryhow he satisfied all scruples with regard to retaining the property and at the same time gratified his own feelings by marrying the pretty marie vander heydenand how he and heer antony had many a merry and roving expedition together  i must not omit to say however that dolph took his mother home to live with him and cherished her in her old days the good dame too had the satisfaction of no longer hearing her son made the theme of censure on the contrary he grew daily in public esteem every body spoke well of him and his wines and the lordliest burgomaster was never known to decline his invitation to dinner dolph often related at his own table the wicked pranks which had once been the abhorrence of the town but they were now considered excellent jokes and the gravest dignitary was fain to hold his sides when listening to them no one was more struck with dolphs increasing merit than his old master the doctor and so forgiving was dolph that he actually employed the doctor as his family physician only taking care that his prescriptions should be always thrown out of the window his mother had often her junto of old cronies to take a snug cup of tea with her in her comfortable little parlour and peter de groodt as he sat by the fireside with one of her grandchildren on his knee would many a time congratulate her upon her son turning out so great a man upon which the good old soul would wag her head with exultation and exclaim ah neighbour neighbour did i not say that dolph would one day or other hold up his head with the best of them  thus did dolph heyliger go on cheerily and prosperously growing merrier as he grew older and wiser and completely falsifying the old proverb about money got over the devils back for he made good use of his wealth and became a distinguished citizen and a valuable member of the community he was a great promoter of public institutions such as beefsteak societies and catchclubs he presided at all public dinners and was the first that introduced turtle from the west indies he improved the breed of racehorses and gamecocks and was so great a patron of modest merit that any one who could sing a good song or tell a good story was sure to find a place at his table  he was a member too of the corporation made several laws for the protection of game and oysters and bequeathed to the board a large silver punchbowl made out of the identical porringer before mentioned and which is in the possession of the corporation to this very day  finally he died in a florid old age of an apoplexy at a corporation feast and was buried with great honours in the yard of the little dutch church in gardenstreet where his tombstone may still be seen with a modest epitaph in dutch by his friend mynheer justus benson an ancient and excellent poet of the province  the foregoing tale rests on better authority than most tales of the kind as i have it at secondhand from the lips of dolph heyliger himself he never related it till towards the latter part of his life and then in great confidence for he was very discreet to a few of his particular cronies at his own table over a supernumerary bowl of punch and strange as the hobgoblin parts of the story may seem there never was a single doubt expressed on the subject by any of his guests it may not be amiss before concluding to observe that in addition to his other accomplishments dolph heyliger was noted for being the ablest drawer of the longbow in the whole province     the wedding    no more no more much honour aye betide   the lofty bridegroom and the lovely bride   that all of their succeeding days may say   each day appears like to a weddingday    braithwaite   notwithstanding the doubts and demurs of lady lillycraft and all the grave objections that were conjured up against the month of may yet the wedding has at length happily taken place it was celebrated at the village church in presence of a numerous company of relatives and friends and many of the tenantry the squire must needs have something of the old ceremonies observed on the occasion so at the gate of the churchyard several little girls of the village dressed in white were in readiness with baskets of flowers which they strewed before the bride and the butler bore before her the bridecup a great silver embossed bowl one of the family relics from the days of the hard drinkers this was filled with rich wine and decorated with a branch of rosemary tied with gay ribands according to ancient custom  happy is the bride that the sun shines on says the old proverb and it was as sunny and auspicious a morning as heart could wish the bride looked uncommonly beautiful but in fact what woman does not look interesting on her weddingday i know no sight more charming and touching than that of a young and timid bride in her robes of virgin white led up trembling to the altar when i thus behold a lovely girl in the tenderness of her years forsaking the house of her fathers and the home of her childhood and with the implicit confiding and the sweet selfabandonment which belong to woman giving up all the world for the man of her choice when i hear her in the good old language of the ritual yielding herself to him for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health to love honour and obey till death us do part it brings to my mind the beautiful and affecting selfdevotion of ruth whither thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god  the fair julia was supported on the trying occasion by lady lillycraft whose heart was overflowing with its wonted sympathy in all matters of love and matrimony as the bride approached the altar her face would be one moment covered with blushes and the next deadly pale and she seemed almost ready to shrink from sight among her female companions  i do not know what it is that makes every one serious and as it were awestruck at a marriage ceremonywhich is generally considered as an occasion of festivity and rejoicing as the ceremony was performing i observed many a rosy face among the country girls turn pale and i did not see a smile throughout the church the young ladies from the hall were almost as much frightened as if it had been their own case and stole many a look of sympathy at their trembling companion a tear stood in the eye of the sensitive lady lillycraft and as to phoebe wilkins who was present she absolutely wept and sobbed aloud but it is hard to tell half the time what these fond foolish creatures are crying about  the captain too though naturally gay and unconcerned was much agitated on the occasion and in attempting to put the ring upon the brides finger dropped it on the floor which lady lillycraft has since assured me is a very lucky omen even master simon had lost his usual vivacity and had assumed a most whimsically solemn face which he is apt to do on all occasions of ceremony he had much whispering with the parson and parishclerk for he is always a busy personage in the scene and he echoed the clerks amen with a solemnity and devotion that edified the whole assemblage  the moment however that the ceremony was over the transition was magical the bridecup was passed round according to ancient usage for the company to drink to a happy union every ones feelings seemed to break forth from restraint master simon had a world of bachelor pleasantries to utter and as to the gallant general he bowed and cooed about the dulcet lady lillycraft like a mighty cockpigeon about his dame  the villagers gathered in the churchyard to cheer the happy couple as they left the church and the musical tailor had marshalled his band and set up a hideous discord as the blushing and smiling bride passed through a lane of honest peasantry to her carriage the children shouted and threw up their hats the bells rung a merry peal that set all the crows and rooks flying and cawing about the air and threatened to bring down the battlements of the old tower and there was a continual popping off of rusty firelocks from every part of the neighbourhood  the prodigal son distinguished himself on the occasion having hoisted a flag on the top of the schoolhouse and kept the village in a hubbub from sunrise with the sound of drum and fife and pandean pipe in which species of music several of his scholars are making wonderful proficiency in his great zeal however he had nearly done mischief for on returning from church the horses of the brides carriage took fright from the discharge of a row of old gunbarrels which he had mounted as a park of artillery in front of the schoolhouse to give the captain a military salute as he passed  the day passed off with great rustic rejoicing tables were spread under the trees in the park where all the peasantry of the neighbourhood were regaled with roastbeef and plumpudding and oceans of ale readymoney jack presided at one of the tables and became so full of good cheer as to unbend from his usual gravity to sing a song out of all tune and give two or three shouts of laughter that almost electrified his neighbours like so many peals of thunder the schoolmaster and the apothecary vied with each other in making speeches over their liquor and there were occasional glees and musical performances by the village band that must have frightened every faun and dryad from the park even old christy who had got on a new dress from top to toe and shone in all the splendour of bright leather breeches and an enormous wedding favour in his cap forgot his usual crustiness became inspired by wine and wassel and absolutely danced a hornpipe on one of the tables with all the grace and agility of a manikin hung upon wires  equal gayety reigned within doors where a large party of friends were entertained every one laughed at his own pleasantry without attending to that of his neighbours loads of bridecake were distributed the young ladies were all busy in passing morsels of it through the weddingring to dream on and i myself assisted a few little boardingschool girls in putting up a quantity for their companions which i have no doubt will set all the little heads in the school gadding for a week at least  after dinner all the company great and small gentle and simple abandoned themselves to the dance not the modern quadrille with its graceful gravity but the merry social old countrydance the true dance as the squire says for a wedding occasion as it sets all the world jigging in couples hand in hand and makes every eye and every heart dance merrily to the music according to frank old usage the gentlefolks of the hall mingled for a tune in the dance of the peasantry who had a great tent erected for a ballroom and i think i never saw master simon more in his element than when figuring about among his rustic admirers as master of the ceremonies and with a mingled air of protection and gallantry leading out the quondam queen of may all blushing at the signal honour conferred upon her  in the evening the whole village was illuminated excepting the house of the radical who has not shown his face during the rejoicings there was a display of fireworks at the schoolhouse got up by the prodigal son which had wellnigh set fire to the building the squire is so much pleased with the extraordinary services of this last mentioned worthy that he talks of enrolling him in his list of valuable retainers and promoting him to some important post on the estate peradventure to be falconer if the hawks can ever be brought into proper training  there is a wellknown old proverb that says one wedding makes manyor something to the same purpose and i should not be surprised if it holds good in the present instance i have seen several flirtations among the young people that have been brought together on this occasion and a great deal of strolling about in pairs among the retired walks and blossoming shrubberies of the old garden and if groves were really given to whispering as poets would fain make us believe heaven knows what love tales the gravelooking old trees about this venerable countryseat might blab to the world  the general too has waxed very zealous in his devotions within the last few days as the time of her ladyships departure approaches i observed him casting many a tender look at her during the wedding dinner while the courses were changing though he was always liable to be interrupted in his adoration by the appearance of any new delicacy the general in fact has arrived at that time of life when the heart and the stomach maintain a kind of balance of power and when a man is apt to be perplexed in his affections between a fine woman and a truffled turkey her ladyship was certainly rivalled through the whole of the first course by a dish of stewed carp and there was one glance which was evidently intended to be a pointblank shot at her heart and could scarcely have failed to effect a practicable breach had it not unluckily been directed away to a tempting breast of lamb in which it immediately produced a formidable incision thus did this faithless general go on coquetting during the whole dinner and committing an infidelity with every new dish until in the end he was so overpowered by the attentions he had paid to fish flesh and fowl to pastry jelly cream and blancmange that he seemed to sink within himself his eyes swam beneath their lids and their fire was so much slackened that he could no longer discharge a single glance that would reach across the table upon the whole i fear the general ate himself into as much disgrace at this memorable dinner as i have seen him sleep himself into on a former occasion  i am told moreover that young jack tibbets was so touched by the wedding ceremony at which he was present and so captivated by the sensibility of poor phoebe wilkins who certainly looked all the better for her tears that he had a reconciliation with her that very day after dinner in one of the groves of the park and danced with her in the evening to the complete confusion of all dame tibbets domestic politics i met them walking together in the park shortly after the reconciliation must have taken place young jack carried himself gayly and manfully but phoebe hung her head blushing as i approached however just as she passed me and dropped a curtsy i caught a shy gleam of her eye from under her bonnet but it was immediately cast down again i saw enough in that single gleam and in the involuntary smile that dimpled about her rosy lips to feel satisfied that the little gipsys heart was happy again  what is more lady lillycraft with her usual benevolence and zeal in all matters of this tender nature on hearing of the reconciliation of the lovers undertook the critical task of breaking the matter to readymoney jack she thought there was no time like the present and attacked the sturdy old yeoman that very evening in the park while his heart was yet lifted up with the squires good cheer jack was a little surprised at being drawn aside by her ladyship but was not to be flurried by such an honour he was still more surprised by the nature of her communication and by this first intelligence of an affair which had been passing under his eye he listened however with his usual gravity as her ladyship represented the advantages of the match the good qualities of the girl and the distress which she had lately suffered at length his eye began to kindle and his hand to play with the head of his cudgel lady lillycraft saw that something in the narrative had gone wrong and hastened to mollify his rising ire by reiterating the softhearted phoebes merit and fidelity and her great unhappiness when old readymoney suddenly interrupted her by exclaiming that if jack did not marry the wench hed break every bone in his body the match therefore is considered a settled thing dame tibbets and the housekeeper have made friends and drank tea together and phoebe has again recovered her good looks and good spirits and is carolling from morning till night like a lark  but the most whimsical caprice of cupid is one that i should be almost afraid to mention did i not know that i was writing for readers well experienced in the waywardness of this most mischievous deity the morning after the wedding therefore while lady lillycraft was making preparations for her departure an audience was requested by her immaculate handmaid mrs hannah who with much primming of the mouth and many maidenly hesitations requested leave to stay behind and that lady lillycraft would supply her place with some other servant her ladyship was astonished what hannah going to quit her that had lived with her so long  why one could not help it one must settle in life some time or other  the good lady was still lost in amazement at length the secret was gasped from the dry lips of the maiden gentlewoman she had been some time thinking of changing her condition and at length had given her word last evening to mr christy the huntsman  how or when or where this singular courtship had been carried on i have not been able to learn nor how she has been able with the vinegar of her disposition to soften the stony heart of old nimrod so however it is and it has astonished every one with all her ladyships love of matchmaking this last fume of hymens torch has been too much for her she has endeavoured to reason with mrs hannah but all in vain her mind was made up and she grew tart on the least contradiction lady lillycraft applied to the squire for his interference she did not know what she should do without mrs hannah she had been used to have her about her so long a time  the squire on the contrary rejoiced in the match as relieving the good lady from a kind of toilettyrant under whose sway she had suffered for years instead of thwarting the affair therefore he has given it his full countenance and declares that he will set up the young couple in one of the best cottages on his estate the approbation of the squire has been followed by that of the whole household they all declare that if ever matches are really made in heaven this must have been for that old christy and mrs hannah were as evidently formed to be linked together as ever were pepperbox and vinegarcruet  as soon as this matter was arranged lady lillycraft took her leave of the family at the hall taking with her the captain and his blushing bride who are to pass the honeymoon with her master simon accompanied them on horseback and indeed means to ride on ahead to make preparations the general who was fishing in vain for an invitation to her seat handed her ladyship into the carriage with a heavy sigh upon which his bosom friend master simon who was just mounting his horse gave me a knowing wink made an abominably wry face and leaning from his saddle whispered loudly in my ear it wont do then putting spurs to his horse away he cantered off the general stood for some time waving his hat after the carriage as it rolled down the avenue until he was seized with a fit of sneezing from exposing his head to the cool breeze i observed that he returned rather thoughtfully to the house whistling softly to himself with his hands behind his back and an exceedingly dubious air  the company have now almost all taken their departure i have determined to do the same tomorrow morning and i hope my reader may not think that i have already lingered too long at the hall i have been tempted to do so however because i thought i had lit upon one of the retired places where there are yet some traces to be met with of old english character a little while hence and all these will probably have passed away readymoney jack will sleep with his fathers the good squire and all his peculiarities will be buried in the neighbouring church the old hall will be modernized into a fashionable countryseat or peradventure a manufactory the park will be cut up into petty farms and kitchengardens a daily coach will run through the village it will become like all other commonplace villages thronged with coachmen postboys tipplers and politicians and christmas mayday and all the other hearty merrymakings of the good old times will be forgotten     the authors farewell    and so without more circumstance at all   i hold it fit that we shake hands and part    hamlet   having taken leave of the hall and its inmates and brought the history of my visit to something like a close there seems to remain nothing further than to make my bow and exit it is my foible however to get on such companionable terms with my reader in the course of a work that it really costs me some pain to part with him and i am apt to keep him by the hand and have a few farewell wards at the end of my last volume  when i cast an eye back upon the work i am just concluding i cannot but be sensible how full it must be of errors and imperfections indeed how should it be otherwise writing as i do about subjects and scenes with which as a stranger i am but partially acquainted many will doubtless find cause to smile at very obvious blunders which i may have made and many may perhaps be offended at what they may conceive prejudiced representations some will think i might have said much more on such subjects as may suit their peculiar tastes whilst others will think i had done wiser to have left those subjects entirely alone  it will probably be said too by some that i view england with a partial eye perhaps i do for i can never forget that it is my father land and yet the circumstances under which i have viewed it have by no means been such as were calculated to produce favourable impressions for the greater part of the time that i have resided in it i have lived almost unknowing and unknown seeking no favours and receiving none a stranger and a sojourner in the land and subject to all the chills and neglects that are the common lot of the stranger  when i consider these circumstances and recollect how often i have taken up my pen with a mind ill at ease and spirits much dejected and cast down i cannot but think i was not likely to err on the favourable side of the picture the opinions i have given of english character have been the result of much quiet dispassionate and varied observation it is a character not to be hastily studied for it always puts on a repulsive and ungracious aspect to a stranger let those then who condemn my representations as too favourable observe this people as closely and deliberately as i have done and they will probably change their opinion of one thing at any rate i am certain that i have spoken honestly and sincerely from the convictions of my mind and the dictates of my heart when i first published my former writings it was with no hope of gaining favour in english eyes for i little thought they were to become current out of my own country and had i merely sought popularity among my own countrymen i should have taken a more direct and obvious way by gratifying rather than rebuking the angry feelings that were then prevalent against england  and here let me acknowledge my warm my thankful feelings at the effect produced by one of my trivial lucubrations i allude to the essay in the sketchbook on the subject of the literary feuds between england and america i cannot express the heartfelt delight i have experienced at the unexpected sympathy and approbation with which those remarks have been received on both sides of the atlantic i speak this not from any paltry feelings of gratified vanity for i attribute the effect to no merit of my pen the paper in question was brief and casual and the ideas it conveyed were simple and obvious it was the cause it was the cause alone there vras a predisposition on the part of my readers to be favourably affected my countrymen responded in heart to the filial feelings i had avowed in their name towards the parent country and there was a generous sympathy in every english bosom towards a solitary individual lifting up his voice in a strange land to vindicate the injured character of his nation there are some causes sosacred as to carry with them an irresistible appeal to every virtuous bosom and he needs but little power of eloquence who defends the honour of his wife his mother or his country  i hail therefore the success of that brief paper as showing how much good may be done by a kind word however feeble when spoken in seasonas showing how much dormant goodfeeling actually exists in each country towards the other which only wants the slightest spark to kindle it into a genial flameas showing in fact what i have all along believed and asserted that the two nations would grow together in esteem and amity if meddling and malignant spirits would but throw by their mischievous pens and leave kindred hearts to the kindly impulses of nature  i once more assert and i assert it with increased conviction of its truth that there exists among the great majority of my countrymen a favourable feeling toward england i repeat this assertion because i think it a truth that cannot too often be reiterated and because it has met with some contradiction among all the liberal and enlightened minds of my countrymen among all those which eventually give a tone to national opinion there exists a cordial desire to be on terms of courtesy and friendship but at the same time there exists in those very minds a distrust of reciprocal goodwill on the part of england they have been rendered morbidly sensitive by the attacks made upon their country by the english press and their occasional irritability on this subject has been misinterpreted into a settled and unnatural hostility  for my part i consider this jealous sensibility as belonging to generous natures i should look upon my countrymen as fallen indeed from that independence of spirit which is their birthgift as fallen indeed from that pride of character which they inherit from the proud nation from which they sprung could they tamely sit down under the infliction of contumely and insult indeed the very impatience which they show as to the misrepresentations of the press proves their respect for english opinion and their desire for english amity for there is never jealousy where there is not strong regard  it is easy to say that these attacks are all the effusions of worthless scribblers and treated with silent contempt by the nation but alas the slanders of the scribbler travel abroad and the silent contempt of the nation is only known at home with england then it remains as i have formerly asserted to promote a mutual spirit of conciliation she has but to hold the language of friendship and respect and she is secure of the goodwill of every american bosom  in expressing these sentiments i would utter nothing that should commit the proper spirit of my countrymen we seek no boon at englands hands we ask nothing as a favour her friendship is not necessary nor would her hostility be dangerous to our wellbeing we ask nothing from abroad that we cannot reciprocate but with respect to england we have a warm feeling of the heart the glow of consanguinity that still lingers in our blood interest apartpast differences forgottenwe extend the hand of old relationship we merely ask do not estrange us from you do not destroy the ancient tie of blood do not let scoffers and slanderers drive a kindred nation from your side we would fain be friends do not compel us to be enemies  there needs no better rallyingground for international amity than that furnished by an eminent english writer there is say she a sacred bond between us of blood and of language which no circumstances can break our literature must always be theirs and though their laws are no longer the same as ours we have the same bible and we address our common father in the same prayer nations are too ready to admit that they have natural enemies why should they be less willing to believe that they have natural friends18  footnote 18 from an article said to be by robert southey esq published in the quarterly review it is to be lamented that that publication should so often forget the generous text here given  to the magnanimous spirits of both countries must we trust to carry such a natural alliance of affection into full effect to pens more powerful than mine i leave the noble task of promoting the cause of national amity to the intelligent and enlightened of my own country i address my parting voice entreating them to show themselves superior to the petty attacks of the ignorant and the worthless and still to look with dispassionate and philosophic eye to the moral character of england as the intellectual source of our rising greatness while i appeal to every generousminded englishman from the slanders which disgrace the press insult the understanding and belie the magnanimity of his country and i invite him to look to america as to a kindred nation worthy of its origin giving in the healthy vigour of its growth the best of comments on its parent stock and reflecting in the dawning brightness of its fame the moral effulgence of british glory  i am sure that such an appeal will not be made in vain indeed i have noticed for some time past an essential change in english sentiment with regard to amerioar in parliament that fountainhead of public opinion there seems to be an emulation on both sides of the house in holding the language of courtesy and friendship the same spirit is daily becoming more and more prevalent in good society there is a growing curiosity concerning my country a craving desire for correct information that cannot fail to lead to a favourable understanding the scoffer i trust has had his day the time of the slanderer is gone by the ribald jokes the stale commonplaces which have so long passed current when america was the theme are now banished to the ignorant and the vulgar or only perpetuated by the hireling scribblers and traditional jesters of the press the intelligent and highminded now pride themselves upon making america a study  but however my feelings may be understood or reciprocated on either side of the atlantic i utter them without reserve for i have ever found that to speak frankly is to speak safely i am not so sanguine as to believe that the two nations are ever to be bound together by any romantic ties of feeling but i believe that much may be done towards keeping alive cordial sentiments were every welldisposed mind occasionally to throw in a simple word of kindness if i have indeed produced any such effect by my writings it will be a soothing reflection to me that for once in the course of a rather negligent life i have been useful that for once by the casual exercise of a pen which has been in general but too unprofitably employed i have awakened a cord of sympathy between the land of my fathers and the dear land that gave me birth  in the spirit of these sentiments i now take my farewell of the paternal soil with anxious eye do i behold the clouds of doubt and difficulty that are lowering over it and earnestly do i hope that they may all clear up into serene and settled sunshine in bidding this last adieu my heart is filled with fond yet melancholy emotions and still i linger and still like a child leaving the venerable abodes of his forefathers i turn to breathe forth a filial benediction peace be within thy walls o england and plenteousness within thy palaces for my brethren and my companions sake i will now say peace be within thee
