54878784	nostromo  a tale of the seaboard   by joseph conrad     so foul a sky clears not without a storm shakespeare     to john galsworthy     authors note   nostromo is the most anxiously meditated of the longer novels which belong to the period following upon the publication of the typhoon volume of short stories  i dont mean to say that i became then conscious of any impending change in my mentality and in my attitude towards the tasks of my writing life and perhaps there was never any change except in that mysterious extraneous thing which has nothing to do with the theories of art a subtle change in the nature of the inspiration a phenomenon for which i can not in any way be held responsible what however did cause me some concern was that after finishing the last story of the typhoon volume it seemed somehow that there was nothing more in the world to write about  this so strangely negative but disturbing mood lasted some little time and then as with many of my longer stories the first hint for nostromo came to me in the shape of a vagrant anecdote completely destitute of valuable details  as a matter of fact in 1875 or 6 when very young in the west indies or rather in the gulf of mexico for my contacts with land were short few and fleeting i heard the story of some man who was supposed to have stolen singlehanded a whole lighterfull of silver somewhere on the tierra firme seaboard during the troubles of a revolution  on the face of it this was something of a feat but i heard no details and having no particular interest in crime qua crime i was not likely to keep that one in my mind and i forgot it till twentysix or seven years afterwards i came upon the very thing in a shabby volume picked up outside a secondhand bookshop it was the life story of an american seaman written by himself with the assistance of a journalist in the course of his wanderings that american sailor worked for some months on board a schooner the master and owner of which was the thief of whom i had heard in my very young days i have no doubt of that because there could hardly have been two exploits of that peculiar kind in the same part of the world and both connected with a south american revolution  the fellow had actually managed to steal a lighter with silver and this it seems only because he was implicitly trusted by his employers who must have been singularly poor judges of character in the sailors story he is represented as an unmitigated rascal a small cheat stupidly ferocious morose of mean appearance and altogether unworthy of the greatness this opportunity had thrust upon him what was interesting was that he would boast of it openly  he used to say people think i make a lot of money in this schooner of mine but that is nothing i dont care for that now and then i go away quietly and lift a bar of silver i must get rich slowlyyou understand  there was also another curious point about the man once in the course of some quarrel the sailor threatened him whats to prevent me reporting ashore what you have told me about that silver  the cynical ruffian was not alarmed in the least he actually laughed you fool if you dare talk like that on shore about me you will get a knife stuck in your back every man woman and child in that port is my friend and whos to prove the lighter wasnt sunk i didnt show you where the silver is hidden did i so you know nothing and suppose i lied eh  ultimately the sailor disgusted with the sordid meanness of that impenitent thief deserted from the schooner the whole episode takes about three pages of his autobiography nothing to speak of but as i looked them over the curious confirmation of the few casual words heard in my early youth evoked the memories of that distant time when everything was so fresh so surprising so venturesome so interesting bits of strange coasts under the stars shadows of hills in the sunshine mens passions in the dusk gossip halfforgotten faces grown dim    perhaps perhaps there still was in the world something to write about yet i did not see anything at first in the mere story a rascal steals a large parcel of a valuable commodityso people say its either true or untrue and in any case it has no value in itself to invent a circumstantial account of the robbery did not appeal to me because my talents not running that way i did not think that the game was worth the candle it was only when it dawned upon me that the purloiner of the treasure need not necessarily be a confirmed rogue that he could be even a man of character an actor and possibly a victim in the changing scenes of a revolution it was only then that i had the first vision of a twilight country which was to become the province of sulaco with its high shadowy sierra and its misty campo for mute witnesses of events flowing from the passions of men shortsighted in good and evil  such are in very truth the obscure origins of nostromothe book from that moment i suppose it had to be yet even then i hesitated as if warned by the instinct of selfpreservation from venturing on a distant and toilsome journey into a land full of intrigues and revolutions but it had to be done  it took the best part of the years 19034 to do with many intervals of renewed hesitation lest i should lose myself in the everenlarging vistas opening before me as i progressed deeper in my knowledge of the country often also when i had thought myself to a standstill over the tangledup affairs of the republic i would figuratively speaking pack my bag rush away from sulaco for a change of air and write a few pages of the mirror of the sea but generally as ive said before my sojourn on the continent of latin america famed for its hospitality lasted for about two years on my return i found speaking somewhat in the style of captain gulliver my family all well my wife heartily glad to learn that the fuss was all over and our small boy considerably grown during my absence  my principal authority for the history of costaguana is of course my venerated friend the late don jose avellanos minister to the courts of england and spain etc etc in his impartial and eloquent history of fifty years of misrule that work was never publishedthe reader will discover whyand i am in fact the only person in the world possessed of its contents i have mastered them in not a few hours of earnest meditation and i hope that my accuracy will be trusted in justice to myself and to allay the fears of prospective readers i beg to point out that the few historical allusions are never dragged in for the sake of parading my unique erudition but that each of them is closely related to actuality either throwing a light on the nature of current events or affecting directly the fortunes of the people of whom i speak  as to their own histories i have tried to set them down aristocracy and people men and women latin and anglosaxon bandit and politician with as cool a hand as was possible in the heat and clash of my own conflicting emotions and after all this is also the story of their conflicts it is for the reader to say how far they are deserving of interest in their actions and in the secret purposes of their hearts revealed in the bitter necessities of the time i confess that for me that time is the time of firm friendships and unforgotten hospitalities and in my gratitude i must mention here mrs gould the first lady of sulaco whom we may safely leave to the secret devotion of dr monygham and charles gould the idealistcreator of material interests whom we must leave to his minefrom which there is no escape in this world  about nostromo the second of the two racially and socially contrasted men both captured by the silver of the san tome mine i feel bound to say something more  i did not hesitate to make that central figure an italian first of all the thing is perfectly credible italians were swarming into the occidental province at the time as anybody who will read further can see and secondly there was no one who could stand so well by the side of giorgio viola the garibaldino the idealist of the old humanitarian revolutions for myself i needed there a man of the people as free as possible from his classconventions and all settled modes of thinking this is not a side snarl at conventions my reasons were not moral but artistic had he been an anglosaxon he would have tried to get into local politics but nostromo does not aspire to be a leader in a personal game he does not want to raise himself above the mass he is content to feel himself a powerwithin the people  but mainly nostromo is what he is because i received the inspiration for him in my early days from a mediterranean sailor those who have read certain pages of mine will see at once what i mean when i say that dominic the padrone of the tremolino might under given circumstances have been a nostromo at any rate dominic would have understood the younger man perfectlyif scornfully he and i were engaged together in a rather absurd adventure but the absurdity does not matter it is a real satisfaction to think that in my very young days there must after all have been something in me worthy to command that mans halfbitter fidelity his halfironic devotion many of nostromos speeches i have heard first in dominics voice his hand on the tiller and his fearless eyes roaming the horizon from within the monkish hood shadowing his face he would utter the usual exordium of his remorseless wisdom vous autres gentilhommes in a caustic tone that hangs on my ear yet like nostromo you hombres finos very much like nostromo but dominic the corsican nursed a certain pride of ancestry from which my nostromo is free for nostromos lineage had to be more ancient still he is a man with the weight of countless generations behind him and no parentage to boast of    like the people  in his firm grip on the earth he inherits in his improvidence and generosity in his lavishness with his gifts in his manly vanity in the obscure sense of his greatness and in his faithful devotion with something despairing as well as desperate in its impulses he is a man of the people their very own unenvious force disdaining to lead but ruling from within years afterwards grown older as the famous captain fidanza with a stake in the country going about his many affairs followed by respectful glances in the modernized streets of sulaco calling on the widow of the cargador attending the lodge listening in unmoved silence to anarchist speeches at the meeting the enigmatical patron of the new revolutionary agitation the trusted the wealthy comrade fidanza with the knowledge of his moral ruin locked up in his breast he remains essentially a man of the people in his mingled love and scorn of life and in the bewildered conviction of having been betrayed of dying betrayed he hardly knows by what or by whom he is still of the people their undoubted great manwith a private history of his own  one more figure of those stirring times i would like to mention and that is antonia avellanosthe beautiful antonia whether she is a possible variation of latinamerican girlhood i wouldnt dare to affirm but for me she is always a little in the background by the side of her father my venerated friend i hope she has yet relief enough to make intelligible what i am going to say of all the people who had seen with me the birth of the occidental republic she is the only one who has kept in my memory the aspect of continued life antonia the aristocrat and nostromo the man of the people are the artisans of the new era the true creators of the new state he by his legendary and daring feat she like a woman simply by the force of what she is the only being capable of inspiring a sincere passion in the heart of a trifler  if anything could induce me to revisit sulaco i should hate to see all these changes it would be antonia and the true reason for thatwhy not be frank about itthe true reason is that i have modelled her on my first love how we a band of tallish schoolboys the chums of her two brothers how we used to look up to that girl just out of the schoolroom herself as the standardbearer of a faith to which we all were born but which she alone knew how to hold aloft with an unflinching hope she had perhaps more glow and less serenity in her soul than antonia but she was an uncompromising puritan of patriotism with no taint of the slightest worldliness in her thoughts i was not the only one in love with her but it was i who had to hear oftenest her scathing criticism of my levitiesvery much like poor decoudor stand the brunt of her austere unanswerable invective she did not quite understandbut never mind that afternoon when i came in a shrinking yet defiant sinner to say the final goodbye i received a handsqueeze that made my heart leap and saw a tear that took my breath away she was softened at the last as though she had suddenly perceived we were such children still that i was really going away for good going very far awayeven as far as sulaco lying unknown hidden from our eyes in the darkness of the placid gulf  thats why i long sometimes for another glimpse of the beautiful antonia or can it be the other moving in the dimness of the great cathedral saying a short prayer at the tomb of the first and last cardinalarchbishop of sulaco standing absorbed in filial devotion before the monument of don jose avellanos and with a lingering tender faithful glance at the medallionmemorial to martin decoud going out serenely into the sunshine of the plaza with her upright carriage and her white head a relic of the past disregarded by men awaiting impatiently the dawns of other new eras the coming of more revolutions  but this is the idlest of dreams for i did understand perfectly well at the time that the moment the breath left the body of the magnificent capataz the man of the people freed at last from the toils of love and wealth there was nothing more for me to do in sulaco   j c  october 1917     contents  part first   the silver of the mine  part second  the isabels  part third   the lighthouse     nostromo     part

never been commercially anything more important than a coasting port with a fairly large local trade in oxhides and indigo the clumsy deepsea galleons of the conquerors that needing a brisk gale to move at all would lie becalmed where your modern ship built on clipper lines forges ahead by the mere flapping of her sails had been barred out of sulaco by the prevailing calms of its vast gulf some harbours of the earth are made difficult of access by the treachery of sunken rocks and the tempests of their shores sulaco had found an inviolable sanctuary from the temptations of a trading world in the solemn hush of the deep golfo placido as if within an enormous semicircular and unroofed temple open to the ocean with its walls of lofty mountains hung with the mourning draperies of cloud  on one side of this broad curve in the straight seaboard of the republic of costaguana the last spur of the coast range forms an insignificant cape whose name is punta mala from the middle of the gulf the point of the land itself is not visible at all but the shoulder of a steep hill at the back can be made out faintly like a shadow on the sky  on the other side what seems to be an isolated patch of blue mist floats lightly on the glare of the horizon this is the peninsula of azuera a wild chaos of sharp rocks and stony levels cut about by vertical ravines it lies far out to sea like a rough head of stone stretched from a greenclad coast at the end of a slender neck of sand covered with thickets of thorny scrub utterly waterless for the rainfall runs off at once on all sides into the sea it has not soil enoughit is saidto grow a single blade of grass as if it were blighted by a curse the poor associating by an obscure instinct of consolation the ideas of evil and wealth will tell you that it is deadly because of its forbidden treasures the common folk of the neighbourhood peons of the estancias vaqueros of the seaboard plains tame indians coming miles to market with a bundle of sugarcane or a basket of maize worth about threepence are well aware that heaps of shining gold lie in the gloom of the deep precipices cleaving the stony levels of azuera tradition has it that many adventurers of olden time had perished in the search the story goes also that within mens memory two wandering sailorsamericanos perhaps but gringos of some sort for certaintalked over a gambling goodfornothing mozo and the three stole a donkey to carry for them a bundle of dry sticks a waterskin and provisions enough to last a few days thus accompanied and with revolvers at their belts they had started to chop their way with machetes through the thorny scrub on the neck of the peninsula  on the second evening an upright spiral of smoke it could only have been from their campfire was seen for the first time within memory of man standing up faintly upon the sky above a razorbacked ridge on the stony head the crew of a coasting schooner lying becalmed three miles off the shore stared at it with amazement till dark a negro fisherman living in a lonely hut in a little bay near by had seen the start and was on the lookout for some sign he called to his wife just as the sun was about to set they had watched the strange portent with envy incredulity and awe  the impious adventurers gave no other sign the sailors the indian and the stolen burro were never seen again as to the mozo a sulaco manhis wife paid for some masses and the poor fourfooted beast being without sin had been probably permitted to die but the two gringos spectral and alive are believed to be dwelling to this day amongst the rocks under the fatal spell of their success their souls cannot tear themselves away from their bodies mounting guard over the discovered treasure they are now rich and hungry and thirstya strange theory of tenacious gringo ghosts suffering in their starved and parched flesh of defiant heretics where a christian would have renounced and been released  these then are the legendary inhabitants of azuera guarding its forbidden wealth and the shadow on the sky on one side with the round patch of blue haze blurring the bright skirt of the horizon on the other mark the two outermost points of the bend which bears the name of golfo placido because never a strong wind had been known to blow upon its waters  on crossing the imaginary line drawn from punta mala to azuera the ships from europe bound to sulaco lose at once the strong breezes of the ocean they become the prey of capricious airs that play with them for thirty hours at a stretch sometimes before them the head of the calm gulf is filled on most days of the year by a great body of motionless and opaque clouds on the rare clear mornings another shadow is cast upon the sweep of the gulf the dawn breaks high behind the towering and serrated wall of the cordillera a clearcut vision of dark peaks rearing their steep slopes on a lofty pedestal of forest rising from the very edge of the shore amongst them the white head of higuerota rises majestically upon the blue bare clusters of enormous rocks sprinkle with tiny black dots the smooth dome of snow  then as the midday sun withdraws from the gulf the shadow of the mountains the clouds begin to roll out of the lower valleys they swathe in sombre tatters the naked crags of precipices above the wooded slopes hide the peaks smoke in stormy trails across the snows of higuerota the cordillera is gone from you as if it had dissolved itself into great piles of grey and black vapours that travel out slowly to seaward and vanish into thin air all along the front before the blazing heat of the day the wasting edge of the cloudbank always strives for but seldom wins the middle of the gulf the sunas the sailors sayis eating it up unless perchance a sombre thunderhead breaks away from the main body to career all over the gulf till it escapes into the offing beyond azuera where it bursts suddenly into flame and crashes like a sinster pirateship of the air hoveto above the horizon engaging the sea  at night the body of clouds advancing higher up the sky smothers the whole quiet gulf below with an impenetrable darkness in which the sound of the falling showers can be heard beginning and ceasing abruptlynow here now there indeed these cloudy nights are proverbial with the seamen along the whole west coast of a great continent sky land and sea disappear together out of the world when the placidoas the saying isgoes to sleep under its black poncho the few stars left below the seaward frown of the vault shine feebly as into the mouth of a black cavern in its vastness your ship floats unseen under your feet her sails flutter invisible above your head the eye of god himselfthey add with grim profanitycould not find out what work a mans hand is doing in there and you would be free to call the devil to your aid with impunity if even his malice were not defeated by such a blind darkness  the shores on the gulf are steepto all round three uninhabited islets basking in the sunshine just outside the cloud veil and opposite the entrance to the harbour of sulaco bear the name of the isabels  there is the great isabel the little isabel which is round and hermosa which is the smallest  that last is no more than a foot high and about seven paces across a mere flat top of a grey rock which smokes like a hot cinder after a shower and where no man would care to venture a naked sole before sunset on the little isabel an old ragged palm with a thick bulging trunk rough with spines a very witch amongst palm trees rustles a dismal bunch of dead leaves above the coarse sand the great isabel has a spring of fresh water issuing from the overgrown side of a ravine resembling an emerald green wedge of land a mile long and laid flat upon the sea it bears two forest trees standing close together with a wide spread of shade at the foot of their smooth trunks a ravine extending the whole length of the island is full of bushes and presenting a deep tangled cleft on the high side spreads itself out on the other into a shallow depression abutting on a small strip of sandy shore  from that low end of the great isabel the eye plunges through an opening two miles away as abrupt as if chopped with an axe out of the regular sweep of the coast right into the harbour of sulaco it is an oblong lakelike piece of water on one side the short wooded spurs and valleys of the cordillera come down at right angles to the very strand on the other the open view of the great sulaco plain passes into the opal mystery of great distances overhung by dry haze the town of sulaco itselftops of walls a great cupola gleams of white miradors in a vast grove of orange treeslies between the mountains and the plain at some little distance from its harbour and out of the direct line of sight from the sea    chapter two  the only sign of commercial activity within the harbour visible from the beach of the great isabel is the square blunt end of the wooden jetty which the oceanic steam navigation company the osn of familiar speech had thrown over the shallow part of the bay soon after they had resolved to make of sulaco one of their ports of call for the republic of costaguana the state possesses several harbours on its long seaboard but except cayta an important place all are either small and inconvenient inlets in an ironbound coastlike esmeralda for instance sixty miles to the southor else mere open roadsteads exposed to the winds and fretted by the surf  perhaps the very atmospheric conditions which had kept away the merchant fleets of bygone ages induced the osn company to violate the sanctuary of peace sheltering the calm existence of sulaco the variable airs sporting lightly with the vast semicircle of waters within the head of azuera could not baffle the steam power of their excellent fleet year after year the black hulls of their ships had gone up and down the coast in and out past azuera past the isabels past punta maladisregarding everything but the tyranny of time their names the names of all mythology became the household words of a coast that had never been ruled by the gods of olympus the juno was known only for her comfortable cabins amidships the saturn for the geniality of her captain and the painted and gilt luxuriousness of her saloon whereas the ganymede was fitted out mainly for cattle transport and to be avoided by coastwise passengers the humblest indian in the obscurest village on the coast was familiar with the cerberus a little black puffer without charm or living accommodation to speak of whose mission was to creep inshore along the wooded beaches close to mighty ugly rocks stopping obligingly before every cluster of huts to collect produce down to threepound parcels of indiarubber bound in a wrapper of dry grass  and as they seldom failed to account for the smallest package rarely lost a bullock and had never drowned a single passenger the name of the osn stood very high for trustworthiness people declared that under the companys care their lives and property were safer on the water than in their own houses on shore  the osns superintendent in sulaco for the whole costaguana section of the service was very proud of his companys standing he resumed it in a saying which was very often on his lips we never make mistakes to the companys officers it took the form of a severe injunction we must make no mistakes ill have no mistakes here no matter what smith may do at his end  smith on whom he had never set eyes in his life was the other superintendent of the service quartered some fifteen hundred miles away from sulaco dont talk to me of your smith  then calming down suddenly he would dismiss the subject with studied negligence  smith knows no more of this continent than a baby  our excellent senor mitchell for the business and official world of sulaco fussy joe for the commanders of the companys ships captain joseph mitchell prided himself on his profound knowledge of men and things in the countrycosas de costaguana amongst these last he accounted as most unfavourable to the orderly working of his company the frequent changes of government brought about by revolutions of the military type  the political atmosphere of the republic was generally stormy in these days the fugitive patriots of the defeated party had the knack of turning up again on the coast with half a steamers load of small arms and ammunition such resourcefulness captain mitchell considered as perfectly wonderful in view of their utter destitution at the time of flight he had observed that they never seemed to have enough change about them to pay for their passage ticket out of the country and he could speak with knowledge for on a memorable occasion he had been called upon to save the life of a dictator together with the lives of a few sulaco officialsthe political chief the director of the customs and the head of policebelonging to an overturned government poor senor ribiera such was the dictators name had come pelting eighty miles over mountain tracks after the lost battle of socorro in the hope of outdistancing the fatal newswhich of course he could not manage to do on a lame mule the animal moreover expired under him at the end of the alameda where the military band plays sometimes in the evenings between the revolutions sir captain mitchell would pursue with portentous gravity the illtimed end of that mule attracted attention to the unfortunate rider his features were recognized by several deserters from the dictatorial army amongst the rascally mob already engaged in smashing the windows of the intendencia  early on the morning of that day the local authorities of sulaco had fled for refuge to the osn companys offices a strong building near the shore end of the jetty leaving the town to the mercies of a revolutionary rabble and as the dictator was execrated by the populace on account of the severe recruitment law his necessities had compelled him to enforce during the struggle he stood a good chance of being torn to pieces providentially nostromoinvaluable fellowwith some italian workmen imported to work upon the national central railway was at hand and managed to snatch him awayfor the time at least ultimately captain mitchell succeeded in taking everybody off in his own gig to one of the companys steamersit was the minervajust then as luck would have it entering the harbour  he had to lower these gentlemen at the end of a rope out of a hole in the wall at the back while the mob which pouring out of the town had spread itself all along the shore howled and foamed at the foot of the building in front he had to hurry them then the whole length of the jetty it had been a desperate dash neck or nothingand again it was nostromo a fellow in a thousand who at the head this time of the companys body of lightermen held the jetty against the rushes of the rabble thus giving the fugitives time to reach the gig lying ready for them at the other end with the companys flag at the stern sticks stones shots flew knives too were thrown captain mitchell exhibited willingly the long cicatrice of a cut over his left ear and temple made by a razorblade fastened to a sticka weapon he explained very much in favour with the worst kind of nigger out here  captain mitchell was a thick elderly man wearing high pointed collars and short sidewhiskers partial to white waistcoats and really very communicative under his air of pompous reserve  these gentlemen he would say staring with great solemnity had to run like rabbits sir i ran like a rabbit myself certain forms of death areerdistasteful to aaerrespectable man they would have pounded me to death too a crazy mob sir does not discriminate under providence we owed our preservation to my capataz de cargadores as they called him in the town a man who when i discovered his value sir was just the bosn of an italian ship a big genoese ship one of the few european ships that ever came to sulaco with a general cargo before the building of the national central he left her on account of some very respectable friends he made here his own countrymen but also i suppose to better himself sir i am a pretty good judge of character i engaged him to be the foreman of our lightermen and caretaker of our jetty thats all that he was but without him senor ribiera would have been a dead man this nostromo sir a man absolutely above reproach became the terror of all the thieves in the town we were infested infested overrun sir here at that time by ladrones and matreros thieves and murderers from the whole province on this occasion they had been flocking into sulaco for a week past they had scented the end sir fifty per cent of that murdering mob were professional bandits from the campo sir but there wasnt one that hadnt heard of nostromo as to the town leperos sir the sight of his black whiskers and white teeth was enough for them they quailed before him sir thats what the force of character will do for you  it could very well be said that it was nostromo alone who saved the lives of these gentlemen captain mitchell on his part never left them till he had seen them collapse panting terrified and exasperated but safe on the luxuriant velvet sofas in the firstclass saloon of the minerva to the very last he had been careful to address the exdictator as your excellency  sir i could do no other the man was downghastly livid one mass of scratches  the minerva never let go her anchor that call the superintendent ordered her out of the harbour at once no cargo could be landed of course and the passengers for sulaco naturally refused to go ashore they could hear the firing and see plainly the fight going on at the edge of the water the repulsed mob devoted its energies to an attack upon the custom house a dreary unfinishedlooking structure with many windows two hundred yards away from the osn offices and the only other building near the harbour captain mitchell after directing the commander of the minerva to land these gentlemen in the first port of call outside costaguana went back in his gig to see what could be done for the protection of the companys property that and the property of the railway were preserved by the european residents that is by captain mitchell himself and the staff of engineers building the road aided by the italian and basque workmen who rallied faithfully round their english chiefs the companys lightermen too natives of the republic behaved very well under their capataz an outcast lot of very mixed blood mainly negroes everlastingly at feud with the other customers of low grog shops in the town they embraced with delight this opportunity to settle their personal scores under such favourable auspices there was not one of them that had not at some time or other looked with terror at nostromos revolver poked very close at his face or been otherwise daunted by nostromos resolution he was much of a man their capataz was they said too scornful in his temper ever to utter abuse a tireless taskmaster and the more to be feared because of his aloofness and behold there he was that day at their head condescending to make jocular remarks to this man or the other  such leadership was inspiriting and in truth all the harm the mob managed to achieve was to set fire to oneonly onestack of railwaysleepers which being creosoted burned well the main attack on the railway yards on the osn offices and especially on the custom house whose strong room it was well known contained a large treasure in silver ingots failed completely even the little hotel kept by old giorgio standing alone halfway between the harbour and the town escaped looting and destruction not by a miracle but because with the safes in view they had neglected it at first and afterwards found no leisure to stop nostromo with his cargadores was pressing them too hard then    chapter three  it might have been said that there he was only protecting his own from the first he had been admitted to live in the intimacy of the family of the hotelkeeper who was a countryman of his old giorgio viola a genoese with a shaggy white leonine headoften called simply the garibaldino as mohammedans are called after their prophetwas to use captain mitchells own words the respectable married friend by whose advice nostromo had left his ship to try for a run of shore luck in costaguana  the old man full of scorn for the populace as your austere republican so often is had disregarded the preliminary sounds of trouble he went on that day as usual pottering about the casa in his slippers muttering angrily to himself his contempt of the nonpolitical nature of the riot and shrugging his shoulders in the end he was taken unawares by the outrush of the rabble it was too late then to remove his family and indeed where could he have run to with the portly signora teresa and two little girls on that great plain so barricading every opening the old man sat down sternly in the middle of the darkened cafe with an old shotgun on his knees his wife sat on another chair by his side muttering pious invocations to all the saints of the calendar  the old republican did not believe in saints or in prayers or in what he called priests religion liberty and garibaldi were his divinities but he tolerated superstition in women preserving in these matters a lofty and silent attitude  his two girls the eldest fourteen and the other two years younger crouched on the sanded floor on each side of the signora teresa with their heads on their mothers lap both scared but each in her own way the darkhaired linda indignant and angry the fair giselle the younger bewildered and resigned the patrona removed her arms which embraced her daughters for a moment to cross herself and wring her hands hurriedly she moaned a little louder  oh gian battista why art thou not here oh why art thou not here  she was not then invoking the saint himself but calling upon nostromo whose patron he was and giorgio motionless on the chair by her side would be provoked by these reproachful and distracted appeals  peace woman wheres the sense of it theres his duty he murmured in the dark and she would retort panting  eh i have no patience duty what of the woman who has been like a mother to him i bent my knee to him this morning dont you go out gian battistastop in the house battistinolook at those two little innocent children  mrs viola was an italian too a native of spezzia and though considerably younger than her husband already middleaged she had a handsome face whose complexion had turned yellow because the climate of sulaco did not suit her at all her voice was a rich contralto when with her arms folded tight under her ample bosom she scolded the squat thicklegged china girls handling linen plucking fowls pounding corn in wooden mortars amongst the mud outbuildings at the back of the house she could bring out such an impassioned vibrating sepulchral note that the chained watchdog bolted into his kennel with a great rattle luis a cinnamoncoloured mulatto with a sprouting moustache and thick dark lips would stop sweeping the cafe with a broom of palmleaves to let a gentle shudder run down his spine his languishing almond eyes would remain closed for a long time  this was the staff of the casa viola but all these people had fled early that morning at the first sounds of the riot preferring to hide on the plain rather than trust themselves in the house a preference for which they were in no way to blame since whether true or not it was generally believed in the town that the garibaldino had some money buried under the clay floor of the kitchen the dog an irritable shaggy brute barked violently and whined plaintively in turns at the back running in and out of his kennel as rage or fear prompted him  bursts of great shouting rose and died away like wild gusts of wind on the plain round the barricaded house the fitful popping of shots grew louder above the yelling sometimes there were intervals of unaccountable stillness outside and nothing could have been more gaily peaceful than the narrow bright lines of sunlight from the cracks in the shutters ruled straight across the cafe over the disarranged chairs and tables to the wall opposite old giorgio had chosen that bare whitewashed room for a retreat it had only one window and its only door swung out upon the track of thick dust fenced by aloe hedges between the harbour and the town where clumsy carts used to creak along behind slow yokes of oxen guided by boys on horseback  in a pause of stillness giorgio cocked his gun the ominous sound wrung a low moan from the rigid figure of the woman sitting by his side a sudden outbreak of defiant yelling quite near the house sank all at once to a confused murmur of growls somebody ran along the loud catching of his breath was heard for an instant passing the door there were hoarse mutters and footsteps near the wall a shoulder rubbed against the shutter effacing the bright lines of sunshine pencilled across the whole breadth of the room signora teresas arms thrown about the kneeling forms of her daughters embraced them closer with a convulsive pressure  the mob driven away from the custom house had broken up into several bands retreating across the plain in the direction of the town the subdued crash of irregular volleys fired in the distance was answered by faint yells far away in the intervals the single shots rang feebly and the low long white building blinded in every window seemed to be the centre of a turmoil widening in a great circle about its closedup silence but the cautious movements and whispers of a routed party seeking a momentary shelter behind the wall made the darkness of the room striped by threads of quiet sunlight alight with evil stealthy sounds the violas had them in their ears as though invisible ghosts hovering about their chairs had consulted in mutters as to the advisability of setting fire to this foreigners casa  it was trying to the nerves old viola had risen slowly gun in hand irresolute for he did not see how he could prevent them already voices could be heard talking at the back signora teresa was beside herself with terror  ah the traitor the traitor she mumbled almost inaudibly now we are going to be burnt and i bent my knee to him no he must run at the heels of his english  she seemed to think that nostromos mere presence in the house would have made it perfectly safe so far she too was under the spell of that reputation the capataz de cargadores had made for himself by the waterside along the railway line with the english and with the populace of sulaco to his face and even against her husband she invariably affected to laugh it to scorn sometimes goodnaturedly more often with a curious bitterness but then women are unreasonable in their opinions as giorgio used to remark calmly on fitting occasions on this occasion with his gun held at ready before him he stooped down to his wifes head and keeping his eyes steadfastly on the barricaded door he breathed out into her ear that nostromo would have been powerless to help what could two men shut up in a house do against twenty or more bent upon setting fire to the roof gian battista was thinking of the casa all the time he was sure  he think of the casa he gasped signora viola crazily she struck her breast with her open hands i know him he thinks of nobody but himself  a discharge of firearms near by made her throw her head back and close her eyes old giorgio set his teeth hard under his white moustache and his eyes began to roll fiercely several bullets struck the end of the wall together pieces of plaster could be heard falling outside a voice screamed here they come and after a moment of uneasy silence there was a rush of running feet along the front  then the tension of old giorgios attitude relaxed and a smile of contemptuous relief came upon his lips of an old fighter with a leonine face these were not a people striving for justice but thieves even to defend his life against them was a sort of degradation for a man who had been one of garibaldis immortal thousand in the conquest of sicily he had an immense scorn for this outbreak of scoundrels and leperos who did not know the meaning of the word liberty  he grounded his old gun and turning his head glanced at the coloured lithograph of garibaldi in a black frame on the white wall a thread of strong sunshine cut it perpendicularly his eyes accustomed to the luminous twilight made out the high colouring of the face the red of the shirt the outlines of the square shoulders the black patch of the bersagliere hat with cocks feathers curling over the crown an immortal hero this was your liberty it gave you not only life but immortality as well  for that one man his fanaticism had suffered no diminution in the moment of relief from the apprehension of the greatest danger perhaps his family had been exposed to in all their wanderings he had turned to the picture of his old chief first and only then laid his hand on his wifes shoulder  the children kneeling on the floor had not moved signora teresa opened her eyes a little as though he had awakened her from a very deep and dreamless slumber before he had time in his deliberate way to say a reassuring word she jumped up with the children clinging to her one on each side gasped for breath and let out a hoarse shriek  it was simultaneous with the bang of a violent blow struck on the outside of the shutter they could hear suddenly the snorting of a horse the restive tramping of hoofs on the narrow hard path in front of the house the toe of a boot struck at the shutter again a spur jingled at every blow and an excited voice shouted hola hola in there    chapter four  all the morning nostromo had kept his eye from afar on the casa viola even in the thick of the hottest scrimmage near the custom house if i see smoke rising over there he thought to himself they are lost directly the mob had broken he pressed with a small band of italian workmen in that direction which indeed was the shortest line towards the town that part of the rabble he was pursuing seemed to think of making a stand under the house a volley fired by his followers from behind an aloe hedge made the rascals fly in a gap chopped out for the rails of the harbour branch line nostromo appeared mounted on his silvergrey mare he shouted sent after them one shot from his revolver and galloped up to the cafe window he had an idea that old giorgio would choose that part of the house for a refuge  his voice had penetrated to them sounding breathlessly hurried hola vecchio o vecchio is it all well with you in there  you see murmured old viola to his wife signora teresa was silent now outside nostromo laughed  i can hear the padrona is not dead  you have done your best to kill me with fear cried signora teresa she wanted to say something more but her voice failed her  linda raised her eyes to her face for a moment but old giorgio shouted apologetically  she is a little upset  outside nostromo shouted back with another laugh  she cannot upset me  signora teresa found her voice  it is what i say you have no heartand you have no conscience gian battista  they heard him wheel his horse away from the shutters the party he led were babbling excitedly in italian and spanish inciting each other to the pursuit he put himself at their head crying avanti  he has not stopped very long with us there is no praise from strangers to be got here signora teresa said tragically avanti yes that is all he cares for to be first somewheresomehowto be first with these english they will be showing him to everybody this is our nostromo she laughed ominously what a name what is that nostromo he would take a name that is properly no word from them  meantime giorgio with tranquil movements had been unfastening the door the flood of light fell on signora teresa with her two girls gathered to her side a picturesque woman in a pose of maternal exaltation behind her the wall was dazzlingly white and the crude colours of the garibaldi lithograph paled in the sunshine  old viola at the door moved his arm upwards as if referring all his quick fleeting thoughts to the picture of his old chief on the wall even when he was cooking for the signori inglesithe engineers he was a famous cook though the kitchen was a dark placehe was as it were under the eye of the great man who had led him in a glorious struggle where under the walls of gaeta tyranny would have expired for ever had it not been for that accursed piedmontese race of kings and ministers when sometimes a fryingpan caught fire during a delicate operation with some shredded onions and the old man was seen backing out of the doorway swearing and coughing violently in an acrid cloud of smoke the name of cavourthe arch intriguer sold to kings and tyrantscould be heard involved in imprecations against the china girls cooking in general and the brute of a country where he was reduced to live for the love of liberty that traitor had strangled  then signora teresa all in black issuing from another door advanced portly and anxious inclining her fine blackbrowed head opening her arms and crying in a profound tone  giorgio thou passionate man misericordia divina in the sun like this he will make himself ill  at her feet the hens made off in all directions with immense strides if there were any engineers from up the line staying in sulaco a young english face or two would appear at the billiardroom occupying one end of the house but at the other end in the cafe luis the mulatto took good care not to show himself the indian girls with hair like flowing black manes and dressed only in a shift and short petticoat stared dully from under the squarecut fringes on their foreheads the noisy frizzling of fat had stopped the fumes floated upwards in sunshine a strong smell of burnt onions hung in the drowsy heat enveloping the house and the eye lost itself in a vast flat expanse of grass to the west as if the plain between the sierra overtopping sulaco and the coast range away there towards esmeralda had been as big as half the world  signora teresa after an impressive pause remonstrated  eh giorgio leave cavour alone and take care of yourself now we are lost in this country all alone with the two children because you cannot live under a king  and while she looked at him she would sometimes put her hand hastily to her side with a short twitch of her fine lips and a knitting of her black straight eyebrows like a flicker of angry pain or an angry thought on her handsome regular features  it was pain she suppressed the twinge it had come to her first a few years after they had left italy to emigrate to america and settle at last in sulaco after wandering from town to town trying shopkeeping in a small way here and there and once an organized enterprise of fishingin maldonadofor giorgio like the great garibaldi had been a sailor in his time  sometimes she had no patience with pain for years its gnawing had been part of the landscape embracing the glitter of the harbour under the wooded spurs of the range and the sunshine itself was heavy and dullheavy with painnot like the sunshine of her girlhood in which middleaged giorgio had wooed her gravely and passionately on the shores of the gulf of spezzia  you go in at once giorgio she directed one would think you do not wish to have any pity on mewith four signori inglesi staying in the house va bene va bene giorgio would mutter he obeyed the signori inglesi would require their midday meal presently he had been one of the immortal and invincible band of liberators who had made the mercenaries of tyranny fly like chaff before a hurricane un uragano terribile but that was before he was married and had children and before tyranny had reared its head again amongst the traitors who had imprisoned garibaldi his hero  there were three doors in the front of the house and each afternoon the garibaldino could be seen at one or another of them with his big bush of white hair his arms folded his legs crossed leaning back his leonine head against the side and looking up the wooded slopes of the foothills at the snowy dome of higuerota the front of his house threw off a black long rectangle of shade broadening slowly over the soft oxcart track through the gaps chopped out in the oleander hedges the harbour branch railway laid out temporarily on the level of the plain curved away its shining parallel ribbons on a belt of scorched and withered grass within sixty yards of the end of the house in the evening the empty material trains of flat cars circled round the dark green grove of sulaco and ran undulating slightly with white jets of steam over the plain towards the casa viola on their way to the railway yards by the harbour the italian drivers saluted him from the footplate with raised hand while the negro brakesmen sat carelessly on the brakes looking straight forward with the rims of their big hats flapping in the wind in return giorgio would give a slight sideways jerk of the head without unfolding his arms  on this memorable day of the riot his arms were not folded on his chest his hand grasped the barrel of the gun grounded on the threshold he did not look up once at the white dome of higuerota whose cool purity seemed to hold itself aloof from a hot earth his eyes examined the plain curiously tall trails of dust subsided here and there in a speckless sky the sun hung clear and blinding knots of men ran headlong others made a stand and the irregular rattle of firearms came rippling to his ears in the fiery still air single figures on foot raced desperately horsemen galloped towards each other wheeled round together separated at speed giorgio saw one fall rider and horse disappearing as if they had galloped into a chasm and the movements of the animated scene were like the passages of a violent game played upon the plain by dwarfs mounted and on foot yelling with tiny throats under the mountain that seemed a colossal embodiment of silence never before had giorgio seen this bit of plain so full of active life his gaze could not take in all its details at once he shaded his eyes with his hand till suddenly the thundering of many hoofs near by startled him  a troop of horses had broken out of the fenced paddock of the railway company they came on like a whirlwind and dashed over the line snorting kicking squealing in a compact piebald tossing mob of bay brown grey backs eyes staring necks extended nostrils red long tails streaming as soon as they had leaped upon the road the thick dust flew upwards from under their hoofs and within six yards of giorgio only a brown cloud with vague forms of necks and cruppers rolled by making the soil tremble on its passage  viola coughed turning his face away from the dust and shaking his head slightly  there will be some horsecatching to be done before tonight he muttered  in the square of sunlight falling through the door signora teresa kneeling before the chair had bowed her head heavy with a twisted mass of ebony hair streaked with silver into the palm of her hands the black lace shawl she used to drape about her face had dropped to the ground by her side the two girls had got up handinhand in short skirts their loose hair falling in disorder the younger had thrown her arm across her eyes as if afraid to face the light linda with her hand on the others shoulder stared fearlessly viola looked at his children the sun brought out the deep lines on his face and energetic in expression it had the immobility of a carving it was impossible to discover what he thought bushy grey eyebrows shaded his dark glance  well and do you not pray like your mother  linda pouted advancing her red lips which were almost too red but she had admirable eyes brown with a sparkle of gold in the irises full of intelligence and meaning and so clear that they seemed to throw a glow upon her thin colourless face there were bronze glints in the sombre clusters of her hair and the eyelashes long and coal black made her complexion appear still more pale  mother is going to offer up a lot of candles in the church she always does when nostromo has been away fighting i shall have some to carry up to the chapel of the madonna in the cathedral  she said all this quickly with great assurance in an animated penetrating voice then giving her sisters shoulder a slight shake she added  and she will be made to carry one too  why made inquired giorgio gravely does she not want to  she is timid said linda with a little burst of laughter people notice her fair hair as she goes along with us they call out after her look at the rubia look at the rubiacita they call out in the streets she is timid  and you you are not timideh the father pronounced slowly  she tossed back all her dark hair  nobody calls out after me  old giorgio contemplated his children thoughtfully there was two years difference between them they had been born to him late years after the boy had died had he lived he would have been nearly as old as gian battistahe whom the english called nostromo but as to his daughters the severity of his temper his advancing age his absorption in his memories had prevented his taking much notice of them he loved his children but girls belong more to the mother and much of his affection had been expended in the worship and service of liberty  when quite a youth he had deserted from a ship trading to la plata to enlist in the navy of montevideo then under the command of garibaldi afterwards in the italian legion of the republic struggling against the encroaching tyranny of rosas he had taken part on great plains on the banks of immense rivers in the fiercest fighting perhaps the world had ever known he had lived amongst men who had declaimed about liberty suffered for liberty died for liberty with a desperate exaltation and with their eyes turned towards an oppressed italy his own enthusiasm had been fed on scenes of carnage on the examples of lofty devotion on the din of armed struggle on the inflamed language of proclamations he had never parted from the chief of his choicethe fiery apostle of independencekeeping by his side in america and in italy till after the fatal day of aspromonte when the treachery of kings emperors and ministers had been revealed to the world in the wounding and imprisonment of his heroa catastrophe that had instilled into him a gloomy doubt of ever being able to understand the ways of divine justice  he did not deny it however it required patience he would say though he disliked priests and would not put his foot inside a church for anything he believed in god were not the proclamations against tyrants addressed to the peoples in the name of god and liberty god for menreligions for women he muttered sometimes in sicily an englishman who had turned up in palermo after its evacuation by the army of the king had given him a bible in italianthe publication of the british and foreign bible society bound in a dark leather cover in periods of political adversity in the pauses of silence when the revolutionists issued no proclamations giorgio earned his living with the first work that came to handas sailor as dock labourer on the quays of genoa once as a hand on a farm in the hills above spezziaand in his spare time he studied the thick volume he carried it with him into battles now it was his only reading and in order not to be deprived of it the print was small he had consented to accept the present of a pair of silvermounted spectacles from senora emilia gould the wife of the englishman who managed the silver mine in the mountains three leagues from the town she was the only englishwoman in sulaco  giorgio viola had a great consideration for the english this feeling born on the battlefields of uruguay was forty years old at the very least several of them had poured their blood for the cause of freedom in america and the first he had ever known he remembered by the name of samuel he commanded a negro company under garibaldi during the famous siege of montevideo and died heroically with his negroes at the fording of the boyana he giorgio had reached the rank of ensignalferezand cooked for the general later in italy he with the rank of lieutenant rode with the staff and still cooked for the general he had cooked for him in lombardy through the whole campaign on the march to rome he had lassoed his beef in the campagna after the american manner he had been wounded in the defence of the roman republic he was one of the four fugitives who with the general carried out of the woods the inanimate body of the generals wife into the farmhouse where she died exhausted by the hardships of that terrible retreat he had survived that disastrous time to attend his general in palermo when the neapolitan shells from the castle crashed upon the town he had cooked for him on the field of volturno after fighting all day and everywhere he had seen englishmen in the front rank of the army of freedom he respected their nation because they loved garibaldi their very countesses and princesses had kissed the generals hands in london it was said he could well believe it for the nation was noble and the man was a saint it was enough to look once at his face to see the divine force of faith in him and his great pity for all that was poor suffering and oppressed in this world  the spirit of selfforgetfulness the simple devotion to a vast humanitarian idea which inspired the thought and stress of that revolutionary time had left its mark upon giorgio in a sort of austere contempt for all personal advantage this man whom the lowest class in sulaco suspected of having a buried hoard in his kitchen had all his life despised money the leaders of his youth had lived poor had died poor it had been a habit of his mind to disregard tomorrow it was engendered partly by an existence of excitement adventure and wild warfare but mostly it was a matter of principle it did not resemble the carelessness of a condottiere it was a puritanism of conduct born of stern enthusiasm like the puritanism of religion  this stern devotion to a cause had cast a gloom upon giorgios old age it cast a gloom because the cause seemed lost too many kings and emperors flourished yet in the world which god had meant for the people he was sad because of his simplicity though always ready to help his countrymen and greatly respected by the italian emigrants wherever he lived in his exile he called it he could not conceal from himself that they cared nothing for the wrongs of downtrodden nations they listened to his tales of war readily but seemed to ask themselves what he had got out of it after all there was nothing that they could see we wanted nothing we suffered for the love of all humanity he cried out furiously sometimes and the powerful voice the blazing eyes the shaking of the white mane the brown sinewy hand pointing upwards as if to call heaven to witness impressed his hearers after the old man had broken off abruptly with a jerk of the head and a movement of the arm meaning clearly but whats the good of talking to you they nudged each other there was in old giorgio an energy of feeling a personal quality of conviction something they called terribilitaan old lion they used to say of him some slight incident a chance word would set him off talking on the beach to the italian fishermen of maldonado in the little shop he kept afterwards in valparaiso to his countrymen customers of an evening suddenly in the cafe at one end of the casa viola the other was reserved for the english engineers to the select clientele of enginedrivers and foremen of the railway shops  with their handsome bronzed lean faces shiny black ringlets glistening eyes broadchested bearded sometimes a tiny gold ring in the lobe of the ear the aristocracy of the railway works listened to him turning away from their cards or dominoes here and there a fairhaired basque studied his hand meantime waiting without protest no native of costaguana intruded there this was the italian stronghold even the sulaco policemen on a night patrol let their horses pace softly by bending low in the saddle to glance through the window at the heads in a fog of smoke and the drone of old giorgios declamatory narrative seemed to sink behind them into the plain only now and then the assistant of the chief of police some broadfaced brown little gentleman with a great deal of indian in him would put in an appearance leaving his man outside with the horses he advanced with a confident sly smile and without a word up to the long trestle table he pointed to one of the bottles on the shelf giorgio thrusting his pipe into his mouth abruptly served him in person nothing would be heard but the slight jingle of the spurs his glass emptied he would take a leisurely scrutinizing look all round the room go out and ride away slowly circling towards the town    chapter five  in this way only was the power of the local authorities vindicated amongst the great body of stronglimbed foreigners who dug the earth blasted the rocks drove the engines for the progressive and patriotic undertaking in these very words eighteen months before the excellentissimo senor don vincente ribiera the dictator of costaguana had described the national central railway in his great speech at the turning of the first sod  he had come on purpose to sulaco and there was a oneoclock dinnerparty a convite offered by the osn company on board the juno after the function on shore captain mitchell had himself steered the cargo lighter all draped with flags which in tow of the junos steam launch took the excellentissimo from the jetty to the ship everybody of note in sulaco had been invitedthe one or two foreign merchants all the representatives of the old spanish families then in town the great owners of estates on the plain grave courteous simple men caballeros of pure descent with small hands and feet conservative hospitable and kind the occidental province was their stronghold their blanco party had triumphed now it was their presidentdictator a blanco of the blancos who sat smiling urbanely between the representatives of two friendly foreign powers they had come with him from sta marta to countenance by their presence the enterprise in which the capital of their countries was engaged the only lady of that company was mrs gould the wife of don carlos the administrator of the san tome silver mine the ladies of sulaco were not advanced enough to take part in the public life to that extent they had come out strongly at the great ball at the intendencia the evening before but mrs gould alone had appeared a bright spot in the group of black coats behind the presidentdictator on the crimson clothcovered stage erected under a shady tree on the shore of the harbour where the ceremony of turning the first sod had taken place she had come off in the cargo lighter full of notabilities sitting under the flutter of gay flags in the place of honour by the side of captain mitchell who steered and her clear dress gave the only truly festive note to the sombre gathering in the long gorgeous saloon of the juno  the head of the chairman of the railway board from london handsome and pale in a silvery mist of white hair and clipped beard hovered near her shoulder attentive smiling and fatigued the journey from london to sta marta in mail boats and the special carriages of the sta marta coastline the only railway so far had been tolerableeven pleasantquite tolerable but the trip over the mountains to sulaco was another sort of experience in an old diligencia over impassable roads skirting awful precipices  we have been upset twice in one day on the brink of very deep ravines he was telling mrs gould in an undertone and when we arrived here at last i dont know what we should have done without your hospitality what an outoftheway place sulaco isand for a harbour too astonishing  ah but we are very proud of it it used to be historically important the highest ecclesiastical court for two viceroyalties sat here in the olden time she instructed him with animation  i am impressed i didnt mean to be disparaging you seem very patriotic  the place is lovable if only by its situation perhaps you dont know what an old resident i am  how old i wonder he murmured looking at her with a slight smile mrs goulds appearance was made youthful by the mobile intelligence of her face we cant give you your ecclesiastical court back again but you shall have more steamers a railway a telegraphcablea future in the great world which is worth infinitely more than any amount of ecclesiastical past you shall be brought in touch with something greater than two viceroyalties but i had no notion that a place on a seacoast could remain so isolated from the world if it had been a thousand miles inland nowmost remarkable has anything ever happened here for a hundred years before today  while he talked in a slow humorous tone she kept her little smile agreeing ironically she assured him that certainly notnothing ever happened in sulaco even the revolutions of which there had been two in her time had respected the repose of the place their course ran in the more populous southern parts of the republic and the great valley of sta marta which was like one great battlefield of the parties with the possession of the capital for a prize and an outlet to another ocean they were more advanced over there here in sulaco they heard only the echoes of these great questions and of course their official world changed each time coming to them over their rampart of mountains which he himself had traversed in an old diligencia with such a risk to life and limb  the chairman of the railway had been enjoying her hospitality for several days and he was really grateful for it it was only since he had left sta marta that he had utterly lost touch with the feeling of european life on the background of his exotic surroundings in the capital he had been the guest of the legation and had been kept busy negotiating with the members of don vincentes governmentcultured men men to whom the conditions of civilized business were not unknown  what concerned him most at the time was the acquisition of land for the railway in the sta marta valley where there was already one line in existence the people were tractable and it was only a matter of price a commission had been nominated to fix the values and the difficulty resolved itself into the judicious influencing of the commissioners but in sulacothe occidental province for whose very development the railway was intendedthere had been trouble it had been lying for ages ensconced behind its natural barriers repelling modern enterprise by the precipices of its mountain range by its shallow harbour opening into the everlasting calms of a gulf full of clouds by the benighted state of mind of the owners of its fertile territoryall these aristocratic old spanish families all those don ambrosios this and don fernandos that who seemed actually to dislike and distrust the coming of the railway over their lands it had happened that some of the surveying parties scattered all over the province had been warned off with threats of violence in other cases outrageous pretensions as to price had been raised but the man of railways prided himself on being equal to every emergency since he was met by the inimical sentiment of blind conservatism in sulaco he would meet it by sentiment too before taking his stand on his right alone the government was bound to carry out its part of the contract with the board of the new railway company even if it had to use force for the purpose but he desired nothing less than an armed disturbance in the smooth working of his plans they were much too vast and farreaching and too promising to leave a stone unturned and so he imagined to get the presidentdictator over there on a tour of ceremonies and speeches culminating in a great function at the turning of the first sod by the harbour shore after all he was their own creaturethat don vincente he was the embodied triumph of the best elements in the state these were facts and unless facts meant nothing sir john argued to himself such a mans influence must be real and his personal action would produce the conciliatory effect he required he had succeeded in arranging the trip with the help of a very clever advocate who was known in sta marta as the agent of the gould silver mine the biggest thing in sulaco and even in the whole republic it was indeed a fabulously rich mine its socalled agent evidently a man of culture and ability seemed without official position to possess an extraordinary influence in the highest government spheres he was able to assure sir john that the presidentdictator would make the journey he regretted however in the course of the same conversation that general montero insisted upon going too  general montero whom the beginning of the struggle had found an obscure army captain employed on the wild eastern frontier of the state had thrown in his lot with the ribiera party at a moment when special circumstances had given that small adhesion a fortuitous importance the fortunes of war served him marvellously and the victory of rio seco after a day of desperate fighting put a seal to his success at the end he emerged general minister of war and the military head of the blanco party although there was nothing aristocratic in his descent indeed it was said that he and his brother orphans had been brought up by the munificence of a famous european traveller in whose service their father had lost his life another story was that their father had been nothing but a charcoal burner in the woods and their mother a baptised indian woman from the far interior  however that might be the costaguana press was in the habit of styling monteros forest march from his commandancia to join the blanco forces at the beginning of the troubles the most heroic military exploit of modern times about the same time too his brother had turned up from europe where he had gone apparently as secretary to a consul having however collected a small band of outlaws he showed some talent as guerilla chief and had been rewarded at the pacification by the post of military commandant of the capital  the minister of war then accompanied the dictator the board of the osn company working handinhand with the railway people for the good of the republic had on this important occasion instructed captain mitchell to put the mailboat juno at the disposal of the distinguished party don vincente journeying south from sta marta had embarked at cayta the principal port of costaguana and came to sulaco by sea but the chairman of the railway company had courageously crossed the mountains in a ramshackle diligencia mainly for the purpose of meeting his engineerinchief engaged in the final survey of the road  for all the indifference of a man of affairs to nature whose hostility can always be overcome by the resources of finance he could not help being impressed by his surroundings during his halt at the surveying camp established at the highest point his railway was to reach he spent the night there arriving just too late to see the last dying glow of sunlight upon the snowy flank of higuerota pillared masses of black basalt framed like an open portal a portion of the white field lying aslant against the west in the transparent air of the high altitudes everything seemed very near steeped in a clear stillness as in an imponderable liquid and with his ear ready to catch the first sound of the expected diligencia the engineerinchief at the door of a hut of rough stones had contemplated the changing hues on the enormous side of the mountain thinking that in this sight as in a piece of inspired music there could be found together the utmost delicacy of shaded expression and a stupendous magnificence of effect  sir john arrived too late to hear the magnificent and inaudible strain sung by the sunset amongst the high peaks of the sierra it had sung itself out into the breathless pause of deep dusk before climbing down the fore wheel of the diligencia with stiff limbs he shook hands with the engineer  they gave him his dinner in a stone hut like a cubical boulder with no door or windows in its two openings a bright fire of sticks brought on muleback from the first valley below burning outside sent in a wavering glare and two candles in tin candlestickslighted it was explained to him in his honourstood on a sort of rough camp table at which he sat on the right hand of the chief he knew how to be amiable and the young men of the engineering staff for whom the surveying of the railway track had the glamour of the first steps on the path of life sat there too listening modestly with their smooth faces tanned by the weather and very pleased to witness so much affability in so great a man  afterwards late at night pacing to and fro outside he had a long talk with his chief engineer he knew him well of old this was not the first undertaking in which their gifts as elementally different as fire and water had worked in conjunction from the contact of these two personalities who had not the same vision of the world there was generated a power for the worlds servicea subtle force that could set in motion mighty machines mens muscles and awaken also in human breasts an unbounded devotion to the task of the young fellows at the table to whom the survey of the track was like the tracing of the path of life more than one would be called to meet death before the work was done but the work would be done the force would be almost as strong as a faith not quite however in the silence of the sleeping camp upon the moonlit plateau forming the top of the pass like the floor of a vast arena surrounded by the basalt walls of precipices two strolling figures in thick ulsters stood still and the voice of the engineer pronounced distinctly the words  we cant move mountains  sir john raising his head to follow the pointing gesture felt the full force of the words the white higuerota soared out of the shadows of rock and earth like a frozen bubble under the moon all was still till near by behind the wall of a corral for the camp animals built roughly of loose stones in the form of a circle a pack mule stamped his forefoot and blew heavily twice  the engineerinchief had used the phrase in answer to the chairmans tentative suggestion that the tracing of the line could perhaps be altered in deference to the prejudices of the sulaco landowners the chief engineer believed that the obstinacy of men was the lesser obstacle moreover to combat that they had the great influence of charles gould whereas tunnelling under higuerota would have been a colossal undertaking  ah yes gould what sort of a man is he  sir john had heard much of charles gould in sta marta and wanted to know more the engineerinchief assured him that the administrator of the san tome silver mine had an immense influence over all these spanish dons he had also one of the best houses in sulaco and the gould hospitality was beyond all praise  they received me as if they had known me for years he said the little lady is kindness personified i stayed with them for a month he helped me to organize the surveying parties his practical ownership of the san tome silver mine gives him a special position he seems to have the ear of every provincial authority apparently and as i said he can wind all the hidalgos of the province round his little finger if you follow his advice the difficulties will fall away because he wants the railway of course you must be careful in what you say hes english and besides he must be immensely wealthy the holroyd house is in with him in that mine so you may imagine  he interrupted himself as from before one of the little fires burning outside the low wall of the corral arose the figure of a man wrapped in a poncho up to the neck the saddle which he had been using for a pillow made a dark patch on the ground against the red glow of embers  i shall see holroyd himself on my way back through the states said sir john ive ascertained that he too wants the railway  the man who perhaps disturbed by the proximity of the voices had arisen from the ground struck a match to light a cigarette the flame showed a bronzed blackwhiskered face a pair of eyes gazing straight then rearranging his wrappings he sank full length and laid his head again on the saddle  thats our campmaster whom i must send back to sulaco now we are going to carry our survey into the sta marta valley said the engineer a most useful fellow lent me by captain mitchell of the osn company it was very good of mitchell charles gould told me i couldnt do better than take advantage of the offer he seems to know how to rule all these muleteers and peons we had not the slightest trouble with our people he shall escort your diligencia right into sulaco with some of our railway peons the road is bad to have him at hand may save you an upset or two he promised me to take care of your person all the way down as if you were his father  this campmaster was the italian sailor whom all the europeans in sulaco following captain mitchells mispronunciation were in the habit of calling nostromo and indeed taciturn and ready he did take excellent care of his charge at the bad parts of the road as sir john himself acknowledged to mrs gould afterwards    chapter six  at that time nostromo had been already long enough in the country to raise to the highest pitch captain mitchells opinion of the extraordinary value of his discovery clearly he was one of those invaluable subordinates whom to possess is a legitimate cause of boasting captain mitchell plumed himself upon his eye for menbut he was not selfishand in the innocence of his pride was already developing that mania for lending you my capataz de cargadores which was to bring nostromo into personal contact sooner or later with every european in sulaco as a sort of universal factotuma prodigy of efficiency in his own sphere of life  the fellow is devoted to me body and soul captain mitchell was given to affirm and though nobody perhaps could have explained why it should be so it was impossible on a survey of their relation to throw doubt on that statement unless indeed one were a bitter eccentric character like dr monyghamfor instancewhose short hopeless laugh expressed somehow an immense mistrust of mankind not that dr monygham was a prodigal either of laughter or of words he was bitterly taciturn when at his best at his worst people feared the open scornfulness of his tongue only mrs gould could keep his unbelief in mens motives within due bounds but even to her on an occasion not connected with nostromo and in a tone which for him was gentle even to her he had said once really it is most unreasonable to demand that a man should think of other people so much better than he is able to think of himself  and mrs gould had hastened to drop the subject there were strange rumours of the english doctor years ago in the time of guzman bento he had been mixed up it was whispered in a conspiracy which was betrayed and as people expressed it drowned in blood his hair had turned grey his hairless seamed face was of a brickdust colour the large check pattern of his flannel shirt and his old stained panama hat were an established defiance to the conventionalities of sulaco had it not been for the immaculate cleanliness of his apparel he might have been taken for one of those shiftless europeans that are a moral eyesore to the respectability of a foreign colony in almost every exotic part of the world the young ladies of sulaco adorning with clusters of pretty faces the balconies along the street of the constitution when they saw him pass with his limping gait and bowed head a short linen jacket drawn on carelessly over the flannel check shirt would remark to each other here is the senor doctor going to call on dona emilia he has got his little coat on the inference was true its deeper meaning was hidden from their simple intelligence moreover they expended no store of thought on the doctor he was old ugly learnedand a little locomad if not a bit of a sorcerer as the common people suspected him of being the little white jacket was in reality a concession to mrs goulds humanizing influence the doctor with his habit of sceptical bitter speech had no other means of showing his profound respect for the character of the woman who was known in the country as the english senora he presented this tribute very seriously indeed it was no trifle for a man of his habits mrs gould felt that too perfectly she would never have thought of imposing upon him this marked show of deference  she kept her old spanish house one of the finest specimens in sulaco open for the dispensation of the small graces of existence she dispensed them with simplicity and charm because she was guided by an alert perception of values she was highly gifted in the art of human intercourse which consists in delicate shades of selfforgetfulness and in the suggestion of universal comprehension charles gould the gould family established in costaguana for three generations always went to england for their education and for their wives imagined that he had fallen in love with a girls sound common sense like any other man but these were not exactly the reasons why for instance the whole surveying camp from the youngest of the young men to their mature chief should have found occasion to allude to mrs goulds house so frequently amongst the high peaks of the sierra she would have protested that she had done nothing for them with a low laugh and a surprised widening of her grey eyes had anybody told her how convincingly she was remembered on the edge of the snowline above sulaco but directly with a little capable air of setting her wits to work she would have found an explanation of course it was such a surprise for these boys to find any sort of welcome here and i suppose they are homesick i suppose everybody must be always just a little homesick  she was always sorry for homesick people  born in the country as his father before him spare and tall with a flaming moustache a neat chin clear blue eyes auburn hair and a thin fresh red face charles gould looked like a new arrival from over the sea his grandfather had fought in the cause of independence under bolivar in that famous english legion which on the battlefield of carabobo had been saluted by the great liberator as saviours of his country one of charles goulds uncles had been the elected president of that very province of sulaco then called a state in the days of federation and afterwards had been put up against the wall of a church and shot by the order of the barbarous unionist general guzman bento it was the same guzman bento who becoming later perpetual president famed for his ruthless and cruel tyranny readied his apotheosis in the popular legend of a sanguinary landhaunting spectre whose body had been carried off by the devil in person from the brick mausoleum in the nave of the church of assumption in sta marta thus at least the priests explained its disappearance to the barefooted multitude that streamed in awestruck to gaze at the hole in the side of the ugly box of bricks before the great altar  guzman bento of cruel memory had put to death great numbers of people besides charles goulds uncle but with a relative martyred in the cause of aristocracy the sulaco oligarchs this was the phraseology of guzman bentos time now they were called blancos and had given up the federal idea which meant the families of pure spanish descent considered charles as one of themselves with such a family record no one could be more of a costaguanero than don carlos gould but his aspect was so characteristic that in the talk of common people he was just the inglezthe englishman of sulaco he looked more english than a casual tourist a sort of heretic pilgrim however quite unknown in sulaco he looked more english than the last arrived batch of young railway engineers than anybody out of the huntingfield pictures in the numbers of punch reaching his wifes drawingroom two months or so after date it astonished you to hear him talk spanish castillan as the natives say or the indian dialect of the countrypeople so naturally his accent had never been english but there was something so indelible in all these ancestral gouldsliberators explorers coffee planters merchants revolutionistsof costaguana that he the only representative of the third generation in a continent possessing its own style of horsemanship went on looking thoroughly english even on horseback this is not said of him in the mocking spirit of the llanerosmen of the great plainswho think that no one in the world knows how to sit a horse but themselves charles gould to use the suitably lofty phrase rode like a centaur riding for him was not a special form of exercise it was a natural faculty as walking straight is to all men sound of mind and limb but all the same when cantering beside the rutty oxcart track to the mine he looked in his english clothes and with his imported saddlery as though he had come this moment to costaguana at his easy swift pasotrote straight out of some green meadow at the other side of the world  his way would lie along the old spanish roadthe camino real of popular speechthe only remaining vestige of a fact and name left by that royalty old giorgio viola hated and whose very shadow had departed from the land for the big equestrian statue of charles iv at the entrance of the alameda towering white against the trees was only known to the folk from the country and to the beggars of the town that slept on the steps around the pedestal as the horse of stone the other carlos turning off to the left with a rapid clatter of hoofs on the disjointed pavementdon carlos gould in his english clothes looked as incongruous but much more at home than the kingly cavalier reining in his steed on the pedestal above the sleeping leperos with his marble arm raised towards the marble rim of a plumed hat  the weatherstained effigy of the mounted king with its vague suggestion of a saluting gesture seemed to present an inscrutable breast to the political changes which had robbed it of its very name but neither did the other horseman well known to the people keen and alive on his wellshaped slatecoloured beast with a white eye wear his heart on the sleeve of his english coat his mind preserved its steady poise as if sheltered in the passionless stability of private and public decencies at home in europe he accepted with a like calm the shocking manner in which the sulaco ladies smothered their faces with pearl powder till they looked like white plaster casts with beautiful living eyes the peculiar gossip of the town and the continuous political changes the constant saving of the country which to his wife seemed a puerile and bloodthirsty game of murder and rapine played with terrible earnestness by depraved children in the early days of her costaguana life the little lady used to clench her hands with exasperation at not being able to take the public affairs of the country as seriously as the incidental atrocity of methods deserved she saw in them a comedy of naive pretences but hardly anything genuine except her own appalled indignation charles very quiet and twisting his long moustaches would decline to discuss them at all once however he observed to her gently  my dear you seem to forget that i was born here these few words made her pause as if they had been a sudden revelation perhaps the mere fact of being born in the country did make a difference she had a great confidence in her husband it had always been very great he had struck her imagination from the first by his unsentimentalism by that very quietude of mind which she had erected in her thought for a sign of perfect competency in the business of living don jose avellanos their neighbour across the street a statesman a poet a man of culture who had represented his country at several european courts and had suffered untold indignities as a state prisoner in the time of the tyrant guzman bento used to declare in dona emilias drawingroom that carlos had all the english qualities of character with a truly patriotic heart  mrs gould raising her eyes to her husbands thin red and tan face could not detect the slightest quiver of a feature at what he must have heard said of his patriotism perhaps he had just dismounted on his return from the mine he was english enough to disregard the hottest hours of the day basilio in a livery of white linen and a red sash had squatted for a moment behind his heels to unstrap the heavy blunt spurs in the patio and then the senor administrator would go up the staircase into the gallery rows of plants in pots ranged on the balustrade between the pilasters of the arches screened the corredor with their leaves and flowers from the quadrangle below whose paved space is the true hearthstone of a south american house where the quiet hours of domestic life are marked by the shifting of light and shadow on the flagstones  senor avellanos was in the habit of crossing the patio at five oclock almost every day don jose chose to come over at teatime because the english rite at dona emilias house reminded him of the time he lived in london as minister plenipotentiary to the court of st james he did not like tea and usually rocking his american chair his neat little shiny boots crossed on the footrest he would talk on and on with a sort of complacent virtuosity wonderful in a man of his age while he held the cup in his hands for a long time his closecropped head was perfectly white his eyes coalblack  on seeing charles gould step into the sala he would nod provisionally and go on to the end of the oratorial period only then he would say  carlos my friend you have ridden from san tome in the heat of the day always the true english activity no what  he drank up all the tea at once in one draught this performance was invariably followed by a slight shudder and a low involuntary brrrr which was not covered by the hasty exclamation excellent  then giving up the empty cup into his young friends hand extended with a smile he continued to expatiate upon the patriotic nature of the san tome mine for the simple pleasure of talking fluently it seemed while his reclining body jerked backwards and forwards in a rockingchair of the sort exported from the united states the ceiling of the largest drawingroom of the casa gould extended its white level far above his head the loftiness dwarfed the mixture of heavy straightbacked spanish chairs of brown wood with leathern seats and european furniture low and cushioned all over like squat little monsters gorged to bursting with steel springs and horsehair there were knickknacks on little tables mirrors let into the wall above marble consoles square spaces of carpet under the two groups of armchairs each presided over by a deep sofa smaller rugs scattered all over the floor of red tiles three windows from the ceiling down to the ground opening on a balcony and flanked by the perpendicular folds of the dark hangings the stateliness of ancient days lingered between the four high smooth walls tinted a delicate primrosecolour and mrs gould with her little head and shining coils of hair sitting in a cloud of muslin and lace before a slender mahogany table resembled a fairy posed lightly before dainty philtres dispensed out of vessels of silver and porcelain  mrs gould knew the history of the san tome mine worked in the early days mostly by means of lashes on the backs of slaves its yield had been paid for in its own weight of human bones whole tribes of indians had perished in the exploitation and then the mine was abandoned since with this primitive method it had ceased to make a profitable return no matter how many corpses were thrown into its maw then it became forgotten it was rediscovered after the war of independence an english company obtained the right to work it and found so rich a vein that neither the exactions of successive governments nor the periodical raids of recruiting officers upon the population of paid miners they had created could discourage their perseverance but in the end during the long turmoil of pronunciamentos that followed the death of the famous guzman bento the native miners incited to revolt by the emissaries sent out from the capital had risen upon their english chiefs and murdered them to a man the decree of confiscation which appeared immediately afterwards in the diario official published in sta marta began with the words justly incensed at the grinding oppression of foreigners actuated by sordid motives of gain rather than by love for a country where they come impoverished to seek their fortunes the mining population of san tome etc    and ended with the declaration the chief of the state has resolved to exercise to the full his power of clemency the mine which by every law international human and divine reverts now to the government as national property shall remain closed till the sword drawn for the sacred defence of liberal principles has accomplished its mission of securing the happiness of our beloved country  and for many years this was the last of the san tome mine what advantage that government had expected from the spoliation it is impossible to tell now costaguana was made with difficulty to pay a beggarly money compensation to the families of the victims and then the matter dropped out of diplomatic despatches but afterwards another government bethought itself of that valuable asset it was an ordinary costaguana governmentthe fourth in six yearsbut it judged of its opportunities sanely it remembered the san tome mine with a secret conviction of its worthlessness in their own hands but with an ingenious insight into the various uses a silver mine can be put to apart from the sordid process of extracting the metal from under the ground the father of charles gould for a long time one of the most wealthy merchants of costaguana had already lost a considerable part of his fortune in forced loans to the successive governments he was a man of calm judgment who never dreamed of pressing his claims and when suddenly the perpetual concession of the san tome mine was offered to him in full settlement his alarm became extreme he was versed in the ways of governments indeed the intention of this affair though no doubt deeply meditated in the closet lay open on the surface of the document presented urgently for his signature the third and most important clause stipulated that the concessionholder should pay at once to the government five years royalties on the estimated output of the mine  mr gould senior defended himself from this fatal favour with many arguments and entreaties but without success he knew nothing of mining he had no means to put his concession on the european market the mine as a working concern did not exist the buildings had been burnt down the mining plant had been destroyed the mining population had disappeared from the neighbourhood years and years ago the very road had vanished under a flood of tropical vegetation as effectually as if swallowed by the sea and the main gallery had fallen in within a hundred yards from the entrance it was no longer an abandoned mine it was a wild inaccessible and rocky gorge of the sierra where vestiges of charred timber some heaps of smashed bricks and a few shapeless pieces of rusty iron could have been found under the matted mass of thorny creepers covering the ground mr gould senior did not desire the perpetual possession of that desolate locality in fact the mere vision of it arising before his mind in the still watches of the night had the power to exasperate him into hours of hot and agitated insomnia  it so happened however that the finance minister of the time was a man to whom in years gone by mr gould had unfortunately declined to grant some small pecuniary assistance basing his refusal on the ground that the applicant was a notorious gambler and cheat besides being more than half suspected of a robbery with violence on a wealthy ranchero in a remote country district where he was actually exercising the function of a judge now after reaching his exalted position that politician had proclaimed his intention to repay evil with good to senor gouldthe poor man he affirmed and reaffirmed this resolution in the drawingrooms of sta marta in a soft and implacable voice and with such malicious glances that mr goulds best friends advised him earnestly to attempt no bribery to get the matter dropped it would have been useless indeed it would not have been a very safe proceeding such was also the opinion of a stout loudvoiced lady of french extraction the daughter she said of an officer of high rank officier superieur de larmee who was accommodated with lodgings within the walls of a secularized convent next door to the ministry of finance that florid person when approached on behalf of mr gould in a proper manner and with a suitable present shook her head despondently she was goodnatured and her despondency was genuine she imagined she could not take money in consideration of something she could not accomplish the friend of mr gould charged with the delicate mission used to say afterwards that she was the only honest person closely or remotely connected with the government he had ever met no go she had said with a cavalier husky intonation which was natural to her and using turns of expression more suitable to a child of parents unknown than to the orphaned daughter of a general officer no its no go pas moyen mon garcon cest dommage tout de meme ah zut je ne vole pas mon monde je ne suis pas ministremoi vous pouvez emporter votre petit sac  for a moment biting her carmine lip she deplored inwardly the tyranny of the rigid principles governing the sale of her influence in high places then significantly and with a touch of impatience allez she added et dites bien a votre bonhommeentendezvousquil faut avaler la pilule  after such a warning there was nothing for it but to sign and pay mr gould had swallowed the pill and it was as though it had been compounded of some subtle poison that acted directly on his brain he became at once mineridden and as he was well read in light literature it took to his mind the form of the old man of the sea fastened upon his shoulders he also began to dream of vampires mr gould exaggerated to himself the disadvantages of his new position because he viewed it emotionally his position in costaguana was no worse than before but man is a desperately conservative creature and the extravagant novelty of this outrage upon his purse distressed his sensibilities everybody around him was being robbed by the grotesque and murderous bands that played their game of governments and revolutions after the death of guzman bento his experience had taught him that however short the plunder might fall of their legitimate expectations no gang in possession of the presidential palace would be so incompetent as to suffer itself to be baffled by the want of a pretext the first casual colonel of the barefooted army of scarecrows that came along was able to expose with force and precision to any mere civilian his titles to a sum of 10000 dollars the while his hope would be immutably fixed upon a gratuity at any rate of no less than a thousand mr gould knew that very well and armed with resignation had waited for better times but to be robbed under the forms of legality and business was intolerable to his imagination mr gould the father had one fault in his sagacious and honourable character he attached too much importance to form it is a failing common to mankind whose views are tinged by prejudices there was for him in that affair a malignancy of perverted justice which by means of a moral shock attacked his vigorous physique it will end by killing me he used to affirm many times a day and in fact since that time he began to suffer from fever from liver pains and mostly from a worrying inability to think of anything else the finance minister could have formed no conception of the profound subtlety of his revenge even mr goulds letters to his fourteenyearold boy charles then away in england for his education came at last to talk of practically nothing but the mine he groaned over the injustice the persecution the outrage of that mine he occupied whole pages in the exposition of the fatal consequences attaching to the possession of that mine from every point of view with every dismal inference with words of horror at the apparently eternal character of that curse for the concession had been granted to him and his descendants for ever he implored his son never to return to costaguana never to claim any part of his inheritance there because it was tainted by the infamous concession never to touch it never to approach it to forget that america existed and pursue a mercantile career in europe and each letter ended with bitter selfreproaches for having stayed too long in that cavern of thieves intriguers and brigands  to be told repeatedly that ones future is blighted because of the possession of a silver mine is not at the age of fourteen a matter of prime importance as to its main statement but in its form it is calculated to excite a certain amount of wonder and attention in course of time the boy at first only puzzled by the angry jeremiads but rather sorry for his dad began to turn the matter over in his mind in such moments as he could spare from play and study in about a year he had evolved from the lecture of the letters a definite conviction that there was a silver mine in the sulaco province of the republic of costaguana where poor uncle harry had been shot by soldiers a great many years before there was also connected closely with that mine a thing called the iniquitous gould concession apparently written on a paper which his father desired ardently to tear and fling into the faces of presidents members of judicature and ministers of state and this desire persisted though the names of these people he noticed seldom remained the same for a whole year together this desire since the thing was iniquitous seemed quite natural to the boy though why the affair was iniquitous he did not know afterwards with advancing wisdom he managed to clear the plain truth of the business from the fantastic intrusions of the old man of the sea vampires and ghouls which had lent to his fathers correspondence the flavour of a gruesome arabian nights tale in the end the growing youth attained to as close an intimacy with the san tome mine as the old man who wrote these plaintive and enraged letters on the other side of the sea he had been made several times already to pay heavy fines for neglecting to work the mine he reported besides other sums extracted from him on account of future royalties on the ground that a man with such a valuable concession in his pocket could not refuse his financial assistance to the government of the republic the last of his fortune was passing away from him against worthless receipts he wrote in a rage whilst he was being pointed out as an individual who had known how to secure enormous advantages from the necessities of his country and the young man in europe grew more and more interested in that thing which could provoke such a tumult of words and passion  he thought of it every day but he thought of it without bitterness it might have been an unfortunate affair for his poor dad and the whole story threw a queer light upon the social and political life of costaguana the view he took of it was sympathetic to his father yet calm and reflective his personal feelings had not been outraged and it is difficult to resent with proper and durable indignation the physical or mental anguish of another organism even if that other organism is ones own father by the time he was twenty charles gould had in his turn fallen under the spell of the san tome mine but it was another form of enchantment more suitable to his youth into whose magic formula there entered hope vigour and selfconfidence instead of weary indignation and despair left after he was twenty to his own guidance except for the severe injunction not to return to costaguana he had pursued his studies in belgium and france with the idea of qualifying for a mining engineer but this scientific aspect of his labours remained vague and imperfect in his mind mines had acquired for him a dramatic interest he studied their peculiarities from a personal point of view too as one would study the varied characters of men he visited them as one goes with curiosity to call upon remarkable persons he visited mines in germany in spain in cornwall abandoned workings had for him strong fascination their desolation appealed to him like the sight of human misery whose causes are varied and profound they might have been worthless but also they might have been misunderstood his future wife was the first and perhaps the only person to detect this secret mood which governed the profoundly sensible almost voiceless attitude of this man towards the world of material things and at once her delight in him lingering with halfopen wings like those birds that cannot rise easily from a flat level found a pinnacle from which to soar up into the skies  they had become acquainted in italy where the future mrs gould was staying with an old and pale aunt who years before had married a middleaged impoverished italian marquis she now mourned that man who had known how to give up his life to the independence and unity of his country who had known how to be as enthusiastic in his generosity as the youngest of those who fell for that very cause of which old giorgio viola was a drifting relic as a broken spar is suffered to float away disregarded after a naval victory the marchesa led a still whispering existence nunlike in her black robes and a white band over the forehead in a corner of the first floor of an ancient and ruinous palace whose big empty halls downstairs sheltered under their painted ceilings the harvests the fowls and even the cattle together with the whole family of the tenant farmer  the two young people had met in lucca after that meeting charles gould visited no mines though they went together in a carriage once to see some marble quarries where the work resembled mining in so far that it also was the tearing of the raw material of treasure from the earth charles gould did not open his heart to her in any set speeches he simply went on acting and thinking in her sight this is the true method of sincerity one of his frequent remarks was i think sometimes that poor father takes a wrong view of that san tome business and they discussed that opinion long and earnestly as if they could influence a mind across half the globe but in reality they discussed it because the sentiment of love can enter into any subject and live ardently in remote phrases for this natural reason these discussions were precious to mrs gould in her engaged state charles feared that mr gould senior was wasting his strength and making himself ill by his efforts to get rid of the concession i fancy that this is not the kind of handling it requires he mused aloud as if to himself and when she wondered frankly that a man of character should devote his energies to plotting and intrigues charles would remark with a gentle concern that understood her wonder you must not forget that he was born there  she would set her quick mind to work upon that and then make the inconsequent retort which he accepted as perfectly sagacious because in fact it was so  well and you you were born there too  he knew his answer  thats different ive been away ten years dad never had such a long spell and it was more than thirty years ago  she was the first person to whom he opened his lips after receiving the news of his fathers death  it has killed him he said  he had walked straight out of town with the news straight out before him in the noonday sun on the white road and his feet had brought him face to face with her in the hall of the ruined palazzo a room magnificent and naked with here and there a long strip of damask black with damp and age hanging down on a bare panel of the wall it was furnished with exactly one gilt armchair with a broken back and an octagon columnar stand bearing a heavy marble vase ornamented with sculptured masks and garlands of flowers and cracked from top to bottom charles gould was dusty with the white dust of the road lying on his boots on his shoulders on his cap with two peaks water dripped from under it all over his face and he grasped a thick oaken cudgel in his bare right hand  she went very pale under the roses of her big straw hat gloved swinging a clear sunshade caught just as she was going out to meet him at the bottom of the hill where three poplars stand near the wall of a vineyard  it has killed him he repeated he ought to have had many years yet we are a longlived family  she was too startled to say anything he was contemplating with a penetrating and motionless stare the cracked marble urn as though he had resolved to fix its shape for ever in his memory it was only when turning suddenly to her he blurted out twice ive come to youive come straight to you without being able to finish his phrase that the great pitifulness of that lonely and tormented death in costaguana came to her with the full force of its misery he caught hold of her hand raised it to his lips and at that she dropped her parasol to pat him on the cheek murmured poor boy and began to dry her eyes under the downward curve of her hatbrim very small in her simple white frock almost like a lost child crying in the degraded grandeur of the noble hall while he stood by her again perfectly motionless in the contemplation of the marble urn  afterwards they went out for a long walk which was silent till he exclaimed suddenly  yes but if he had only grappled with it in a proper way  and then they stopped everywhere there were long shadows lying on the hills on the roads on the enclosed fields of olive trees the shadows of poplars of wide chestnuts of farm buildings of stone walls and in midair the sound of a bell thin and alert was like the throbbing pulse of the sunset glow her lips were slightly parted as though in surprise that he should not be looking at her with his usual expression his usual expression was unconditionally approving and attentive he was in his talks with her the most anxious and deferential of dictators an attitude that pleased her immensely it affirmed her power without detracting from his dignity that slight girl with her little feet little hands little face attractively overweighted by great coils of hair with a rather large mouth whose mere parting seemed to breathe upon you the fragrance of frankness and generosity had the fastidious soul of an experienced woman she was before all things and all flatteries careful of her pride in the object of her choice but now he was actually not looking at her at all and his expression was tense and irrational as is natural in a man who elects to stare at nothing past a young girls head  well yes it was iniquitous they corrupted him thoroughly the poor old boy oh why wouldnt he let me go back to him but now i shall know how to grapple with this  after pronouncing these words with immense assurance he glanced down at her and at once fell a prey to distress incertitude and fear  the only thing he wanted to know now he said was whether she did love him enoughwhether she would have the courage to go with him so far away he put these questions to her in a voice that trembled with anxietyfor he was a determined man  she did she would and immediately the future hostess of all the europeans in sulaco had the physical experience of the earth falling away from under her it vanished completely even to the very sound of the bell when her feet touched the ground again the bell was still ringing in the valley she put her hands up to her hair breathing quickly and glanced up and down the stony lane it was reassuringly empty meantime charles stepping with one foot into a dry and dusty ditch picked up the open parasol which had bounded away from them with a martial sound of drum taps he handed it to her soberly a little crestfallen  they turned back and after she had slipped her hand on his arm the first words he pronounced were  its lucky that we shall be able to settle in a coast town youve heard its name it is sulaco i am so glad poor father did get that house he bought a big house there years ago in order that there should always be a casa gould in the principal town of what used to be called the occidental province i lived there once as a small boy with my dear mother for a whole year while poor father was away in the united states on business you shall be the new mistress of the casa gould  and later in the inhabited corner of the palazzo above the vineyards the marble hills the pines and olives of lucca he also said  the name of gould has been always highly respected in sulaco my uncle harry was chief of the state for some time and has left a great name amongst the first families by this i mean the pure creole families who take no part in the miserable farce of governments uncle harry was no adventurer in costaguana we goulds are no adventurers he was of the country and he loved it but he remained essentially an englishman in his ideas he made use of the political cry of his time it was federation but he was no politician he simply stood up for social order out of pure love for rational liberty and from his hate of oppression there was no nonsense about him he went to work in his own way because it seemed right just as i feel i must lay hold of that mine  in such words he talked to her because his memory was very full of the country of his childhood his heart of his life with that girl and his mind of the san tome concession he added that he would have to leave her for a few days to find an american a man from san francisco who was still somewhere in europe a few months before he had made his acquaintance in an old historic german town situated in a mining district the american had his womankind with him but seemed lonely while they were sketching all day long the old doorways and the turreted corners of the mediaeval houses charles gould had with him the inseparable companionship of the mine the other man was interested in mining enterprises knew something of costaguana and was no stranger to the name of gould they had talked together with some intimacy which was made possible by the difference of their ages charles wanted now to find that capitalist of shrewd mind and accessible character his fathers fortune in costaguana which he had supposed to be still considerable seemed to have melted in the rascally crucible of revolutions apart from some ten thousand pounds deposited in england there appeared to be nothing left except the house in sulaco a vague right of forest exploitation in a remote and savage district and the san tome concession which had attended his poor father to the very brink of the grave  he explained those things it was late when they parted she had never before given him such a fascinating vision of herself all the eagerness of youth for a strange life for great distances for a future in which there was an air of adventure of combata subtle thought of redress and conquest had filled her with an intense excitement which she returned to the giver with a more open and exquisite display of tenderness  he left her to walk down the hill and directly he found himself alone he became sober that irreparable change a death makes in the course of our daily thoughts can be felt in a vague and poignant discomfort of mind it hurt charles gould to feel that never more by no effort of will would he be able to think of his father in the same way he used to think of him when the poor man was alive his breathing image was no longer in his power this consideration closely affecting his own identity filled his breast with a mournful and angry desire for action in this his instinct was unerring action is consolatory it is the enemy of thought and the friend of flattering illusions only in the conduct of our action can we find the sense of mastery over the fates for his action the mine was obviously the only field it was imperative sometimes to know how to disobey the solemn wishes of the dead he resolved firmly to make his disobedience as thorough by way of atonement as it well could be the mine had been the cause of an absurd moral disaster its working must be made a serious and moral success he owed it to the dead mans memory such were theproperly speakingemotions of charles gould his thoughts ran upon the means of raising a large amount of capital in san francisco or elsewhere and incidentally there occurred to him also the general reflection that the counsel of the departed must be an unsound guide not one of them could be aware beforehand what enormous changes the death of any given individual may produce in the very aspect of the world  the latest phase in the history of the mine mrs gould knew from personal experience it was in essence the history of her married life the mantle of the goulds hereditary position in sulaco had descended amply upon her little person but she would not allow the peculiarities of the strange garment to weigh down the vivacity of her character which was the sign of no mere mechanical sprightliness but of an eager intelligence it must not be supposed that mrs goulds mind was masculine a woman with a masculine mind is not a being of superior efficiency she is simply a phenomenon of imperfect differentiationinterestingly barren and without importance dona emilias intelligence being feminine led her to achieve the conquest of sulaco simply by lighting the way for her unselfishness and sympathy she could converse charmingly but she was not talkative the wisdom of the heart having no concern with the erection or demolition of theories any more than with the defence of prejudices has no random words at its command the words it pronounces have the value of acts of integrity tolerance and compassion a womans true tenderness like the true virility of man is expressed in action of a conquering kind the ladies of sulaco adored mrs gould they still look upon me as something of a monster mrs gould had said pleasantly to one of the three gentlemen from san francisco she had to entertain in her new sulaco house just about a year after her marriage  they were her first visitors from abroad and they had come to look at the san tome mine she jested most agreeably they thought and charles gould besides knowing thoroughly what he was about had shown himself a real hustler these facts caused them to be well disposed towards his wife an unmistakable enthusiasm pointed by a slight flavour of irony made her talk of the mine absolutely fascinating to her visitors and provoked them to grave and indulgent smiles in which there was a good deal of deference perhaps had they known how much she was inspired by an idealistic view of success they would have been amazed at the state of her mind as the spanishamerican ladies had been amazed at the tireless activity of her body she wouldin her own wordshave been for them something of a monster however the goulds were in essentials a reticent couple and their guests departed without the suspicion of any other purpose but simple profit in the working of a silver mine mrs gould had out her own carriage with two white mules to drive them down to the harbour whence the ceres was to carry them off into the olympus of plutocrats captain mitchell had snatched at the occasion of leavetaking to remark to mrs gould in a low confidential mutter this marks an epoch  mrs gould loved the patio of her spanish house a broad flight of stone steps was overlooked silently from a niche in the wall by a madonna in blue robes with the crowned child sitting on her arm subdued voices ascended in the early mornings from the paved well of the quadrangle with the stamping of horses and mules led out in pairs to drink at the cistern a tangle of slender bamboo stems drooped its narrow bladelike leaves over the square pool of water and the fat coachman sat muffled up on the edge holding lazily the ends of halters in his hand barefooted servants passed to and fro issuing from dark low doorways below two laundry girls with baskets of washed linen the baker with the tray of bread made for the day leonardaher own cameristabearing high up swung from her hand raised above her raven black head a bunch of starched underskirts dazzlingly white in the slant of sunshine then the old porter would hobble in sweeping the flagstones and the house was ready for the day all the lofty rooms on three sides of the quadrangle opened into each other and into the corredor with its wroughtiron railings and a border of flowers whence like the lady of the mediaeval castle she could witness from above all the departures and arrivals of the casa to which the sonorous arched gateway lent an air of stately importance  she had watched her carriage roll away with the three guests from the north she smiled their three arms went up simultaneously to their three hats captain mitchell the fourth in attendance had already begun a pompous discourse then she lingered she lingered approaching her face to the clusters of flowers here and there as if to give time to her thoughts to catch up with her slow footsteps along the straight vista of the corredor  a fringed indian hammock from aroa gay with coloured featherwork had been swung judiciously in a corner that caught the early sun for the mornings are cool in sulaco the cluster of flor de noche buena blazed in great masses before the open glass doors of the reception rooms a big green parrot brilliant like an emerald in a cage that flashed like gold screamed out ferociously viva costaguana then called twice mellifluously leonarda leonarda in imitation of mrs goulds voice and suddenly took refuge in immobility and silence mrs gould reached the end of the gallery and put her head through the door of her husbands room  charles gould with one foot on a low wooden stool was already strapping his spurs he wanted to hurry back to the mine mrs gould without coming in glanced about the room one tall broad bookcase with glass doors was full of books but in the other without shelves and lined with red baize were arranged firearms winchester carbines revolvers a couple of shotguns and even two pairs of doublebarrelled holster pistols between them by itself upon a strip of scarlet velvet hung an old cavalry sabre once the property of don enrique gould the hero of the occidental province presented by don jose avellanos the hereditary friend of the family  otherwise the plastered white walls were completely bare except for a watercolour sketch of the san tome mountainthe work of dona emilia herself in the middle of the redtiled floor stood two long tables littered with plans and papers a few chairs and a glass showcase containing specimens of ore from the mine mrs gould looking at all these things in turn wondered aloud why the talk of these wealthy and enterprising men discussing the prospects the working and the safety of the mine rendered her so impatient and uneasy whereas she could talk of the mine by the hour with her husband with unwearied interest and satisfaction and dropping her eyelids expressively she added  what do you feel about it charley  then surprised at her husbands silence she raised her eyes opened wide as pretty as pale flowers he had done with the spurs and twisting his moustache with both hands horizontally he contemplated her from the height of his long legs with a visible appreciation of her appearance the consciousness of being thus contemplated pleased mrs gould  they are considerable men he said  i know but have you listened to their conversation they dont seem to have understood anything they have seen here  they have seen the mine they have understood that to some purpose charles gould interjected in defence of the visitors and then his wife mentioned the name of the most considerable of the three he was considerable in finance and in industry his name was familiar to many millions of people he was so considerable that he would never have travelled so far away from the centre of his activity if the doctors had not insisted with veiled menaces on his taking a long holiday  mr holroyds sense of religion mrs gould pursued was shocked and disgusted at the tawdriness of the dressedup saints in the cathedralthe worship he called it of wood and tinsel but it seemed to me that he looked upon his own god as a sort of influential partner who gets his share of profits in the endowment of churches thats a sort of idolatry he told me he endowed churches every year charley  no end of them said mr gould marvelling inwardly at the mobility of her physiognomy all over the country hes famous for that sort of munificence oh he didnt boast mrs gould declared scrupulously i believe hes really a good man but so stupid a poor chulo who offers a little silver arm or leg to thank his god for a cure is as rational and more touching  hes at the head of immense silver and iron interests charles gould observed  ah yes the religion of silver and iron hes a very civil man though he looked awfully solemn when he first saw the madonna on the staircase whos only wood and paint but he said nothing to me my dear charley i heard those men talk among themselves can it be that they really wish to become for an immense consideration drawers of water and hewers of wood to all the countries and nations of the earth  a man must work to some end charles gould said vaguely  mrs gould frowning surveyed him from head to foot with his riding breeches leather leggings an article of apparel never before seen in costaguana a norfolk coat of grey flannel and those great flaming moustaches he suggested an officer of cavalry turned gentleman farmer this combination was gratifying to mrs goulds tastes how thin the poor boy is she thought he overworks himself but there was no denying that his finedrawn keen red face and his whole longlimbed lank person had an air of breeding and distinction and mrs gould relented  i only wondered what you felt she murmured gently  during the last few days as it happened charles gould had been kept too busy thinking twice before he spoke to have paid much attention to the state of his feelings but theirs was a successful match and he had no difficulty in finding his answer  the best of my feelings are in your keeping my dear he said lightly and there was so much truth in that obscure phrase that he experienced towards her at the moment a great increase of gratitude and tenderness  mrs gould however did not seem to find this answer in the least obscure she brightened up delicately already he had changed his tone  but there are facts the worth of the mineas a mineis beyond doubt it shall make us very wealthy the mere working of it is a matter of technical knowledge which i havewhich ten thousand other men in the world have but its safety its continued existence as an enterprise giving a return to mento strangers comparative strangerswho invest money in it is left altogether in my hands i have inspired confidence in a man of wealth and position you seem to think this perfectly naturaldo you well i dont know i dont know why i have but it is a fact this fact makes everything possible because without it i would never have thought of disregarding my fathers wishes i would never have disposed of the concession as a speculator disposes of a valuable right to a companyfor cash and shares to grow rich eventually if possible but at any rate to put some money at once in his pocket no even if it had been feasiblewhich i doubti would not have done so poor father did not understand he was afraid i would hang on to the ruinous thing waiting for just some such chance and waste my life miserably that was the true sense of his prohibition which we have deliberately set aside  they were walking up and down the corredor her head just reached to his shoulder his arm extended downwards was about her waist his spurs jingled slightly  he had not seen me for ten years he did not know me he parted from me for my sake and he would never let me come back he was always talking in his letters of leaving costaguana of abandoning everything and making his escape but he was too valuable a prey they would have thrown him into one of their prisons at the first suspicion  his spurred feet clinked slowly he was bending over his wife as they walked the big parrot turning its head askew followed their pacing figures with a round unblinking eye  he was a lonely man ever since i was ten years old he used to talk to me as if i had been grown up when i was in europe he wrote to me every month ten twelve pages every month of my life for ten years and after all he did not know me just think of itten whole years away the years i was growing up into a man he could not know me do you think he could  mrs gould shook her head negatively which was just what her husband had expected from the strength of the argument but she shook her head negatively only because she thought that no one could know her charlesreally know him for what he was but herself the thing was obvious it could be felt it required no argument and poor mr gould senior who had died too soon to ever hear of their engagement remained too shadowy a figure for her to be credited with knowledge of any sort whatever  no he did not understand in my view this mine could never have been a thing to sell never after all his misery i simply could not have touched it for money alone charles gould pursued and she pressed her head to his shoulder approvingly  these two young people remembered the life which had ended wretchedly just when their own lives had come together in that splendour of hopeful love which to the most sensible minds appears like a triumph of good over all the evils of the earth a vague idea of rehabilitation had entered the plan of their life that it was so vague as to elude the support of argument made it only the stronger it had presented itself to them at the instant when the womans instinct of devotion and the mans instinct of activity receive from the strongest of illusions their most powerful impulse the very prohibition imposed the necessity of success it was as if they had been morally bound to make good their vigorous view of life against the unnatural error of weariness and despair if the idea of wealth was present to them it was only in so far as it was bound with that other success mrs gould an orphan from early childhood and without fortune brought up in an atmosphere of intellectual interests had never considered the aspects of great wealth they were too remote and she had not learned that they were desirable on the other hand she had not known anything of absolute want even the very poverty of her aunt the marchesa had nothing intolerable to a refined mind it seemed in accord with a great grief it had the austerity of a sacrifice offered to a noble ideal thus even the most legitimate touch of materialism was wanting in mrs goulds character the dead man of whom she thought with tenderness because he was charleys father and with some impatience because he had been weak must be put completely in the wrong nothing else would do to keep their prosperity without a stain on its only real on its immaterial side  charles gould on his part had been obliged to keep the idea of wealth well to the fore but he brought it forward as a means not as an end unless the mine was good business it could not be touched he had to insist on that aspect of the enterprise it was his lever to move men who had capital and charles gould believed in the mine he knew everything that could be known of it his faith in the mine was contagious though it was not served by a great eloquence but business men are frequently as sanguine and imaginative as lovers they are affected by a personality much oftener than people would suppose and charles gould in his unshaken assurance was absolutely convincing besides it was a matter of common knowledge to the men to whom he addressed himself that mining in costaguana was a game that could be made considerably more than worth the candle the men of affairs knew that very well the real difficulty in touching it was elsewhere against that there was an implication of calm and implacable resolution in charles goulds very voice men of affairs venture sometimes on acts that the common judgment of the world would pronounce absurd they make their decisions on apparently impulsive and human grounds very well had said the considerable personage to whom charles gould on his way out through san francisco had lucidly exposed his point of view let us suppose that the mining affairs of sulaco are taken in hand there would then be in it first the house of holroyd which is all right then mr charles gould a citizen of costaguana who is also all right and lastly the government of the republic so far this resembles the first start of the atacama nitrate fields where there was a financing house a gentleman of the name of edwards anda government or rather two governmentstwo south american governments and you know what came of it war came of it devastating and prolonged war came of it mr gould however here we possess the advantage of having only one south american government hanging around for plunder out of the deal it is an advantage but then there are degrees of badness and that government is the costaguana government  thus spoke the considerable personage the millionaire endower of churches on a scale befitting the greatness of his native landthe same to whom the doctors used the language of horrid and veiled menaces he was a biglimbed deliberate man whose quiet burliness lent to an ample silkfaced frockcoat a superfine dignity his hair was iron grey his eyebrows were still black and his massive profile was the profile of a caesars head on an old roman coin but his parentage was german and scotch and english with remote strains of danish and french blood giving him the temperament of a puritan and an insatiable imagination of conquest he was completely unbending to his visitor because of the warm introduction the visitor had brought from europe and because of an irrational liking for earnestness and determination wherever met to whatever end directed  the costaguana government shall play its hand for all its worthand dont you forget it mr gould now what is costaguana it is the bottomless pit of 10 per cent loans and other fool investments european capital has been flung into it with both hands for years not ours though we in this country know just about enough to keep indoors when it rains we can sit and watch of course some day we shall step in we are bound to but theres no hurry time itself has got to wait on the greatest country in the whole of gods universe we shall be giving the word for everything industry trade law journalism art politics and religion from cape horn clear over to smiths sound and beyond too if anything worth taking hold of turns up at the north pole and then we shall have the leisure to take in hand the outlying islands and continents of the earth we shall run the worlds business whether the world likes it or not the world cant help itand neither can we i guess  by this he meant to express his faith in destiny in words suitable to his intelligence which was unskilled in the presentation of general ideas his intelligence was nourished on facts and charles gould whose imagination had been permanently affected by the one great fact of a silver mine had no objection to this theory of the worlds future if it had seemed distasteful for a moment it was because the sudden statement of such vast eventualities dwarfed almost to nothingness the actual matter in hand he and his plans and all the mineral wealth of the occidental province appeared suddenly robbed of every vestige of magnitude the sensation was disagreeable but charles gould was not dull already he felt that he was producing a favourable impression the consciousness of that flattering fact helped him to a vague smile which his big interlocutor took for a smile of discreet and admiring assent he smiled quietly too and immediately charles gould with that mental agility mankind will display in defence of a cherished hope reflected that the very apparent insignificance of his aim would help him to success his personality and his mine would be taken up because it was a matter of no great consequence one way or another to a man who referred his action to such a prodigious destiny and charles gould was not humiliated by this consideration because the thing remained as big as ever for him nobody elses vast conceptions of destiny could diminish the aspect of his desire for the redemption of the san tome mine in comparison to the correctness of his aim definite in space and absolutely attainable within a limited time the other man appeared for an instant as a dreamy idealist of no importance  the great man massive and benignant had been looking at him thoughtfully when he broke the short silence it was to remark that concessions flew about thick in the air of costaguana any simple soul that just yearned to be taken in could bring down a concession at the first shot  our consuls get their mouths stopped with them he continued with a twinkle of genial scorn in his eyes but in a moment he became grave a conscientious upright man that cares nothing for boodle and keeps clear of their intrigues conspiracies and factions soon gets his passports see that mr gould persona non grata thats the reason our government is never properly informed on the other hand europe must be kept out of this continent and for proper interference on our part the time is not yet ripe i dare say but we herewe are not this countrys government neither are we simple souls your affair is all right the main question for us is whether the second partner and thats you is the right sort to hold his own against the third and unwelcome partner which is one or another of the high and mighty robber gangs that run the costaguana government what do you think mr gould eh  he bent forward to look steadily into the unflinching eyes of charles gould who remembering the large box full of his fathers letters put the accumulated scorn and bitterness of many years into the tone of his answer  as far as the knowledge of these men and their methods and their politics is concerned i can answer for myself i have been fed on that sort of knowledge since i was a boy i am not likely to fall into mistakes from excess of optimism  not likely eh thats all right tact and a stiff upper lip is what youll want and you could bluff a little on the strength of your backing not too much though we will go with you as long as the thing runs straight but we wont be drawn into any large trouble this is the experiment which i am willing to make there is some risk and we will take it but if you cant keep up your end we will stand our loss of course and thenwell let the thing go this mine can wait it has been shut up before as you know you must understand that under no circumstances will we consent to throw good money after bad  thus the great personage had spoken then in his own private office in a great city where other men very considerable in the eyes of a vain populace waited with alacrity upon a wave of his hand and rather more than a year later during his unexpected appearance in sulaco he had emphasized his uncompromising attitude with a freedom of sincerity permitted to his wealth and influence he did this with the less reserve perhaps because the inspection of what had been done and more still the way in which successive steps had been taken had impressed him with the conviction that charles gould was perfectly capable of keeping up his end  this young fellow he thought to himself may yet become a power in the land  this thought flattered him for hitherto the only account of this young man he could give to his intimates was  my brotherinlaw met him in one of these onehorse old german towns near some mines and sent him on to me with a letter hes one of the costaguana goulds purebred englishmen but all born in the country his uncle went into politics was the last provincial president of sulaco and got shot after a battle his father was a prominent business man in sta marta tried to keep clear of their politics and died ruined after a lot of revolutions and thats your costaguana in a nutshell  of course he was too great a man to be questioned as to his motives even by his intimates the outside world was at liberty to wonder respectfully at the hidden meaning of his actions he was so great a man that his lavish patronage of the purer forms of christianity which in its naive form of churchbuilding amused mrs gould was looked upon by his fellowcitizens as the manifestation of a pious and humble spirit but in his own circles of the financial world the taking up of such a thing as the san tome mine was regarded with respect indeed but rather as a subject for discreet jocularity it was a great mans caprice in the great holroyd building an enormous pile of iron glass and blocks of stone at the corner of two streets cobwebbed aloft by the radiation of telegraph wires the heads of principal departments exchanged humorous glances which meant that they were not let into the secrets of the san tome business the costaguana mail it was never largeone fairly heavy envelope was taken unopened straight into the great mans room and no instructions dealing with it had ever been issued thence the office whispered that he answered personallyand not by dictation either but actually writing in his own hand with pen and ink and it was to be supposed taking a copy in his own private press copybook inaccessible to profane eyes some scornful young men insignificant pieces of minor machinery in that elevenstoreyhigh workshop of great affairs expressed frankly their private opinion that the great chief had done at last something silly and was ashamed of his folly others elderly and insignificant but full of romantic reverence for the business that had devoured their best years used to mutter darkly and knowingly that this was a portentous sign that the holroyd connection meant byandby to get hold of the whole republic of costaguana lock stock and barrel but in fact the hobby theory was the right one it interested the great man to attend personally to the san tome mine it interested him so much that he allowed this hobby to give a direction to the first complete holiday he had taken for quite a startling number of years he was not running a great enterprise there no mere railway board or industrial corporation he was running a man a success would have pleased him very much on refreshingly novel grounds but on the other side of the same feeling it was incumbent upon him to cast it off utterly at the first sign of failure a man may be thrown off the papers had unfortunately trumpeted all over the land his journey to costaguana if he was pleased at the way charles gould was going on he infused an added grimness into his assurances of support even at the very last interview half an hour or so before he rolled out of the patio hat in hand behind mrs goulds white mules he had said in charless room  you go ahead in your own way and i shall know how to help you as long as you hold your own but you may rest assured that in a given case we shall know how to drop you in time  to this charles goulds only answer had been you may begin sending out the machinery as soon as you like  and the great man had liked this imperturbable assurance the secret of it was that to charles goulds mind these uncompromising terms were agreeable like this the mine preserved its identity with which he had endowed it as a boy and it remained dependent on himself alone it was a serious affair and he too took it grimly  of course he said to his wife alluding to this last conversation with the departed guest while they walked slowly up and down the corredor followed by the irritated eye of the parrotof course a man of that sort can take up a thing or drop it when he likes he will suffer from no sense of defeat he may have to give in or he may have to die tomorrow but the great silver and iron interests will survive and some day will get hold of costaguana along with the rest of the world  they had stopped near the cage the parrot catching the sound of a word belonging to his vocabulary was moved to interfere parrots are very human  viva costaguana he shrieked with intense selfassertion and instantly ruffling up his feathers assumed an air of puffedup somnolence behind the glittering wires  and do you believe that charley mrs gould asked this seems to me most awful materialism and  my dear its nothing to me interrupted her husband in a reasonable tone i make use of what i see whats it to me whether his talk is the voice of destiny or simply a bit of claptrap eloquence theres a good deal of eloquence of one sort or another produced in both americas the air of the new world seems favourable to the art of declamation have you forgotten how dear avellanos can hold forth for hours here  oh but thats different protested mrs gould almost shocked the allusion was not to the point don jose was a dear good man who talked very well and was enthusiastic about the greatness of the san tome mine how can you compare them charles she exclaimed reproachfully he has sufferedand yet he hopes  the working competence of menwhich she never questionedwas very surprising to mrs gould because upon so many obvious issues they showed themselves strangely muddleheaded  charles gould with a careworn calmness which secured for him at once his wifes anxious sympathy assured her that he was not comparing he was an american himself after all and perhaps he could understand both kinds of eloquenceif it were worth while to try he added grimly but he had breathed the air of england longer than any of his people had done for three generations and really he begged to be excused his poor father could be eloquent too and he asked his wife whether she remembered a passage in one of his fathers last letters where mr gould had expressed the conviction that god looked wrathfully at these countries or else he would let some ray of hope fall through a rift in the appalling darkness of intrigue bloodshed and crime that hung over the queen of continents  mrs gould had not forgotten you read it to me charley she murmured it was a striking pronouncement how deeply your father must have felt its terrible sadness  he did not like to be robbed it exasperated him said charles gould but the image will serve well enough what is wanted here is law good faith order security any one can declaim about these things but i pin my faith to material interests only let the material interests once get a firm footing and they are bound to impose the conditions on which alone they can continue to exist thats how your moneymaking is justified here in the face of lawlessness and disorder it is justified because the security which it demands must be shared with an oppressed people a better justice will come afterwards thats your ray of hope his arm pressed her slight form closer to his side for a moment and who knows whether in that sense even the san tome mine may not become that little rift in the darkness which poor father despaired of ever seeing  she glanced up at him with admiration he was competent he had given a vast shape to the vagueness of her unselfish ambitions  charley she said you are splendidly disobedient  he left her suddenly in the corredor to go and get his hat a soft grey sombrero an article of national costume which combined unexpectedly well with his english getup he came back a ridingwhip under his arm buttoning up a dogskin glove his face reflected the resolute nature of his thoughts his wife had waited for him at the head of the stairs and before he gave her the parting kiss he finished the conversation  what should be perfectly clear to us he said is the fact that there is no going back where could we begin life afresh we are in now for all that there is in us  he bent over her upturned face very tenderly and a little remorsefully charles gould was competent because he had no illusions the gould concession had to fight for life with such weapons as could be found at once in the mire of a corruption that was so universal as almost to lose its significance he was prepared to stoop for his weapons for a moment he felt as if the silver mine which had killed his father had decoyed him further than he meant to go and with the roundabout logic of emotions he felt that the worthiness of his life was bound up with success there was no going back    chapter seven  mrs gould was too intelligently sympathetic not to share that feeling it made life exciting and she was too much of a woman not to like excitement but it frightened her too a little and when don jose avellanos rocking in the american chair would go so far as to say even my dear carlos if you had failed even if some untoward event were yet to destroy your workwhich god forbidyou would have deserved well of your country mrs gould would look up from the teatable profoundly at her unmoved husband stirring the spoon in the cup as though he had not heard a word  not that don jose anticipated anything of the sort he could not praise enough dear carloss tact and courage his english rocklike quality of character was his best safeguard don jose affirmed and turning to mrs gould as to you emilia my soulhe would address her with the familiarity of his age and old friendshipyou are as true a patriot as though you had been born in our midst  this might have been less or more than the truth mrs gould accompanying her husband all over the province in the search for labour had seen the land with a deeper glance than a trueborn costaguanera could have done in her travelworn riding habit her face powdered white like a plaster cast with a further protection of a small silk mask during the heat of the day she rode on a wellshaped lightfooted pony in the centre of a little cavalcade two mozos de campo picturesque in great hats with spurred bare heels in white embroidered calzoneras leather jackets and striped ponchos rode ahead with carbines across their shoulders swaying in unison to the pace of the horses a tropilla of pack mules brought up the rear in charge of a thin brown muleteer sitting his longeared beast very near the tail legs thrust far forward the wide brim of his hat set far back making a sort of halo for his head an old costaguana officer a retired senior major of humble origin but patronized by the first families on account of his blanco opinions had been recommended by don jose for commissary and organizer of that expedition the points of his grey moustache hung far below his chin and riding on mrs goulds left hand he looked about with kindly eyes pointing out the features of the country telling the names of the little pueblos and of the estates of the smoothwalled haciendas like long fortresses crowning the knolls above the level of the sulaco valley it unrolled itself with green young crops plains woodland and gleams of water parklike from the blue vapour of the distant sierra to an immense quivering horizon of grass and sky where big white clouds seemed to fall slowly into the darkness of their own shadows  men ploughed with wooden ploughs and yoked oxen small on a boundless expanse as if attacking immensity itself the mounted figures of vaqueros galloped in the distance and the great herds fed with all their horned heads one way in one single wavering line as far as eye could reach across the broad potreros a spreading cottonwool tree shaded a thatched ranche by the road the trudging files of burdened indians taking off their hats would lift sad mute eyes to the cavalcade raising the dust of the crumbling camino real made by the hands of their enslaved forefathers and mrs gould with each days journey seemed to come nearer to the soul of the land in the tremendous disclosure of this interior unaffected by the slight european veneer of the coast towns a great land of plain and mountain and people suffering and mute waiting for the future in a pathetic immobility of patience  she knew its sights and its hospitality dispensed with a sort of slumbrous dignity in those great houses presenting long blind walls and heavy portals to the windswept pastures she was given the head of the tables where masters and dependants sat in a simple and patriarchal state the ladies of the house would talk softly in the moonlight under the orange trees of the courtyards impressing upon her the sweetness of their voices and the something mysterious in the quietude of their lives in the morning the gentlemen well mounted in braided sombreros and embroidered riding suits with much silver on the trappings of their horses would ride forth to escort the departing guests before committing them with grave goodbyes to the care of god at the boundary pillars of their estates in all these households she could hear stories of political outrage friends relatives ruined imprisoned killed in the battles of senseless civil wars barbarously executed in ferocious proscriptions as though the government of the country had been a struggle of lust between bands of absurd devils let loose upon the land with sabres and uniforms and grandiloquent phrases and on all the lips she found a weary desire for peace the dread of officialdom with its nightmarish parody of administration without law without security and without justice  she bore a whole two months of wandering very well she had that power of resistance to fatigue which one discovers here and there in some quite fraillooking women with surpriselike a state of possession by a remarkably stubborn spirit don pepethe old costaguana majorafter much display of solicitude for the delicate lady had ended by conferring upon her the name of the nevertired senora mrs gould was indeed becoming a costaguanera having acquired in southern europe a knowledge of true peasantry she was able to appreciate the great worth of the people she saw the man under the silent sadeyed beast of burden she saw them on the road carrying loads lonely figures upon the plain toiling under great straw hats with their white clothing flapping about their limbs in the wind she remembered the villages by some group of indian women at the fountain impressed upon her memory by the face of some young indian girl with a melancholy and sensual profile raising an earthenware vessel of cool water at the door of a dark hut with a wooden porch cumbered with great brown jars the solid wooden wheels of an oxcart halted with its shafts in the dust showed the strokes of the axe and a party of charcoal carriers with each mans load resting above his head on the top of the low mud wall slept stretched in a row within the strip of shade  the heavy stonework of bridges and churches left by the conquerors proclaimed the disregard of human labour the tributelabour of vanished nations the power of king and church was gone but at the sight of some heavy ruinous pile overtopping from a knoll the low mud walls of a village don pepe would interrupt the tale of his campaigns to exclaim  poor costaguana before it was everything for the padres nothing for the people and now it is everything for those great politicos in sta marta for negroes and thieves  charles talked with the alcaldes with the fiscales with the principal people in towns and with the caballeros on the estates the commandantes of the districts offered him escortsfor he could show an authorization from the sulaco political chief of the day how much the document had cost him in gold twentydollar pieces was a secret between himself a great man in the united states who condescended to answer the sulaco mail with his own hand and a great man of another sort with a dark olive complexion and shifty eyes inhabiting then the palace of the intendencia in sulaco and who piqued himself on his culture and europeanism generally in a rather french style because he had lived in europe for some yearsin exile he said however it was pretty well known that just before this exile he had incautiously gambled away all the cash in the custom house of a small port where a friend in power had procured for him the post of subcollector that youthful indiscretion had amongst other inconveniences obliged him to earn his living for a time as a cafe waiter in madrid but his talents must have been great after all since they had enabled him to retrieve his political fortunes so splendidly charles gould exposing his business with an imperturbable steadiness called him excellency  the provincial excellency assumed a weary superiority tilting his chair far back near an open window in the true costaguana manner the military band happened to be braying operatic selections on the plaza just then and twice he raised his hand imperatively for silence in order to listen to a favourite passage  exquisite delicious he murmured while charles gould waited standing by with inscrutable patience lucia lucia di lammermoor i am passionate for music it transports me ha the divinehamozart si divine    what is it you were saying  of course rumours had reached him already of the newcomers intentions besides he had received an official warning from sta marta his manner was intended simply to conceal his curiosity and impress his visitor but after he had locked up something valuable in the drawer of a large writingdesk in a distant part of the room he became very affable and walked back to his chair smartly  if you intend to build villages and assemble a population near the mine you shall require a decree of the minister of the interior for that he suggested in a businesslike manner  i have already sent a memorial said charles gould steadily and i reckon now confidently upon your excellencys favourable conclusions  the excellency was a man of many moods with the receipt of the money a great mellowness had descended upon his simple soul unexpectedly he fetched a deep sigh  ah don carlos what we want is advanced men like you in the province the lethargythe lethargy of these aristocrats the want of public spirit the absence of all enterprise i with my profound studies in europe you understand  with one hand thrust into his swelling bosom he rose and fell on his toes and for ten minutes almost without drawing breath went on hurling himself intellectually to the assault of charles goulds polite silence and when stopping abruptly he fell back into his chair it was as though he had been beaten off from a fortress to save his dignity he hastened to dismiss this silent man with a solemn inclination of the head and the words pronounced with moody fatigued condescension  you may depend upon my enlightened goodwill as long as your conduct as a good citizen deserves it  he took up a paper fan and began to cool himself with a consequential air while charles gould bowed and withdrew then he dropped the fan at once and stared with an appearance of wonder and perplexity at the closed door for quite a long time at last he shrugged his shoulders as if to assure himself of his disdain cold dull no intellectuality red hair a true englishman he despised him  his face darkened what meant this unimpressed and frigid behaviour he was the first of the successive politicians sent out from the capital to rule the occidental province whom the manner of charles gould in official intercourse was to strike as offensively independent  charles gould assumed that if the appearance of listening to deplorable balderdash must form part of the price he had to pay for being left unmolested the obligation of uttering balderdash personally was by no means included in the bargain he drew the line there to these provincial autocrats before whom the peaceable population of all classes had been accustomed to tremble the reserve of that englishlooking engineer caused an uneasiness which swung to and fro between cringing and truculence gradually all of them discovered that no matter what party was in power that man remained in most effective touch with the higher authorities in sta marta  this was a fact and it accounted perfectly for the goulds being by no means so wealthy as the engineerinchief on the new railway could legitimately suppose following the advice of don jose avellanos who was a man of good counsel though rendered timid by his horrible experiences of guzman bentos time charles gould had kept clear of the capital but in the current gossip of the foreign residents there he was known with a good deal of seriousness underlying the irony by the nickname of king of sulaco an advocate of the costaguana bar a man of reputed ability and good character member of the distinguished moraga family possessing extensive estates in the sulaco valley was pointed out to strangers with a shade of mystery and respect as the agent of the san tome minepolitical you know he was tall blackwhiskered and discreet it was known that he had easy access to ministers and that the numerous costaguana generals were always anxious to dine at his house presidents granted him audience with facility he corresponded actively with his maternal uncle don jose avellanos but his lettersunless those expressing formally his dutiful affectionwere seldom entrusted to the costaguana post office there the envelopes are opened indiscriminately with the frankness of a brazen and childish impudence characteristic of some spanishamerican governments but it must be noted that at about the time of the reopening of the san tome mine the muleteer who had been employed by charles gould in his preliminary travels on the campo added his small train of animals to the thin stream of traffic carried over the mountain passes between the sta marta upland and the valley of sulaco there are no travellers by that arduous and unsafe route unless under very exceptional circumstances and the state of inland trade did not visibly require additional transport facilities but the man seemed to find his account in it a few packages were always found for him whenever he took the road very brown and wooden in goatskin breeches with the hair outside he sat near the tail of his own smart mule his great hat turned against the sun an expression of blissful vacancy on his long face humming day after day a lovesong in a plaintive key or without a change of expression letting out a yell at his small tropilla in front a round little guitar hung high up on his back and there was a place scooped out artistically in the wood of one of his packsaddles where a tightly rolled piece of paper could be slipped in the wooden plug replaced and the coarse canvas nailed on again when in sulaco it was his practice to smoke and doze all day long as though he had no care in the world on a stone bench outside the doorway of the casa gould and facing the windows of the avellanos house years and years ago his mother had been chief laundrywoman in that familyvery accomplished in the matter of clearstarching he himself had been born on one of their haciendas his name was bonifacio and don jose crossing the street about five oclock to call on dona emilia always acknowledged his humble salute by some movement of hand or head the porters of both houses conversed lazily with him in tones of grave intimacy his evenings he devoted to gambling and to calls in a spirit of generous festivity upon the peyne doro girls in the more remote sidestreets of the town but he too was a discreet man    chapter eight  those of us whom business or curiosity took to sulaco in these years before the first advent of the railway can remember the steadying effect of the san tome mine upon the life of that remote province the outward appearances had not changed then as they have changed since as i am told with cable cars running along the streets of the constitution and carriage roads far into the country to rincon and other villages where the foreign merchants and the ricos generally have their modern villas and a vast railway goods yard by the harbour which has a quayside a long range of warehouses and quite serious organized labour troubles of its own  nobody had ever heard of labour troubles then the cargadores of the port formed indeed an unruly brotherhood of all sorts of scum with a patron saint of their own they went on strike regularly every bullfight day a form of trouble that even nostromo at the height of his prestige could never cope with efficiently but the morning after each fiesta before the indian marketwomen had opened their mat parasols on the plaza when the snows of higuerota gleamed pale over the town on a yet black sky the appearance of a phantomlike horseman mounted on a silvergrey mare solved the problem of labour without fail his steed paced the lanes of the slums and the weedgrown enclosures within the old ramparts between the black lightless cluster of huts like cowbyres like dogkennels the horseman hammered with the butt of a heavy revolver at the doors of low pulperias of obscene leanto sheds sloping against the tumbledown piece of a noble wall at the wooden sides of dwellings so flimsy that the sound of snores and sleepy mutters within could be heard in the pauses of the thundering clatter of his blows he called out mens names menacingly from the saddle once twice the drowsy answersgrumpy conciliating savage jocular or deprecatingcame out into the silent darkness in which the horseman sat still and presently a dark figure would flit out coughing in the still air sometimes a lowtoned woman cried through the windowhole softly hes coming directly senor and the horseman waited silent on a motionless horse but if perchance he had to dismount then after a while from the door of that hovel or of that pulperia with a ferocious scuffle and stifled imprecations a cargador would fly out head first and hands abroad to sprawl under the forelegs of the silvergrey mare who only pricked forward her sharp little ears she was used to that work and the man picking himself up would walk away hastily from nostromos revolver reeling a little along the street and snarling low curses at sunrise captain mitchell coming out anxiously in his night attire on to the wooden balcony running the whole length of the osn companys lonely building by the shore would see the lighters already under way figures moving busily about the cargo cranes perhaps hear the invaluable nostromo now dismounted and in the checked shirt and red sash of a mediterranean sailor bawling orders from the end of the jetty in a stentorian voice a fellow in a thousand  the material apparatus of perfected civilization which obliterates the individuality of old towns under the stereotyped conveniences of modern life had not intruded as yet but over the wornout antiquity of sulaco so characteristic with its stuccoed houses and barred windows with the great yellowywhite walls of abandoned convents behind the rows of sombre green cypresses that factvery modern in its spiritthe san tome mine had already thrown its subtle influence it had altered too the outward character of the crowds on feast days on the plaza before the open portal of the cathedral by the number of white ponchos with a green stripe affected as holiday wear by the san tome miners they had also adopted white hats with green cord and braidarticles of good quality which could be obtained in the storehouse of the administration for very little money a peaceable cholo wearing these colours unusual in costaguana was somehow very seldom beaten to within an inch of his life on a charge of disrespect to the town police neither ran he much risk of being suddenly lassoed on the road by a recruiting party of lancerosa method of voluntary enlistment looked upon as almost legal in the republic whole villages were known to have volunteered for the army in that way but as don pepe would say with a hopeless shrug to mrs gould what would you poor people pobrecitos pobrecitos but the state must have its soldiers  thus professionally spoke don pepe the fighter with pendent moustaches a nutbrown lean face and a clean run of a castiron jaw suggesting the type of a cattleherd horseman from the great llanos of the south if you will listen to an old officer of paez senores was the exordium of all his speeches in the aristocratic club of sulaco where he was admitted on account of his past services to the extinct cause of federation the club dating from the days of the proclamation of costaguanas independence boasted many names of liberators amongst its first founders suppressed arbitrarily innumerable times by various governments with memories of proscriptions and of at least one wholesale massacre of its members sadly assembled for a banquet by the order of a zealous military commandante their bodies were afterwards stripped naked and flung into the plaza out of the windows by the lowest scum of the populace it was again flourishing at that period peacefully it extended to strangers the large hospitality of the cool big rooms of its historic quarters in the front part of a house once the residence of a high official of the holy office the two wings shut up crumbled behind the nailed doors and what may be described as a grove of young orange trees grown in the unpaved patio concealed the utter ruin of the back part facing the gate you turned in from the street as if entering a secluded orchard where you came upon the foot of a disjointed staircase guarded by a mossstained effigy of some saintly bishop mitred and staffed and bearing the indignity of a broken nose meekly with his fine stone hands crossed on his breast the chocolatecoloured faces of servants with mops of black hair peeped at you from above the click of billiard balls came to your ears and ascending the steps you would perhaps see in the first sala very stiff upon a straightbacked chair in a good light don pepe moving his long moustaches as he spelt his way at arms length through an old sta marta newspaper his horsea stonyhearted but persevering black brute with a hammer headyou would have seen in the street dozing motionless under an immense saddle with its nose almost touching the curbstone of the sidewalk  don pepe when down from the mountain as the phrase often heard in sulaco went could also be seen in the drawingroom of the casa gould he sat with modest assurance at some distance from the teatable with his knees close together and a kindly twinkle of drollery in his deepset eyes he would throw his small and ironic pleasantries into the current of conversation there was in that man a sort of sane humorous shrewdness and a vein of genuine humanity so often found in simple old soldiers of proved courage who have seen much desperate service of course he knew nothing whatever of mining but his employment was of a special kind he was in charge of the whole population in the territory of the mine which extended from the head of the gorge to where the cart track from the foot of the mountain enters the plain crossing a stream over a little wooden bridge painted greengreen the colour of hope being also the colour of the mine  it was reported in sulaco that up there at the mountain don pepe walked about precipitous paths girt with a great sword and in a shabby uniform with tarnished bullion epaulettes of a senior major most miners being indians with big wild eyes addressed him as taita father as these barefooted people of costaguana will address anybody who wears shoes but it was basilio mr goulds own mozo and the head servant of the casa who in all good faith and from a sense of propriety announced him once in the solemn words el senor gobernador has arrived  don jose avellanos then in the drawingroom was delighted beyond measure at the aptness of the title with which he greeted the old major banteringly as soon as the latters soldierly figure appeared in the doorway don pepe only smiled in his long moustaches as much as to say you might have found a worse name for an old soldier  and el senor gobernador he had remained with his small jokes upon his function and upon his domain where he affirmed with humorous exaggeration to mrs gould  no two stones could come together anywhere without the gobernador hearing the click senora  and he would tap his ear with the tip of his forefinger knowingly even when the number of the miners alone rose to over six hundred he seemed to know each of them individually all the innumerable joses manuels ignacios from the villages primerosegundoor tercero there were three mining villages under his government he could distinguish them not only by their flat joyless faces which to mrs gould looked all alike as if run into the same ancestral mould of suffering and patience but apparently also by the infinitely graduated shades of reddishbrown of blackishbrown of copperybrown backs as the two shifts stripped to linen drawers and leather skullcaps mingled together with a confusion of naked limbs of shouldered picks swinging lamps in a great shuffle of sandalled feet on the open plateau before the entrance of the main tunnel it was a time of pause the indian boys leaned idly against the long line of little cradle wagons standing empty the screeners and orebreakers squatted on their heels smoking long cigars the great wooden shoots slanting over the edge of the tunnel plateau were silent and only the ceaseless violent rush of water in the open flumes could be heard murmuring fiercely with the splash and rumble of revolving turbinewheels and the thudding march of the stamps pounding to powder the treasure rock on the plateau below the heads of gangs distinguished by brass medals hanging on their bare breasts marshalled their squads and at last the mountain would swallow onehalf of the silent crowd while the other half would move off in long files down the zigzag paths leading to the bottom of the gorge it was deep and far below a thread of vegetation winding between the blazing rock faces resembled a slender green cord in which three lumpy knots of banana patches palmleaf roots and shady trees marked the village one village two village three housing the miners of the gould concession  whole families had been moving from the first towards the spot in the higuerota range whence the rumour of work and safety had spread over the pastoral campo forcing its way also even as the waters of a high flood into the nooks and crannies of the distant blue walls of the sierras father first in a pointed straw hat then the mother with the bigger children generally also a diminutive donkey all under burdens except the leader himself or perhaps some grown girl the pride of the family stepping barefooted and straight as an arrow with braids of raven hair a thick haughty profile and no load to carry but the small guitar of the country and a pair of soft leather sandals tied together on her back at the sight of such parties strung out on the cross trails between the pastures or camped by the side of the royal road travellers on horseback would remark to each other  more people going to the san tome mine we shall see others tomorrow  and spurring on in the dusk they would discuss the great news of the province the news of the san tome mine a rich englishman was going to work itand perhaps not an englishman quien sabe a foreigner with much money oh yes it had begun a party of men who had been to sulaco with a herd of black bulls for the next corrida had reported that from the porch of the posada in rincon only a short league from the town the lights on the mountain were visible twinkling above the trees and there was a woman seen riding a horse sideways not in the chair seat but upon a sort of saddle and a mans hat on her head she walked about too on foot up the mountain paths a woman engineer it seemed she was  what an absurdity impossible senor  si si una americana del norte  ah well if your worship is informed una americana it need be something of that sort  and they would laugh a little with astonishment and scorn keeping a wary eye on the shadows of the road for one is liable to meet bad men when travelling late on the campo  and it was not only the men that don pepe knew so well but he seemed able with one attentive thoughtful glance to classify each woman girl or growing youth of his domain it was only the small fry that puzzled him sometimes he and the padre could be seen frequently side by side meditative and gazing across the street of a village at a lot of sedate brown children trying to sort them out as it were in low consulting tones or else they would together put searching questions as to the parentage of some small staid urchin met wandering naked and grave along the road with a cigar in his baby mouth and perhaps his mothers rosary purloined for purposes of ornamentation hanging in a loop of beads low down on his rotund little stomach the spiritual and temporal pastors of the mine flock were very good friends with dr monygham the medical pastor who had accepted the charge from mrs gould and lived in the hospital building they were on not so intimate terms but no one could be on intimate terms with el senor doctor who with his twisted shoulders drooping head sardonic mouth and sidelong bitter glance was mysterious and uncanny the other two authorities worked in harmony father roman driedup small alert wrinkled with big round eyes a sharp chin and a great snufftaker was an old campaigner too he had shriven many simple souls on the battlefields of the republic kneeling by the dying on hillsides in the long grass in the gloom of the forests to hear the last confession with the smell of gunpowder smoke in his nostrils the rattle of muskets the hum and spatter of bullets in his ears and where was the harm if at the presbytery they had a game with a pack of greasy cards in the early evening before don pepe went his last rounds to see that all the watchmen of the minea body organized by himselfwere at their posts for that last duty before he slept don pepe did actually gird his old sword on the verandah of an unmistakable american white frame house which father roman called the presbytery near by a long low dark building steepleroofed like a vast barn with a wooden cross over the gable was the miners chapel there father roman said mass every day before a sombre altarpiece representing the resurrection the grey slab of the tombstone balanced on one corner a figure soaring upwards longlimbed and livid in an oval of pallid light and a helmeted brown legionary smitten down right across the bituminous foreground this picture my children muy linda e maravillosa father roman would say to some of his flock which you behold here through the munificence of the wife of our senor administrador has been painted in europe a country of saints and miracles and much greater than our costaguana and he would take a pinch of snuff with unction but when once an inquisitive spirit desired to know in what direction this europe was situated whether up or down the coast father roman to conceal his perplexity became very reserved and severe no doubt it is extremely far away but ignorant sinners like you of the san tome mine should think earnestly of everlasting punishment instead of inquiring into the magnitude of the earth with its countries and populations altogether beyond your understanding  with a goodnight padre goodnight don pepe the gobernador would go off holding up his sabre against his side his body bent forward with a long plodding stride in the dark the jocularity proper to an innocent card game for a few cigars or a bundle of yerba was replaced at once by the stern duty mood of an officer setting out to visit the outposts of an encamped army one loud blast of the whistle that hung from his neck provoked instantly a great shrilling of responding whistles mingled with the barking of dogs that would calm down slowly at last away up at the head of the gorge and in the stillness two serenos on guard by the bridge would appear walking noiselessly towards him on one side of the road a long frame buildingthe storewould be closed and barricaded from end to end facing it another white frame house still longer and with a verandahthe hospitalwould have lights in the two windows of dr monyghams quarters even the delicate foliage of a clump of pepper trees did not stir so breathless would be the darkness warmed by the radiation of the overheated rocks don pepe would stand still for a moment with the two motionless serenos before him and abruptly high up on the sheer face of the mountain dotted with single torches like drops of fire fallen from the two great blazing clusters of lights above the ore shoots would begin to rattle the great clattering shuffling noise gathering speed and weight would be caught up by the walls of the gorge and sent upon the plain in a growl of thunder the pasadero in rincon swore that on calm nights by listening intently he could catch the sound in his doorway as of a storm in the mountains  to charles goulds fancy it seemed that the sound must reach the uttermost limits of the province riding at night towards the mine it would meet him at the edge of a little wood just beyond rincon there was no mistaking the growling mutter of the mountain pouring its stream of treasure under the stamps and it came to his heart with the peculiar force of a proclamation thundered forth over the land and the marvellousness of an accomplished fact fulfilling an audacious desire he had heard this very sound in his imagination on that faroff evening when his wife and himself after a tortuous ride through a strip of forest had reined in their horses near the stream and had gazed for the first time upon the junglegrown solitude of the gorge the head of a palm rose here and there in a high ravine round the corner of the san tome mountain which is square like a blockhouse the thread of a slender waterfall flashed bright and glassy through the dark green of the heavy fronds of treeferns don pepe in attendance rode up and stretching his arm up the gorge had declared with mock solemnity behold the very paradise of snakes senora  and then they had wheeled their horses and ridden back to sleep that night at rincon the alcaldean old skinny moreno a sergeant of guzman bentos timehad cleared respectfully out of his house with his three pretty daughters to make room for the foreign senora and their worships the caballeros all he asked charles gould whom he took for a mysterious and official person to do for him was to remind the supreme governmentel gobierno supremeof a pension amounting to about a dollar a month to which he believed himself entitled it had been promised to him he affirmed straightening his bent back martially many years ago for my valour in the wars with the wild indios when a young man senor  the waterfall existed no longer the treeferns that had luxuriated in its spray had died around the driedup pool and the high ravine was only a big trench half filled up with the refuse of excavations and tailings the torrent dammed up above sent its water rushing along the open flumes of scooped tree trunks striding on trestlelegs to the turbines working the stamps on the lower plateauthe mesa grande of the san tome mountain only the memory of the waterfall with its amazing fernery like a hanging garden above the rocks of the gorge was preserved in mrs goulds watercolour sketch she had made it hastily one day from a cleared patch in the bushes sitting in the shade of a roof of straw erected for her on three rough poles under don pepes direction  mrs gould had seen it all from the beginning the clearing of the wilderness the making of the road the cutting of new paths up the cliff face of san tome for weeks together she had lived on the spot with her husband and she was so little in sulaco during that year that the appearance of the gould carriage on the alameda would cause a social excitement from the heavy family coaches full of stately senoras and blackeyed senoritas rolling solemnly in the shaded alley white hands were waved towards her with animation in a flutter of greetings dona emilia was down from the mountain  but not for long dona emilia would be gone up to the mountain in a day or two and her sleek carriage mules would have an easy time of it for another long spell she had watched the erection of the first framehouse put up on the lower mesa for an office and don pepes quarters she heard with a thrill of thankful emotion the first wagon load of ore rattle down the then only shoot she had stood by her husbands side perfectly silent and gone cold all over with excitement at the instant when the first battery of only fifteen stamps was put in motion for the first time on the occasion when the fires under the first set of retorts in their shed had glowed far into the night she did not retire to rest on the rough cadre set up for her in the as yet bare framehouse till she had seen the first spongy lump of silver yielded to the hazards of the world by the dark depths of the gould concession she had laid her unmercenary hands with an eagerness that made them tremble upon the first silver ingot turned out still warm from the mould and by her imaginative estimate of its power she endowed that lump of metal with a justificative conception as though it were not a mere fact but something farreaching and impalpable like the true expression of an emotion or the emergence of a principle  don pepe extremely interested too looked over her shoulder with a smile that making longitudinal folds on his face caused it to resemble a leathern mask with a benignantly diabolic expression  would not the muchachos of hernandez like to get hold of this insignificant object that looks por dios very much like a piece of tin he remarked jocularly  hernandez the robber had been an inoffensive small ranchero kidnapped with circumstances of peculiar atrocity from his home during one of the civil wars and forced to serve in the army there his conduct as soldier was exemplary till watching his chance he killed his colonel and managed to get clear away with a band of deserters who chose him for their chief he had taken refuge beyond the wild and waterless bolson de tonoro the haciendas paid him blackmail in cattle and horses extraordinary stories were told of his powers and of his wonderful escapes from capture he used to ride singlehanded into the villages and the little towns on the campo driving a pack mule before him with two revolvers in his belt go straight to the shop or store select what he wanted and ride away unopposed because of the terror his exploits and his audacity inspired poor country people he usually left alone the upper class were often stopped on the roads and robbed but any unlucky official that fell into his hands was sure to get a severe flogging the army officers did not like his name to be mentioned in their presence his followers mounted on stolen horses laughed at the pursuit of the regular cavalry sent to hunt them down and whom they took pleasure to ambush most scientifically in the broken ground of their own fastness expeditions had been fitted out a price had been put upon his head even attempts had been made treacherously of course to open negotiations with him without in the slightest way affecting the even tenor of his career at last in true costaguana fashion the fiscal of tonoro who was ambitious of the glory of having reduced the famous hernandez offered him a sum of money and a safe conduct out of the country for the betrayal of his band but hernandez evidently was not of the stuff of which the distinguished military politicians and conspirators of costaguana are made this clever but common device which frequently works like a charm in putting down revolutions failed with the chief of vulgar salteadores it promised well for the fiscal at first but ended very badly for the squadron of lanceros posted by the fiscals directions in a fold of the ground into which hernandez had promised to lead his unsuspecting followers they came indeed at the appointed time but creeping on their hands and knees through the bush and only let their presence be known by a general discharge of firearms which emptied many saddles the troopers who escaped came riding very hard into tonoro it is said that their commanding officer who being better mounted rode far ahead of the rest afterwards got into a state of despairing intoxication and beat the ambitious fiscal severely with the flat of his sabre in the presence of his wife and daughters for bringing this disgrace upon the national army the highest civil official of tonoro falling to the ground in a swoon was further kicked all over the body and rowelled with sharp spurs about the neck and face because of the great sensitiveness of his military colleague this gossip of the inland campo so characteristic of the rulers of the country with its story of oppression inefficiency fatuous methods treachery and savage brutality was perfectly known to mrs gould that it should be accepted with no indignant comment by people of intelligence refinement and character as something inherent in the nature of things was one of the symptoms of degradation that had the power to exasperate her almost to the verge of despair still looking at the ingot of silver she shook her head at don pepes remark  if it had not been for the lawless tyranny of your government don pepe many an outlaw now with hernandez would be living peaceably and happy by the honest work of his hands  senora cried don pepe with enthusiasm it is true it is as if god had given you the power to look into the very breasts of people you have seen them working round you dona emiliameek as lambs patient like their own burros brave like lions i have led them to the very muzzles of gunsi who stand here before you senorain the time of paez who was full of generosity and in courage only approached by the uncle of don carlos here as far as i know no wonder there are bandits in the campo when there are none but thieves swindlers and sanguinary macaques to rule us in sta marta however all the same a bandit is a bandit and we shall have a dozen good straight winchesters to ride with the silver down to sulaco  mrs goulds ride with the first silver escort to sulaco was the closing episode of what she called my camp life before she had settled in her townhouse permanently as was proper and even necessary for the wife of the administrator of such an important institution as the san tome mine for the san tome mine was to become an institution a rallying point for everything in the province that needed order and stability to live security seemed to flow upon this land from the mountaingorge the authorities of sulaco had learned that the san tome mine could make it worth their while to leave things and people alone this was the nearest approach to the rule of commonsense and justice charles gould felt it possible to secure at first in fact the mine with its organization its population growing fiercely attached to their position of privileged safety with its armoury with its don pepe with its armed body of serenos where it was said many an outlaw and deserterand even some members of hernandezs bandhad found a place the mine was a power in the land as a certain prominent man in sta marta had exclaimed with a hollow laugh once when discussing the line of action taken by the sulaco authorities at a time of political crisis  you call these men government officials they never they are officials of the mineofficials of the concessioni tell you  the prominent man who was then a person in power with a lemoncoloured face and a very short and curly not to say woolly head of hair went so far in his temporary discontent as to shake his yellow fist under the nose of his interlocutor and shriek  yes all silence all i tell you the political gefe the chief of the police the chief of the customs the general all all are the officials of that gould  thereupon an intrepid but low and argumentative murmur would flow on for a space in the ministerial cabinet and the prominent mans passion would end in a cynical shrug of the shoulders after all he seemed to say what did it matter as long as the minister himself was not forgotten during his brief day of authority but all the same the unofficial agent of the san tome mine working for a good cause had his moments of anxiety which were reflected in his letters to don jose avellanos his maternal uncle  no sanguinary macaque from sta marta shall set foot on that part of costaguana which lies beyond the san tome bridge don pepe used to assure mrs gould except of course as an honoured guestfor our senor administrador is a deep politico but to charles gould in his own room the old major would remark with a grim and soldierly cheeriness we are all playing our heads at this game  don jose avellanos would mutter imperium in imperio emilia my soul with an air of profound selfsatisfaction which somehow in a curious way seemed to contain a queer admixture of bodily discomfort but that perhaps could only be visible to the initiated and for the initiated it was a wonderful place this drawingroom of the casa gould with its momentary glimpses of the masterel senor administradorolder harder mysteriously silent with the lines deepened on his english ruddy outofdoors complexion flitting on his thin cavalrymans legs across the doorways either just back from the mountain or with jingling spurs and ridingwhip under his arm on the point of starting for the mountain then don pepe modestly martial in his chair the llanero who seemed somehow to have found his martial jocularity his knowledge of the world and his manner perfect for his station in the midst of savage armed contests with his kind avellanos polished and familiar the diplomatist with his loquacity covering much caution and wisdom in delicate advice with his manuscript of a historical work on costaguana entitled fifty years of misrule which at present he thought it was not prudent even if it were possible to give to the world these three and also dona emilia amongst them gracious small and fairylike before the glittering teaset with one common masterthought in their heads with one common feeling of a tense situation with one everpresent aim to preserve the inviolable character of the mine at every cost and there was also to be seen captain mitchell a little apart near one of the long windows with an air of oldfashioned neat old bachelorhood about him slightly pompous in a white waistcoat a little disregarded and unconscious of it utterly in the dark and imagining himself to be in the thick of things the good man having spent a clear thirty years of his life on the high seas before getting what he called a shore billet was astonished at the importance of transactions other than relating to shipping which take place on dry land almost every event out of the usual daily course marked an epoch for him or else was history unless with his pomposity struggling with a discomfited droop of his rubicund rather handsome face set off by snowwhite close hair and short whiskers he would mutter  ah that that sir was a mistake  the reception of the first consignment of san tome silver for shipment to san francisco in one of the osn cos mailboats had of course marked an epoch for captain mitchell the ingots packed in boxes of stiff oxhide with plaited handles small enough to be carried easily by two men were brought down by the serenos of the mine walking in careful couples along the halfmile or so of steep zigzag paths to the foot of the mountain there they would be loaded into a string of twowheeled carts resembling roomy coffers with a door at the back and harnessed tandem with two mules each waiting under the guard of armed and mounted serenos don pepe padlocked each door in succession and at the signal of his whistle the string of carts would move off closely surrounded by the clank of spur and carbine with jolts and cracking of whips with a sudden deep rumble over the boundary bridge into the land of thieves and sanguinary macaques don pepe defined that crossing hats bobbing in the first light of the dawn on the heads of cloaked figures winchesters on hip bridle hands protruding lean and brown from under the falling folds of the ponchos the convoy skirting a little wood along the mine trail between the mud huts and low walls of rincon increased its pace on the camino real mules urged to speed escort galloping don carlos riding alone ahead of a dust storm affording a vague vision of long ears of mules of fluttering little green and white flags stuck upon each cart of raised arms in a mob of sombreros with the white gleam of ranging eyes and don pepe hardly visible in the rear of that rattling dust trail with a stiff seat and impassive face rising and falling rhythmically on an ewenecked silverbitted black brute with a hammer head  the sleepy people in the little clusters of huts in the small ranches near the road recognized by the headlong sound the charge of the san tome silver escort towards the crumbling wall of the city on the campo side they came to the doors to see it dash by over ruts and stones with a clatter and clank and cracking of whips with the reckless rush and precise driving of a field battery hurrying into action and the solitary english figure of the senor administrador riding far ahead in the lead  in the fenced roadside paddocks loose horses galloped wildly for a while the heavy cattle stood up breast deep in the grass lowing mutteringly at the flying noise a meek indian villager would glance back once and hasten to shove his loaded little donkey bodily against a wall out of the way of the san tome silver escort going to the sea a small knot of chilly leperos under the stone horse of the alameda would mutter caramba on seeing it take a wide curve at a gallop and dart into the empty street of the constitution for it was considered the correct thing the only proper style by the muledrivers of the san tome mine to go through the waking town from end to end without a check in the speed as if chased by a devil  the early sunshine glowed on the delicate primrose pale pink pale blue fronts of the big houses with all their gates shut yet and no face behind the iron bars of the windows in the whole sunlit range of empty balconies along the street only one white figure would be visible high up above the clear pavementthe wife of the senor administradorleaning over to see the escort go by to the harbour a mass of heavy fair hair twisted up negligently on her little head and a lot of lace about the neck of her muslin wrapper with a smile to her husbands single quick upward glance she would watch the whole thing stream past below her feet with an orderly uproar till she answered by a friendly sign the salute of the galloping don pepe the stiff deferential inclination with a sweep of the hat below the knee  the string of padlocked carts lengthened the size of the escort grew bigger as the years went on every three months an increasing stream of treasure swept through the streets of sulaco on its way to the strong room in the osn cos building by the harbour there to await shipment for the north increasing in volume and of immense value also for as charles gould told his wife once with some exultation there had never been seen anything in the world to approach the vein of the gould concession for them both each passing of the escort under the balconies of the casa gould was like another victory gained in the conquest of peace for sulaco  no doubt the initial action of charles gould had been helped at the beginning by a period of comparative peace which occurred just about that time and also by the general softening of manners as compared with the epoch of civil wars whence had emerged the iron tyranny of guzman bento of fearful memory in the contests that broke out at the end of his rule which had kept peace in the country for a whole fifteen years there was more fatuous imbecility plenty of cruelty and suffering still but much less of the oldtime fierce and blindly ferocious political fanaticism it was all more vile more base more contemptible and infinitely more manageable in the very outspoken cynicism of motives it was more clearly a brazenfaced scramble for a constantly diminishing quantity of booty since all enterprise had been stupidly killed in the land thus it came to pass that the province of sulaco once the field of cruel party vengeances had become in a way one of the considerable prizes of political career the great of the earth in sta marta reserved the posts in the old occidental state to those nearest and dearest to them nephews brothers husbands of favourite sisters bosom friends trusty supportersor prominent supporters of whom perhaps they were afraid it was the blessed province of great opportunities and of largest salaries for the san tome mine had its own unofficial pay list whose items and amounts fixed in consultation by charles gould and senor avellanos were known to a prominent business man in the united states who for twenty minutes or so in every month gave his undivided attention to sulaco affairs at the same time the material interests of all sorts backed up by the influence of the san tome mine were quietly gathering substance in that part of the republic if for instance the sulaco collectorship was generally understood in the political world of the capital to open the way to the ministry of finance and so on for every official post then on the other hand the despondent business circles of the republic had come to consider the occidental province as the promised land of safety especially if a man managed to get on good terms with the administration of the mine charles gould excellent fellow absolutely necessary to make sure of him before taking a single step get an introduction to him from moraga if you canthe agent of the king of sulaco dont you know  no wonder then that sir john coming from europe to smooth the path for his railway had been meeting the name and even the nickname of charles gould at every turn in costaguana the agent of the san tome administration in sta marta a polished wellinformed gentleman sir john thought him had certainly helped so greatly in bringing about the presidential tour that he began to think that there was something in the faint whispers hinting at the immense occult influence of the gould concession what was currently whispered was thisthat the san tome administration had in part at least financed the last revolution which had brought into a fiveyear dictatorship don vincente ribiera a man of culture and of unblemished character invested with a mandate of reform by the best elements of the state serious wellinformed men seemed to believe the fact to hope for better things for the establishment of legality of good faith and order in public life so much the better then thought sir john he worked always on a great scale there was a loan to the state and a project for systematic colonization of the occidental province involved in one vast scheme with the construction of the national central railway good faith order honesty peace were badly wanted for this great development of material interests anybody on the side of these things and especially if able to help had an importance in sir johns eyes he had not been disappointed in the king of sulaco the local difficulties had fallen away as the engineerinchief had foretold they would before charles goulds mediation sir john had been extremely feted in sulaco next to the presidentdictator a fact which might have accounted for the evident illhumour general montero displayed at lunch given on board the juno just before she was to sail taking away from sulaco the presidentdictator and the distinguished foreign guests in his train  the excellentissimo the hope of honest men as don jose had addressed him in a public speech delivered in the name of the provincial assembly of sulaco sat at the head of the long table captain mitchell positively stonyeyed and purple in the face with the solemnity of this historical event occupied the foot as the representative of the osn company in sulaco the hosts of that informal function with the captain of the ship and some minor officials from the shore around him those cheery swarthy little gentlemen cast jovial sideglances at the bottles of champagne beginning to pop behind the guests backs in the hands of the ships stewards the amber wine creamed up to the rims of the glasses  charles gould had his place next to a foreign envoy who in a listless undertone had been talking to him fitfully of hunting and shooting the wellnourished pale face with an eyeglass and drooping yellow moustache made the senor administrador appear by contrast twice as sunbaked more flaming red a hundred times more intensely and silently alive don jose avellanos touched elbows with the other foreign diplomat a dark man with a quiet watchful selfconfident demeanour and a touch of reserve all etiquette being laid aside on the occasion general montero was the only one there in full uniform so stiff with embroideries in front that his broad chest seemed protected by a cuirass of gold sir john at the beginning had got away from high places for the sake of sitting near mrs gould  the great financier was trying to express to her his grateful sense of her hospitality and of his obligation to her husbands enormous influence in this part of the country when she interrupted him by a low hush the president was going to make an informal pronouncement  the excellentissimo was on his legs he said only a few words evidently deeply felt and meant perhaps mostly for avellanoshis old friendas to the necessity of unremitting effort to secure the lasting welfare of the country emerging after this last struggle he hoped into a period of peace and material prosperity  mrs gould listening to the mellow slightly mournful voice looking at this rotund dark spectacled face at the short body obese to the point of infirmity thought that this man of delicate and melancholy mind physically almost a cripple coming out of his retirement into a dangerous strife at the call of his fellows had the right to speak with the authority of his selfsacrifice and yet she was made uneasy he was more pathetic than promising this first civilian chief of the state costaguana had ever known pronouncing glass in hand his simple watchwords of honesty peace respect for law political good faith abroad and at homethe safeguards of national honour  he sat down during the respectful appreciative buzz of voices that followed the speech general montero raised a pair of heavy drooping eyelids and rolled his eyes with a sort of uneasy dullness from face to face the military backwoods hero of the party though secretly impressed by the sudden novelties and splendours of his position he had never been on board a ship before and had hardly ever seen the sea except from a distance understood by a sort of instinct the advantage his surly unpolished attitude of a savage fighter gave him amongst all these refined blanco aristocrats but why was it that nobody was looking at him he wondered to himself angrily he was able to spell out the print of newspapers and knew that he had performed the greatest military exploit of modern times  my husband wanted the railway mrs gould said to sir john in the general murmur of resumed conversations all this brings nearer the sort of future we desire for the country which has waited for it in sorrow long enough god knows but i will confess that the other day during my afternoon drive when i suddenly saw an indian boy ride out of a wood with the red flag of a surveying party in his hand i felt something of a shock the future means changean utter change and yet even here there are simple and picturesque things that one would like to preserve  sir john listened smiling but it was his turn now to hush mrs gould  general montero is going to speak he whispered and almost immediately added in comic alarm heavens hes going to propose my own health i believe  general montero had risen with a jingle of steel scabbard and a ripple of glitter on his goldembroidered breast a heavy swordhilt appeared at his side above the edge of the table in this gorgeous uniform with his bull neck his hooked nose flattened on the tip upon a blueblack dyed moustache he looked like a disguised and sinister vaquero the drone of his voice had a strangely rasping soulless ring he floundered lowering through a few vague sentences then suddenly raising his big head and his voice together burst out harshly  the honour of the country is in the hands of the army i assure you i shall be faithful to it he hesitated till his roaming eyes met sir johns face upon which he fixed a lurid sleepy glance and the figure of the lately negotiated loan came into his mind he lifted his glass i drink to the health of the man who brings us a million and a half of pounds  he tossed off his champagne and sat down heavily with a halfsurprised halfbullying look all round the faces in the profound as if appalled silence which succeeded the felicitous toast sir john did not move  i dont think i am called upon to rise he murmured to mrs gould that sort of thing speaks for itself but don jose avellanos came to the rescue with a short oration in which he alluded pointedly to englands goodwill towards costaguanaa goodwill he continued significantly of which i having been in my time accredited to the court of st james am able to speak with some knowledge  only then sir john thought fit to respond which he did gracefully in bad french punctuated by bursts of applause and the hear hears of captain mitchell who was able to understand a word now and then directly he had done the financier of railways turned to mrs gould  you were good enough to say that you intended to ask me for something he reminded her gallantly what is it be assured that any request from you would be considered in the light of a favour to myself  she thanked him by a gracious smile everybody was rising from the table  let us go on deck she proposed where ill be able to point out to you the very object of my request  an enormous national flag of costaguana diagonal red and yellow with two green palm trees in the middle floated lazily at the mainmast head of the juno a multitude of fireworks being let off in their thousands at the waters edge in honour of the president kept up a mysterious crepitating noise half round the harbour now and then a lot of rockets swishing upwards invisibly detonated overhead with only a puff of smoke in the bright sky crowds of people could be seen between the town gate and the harbour under the bunches of multicoloured flags fluttering on tall poles faint bursts of military music would be heard suddenly and the remote sound of shouting a knot of ragged negroes at the end of the wharf kept on loading and firing a small iron cannon time after time a greyish haze of dust hung thin and motionless against the sun  don vincente ribiera made a few steps under the deckawning leaning on the arm of senor avellanos a wide circle was formed round him where the mirthless smile of his dark lips and the sightless glitter of his spectacles could be seen turning amiably from side to side the informal function arranged on purpose on board the juno to give the presidentdictator an opportunity to meet intimately some of his most notable adherents in sulaco was drawing to an end on one side general montero his bald head covered now by a plumed cocked hat remained motionless on a skylight seat a pair of big gauntleted hands folded on the hilt of the sabre standing upright between his legs the white plume the coppery tint of his broad face the blueblack of the moustaches under the curved beak the mass of gold on sleeves and breast the high shining boots with enormous spurs the working nostrils the imbecile and domineering stare of the glorious victor of rio seco had in them something ominous and incredible the exaggeration of a cruel caricature the fatuity of solemn masquerading the atrocious grotesqueness of some military idol of aztec conception and european bedecking awaiting the homage of worshippers don jose approached diplomatically this weird and inscrutable portent and mrs gould turned her fascinated eyes away at last  charles coming up to take leave of sir john heard him say as he bent over his wifes hand certainly of course my dear mrs gould for a protege of yours not the slightest difficulty consider it done  going ashore in the same boat with the goulds don jose avellanos was very silent even in the gould carriage he did not open his lips for a long time the mules trotted slowly away from the wharf between the extended hands of the beggars who for that day seemed to have abandoned in a body the portals of churches charles gould sat on the back seat and looked away upon the plain a multitude of booths made of green boughs of rushes of odd pieces of plank eked out with bits of canvas had been erected all over it for the sale of cana of dulces of fruit of cigars over little heaps of glowing charcoal indian women squatting on mats cooked food in black earthen pots and boiled the water for the mate gourds which they offered in soft caressing voices to the country people a racecourse had been staked out for the vaqueros and away to the left from where the crowd was massed thickly about a huge temporary erection like a circus tent of wood with a conical grass roof came the resonant twanging of harp strings the sharp ping of guitars with the grave drumming throb of an indian gombo pulsating steadily through the shrill choruses of the dancers  charles gould said presently  all this piece of land belongs now to the railway company there will be no more popular feasts held here  mrs gould was rather sorry to think so she took this opportunity to mention how she had just obtained from sir john the promise that the house occupied by giorgio viola should not be interfered with she declared she could never understand why the survey engineers ever talked of demolishing that old building it was not in the way of the projected harbour branch of the line in the least  she stopped the carriage before the door to reassure at once the old genoese who came out bareheaded and stood by the carriage step she talked to him in italian of course and he thanked her with calm dignity an old garibaldino was grateful to her from the bottom of his heart for keeping the roof over the heads of his wife and children he was too old to wander any more  and is it for ever signora he asked  for as long as you like  bene then the place must be named it was not worth while before  he smiled ruggedly with a running together of wrinkles at the corners of his eyes i shall set about the painting of the name tomorrow  and what is it going to be giorgio  albergo ditalia una said the old garibaldino looking away for a moment more in memory of those who have died he added than for the country stolen from us soldiers of liberty by the craft of that accursed piedmontese race of kings and ministers  mrs gould smiled slightly and bending over a little began to inquire about his wife and children he had sent them into town on that day the padrona was better in health many thanks to the signora for inquiring  people were passing in twos and threes in whole parties of men and women attended by trotting children a horseman mounted on a silvergrey mare drew rein quietly in the shade of the house after taking off his hat to the party in the carriage who returned smiles and familiar nods old viola evidently very pleased with the news he had just heard interrupted himself for a moment to tell him rapidly that the house was secured by the kindness of the english signora for as long as he liked to keep it the other listened attentively but made no response  when the carriage moved on he took off his hat again a grey sombrero with a silver cord and tassels the bright colours of a mexican serape twisted on the cantle the enormous silver buttons on the embroidered leather jacket the row of tiny silver buttons down the seam of the trousers the snowy linen a silk sash with embroidered ends the silver plates on headstall and saddle proclaimed the unapproachable style of the famous capataz de cargadoresa mediterranean sailorgot up with more finished splendour than any welltodo young ranchero of the campo had ever displayed on a high holiday  it is a great thing for me murmured old giorgio still thinking of the house for now he had grown weary of change the signora just said a word to the englishman  the old englishman who has enough money to pay for a railway he is going off in an hour remarked nostromo carelessly buon viaggio then ive guarded his bones all the way from the entrada pass down to the plain and into sulaco as though he had been my own father  old giorgio only moved his head sideways absently nostromo pointed after the goulds carriage nearing the grassgrown gate in the old town wall that was like a wall of matted jungle  and i have sat alone at night with my revolver in the companys warehouse time and again by the side of that other englishmans heap of silver guarding it as though it had been my own  viola seemed lost in thought it is a great thing for me he repeated again as if to himself  it is agreed the magnificent capataz de cargadores calmly listen vecchiogo in and bring me out a cigar but dont look for it in my room theres nothing there  viola stepped into the cafe and came out directly still absorbed in his idea and tendered him a cigar mumbling thoughtfully in his moustache children growing upand girls too girls he sighed and fell silent  what only one remarked nostromo looking down with a sort of comic inquisitiveness at the unconscious old man no matter he added with lofty negligence one is enough till another is wanted  he lit it and let the match drop from his passive fingers giorgio viola looked up and said abruptly  my son would have been just such a fine young man as you gian battista if he had lived  what your son but you are right padrone if he had been like me he would have been a man  he turned his horse slowly and paced on between the booths checking the mare almost to a standstill now and then for children for the groups of people from the distant campo who stared after him with admiration the companys lightermen saluted him from afar and the greatly envied capataz de cargadores advanced amongst murmurs of recognition and obsequious greetings towards the huge circuslike erection the throng thickened the guitars tinkled louder other horsemen sat motionless smoking calmly above the heads of the crowd it eddied and pushed before the doors of the highroofed building whence issued a shuffle and thumping of feet in time to the dance music vibrating and shrieking with a racking rhythm overhung by the tremendous sustained hollow roar of the gombo the barbarous and imposing noise of the big drum that can madden a crowd and that even europeans cannot hear without a strange emotion seemed to draw nostromo on to its source while a man wrapped up in a faded torn poncho walked by his stirrup and buffeted right and left begged his worship insistently for employment on the wharf he whined offering the senor capataz half his daily pay for the privilege of being admitted to the swaggering fraternity of cargadores the other half would be enough for him he protested but captain mitchells righthand maninvaluable for our worka perfectly incorruptible fellowafter looking down critically at the ragged mozo shook his head without a word in the uproar going on around  the man fell back and a little further on nostromo had to pull up from the doors of the dance hall men and women emerged tottering streaming with sweat trembling in every limb to lean panting with staring eyes and parted lips against the wall of the structure where the harps and guitars played on with mad speed in an incessant roll of thunder hundreds of hands clapped in there voices shrieked and then all at once would sink low chanting in unison the refrain of a love song with a dying fall a red flower flung with a good aim from somewhere in the crowd struck the resplendent capataz on the cheek  he caught it as it fell neatly but for some time did not turn his head when at last he condescended to look round the throng near him had parted to make way for a pretty morenita her hair held up by a small golden comb who was walking towards him in the open space  her arms and neck emerged plump and bare from a snowy chemisette the blue woollen skirt with all the fullness gathered in front scanty on the hips and tight across the back disclosed the provoking action of her walk she came straight on and laid her hand on the mares neck with a timid coquettish look upwards out of the corner of her eyes  querido she murmured caressingly why do you pretend not to see me when i pass  because i dont love thee any more said nostromo deliberately after a moment of reflective silence  the hand on the mares neck trembled suddenly she dropped her head before all the eyes in the wide circle formed round the generous the terrible the inconstant capataz de cargadores and his morenita  nostromo looking down saw tears beginning to fall down her face  has it come then ever beloved of my heart she whispered is it true  no said nostromo looking away carelessly it was a lie i love thee as much as ever  is that true she cooed joyously her cheeks still wet with tears  it is true  true on the life  as true as that but thou must not ask me to swear it on the madonna that stands in thy room and the capataz laughed a little in response to the grins of the crowd  she poutedvery prettya little uneasy  no i will not ask for that i can see love in your eyes she laid her hand on his knee why are you trembling like this from love she continued while the cavernous thundering of the gombo went on without a pause but if you love her as much as that you must give your paquita a goldmounted rosary of beads for the neck of her madonna  no said nostromo looking into her uplifted begging eyes which suddenly turned stony with surprise  no then what else will your worship give me on the day of the fiesta she asked angrily so as not to shame me before all these people  there is no shame for thee in getting nothing from thy lover for once  true the shame is your worshipsmy poor lovers she flared up sarcastically  laughs were heard at her anger at her retort what an audacious spitfire she was the people aware of this scene were calling out urgently to others in the crowd the circle round the silvergrey mare narrowed slowly  the girl went off a pace or two confronting the mocking curiosity of the eyes then flung back to the stirrup tiptoeing her enraged face turned up to nostromo with a pair of blazing eyes he bent low to her in the saddle  juan she hissed i could stab thee to the heart  the dreaded capataz de cargadores magnificent and carelessly public in his amours flung his arm round her neck and kissed her spluttering lips a murmur went round  a knife he demanded at large holding her firmly by the shoulder  twenty blades flashed out together in the circle a young man in holiday attire bounding in thrust one in nostromos hand and bounded back into the ranks very proud of himself nostromo had not even looked at him  stand on my foot he commanded the girl who suddenly subdued rose lightly and when he had her up encircling her waist her face near to his he pressed the knife into her little hand  no morenita you shall not put me to shame he said you shall have your present and so that everyone should know who is your lover today you may cut all the silver buttons off my coat  there were shouts of laughter and applause at this witty freak while the girl passed the keen blade and the impassive rider jingled in his palm the increasing hoard of silver buttons he eased her to the ground with both her hands full after whispering for a while with a very strenuous face she walked away staring haughtily and vanished into the crowd  the circle had broken up and the lordly capataz de cargadores the indispensable man the tried and trusty nostromo the mediterranean sailor come ashore casually to try his luck in costaguana rode slowly towards the harbour the juno was just then swinging round and even as nostromo reined up again to look on a flag ran up on the improvised flagstaff erected in an ancient and dismantled little fort at the harbour entrance half a battery of field guns had been hurried over there from the sulaco barracks for the purpose of firing the regulation salutes for the presidentdictator and the war minister as the mailboat headed through the pass the badly timed reports announced the end of don vincente ribieras first official visit to sulaco and for captain mitchell the end of another historic occasion next time when the hope of honest men was to come that way a year and a half later it was unofficially over the mountain tracks fleeing after a defeat on a lame mule to be only just saved by nostromo from an ignominious death at the hands of a mob it was a very different event of which captain mitchell used to say  it was historyhistory sir and that fellow of mine nostromo you know was right in it absolutely making history sir  but this event creditable to nostromo was to lead immediately to another which could not be classed either as history or as a mistake in captain mitchells phraseology he had another word for it  sir he used to say afterwards that was no mistake it was a fatality a misfortune pure and simple sir and that poor fellow of mine was right in itright in the middle of it a fatality if ever there was oneand to my mind he has never been the same man since      part second the isabels   chapter one  through good and evil report in the varying fortune of that struggle which don jose had characterized in the phrase the fate of national honesty trembles in the balance the gould concession imperium in imperio had gone on working the square mountain had gone on pouring its treasure down the wooden shoots to the unresting batteries of stamps the lights of san tome had twinkled night after night upon the great limitless shadow of the campo every three months the silver escort had gone down to the sea as if neither the war nor its consequences could ever affect the ancient occidental state secluded beyond its high barrier of the cordillera all the fighting took place on the other side of that mighty wall of serrated peaks lorded over by the white dome of higuerota and as yet unbreached by the railway of which only the first part the easy campo part from sulaco to the ivie valley at the foot of the pass had been laid neither did the telegraph line cross the mountains yet its poles like slender beacons on the plain penetrated into the forest fringe of the foothills cut by the deep avenue of the track and its wire ended abruptly in the construction camp at a white deal table supporting a morse apparatus in a long hut of planks with a corrugated iron roof overshadowed by gigantic cedar treesthe quarters of the engineer in charge of the advance section  the harbour was busy too with the traffic in railway material and with the movements of troops along the coast the osn company found much occupation for its fleet costaguana had no navy and apart from a few coastguard cutters there were no national ships except a couple of old merchant steamers used as transports  captain mitchell feeling more and more in the thick of history found time for an hour or so during an afternoon in the drawingroom of the casa gould where with a strange ignorance of the real forces at work around him he professed himself delighted to get away from the strain of affairs he did not know what he would have done without his invaluable nostromo he declared those confounded costaguana politics gave him more workhe confided to mrs gouldthan he had bargained for  don jose avellanos had displayed in the service of the endangered ribiera government an organizing activity and an eloquence of which the echoes reached even europe for after the new loan to the ribiera government europe had become interested in costaguana the sala of the provincial assembly in the municipal buildings of sulaco with its portraits of the liberators on the walls and an old flag of cortez preserved in a glass case above the presidents chair had heard all these speechesthe early one containing the impassioned declaration militarism is the enemy the famous one of the trembling balance delivered on the occasion of the vote for the raising of a second sulaco regiment in the defence of the reforming government and when the provinces again displayed their old flags proscribed in guzman bentos time there was another of those great orations when don jose greeted these old emblems of the war of independence brought out again in the name of new ideals the old idea of federalism had disappeared for his part he did not wish to revive old political doctrines they were perishable they died but the doctrine of political rectitude was immortal the second sulaco regiment to whom he was presenting this flag was going to show its valour in a contest for order peace progress for the establishment of national selfrespect without whichhe declared with energywe are a reproach and a byword amongst the powers of the world  don jose avellanos loved his country he had served it lavishly with his fortune during his diplomatic career and the later story of his captivity and barbarous illusage under guzman bento was well known to his listeners it was a wonder that he had not been a victim of the ferocious and summary executions which marked the course of that tyranny for guzman had ruled the country with the sombre imbecility of political fanaticism the power of supreme government had become in his dull mind an object of strange worship as if it were some sort of cruel deity it was incarnated in himself and his adversaries the federalists were the supreme sinners objects of hate abhorrence and fear as heretics would be to a convinced inquisitor for years he had carried about at the tail of the army of pacification all over the country a captive band of such atrocious criminals who considered themselves most unfortunate at not having been summarily executed it was a diminishing company of nearly naked skeletons loaded with irons covered with dirt with vermin with raw wounds all men of position of education of wealth who had learned to fight amongst themselves for scraps of rotten beef thrown to them by soldiers or to beg a negro cook for a drink of muddy water in pitiful accents don jose avellanos clanking his chains amongst the others seemed only to exist in order to prove how much hunger pain degradation and cruel torture a human body can stand without parting with the last spark of life sometimes interrogatories backed by some primitive method of torture were administered to them by a commission of officers hastily assembled in a hut of sticks and branches and made pitiless by the fear for their own lives a lucky one or two of that spectral company of prisoners would perhaps be led tottering behind a bush to be shot by a file of soldiers always an army chaplainsome unshaven dirty man girt with a sword and with a tiny cross embroidered in white cotton on the left breast of a lieutenants uniformwould follow cigarette in the corner of the mouth wooden stool in hand to hear the confession and give absolution for the citizen saviour of the country guzman bento was called thus officially in petitions was not averse from the exercise of rational clemency the irregular report of the firing squad would be heard followed sometimes by a single finishing shot a little bluish cloud of smoke would float up above the green bushes and the army of pacification would move on over the savannas through the forests crossing rivers invading rural pueblos devastating the haciendas of the horrid aristocrats occupying the inland towns in the fulfilment of its patriotic mission and leaving behind a united land wherein the evil taint of federalism could no longer be detected in the smoke of burning houses and the smell of spilt blood don jose avellanos had survived that time perhaps when contemptuously signifying to him his release the citizen saviour of the country might have thought this benighted aristocrat too broken in health and spirit and fortune to be any longer dangerous or perhaps it may have been a simple caprice guzman bento usually full of fanciful fears and brooding suspicions had sudden accesses of unreasonable selfconfidence when he perceived himself elevated on a pinnacle of power and safety beyond the reach of mere mortal plotters at such times he would impulsively command the celebration of a solemn mass of thanksgiving which would be sung in great pomp in the cathedral of sta marta by the trembling subservient archbishop of his creation he heard it sitting in a gilt armchair placed before the high altar surrounded by the civil and military heads of his government the unofficial world of sta marta would crowd into the cathedral for it was not quite safe for anybody of mark to stay away from these manifestations of presidential piety having thus acknowledged the only power he was at all disposed to recognize as above himself he would scatter acts of political grace in a sardonic wantonness of clemency there was no other way left now to enjoy his power but by seeing his crushed adversaries crawl impotently into the light of day out of the dark noisome cells of the collegio their harmlessness fed his insatiable vanity and they could always be got hold of again it was the rule for all the women of their families to present thanks afterwards in a special audience the incarnation of that strange god el gobierno supremo received them standing cocked hat on head and exhorted them in a menacing mutter to show their gratitude by bringing up their children in fidelity to the democratic form of government which i have established for the happiness of our country his front teeth having been knocked out in some accident of his former herdsmans life his utterance was spluttering and indistinct he had been working for costaguana alone in the midst of treachery and opposition let it cease now lest he should become weary of forgiving  don jose avellanos had known this forgiveness  he was broken in health and fortune deplorably enough to present a truly gratifying spectacle to the supreme chief of democratic institutions he retired to sulaco his wife had an estate in that province and she nursed him back to life out of the house of death and captivity when she died their daughter an only child was old enough to devote herself to poor papa  miss avellanos born in europe and educated partly in england was a tall grave girl with a selfpossessed manner a wide white forehead a wealth of rich brown hair and blue eyes  the other young ladies of sulaco stood in awe of her character and accomplishments she was reputed to be terribly learned and serious as to pride it was well known that all the corbelans were proud and her mother was a corbelan don jose avellanos depended very much upon the devotion of his beloved antonia he accepted it in the benighted way of men who though made in gods image are like stone idols without sense before the smoke of certain burnt offerings he was ruined in every way but a man possessed of passion is not a bankrupt in life don jose avellanos desired passionately for his country peace prosperity and as the end of the preface to fifty years of misrule has it an honourable place in the comity of civilized nations in this last phrase the minister plenipotentiary cruelly humiliated by the bad faith of his government towards the foreign bondholders stands disclosed in the patriot  the fatuous turmoil of greedy factions succeeding the tyranny of guzman bento seemed to bring his desire to the very door of opportunity he was too old to descend personally into the centre of the arena at sta marta but the men who acted there sought his advice at every step he himself thought that he could be most useful at a distance in sulaco his name his connections his former position his experience commanded the respect of his class the discovery that this man living in dignified poverty in the corbelan town residence opposite the casa gould could dispose of material means towards the support of the cause increased his influence it was his open letter of appeal that decided the candidature of don vincente ribiera for the presidency another of these informal state papers drawn up by don jose this time in the shape of an address from the province induced that scrupulous constitutionalist to accept the extraordinary powers conferred upon him for five years by an overwhelming vote of congress in sta marta it was a specific mandate to establish the prosperity of the people on the basis of firm peace at home and to redeem the national credit by the satisfaction of all just claims abroad  on the afternoon the news of that vote had reached sulaco by the usual roundabout postal way through cayta and up the coast by steamer don jose who had been waiting for the mail in the goulds drawingroom got out of the rockingchair letting his hat fall off his knees he rubbed his silvery short hair with both hands speechless with the excess of joy  emilia my soul he had burst out let me embrace you let me  captain mitchell had he been there would no doubt have made an apt remark about the dawn of a new era but if don jose thought something of the kind his eloquence failed him on this occasion the inspirer of that revival of the blanco party tottered where he stood mrs gould moved forward quickly and as she offered her cheek with a smile to her old friend managed very cleverly to give him the support of her arm he really needed  don jose had recovered himself at once but for a time he could do no more than murmur oh you two patriots oh you two patriotslooking from one to the other vague plans of another historical work wherein all the devotions to the regeneration of the country he loved would be enshrined for the reverent worship of posterity flitted through his mind the historian who had enough elevation of soul to write of guzman bento yet this monster imbrued in the blood of his countrymen must not be held unreservedly to the execration of future years it appears to be true that he too loved his country he had given it twelve years of peace and absolute master of lives and fortunes as he was he died poor his worst fault perhaps was not his ferocity but his ignorance the man who could write thus of a cruel persecutor the passage occurs in his history of misrule felt at the foreshadowing of success an almost boundless affection for his two helpers for these two young people from over the sea  just as years ago calmly from the conviction of practical necessity stronger than any abstract political doctrine henry gould had drawn the sword so now the times being changed charles gould had flung the silver of the san tome into the fray the inglez of sulaco the costaguana englishman of the third generation was as far from being a political intriguer as his uncle from a revolutionary swashbuckler springing from the instinctive uprightness of their natures their action was reasoned they saw an opportunity and used the weapon to hand  charles goulds positiona commanding position in the background of that attempt to retrieve the peace and the credit of the republicwas very clear at the beginning he had had to accommodate himself to existing circumstances of corruption so naively brazen as to disarm the hate of a man courageous enough not to be afraid of its irresponsible potency to ruin everything it touched it seemed to him too contemptible for hot anger even he made use of it with a cold fearless scorn manifested rather than concealed by the forms of stony courtesy which did away with much of the ignominy of the situation at bottom perhaps he suffered from it for he was not a man of cowardly illusions but he refused to discuss the ethical view with his wife he trusted that though a little disenchanted she would be intelligent enough to understand that his character safeguarded the enterprise of their lives as much or more than his policy the extraordinary development of the mine had put a great power into his hands to feel that prosperity always at the mercy of unintelligent greed had grown irksome to him to mrs gould it was humiliating at any rate it was dangerous in the confidential communications passing between charles gould the king of sulaco and the head of the silver and steel interests far away in california the conviction was growing that any attempt made by men of education and integrity ought to be discreetly supported you may tell your friend avellanos that i think so mr holroyd had written at the proper moment from his inviolable sanctuary within the elevenstorey high factory of great affairs and shortly afterwards with a credit opened by the third southern bank located next door but one to the holroyd building the ribierist party in costaguana took a practical shape under the eye of the administrator of the san tome mine and don jose the hereditary friend of the gould family could say perhaps my dear carlos i shall not have believed in vain    chapter two  after another armed struggle decided by monteros victory of rio seco had been added to the tale of civil wars the honest men as don jose called them could breathe freely for the first time in half a century the fiveyearmandate law became the basis of that regeneration the passionate desire and hope for which had been like the elixir of everlasting youth for don jose avellanos  and when it was suddenlyand not quite unexpectedlyendangered by that brute montero it was a passionate indignation that gave him a new lease of life as it were already at the time of the presidentdictators visit to sulaco moraga had sounded a note of warning from sta marta about the war minister montero and his brother made the subject of an earnest talk between the dictatorpresident and the nestorinspirer of the party but don vincente a doctor of philosophy from the cordova university seemed to have an exaggerated respect for military ability whose mysteriousnesssince it appeared to be altogether independent of intellectimposed upon his imagination the victor of rio seco was a popular hero his services were so recent that the presidentdictator quailed before the obvious charge of political ingratitude great regenerating transactions were being initiatedthe fresh loan a new railway line a vast colonization scheme anything that could unsettle the public opinion in the capital was to be avoided don jose bowed to these arguments and tried to dismiss from his mind the goldlaced portent in boots and with a sabre made meaningless now at last he hoped in the new order of things  less than six months after the presidentdictators visit sulaco learned with stupefaction of the military revolt in the name of national honour the minister of war in a barracksquare allocution to the officers of the artillery regiment he had been inspecting had declared the national honour sold to foreigners the dictator by his weak compliance with the demands of the european powersfor the settlement of long outstanding money claimshad showed himself unfit to rule a letter from moraga explained afterwards that the initiative and even the very text of the incendiary allocution came in reality from the other montero the exguerillero the commandante de plaza the energetic treatment of dr monygham sent for in haste to the mountain who came galloping three leagues in the dark saved don jose from a dangerous attack of jaundice  after getting over the shock don jose refused to let himself be prostrated indeed better news succeeded at first the revolt in the capital had been suppressed after a night of fighting in the streets unfortunately both the monteros had been able to make their escape south to their native province of entremontes the hero of the forest march the victor of rio seco had been received with frenzied acclamations in nicoya the provincial capital the troops in garrison there had gone to him in a body the brothers were organizing an army gathering malcontents sending emissaries primed with patriotic lies to the people and with promises of plunder to the wild llaneros even a monterist press had come into existence speaking oracularly of the secret promises of support given by our great sister republic of the north against the sinister landgrabbing designs of european powers cursing in every issue the miserable ribiera who had plotted to deliver his country bound hand and foot for a prey to foreign speculators  sulaco pastoral and sleepy with its opulent campo and the rich silver mine heard the din of arms fitfully in its fortunate isolation it was nevertheless in the very forefront of the defence with men and money but the very rumours reached it circuitouslyfrom abroad even so much was it cut off from the rest of the republic not only by natural obstacles but also by the vicissitudes of the war the monteristos were besieging cayta an important postal link the overland couriers ceased to come across the mountains and no muleteer would consent to risk the journey at last even bonifacio on one occasion failed to return from sta marta either not daring to start or perhaps captured by the parties of the enemy raiding the country between the cordillera and the capital monterist publications however found their way into the province mysteriously enough and also monterist emissaries preaching death to aristocrats in the villages and towns of the campo very early at the beginning of the trouble hernandez the bandit had proposed through the agency of an old priest of a village in the wilds to deliver two of them to the ribierist authorities in tonoro they had come to offer him a free pardon and the rank of colonel from general montero in consideration of joining the rebel army with his mounted band no notice was taken at the time of the proposal it was joined as an evidence of good faith to a petition praying the sulaco assembly for permission to enlist with all his followers in the forces being then raised in sulaco for the defence of the fiveyear mandate of regeneration the petition like everything else had found its way into don joses hands he had showed to mrs gould these pages of dirtygreyish rough paper perhaps looted in some village store covered with the crabbed illiterate handwriting of the old padre carried off from his hut by the side of a mudwalled church to be the secretary of the dreaded salteador they had both bent in the lamplight of the gould drawingroom over the document containing the fierce and yet humble appeal of the man against the blind and stupid barbarity turning an honest ranchero into a bandit a postscript of the priest stated that but for being deprived of his liberty for ten days he had been treated with humanity and the respect due to his sacred calling he had been it appears confessing and absolving the chief and most of the band and he guaranteed the sincerity of their good disposition he had distributed heavy penances no doubt in the way of litanies and fasts but he argued shrewdly that it would be difficult for them to make their peace with god durably till they had made peace with men  never before perhaps had hernandezs head been in less jeopardy than when he petitioned humbly for permission to buy a pardon for himself and his gang of deserters by armed service he could range afar from the waste lands protecting his fastness unchecked because there were no troops left in the whole province the usual garrison of sulaco had gone south to the war with its brass band playing the bolivar march on the bridge of one of the osn companys steamers the great family coaches drawn up along the shore of the harbour were made to rock on the high leathern springs by the enthusiasm of the senoras and the senoritas standing up to wave their lace handkerchiefs as lighter after lighter packed full of troops left the end of the jetty  nostromo directed the embarkation under the superintendendence of captain mitchell redfaced in the sun conspicuous in a white waistcoat representing the allied and anxious goodwill of all the material interests of civilization general barrios who commanded the troops assured don jose on parting that in three weeks he would have montero in a wooden cage drawn by three pair of oxen ready for a tour through all the towns of the republic  and then senora he continued baring his curly irongrey head to mrs gould in her landauand then senora we shall convert our swords into ploughshares and grow rich even i myself as soon as this little business is settled shall open a fundacion on some land i have on the llanos and try to make a little money in peace and quietness senora you know all costaguana knowswhat do i saythis whole south american continent knows that pablo barrios has had his fill of military glory  charles gould was not present at the anxious and patriotic sendoff it was not his part to see the soldiers embark it was neither his part nor his inclination nor his policy his part his inclination and his policy were united in one endeavour to keep unchecked the flow of treasure he had started singlehanded from the reopened scar in the flank of the mountain as the mine developed he had trained for himself some native help there were foremen artificers and clerks with don pepe for the gobernador of the mining population for the rest his shoulders alone sustained the whole weight of the imperium in imperio the great gould concession whose mere shadow had been enough to crush the life out of his father  mrs gould had no silver mine to look after in the general life of the gould concession she was represented by her two lieutenants the doctor and the priest but she fed her womans love of excitement on events whose significance was purified to her by the fire of her imaginative purpose on that day she had brought the avellanos father and daughter down to the harbour with her  amongst his other activities of that stirring time don jose had become the chairman of a patriotic committee which had armed a great proportion of troops in the sulaco command with an improved model of a military rifle it had been just discarded for something still more deadly by one of the great european powers how much of the marketprice for secondhand weapons was covered by the voluntary contributions of the principal families and how much came from those funds don jose was understood to command abroad remained a secret which he alone could have disclosed but the ricos as the populace called them had contributed under the pressure of their nestors eloquence some of the more enthusiastic ladies had been moved to bring offerings of jewels into the hands of the man who was the life and soul of the party  there were moments when both his life and his soul seemed overtaxed by so many years of undiscouraged belief in regeneration he appeared almost inanimate sitting rigidly by the side of mrs gould in the landau with his fine old cleanshaven face of a uniform tint as if modelled in yellow wax shaded by a soft felt hat the dark eyes looking out fixedly antonia the beautiful antonia as miss avellanos was called in sulaco leaned back facing them and her full figure the grave oval of her face with full red lips made her look more mature than mrs gould with her mobile expression and small erect person under a slightly swaying sunshade  whenever possible antonia attended her father her recognized devotion weakened the shocking effect of her scorn for the rigid conventions regulating the life of spanishamerican girlhood and in truth she was no longer girlish it was said that she often wrote state papers from her fathers dictation and was allowed to read all the books in his library at the receptionswhere the situation was saved by the presence of a very decrepit old lady a relation of the corbelans quite deaf and motionless in an armchairantonia could hold her own in a discussion with two or three men at a time obviously she was not the girl to be content with peeping through a barred window at a cloaked figure of a lover ensconced in a doorway oppositewhich is the correct form of costaguana courtship it was generally believed that with her foreign upbringing and foreign ideas the learned and proud antonia would never marryunless indeed she married a foreigner from europe or north america now that sulaco seemed on the point of being invaded by all the world    chapter three  when general barrios stopped to address mrs gould antonia raised negligently her hand holding an open fan as if to shade from the sun her head wrapped in a light lace shawl the clear gleam of her blue eyes gliding behind the black fringe of eyelashes paused for a moment upon her father then travelled further to the figure of a young man of thirty at most of medium height rather thickset wearing a light overcoat bearing down with the open palm of his hand upon the knob of a flexible cane he had been looking on from a distance but directly he saw himself noticed he approached quietly and put his elbow over the door of the landau  the shirt collar cut low in the neck the big bow of his cravat the style of his clothing from the round hat to the varnished shoes suggested an idea of french elegance but otherwise he was the very type of a fair spanish creole the fluffy moustache and the short curly golden beard did not conceal his lips rosy fresh almost pouting in expression his full round face was of that warm healthy creole white which is never tanned by its native sunshine martin decoud was seldom exposed to the costaguana sun under which he was born his people had been long settled in paris where he had studied law had dabbled in literature had hoped now and then in moments of exaltation to become a poet like that other foreigner of spanish blood jose maria heredia in other moments he had to pass the time condescended to write articles on european affairs for the semenario the principal newspaper in sta marta which printed them under the heading from our special correspondent though the authorship was an open secret everybody in costaguana where the tale of compatriots in europe is jealously kept knew that it was the son decoud a talented young man supposed to be moving in the higher spheres of society as a matter of fact he was an idle boulevardier in touch with some smart journalists made free of a few newspaper offices and welcomed in the pleasure haunts of pressmen this life whose dreary superficiality is covered by the glitter of universal blague like the stupid clowning of a harlequin by the spangles of a motley costume induced in him a frenchifiedbut most unfrenchcosmopolitanism in reality a mere barren indifferentism posing as intellectual superiority of his own country he used to say to his french associates imagine an atmosphere of operabouffe in which all the comic business of stage statesmen brigands etc etc all their farcical stealing intriguing and stabbing is done in dead earnest it is screamingly funny the blood flows all the time and the actors believe themselves to be influencing the fate of the universe of course government in general any government anywhere is a thing of exquisite comicality to a discerning mind but really we spanishamericans do overstep the bounds no man of ordinary intelligence can take part in the intrigues of une farce macabre however these ribierists of whom we hear so much just now are really trying in their own comical way to make the country habitable and even to pay some of its debts my friends you had better write up senor ribiera all you can in kindness to your own bondholders really if what i am told in my letters is true there is some chance for them at last  and he would explain with railing verve what don vincente ribiera stood fora mournful little man oppressed by his own good intentions the significance of battles won who montero was un grotesque vaniteux et feroce and the manner of the new loan connected with railway development and the colonization of vast tracts of land in one great financial scheme  and his french friends would remark that evidently this little fellow decoud connaissait la question a fond an important parisian review asked him for an article on the situation it was composed in a serious tone and in a spirit of levity afterwards he asked one of his intimates  have you read my thing about the regeneration of costaguanaune bonne blague hein  he imagined himself parisian to the tips of his fingers but far from being that he was in danger of remaining a sort of nondescript dilettante all his life he had pushed the habit of universal raillery to a point where it blinded him to the genuine impulses of his own nature to be suddenly selected for the executive member of the patriotic smallarms committee of sulaco seemed to him the height of the unexpected one of those fantastic moves of which only his dear countrymen were capable  its like a tile falling on my head iiexecutive member its the first i hear of it what do i know of military rifles cest funambulesque he had exclaimed to his favourite sister for the decoud familyexcept the old father and motherused the french language amongst themselves and you should see the explanatory and confidential letter eight pages of itno less  this letter in antonias handwriting was signed by don jose who appealed to the young and gifted costaguanero on public grounds and privately opened his heart to his talented godson a man of wealth and leisure with wide relations and by his parentage and bringingup worthy of all confidence  which means martin commented cynically to his sister that i am not likely to misappropriate the funds or go blabbing to our charge daffaires here  the whole thing was being carried out behind the back of the war minister montero a mistrusted member of the ribiera government but difficult to get rid of at once he was not to know anything of it till the troops under barrioss command had the new rifle in their hands the presidentdictator whose position was very difficult was alone in the secret  how funny commented martins sister and confidante to which the brother with an air of best parisian blague had retorted  its immense the idea of that chief of the state engaged with the help of private citizens in digging a mine under his own indispensable war minister no we are unapproachable and he laughed immoderately  afterwards his sister was surprised at the earnestness and ability he displayed in carrying out his mission which circumstances made delicate and his want of special knowledge rendered difficult she had never seen martin take so much trouble about anything in his whole life  it amuses me he had explained briefly i am beset by a lot of swindlers trying to sell all sorts of gaspipe weapons they are charming they invite me to expensive luncheons i keep up their hopes its extremely entertaining meanwhile the real affair is being carried through in quite another quarter  when the business was concluded he declared suddenly his intention of seeing the precious consignment delivered safely in sulaco the whole burlesque business he thought was worth following up to the end he mumbled his excuses tugging at his golden beard before the acute young lady who after the first wide stare of astonishment looked at him with narrowed eyes and pronounced slowly  i believe you want to see antonia  what antonia asked the costaguana boulevardier in a vexed and disdainful tone he shrugged his shoulders and spun round on his heel his sister called out after him joyously  the antonia you used to know when she wore her hair in two plaits down her back  he had known her some eight years since shortly before the avellanos had left europe for good as a tall girl of sixteen youthfully austere and of a character already so formed that she ventured to treat slightingly his pose of disabused wisdom on one occasion as though she had lost all patience she flew out at him about the aimlessness of his life and the levity of his opinions he was twenty then an only son spoiled by his adoring family this attack disconcerted him so greatly that he had faltered in his affectation of amused superiority before that insignificant chit of a schoolgirl but the impression left was so strong that ever since all the girl friends of his sisters recalled to him antonia avellanos by some faint resemblance or by the great force of contrast it was he told himself like a ridiculous fatality and of course in the news the decouds received regularly from costaguana the name of their friends the avellanos cropped up frequentlythe arrest and the abominable treatment of the exminister the dangers and hardships endured by the family its withdrawal in poverty to sulaco the death of the mother  the monterist pronunciamento had taken place before martin decoud reached costaguana he came out in a roundabout way through magellans straits by the main line and the west coast service of the osn company his precious consignment arrived just in time to convert the first feelings of consternation into a mood of hope and resolution publicly he was made much of by the familias principales privately don jose still shaken and weak embraced him with tears in his eyes  you have come out yourself no less could be expected from a decoud alas our worst fears have been realized he moaned affectionately and again he hugged his godson this was indeed the time for men of intellect and conscience to rally round the endangered cause  it was then that martin decoud the adopted child of western europe felt the absolute change of atmosphere he submitted to being embraced and talked to without a word he was moved in spite of himself by that note of passion and sorrow unknown on the more refined stage of european politics but when the tall antonia advancing with her light step in the dimness of the big bare sala of the avellanos house offered him her hand in her emancipated way and murmured i am glad to see you here don martin he felt how impossible it would be to tell these two people that he had intended to go away by the next months packet don jose meantime continued his praises every accession added to public confidence and besides what an example to the young men at home from the brilliant defender of the countrys regeneration the worthy expounder of the partys political faith before the world everybody had read the magnificent article in the famous parisian review the world was now informed and the authors appearance at this moment was like a public act of faith young decoud felt overcome by a feeling of impatient confusion his plan had been to return by way of the united states through california visit yellowstone park see chicago niagara have a look at canada perhaps make a short stay in new york a longer one in newport use his letters of introduction the pressure of antonias hand was so frank the tone of her voice was so unexpectedly unchanged in its approving warmth that all he found to say after his low bow was  i am inexpressibly grateful for your welcome but why need a man be thanked for returning to his native country i am sure dona antonia does not think so  certainly not senor she said with that perfectly calm openness of manner which characterized all her utterances but when he returns as you return one may be gladfor the sake of both  martin decoud said nothing of his plans he not only never breathed a word of them to any one but only a fortnight later asked the mistress of the casa gould where he had of course obtained admission at once leaning forward in his chair with an air of wellbred familiarity whether she could not detect in him that day a marked changean air he explained of more excellent gravity at this mrs gould turned her face full towards him with the silent inquiry of slightly widened eyes and the merest ghost of a smile an habitual movement with her which was very fascinating to men by something subtly devoted finely selfforgetful in its lively readiness of attention because decoud continued imperturbably he felt no longer an idle cumberer of the earth she was he assured her actually beholding at that moment the journalist of sulaco at once mrs gould glanced towards antonia posed upright in the corner of a high straightbacked spanish sofa a large black fan waving slowly against the curves of her fine figure the tips of crossed feet peeping from under the hem of the black skirt decouds eyes also remained fixed there while in an undertone he added that miss avellanos was quite aware of his new and unexpected vocation which in costaguana was generally the speciality of halfeducated negroes and wholly penniless lawyers then confronting with a sort of urbane effrontery mrs goulds gaze now turned sympathetically upon himself he breathed out the words pro patria  what had happened was that he had all at once yielded to don joses pressing entreaties to take the direction of a newspaper that would voice the aspirations of the province it had been don joses old and cherished idea the necessary plant on a modest scale and a large consignment of paper had been received from america some time before the right man alone was wanted even senor moraga in sta marta had not been able to find one and the matter was now becoming pressing some organ was absolutely needed to counteract the effect of the lies disseminated by the monterist press the atrocious calumnies the appeals to the people calling upon them to rise with their knives in their hands and put an end once for all to the blancos to these gothic remnants to these sinister mummies these impotent paraliticos who plotted with foreigners for the surrender of the lands and the slavery of the people  the clamour of this negro liberalism frightened senor avellanos a newspaper was the only remedy and now that the right man had been found in decoud great black letters appeared painted between the windows above the arcaded ground floor of a house on the plaza it was next to anzanis great emporium of boots silks ironware muslins wooden toys tiny silver arms legs heads hearts for exvoto offerings rosaries champagne womens hats patent medicines even a few dusty books in paper covers and mostly in the french language the big black letters formed the words offices of the porvenir from these offices a single folded sheet of martins journalism issued three times a week and the sleek yellow anzani prowling in a suit of ample black and carpet slippers before the many doors of his establishment greeted by a deep sidelong inclination of his body the journalist of sulaco going to and fro on the business of his august calling    chapter four  perhaps it was in the exercise of his calling that he had come to see the troops depart the porvenir of the day after next would no doubt relate the event but its editor leaning his side against the landau seemed to look at nothing the front rank of the company of infantry drawn up three deep across the shore end of the jetty when pressed too close would bring their bayonets to the charge ferociously with an awful rattle and then the crowd of spectators swayed back bodily even under the noses of the big white mules notwithstanding the great multitude there was only a low muttering noise the dust hung in a brown haze in which the horsemen wedged in the throng here and there towered from the hips upwards gazing all one way over the heads almost every one of them had mounted a friend who steadied himself with both hands grasping his shoulders from behind and the rims of their hats touching made like one disc sustaining the cones of two pointed crowns with a double face underneath a hoarse mozo would bawl out something to an acquaintance in the ranks or a woman would shriek suddenly the word adios followed by the christian name of a man  general barrios in a shabby blue tunic and white pegtop trousers falling upon strange red boots kept his head uncovered and stooped slightly propping himself up with a thick stick no he had earned enough military glory to satiate any man he insisted to mrs gould trying at the same time to put an air of gallantry into his attitude a few jetty hairs hung sparsely from his upper lip he had a salient nose a thin long jaw and a black silk patch over one eye his other eye small and deepset twinkled erratically in all directions aimlessly affable the few european spectators all men who had naturally drifted into the neighbourhood of the gould carriage betrayed by the solemnity of their faces their impression that the general must have had too much punch swedish punch imported in bottles by anzani at the amarilla club before he had started with his staff on a furious ride to the harbour but mrs gould bent forward selfpossessed and declared her conviction that still more glory awaited the general in the near future  senora he remonstrated with great feeling in the name of god reflect how can there be any glory for a man like me in overcoming that baldheaded embustero with the dyed moustaches  pablo ignacio barrios son of a village alcalde general of division commanding in chief the occidental military district did not frequent the higher society of the town he preferred the unceremonious gatherings of men where he could tell jaguarhunt stories boast of his powers with the lasso with which he could perform extremely difficult feats of the sort no married man should attempt as the saying goes amongst the llaneros relate tales of extraordinary night rides encounters with wild bulls struggles with crocodiles adventures in the great forests crossings of swollen rivers and it was not mere boastfulness that prompted the generals reminiscences but a genuine love of that wild life which he had led in his young days before he turned his back for ever on the thatched roof of the parental tolderia in the woods wandering away as far as mexico he had fought against the french by the side as he said of juarez and was the only military man of costaguana who had ever encountered european troops in the field that fact shed a great lustre upon his name till it became eclipsed by the rising star of montero all his life he had been an inveterate gambler he alluded himself quite openly to the current story how once during some campaign when in command of a brigade he had gambled away his horses pistols and accoutrements to the very epaulettes playing monte with his colonels the night before the battle finally he had sent under escort his sword a presentation sword with a gold hilt to the town in the rear of his position to be immediately pledged for five hundred pesetas with a sleepy and frightened shopkeeper by daybreak he had lost the last of that money too when his only remark as he rose calmly was now let us go and fight to the death from that time he had become aware that a general could lead his troops into battle very well with a simple stick in his hand it has been my custom ever since he would say  he was always overwhelmed with debts even during the periods of splendour in his varied fortunes of a costaguana general when he held high military commands his goldlaced uniforms were almost always in pawn with some tradesman and at last to avoid the incessant difficulties of costume caused by the anxious lenders he had assumed a disdain of military trappings an eccentric fashion of shabby old tunics which had become like a second nature but the faction barrios joined needed to fear no political betrayal he was too much of a real soldier for the ignoble traffic of buying and selling victories a member of the foreign diplomatic body in sta marta had once passed a judgment upon him barrios is a man of perfect honesty and even of some talent for war mais il manque de tenue after the triumph of the ribierists he had obtained the reputedly lucrative occidental command mainly through the exertions of his creditors the sta marta shopkeepers all great politicians who moved heaven and earth in his interest publicly and privately besieged senor moraga the influential agent of the san tome mine with the exaggerated lamentations that if the general were passed over we shall all be ruined an incidental but favourable mention of his name in mr gould seniors long correspondence with his son had something to do with his appointment too but most of all undoubtedly his established political honesty no one questioned the personal bravery of the tigerkiller as the populace called him he was however said to be unlucky in the fieldbut this was to be the beginning of an era of peace the soldiers liked him for his humane temper which was like a strange and precious flower unexpectedly blooming on the hotbed of corrupt revolutions and when he rode slowly through the streets during some military display the contemptuous good humour of his solitary eye roaming over the crowds extorted the acclamations of the populace the women of that class especially seemed positively fascinated by the long drooping nose the peaked chin the heavy lower lip the black silk eyepatch and band slanting rakishly over the forehead his high rank always procured an audience of caballeros for his sporting stories which he detailed very well with a simple grave enjoyment as to the society of ladies it was irksome by the restraints it imposed without any equivalent as far as he could see he had not perhaps spoken three times on the whole to mrs gould since he had taken up his high command but he had observed her frequently riding with the senor administrador and had pronounced that there was more sense in her little bridlehand than in all the female heads in sulaco his impulse had been to be very civil on parting to a woman who did not wobble in the saddle and happened to be the wife of a personality very important to a man always short of money he even pushed his attentions so far as to desire the aidedecamp at his side a thickset short captain with a tartar physiognomy to bring along a corporal with a file of men in front of the carriage lest the crowd in its backward surges should incommode the mules of the senora then turning to the small knot of silent europeans looking on within earshot he raised his voice protectingly  senores have no apprehension go on quietly making your ferro carrilyour railways your telegraphs yourtheres enough wealth in costaguana to pay for everythingor else you would not be here ha ha dont mind this little picardia of my friend montero in a little while you shall behold his dyed moustaches through the bars of a strong wooden cage si senores fear nothing develop the country work work  the little group of engineers received this exhortation without a word and after waving his hand at them loftily he addressed himself again to mrs gould  that is what don jose says we must do be enterprising work grow rich to put montero in a cage is my work and when that insignificant piece of business is done then as don jose wishes us we shall grow rich one and all like so many englishmen because it is money that saves a country and  but a young officer in a very new uniform hurrying up from the direction of the jetty interrupted his interpretation of senor avellanoss ideals the general made a movement of impatience the other went on talking to him insistently with an air of respect the horses of the staff had been embarked the steamers gig was awaiting the general at the boat steps and barrios after a fierce stare of his one eye began to take leave don jose roused himself for an appropriate phrase pronounced mechanically the terrible strain of hope and fear was telling on him and he seemed to husband the last sparks of his fire for those oratorical efforts of which even the distant europe was to hear antonia her red lips firmly closed averted her head behind the raised fan and young decoud though he felt the girls eyes upon him gazed away persistently hooked on his elbow with a scornful and complete detachment mrs gould heroically concealed her dismay at the appearance of men and events so remote from her racial conventions dismay too deep to be uttered in words even to her husband she understood his voiceless reserve better now their confidential intercourse fell not in moments of privacy but precisely in public when the quick meeting of their glances would comment upon some fresh turn of events she had gone to his school of uncompromising silence the only one possible since so much that seemed shocking weird and grotesque in the working out of their purposes had to be accepted as normal in this country decidedly the stately antonia looked more mature and infinitely calm but she would never have known how to reconcile the sudden sinkings of her heart with an amiable mobility of expression  mrs gould smiled a goodbye at barrios nodded round to the europeans who raised their hats simultaneously with an engaging invitation i hope to see you all presently at home then said nervously to decoud get in don martin and heard him mutter to himself in french as he opened the carriage door le sort en est jete she heard him with a sort of exasperation nobody ought to have known better than himself that the first cast of dice had been already thrown long ago in a most desperate game distant acclamations words of command yelled out and a roll of drums on the jetty greeted the departing general something like a slight faintness came over her and she looked blankly at antonias still face wondering what would happen to charley if that absurd man failed a la casa ignacio she cried at the motionless broad back of the coachman who gathered the reins without haste mumbling to himself under his breath si la casa si si nina  the carriage rolled noiselessly on the soft track the shadows fell long on the dusty little plain interspersed with dark bushes mounds of turnedup earth low wooden buildings with iron roofs of the railway company the sparse row of telegraph poles strode obliquely clear of the town bearing a single almost invisible wire far into the great campolike a slender vibrating feeler of that progress waiting outside for a moment of peace to enter and twine itself about the weary heart of the land  the cafe window of the albergo dltalia una was full of sunburnt whiskered faces of railway men but at the other end of the house the end of the signori inglesi old giorgio at the door with one of his girls on each side bared his bushy head as white as the snows of higuerota mrs gould stopped the carriage she seldom failed to speak to her protege moreover the excitement the heat and the dust had made her thirsty she asked for a glass of water giorgio sent the children indoors for it and approached with pleasure expressed in his whole rugged countenance it was not often that he had occasion to see his benefactress who was also an englishwomananother title to his regard he offered some excuses for his wife it was a bad day with her her oppressionshe tapped his own broad chest she could not move from her chair that day  decoud ensconced in the corner of his seat observed gloomily mrs goulds old revolutionist then offhand  well and what do you think of it all garibaldino  old giorgio looking at him with some curiosity said civilly that the troops had marched very well oneeyed barrios and his officers had done wonders with the recruits in a short time those indios only caught the other day had gone swinging past in double quick time like bersaglieri they looked well fed too and had whole uniforms uniforms he repeated with a halfsmile of pity a look of grim retrospect stole over his piercing steady eyes it had been otherwise in his time when men fought against tyranny in the forests of brazil or on the plains of uruguay starving on halfraw beef without salt half naked with often only a knife tied to a stick for a weapon and yet we used to prevail against the oppressor he concluded proudly  his animation fell the slight gesture of his hand expressed discouragement but he added that he had asked one of the sergeants to show him the new rifle there was no such weapon in his fighting days and if barrios could not  yes yes broke in don jose almost trembling with eagerness we are safe the good senor viola is a man of experience extremely deadlyis it not so you have accomplished your mission admirably my dear martin  decoud lolling back moodily contemplated old viola  ah yes a man of experience but who are you for really in your heart  mrs gould leaned over to the children linda had brought out a glass of water on a tray with extreme care giselle presented her with a bunch of flowers gathered hastily  for the people declared old viola sternly  we are all for the peoplein the end  yes muttered old viola savagely and meantime they fight for you blind esclavos  at that moment young scarfe of the railway staff emerged from the door of the part reserved for the signori inglesi he had come down to headquarters from somewhere up the line on a light engine and had had just time to get a bath and change his clothes he was a nice boy and mrs gould welcomed him  its a delightful surprise to see you mrs gould ive just come down usual luck missed everything of course this show is just over and i hear there has been a great dance at don juste lopezs last night is it true  the young patricians decoud began suddenly in his precise english have indeed been dancing before they started off to the war with the great pompey  young scarfe stared astounded you havent met before mrs gould intervened mr decoudmr scarfe  ah but we are not going to pharsalia protested don jose with nervous haste also in english you should not jest like this martin  antonias breast rose and fell with a deeper breath the young engineer was utterly in the dark great what he muttered vaguely  luckily montero is not a caesar decoud continued not the two monteros put together would make a decent parody of a caesar he crossed his arms on his breast looking at senor avellanos who had returned to his immobility it is only you don jose who are a genuine old romanvir romanuseloquent and inflexible  since he had heard the name of montero pronounced young scarfe had been eager to express his simple feelings in a loud and youthful tone he hoped that this montero was going to be licked once for all and done with there was no saying what would happen to the railway if the revolution got the upper hand perhaps it would have to be abandoned it would not be the first railway gone to pot in costaguana you know its one of their socalled national things he ran on wrinkling up his nose as if the word had a suspicious flavour to his profound experience of south american affairs and of course he chatted with animation it had been such an immense piece of luck for him at his age to get appointed on the staff of a big thing like thatdont you know it would give him the pull over a lot of chaps all through life he asserted thereforedown with montero mrs gould his artless grin disappeared slowly before the unanimous gravity of the faces turned upon him from the carriage only that old chap don jose presenting a motionless waxy profile stared straight on as if deaf scarfe did not know the avellanos very well they did not give balls and antonia never appeared at a groundfloor window as some other young ladies used to do attended by elder women to chat with the caballeros on horseback in the calle the stares of these creoles did not matter much but what on earth had come to mrs gould she said go on ignacio and gave him a slow inclination of the head he heard a short laugh from that roundfaced frenchified fellow he coloured up to the eyes and stared at giorgio viola who had fallen back with the children hat in hand  i shall want a horse presently he said with some asperity to the old man  si senor there are plenty of horses murmured the garibaldino smoothing absently with his brown hands the two heads one dark with bronze glints the other fair with a coppery ripple of the two girls by his side the returning stream of sightseers raised a great dust on the road horsemen noticed the group go to your mother he said they are growing up as i am growing older and there is nobody  he looked at the young engineer and stopped as if awakened from a dream then folding his arms on his breast took up his usual position leaning back in the doorway with an upward glance fastened on the white shoulder of higuerota far away  in the carriage martin decoud shifting his position as though he could not make himself comfortable muttered as he swayed towards antonia i suppose you hate me then in a loud voice he began to congratulate don jose upon all the engineers being convinced ribierists the interest of all those foreigners was gratifying you have heard this one he is an enlightened wellwisher it is pleasant to think that the prosperity of costaguana is of some use to the world  he is very young mrs gould remarked quietly  and so very wise for his age retorted decoud but here we have the naked truth from the mouth of that child you are right don jose the natural treasures of costaguana are of importance to the progressive europe represented by this youth just as three hundred years ago the wealth of our spanish fathers was a serious object to the rest of europeas represented by the bold buccaneers there is a curse of futility upon our character don quixote and sancho panza chivalry and materialism highsounding sentiments and a supine morality violent efforts for an idea and a sullen acquiescence in every form of corruption we convulsed a continent for our independence only to become the passive prey of a democratic parody the helpless victims of scoundrels and cutthroats our institutions a mockery our laws a farcea guzman bento our master and we have sunk so low that when a man like you has awakened our conscience a stupid barbarian of a monterogreat heavens a monterobecomes a deadly danger and an ignorant boastful indio like barrios is our defender  but don jose disregarding the general indictment as though he had not heard a word of it took up the defence of barrios the man was competent enough for his special task in the plan of campaign it consisted in an offensive movement with cayta as base upon the flank of the revolutionist forces advancing from the south against sta marta which was covered by another army with the presidentdictator in its midst don jose became quite animated with a great flow of speech bending forward anxiously under the steady eyes of his daughter decoud as if silenced by so much ardour did not make a sound the bells of the city were striking the hour of oracion when the carriage rolled under the old gateway facing the harbour like a shapeless monument of leaves and stones the rumble of wheels under the sonorous arch was traversed by a strange piercing shriek and decoud from his back seat had a view of the people behind the carriage trudging along the road outside all turning their heads in sombreros and rebozos to look at a locomotive which rolled quickly out of sight behind giorgio violas house under a white trail of steam that seemed to vanish in the breathless hysterically prolonged scream of warlike triumph and it was all like a fleeting vision the shrieking ghost of a railway engine fleeing across the frame of the archway behind the startled movement of the people streaming back from a military spectacle with silent footsteps on the dust of the road it was a material train returning from the campo to the palisaded yards the empty cars rolled lightly on the single track there was no rumble of wheels no tremor of the ground the enginedriver running past the casa viola with the salute of an uplifted arm checked his speed smartly before entering the yard and when the earsplitting screech of the steamwhistle for the brakes had stopped a series of hard battering shocks mingled with the clanking of chaincouplings made a tumult of blows and shaken fetters under the vault of the gate    chapter five  the gould carriage was the first to return from the harbour to the empty town on the ancient pavement laid out in patterns sunk into ruts and holes the portly ignacio mindful of the springs of the parisianbuilt landau had pulled up to a walk and decoud in his corner contemplated moodily the inner aspect of the gate the squat turreted sides held up between them a mass of masonry with bunches of grass growing at the top and a grey heavily scrolled armorial shield of stone above the apex of the arch with the arms of spain nearly smoothed out as if in readiness for some new device typical of the impending progress  the explosive noise of the railway trucks seemed to augment decouds irritation he muttered something to himself then began to talk aloud in curt angry phrases thrown at the silence of the two women they did not look at him at all while don jose with his semitranslucent waxy complexion overshadowed by the soft grey hat swayed a little to the jolts of the carriage by the side of mrs gould  this sound puts a new edge on a very old truth  decoud spoke in french perhaps because of ignacio on the box above him the old coachman with his broad back filling a short silverbraided jacket had a big pair of ears whose thick rims stood well away from his cropped head  yes the noise outside the city wall is new but the principle is old  he ruminated his discontent for a while then began afresh with a sidelong glance at antonia  no but just imagine our forefathers in morions and corselets drawn up outside this gate and a band of adventurers just landed from their ships in the harbour there thieves of course speculators too their expeditions each one were the speculations of grave and reverend persons in england that is history as that absurd sailor mitchell is always saying  mitchells arrangements for the embarkation of the troops were excellent exclaimed don jose  thatthat oh thats really the work of that genoese seaman but to return to my noises there used to be in the old days the sound of trumpets outside that gate war trumpets im sure they were trumpets i have read somewhere that drake who was the greatest of these men used to dine alone in his cabin on board ship to the sound of trumpets in those days this town was full of wealth those men came to take it now the whole land is like a treasurehouse and all these people are breaking into it whilst we are cutting each others throats the only thing that keeps them out is mutual jealousy but theyll come to an agreement some dayand by the time weve settled our quarrels and become decent and honourable therell be nothing left for us it has always been the same we are a wonderful people but it has always been our fate to behe did not say robbed but added after a pauseexploited  mrs gould said oh this is unjust and antonia interjected dont answer him emilia he is attacking me  you surely do not think i was attacking don carlos decoud answered  and then the carriage stopped before the door of the casa gould the young man offered his hand to the ladies they went in first together don jose walked by the side of decoud and the gouty old porter tottered after them with some light wraps on his arm  don jose slipped his hand under the arm of the journalist of sulaco  the porvenir must have a long and confident article upon barrios and the irresistibleness of his army of cayta the moral effect should be kept up in the country we must cable encouraging extracts to europe and the united states to maintain a favourable impression abroad  decoud muttered oh yes we must comfort our friends the speculators  the long open gallery was in shadow with its screen of plants in vases along the balustrade holding out motionless blossoms and all the glass doors of the receptionrooms thrown open a jingle of spurs died out at the further end  basilio standing aside against the wall said in a soft tone to the passing ladies the senor administrador is just back from the mountain  in the great sala with its groups of ancient spanish and modern european furniture making as if different centres under the high white spread of the ceiling the silver and porcelain of the teaservice gleamed among a cluster of dwarf chairs like a bit of a ladys boudoir putting in a note of feminine and intimate delicacy  don jose in his rockingchair placed his hat on his lap and decoud walked up and down the whole length of the room passing between tables loaded with knickknacks and almost disappearing behind the high backs of leathern sofas he was thinking of the angry face of antonia he was confident that he would make his peace with her he had not stayed in sulaco to quarrel with antonia  martin decoud was angry with himself all he saw and heard going on around him exasperated the preconceived views of his european civilization to contemplate revolutions from the distance of the parisian boulevards was quite another matter here on the spot it was not possible to dismiss their tragic comedy with the expression quelle farce  the reality of the political action such as it was seemed closer and acquired poignancy by antonias belief in the cause its crudeness hurt his feelings he was surprised at his own sensitiveness  i suppose i am more of a costaguanero than i would have believed possible he thought to himself  his disdain grew like a reaction of his scepticism against the action into which he was forced by his infatuation for antonia he soothed himself by saying he was not a patriot but a lover  the ladies came in bareheaded and mrs gould sank low before the little teatable antonia took up her usual place at the reception hourthe corner of a leathern couch with a rigid grace in her pose and a fan in her hand decoud swerving from the straight line of his march came to lean over the high back of her seat  for a long time he talked into her ear from behind softly with a half smile and an air of apologetic familiarity her fan lay half grasped on her knees she never looked at him his rapid utterance grew more and more insistent and caressing at last he ventured a slight laugh  no really you must forgive me one must be serious sometimes he paused she turned her head a little her blue eyes glided slowly towards him slightly upwards mollified and questioning  you cant think i am serious when i call montero a gran bestia every second day in the porvenir that is not a serious occupation no occupation is serious not even when a bullet through the heart is the penalty of failure  her hand closed firmly on her fan  some reason you understand i mean some sense may creep into thinking some glimpse of truth i mean some effective truth for which there is no room in politics or journalism i happen to have said what i thought and you are angry if you do me the kindness to think a little you will see that i spoke like a patriot  she opened her red lips for the first time not unkindly  yes but you never see the aim men must be used as they are i suppose nobody is really disinterested unless perhaps you don martin  god forbid its the last thing i should like you to believe of me he spoke lightly and paused  she began to fan herself with a slow movement without raising her hand after a time he whispered passionately  antonia  she smiled and extended her hand after the english manner towards charles gould who was bowing before her while decoud with his elbows spread on the back of the sofa dropped his eyes and murmured bonjour  the senor administrador of the san tome mine bent over his wife for a moment they exchanged a few words of which only the phrase the greatest enthusiasm pronounced by mrs gould could be heard  yes decoud began in a murmur even he  this is sheer calumny said antonia not very severely  you just ask him to throw his mine into the meltingpot for the great cause decoud whispered  don jose had raised his voice he rubbed his hands cheerily the excellent aspect of the troops and the great quantity of new deadly rifles on the shoulders of those brave men seemed to fill him with an ecstatic confidence  charles gould very tall and thin before his chair listened but nothing could be discovered in his face except a kind and deferential attention  meantime antonia had risen and crossing the room stood looking out of one of the three long windows giving on the street decoud followed her the window was thrown open and he leaned against the thickness of the wall the long folds of the damask curtain falling straight from the broad brass cornice hid him partly from the room he folded his arms on his breast and looked steadily at antonias profile  the people returning from the harbour filled the pavements the shuffle of sandals and a low murmur of voices ascended to the window now and then a coach rolled slowly along the disjointed roadway of the calle de la constitucion there were not many private carriages in sulaco at the most crowded hour on the alameda they could be counted with one glance of the eye the great family arks swayed on high leathern springs full of pretty powdered faces in which the eyes looked intensely alive and black and first don juste lopez the president of the provincial assembly passed with his three lovely daughters solemn in a black frockcoat and stiff white tie as when directing a debate from a high tribune though they all raised their eyes antonia did not make the usual greeting gesture of a fluttered hand and they affected not to see the two young people costaguaneros with european manners whose eccentricities were discussed behind the barred windows of the first families in sulaco and then the widowed senora gavilaso de valdes rolled by handsome and dignified in a great machine in which she used to travel to and from her country house surrounded by an armed retinue in leather suits and big sombreros with carbines at the bows of their saddles she was a woman of most distinguished family proud rich and kindhearted her second son jaime had just gone off on the staff of barrios the eldest a worthless fellow of a moody disposition filled sulaco with the noise of his dissipations and gambled heavily at the club the two youngest boys with yellow ribierist cockades in their caps sat on the front seat she too affected not to see the senor decoud talking publicly with antonia in defiance of every convention and he not even her novio as far as the world knew though even in that case it would have been scandal enough but the dignified old lady respected and admired by the first families would have been still more shocked if she could have heard the words they were exchanging  did you say i lost sight of the aim i have only one aim in the world  she made an almost imperceptible negative movement of her head still staring across the street at the avellanoss house grey marked with decay and with iron bars like a prison  and it would be so easy of attainment he continued this aim which whether knowingly or not i have always had in my heartever since the day when you snubbed me so horribly once in paris you remember  a slight smile seemed to move the corner of the lip that was on his side  you know you were a very terrible person a sort of charlotte corday in a schoolgirls dress a ferocious patriot i suppose you would have stuck a knife into guzman bento  she interrupted him you do me too much honour  at any rate he said changing suddenly to a tone of bitter levity you would have sent me to stab him without compunction  ah par exemple she murmured in a shocked tone  well he argued mockingly you do keep me here writing deadly nonsense deadly to me it has already killed my selfrespect and you may imagine he continued his tone passing into light banter that montero should he be successful would get even with me in the only way such a brute can get even with a man of intelligence who condescends to call him a gran bestia three times a week its a sort of intellectual death but there is the other one in the background for a journalist of my ability  if he is successful said antonia thoughtfully  you seem satisfied to see my life hang on a thread decoud replied with a broad smile and the other montero the my trusted brother of the proclamations the guerrillerohavent i written that he was taking the guests overcoats and changing plates in paris at our legation in the intervals of spying on our refugees there in the time of rojas he will wash out that sacred truth in blood in my blood why do you look annoyed this is simply a bit of the biography of one of our great men what do you think he will do to me there is a certain convent wall round the corner of the plaza opposite the door of the bull ring you know opposite the door with the inscription intrada de la sombra appropriate perhaps thats where the uncle of our host gave up his anglosouthamerican soul and note he might have run away a man who has fought with weapons may run away you might have let me go with barrios if you had cared for me i would have carried one of those rifles in which don jose believes with the greatest satisfaction in the ranks of poor peons and indios that know nothing either of reason or politics the most forlorn hope in the most forlorn army on earth would have been safer than that for which you made me stay here when you make war you may retreat but not when you spend your time in inciting poor ignorant fools to kill and to die  his tone remained light and as if unaware of his presence she stood motionless her hands clasped lightly the fan hanging down from her interlaced fingers he waited for a while and then  i shall go to the wall he said with a sort of jocular desperation  even that declaration did not make her look at him her head remained still her eyes fixed upon the house of the avellanos whose chipped pilasters broken cornices the whole degradation of dignity was hidden now by the gathering dusk of the street in her whole figure her lips alone moved forming the words  martin you will make me cry  he remained silent for a minute startled as if overwhelmed by a sort of awed happiness with the lines of the mocking smile still stiffened about his mouth and incredulous surprise in his eyes the value of a sentence is in the personality which utters it for nothing new can be said by man or woman and those were the last words it seemed to him that could ever have been spoken by antonia he had never made it up with her so completely in all their intercourse of small encounters but even before she had time to turn towards him which she did slowly with a rigid grace he had begun to plead  my sister is only waiting to embrace you my father is transported with joy i wont say anything of my mother our mothers were like sisters there is the mailboat for the south next weeklet us go that moraga is a fool a man like montero is bribed its the practice of the country its traditionits politics read fifty years of misrule  leave poor papa alone don martin he believes  i have the greatest tenderness for your father he began hurriedly but i love you antonia and moraga has miserably mismanaged this business perhaps your father did too i dont know montero was bribeable why i suppose he only wanted his share of this famous loan for national development why didnt the stupid sta marta people give him a mission to europe or something he would have taken five years salary in advance and gone on loafing in paris this stupid ferocious indio  the man she said thoughtfully and very calm before this outburst was intoxicated with vanity we had all the information not from moraga only from others too there was his brother intriguing too  oh yes he said of course you know you know everything you read all the correspondence you write all the papersall those state papers that are inspired here in this room in blind deference to a theory of political purity hadnt you charles gould before your eyes rey de sulaco he and his mine are the practical demonstration of what could have been done do you think he succeeded by his fidelity to a theory of virtue and all those railway people with their honest work of course their work is honest but what if you cannot work honestly till the thieves are satisfied could he not a gentleman have told this sir john whatshisname that montero had to be bought offhe and all his negro liberals hanging on to his goldlaced sleeve he ought to have been bought off with his own stupid weight of goldhis weight of gold i tell you boots sabre spurs cocked hat and all  she shook her head slightly it was impossible she murmured  he wanted the whole lot what  she was facing him now in the deep recess of the window very close and motionless her lips moved rapidly decoud leaning his back against the wall listened with crossed arms and lowered eyelids he drank the tones of her even voice and watched the agitated life of her throat as if waves of emotion had run from her heart to pass out into the air in her reasonable words he also had his aspirations he aspired to carry her away out of these deadly futilities of pronunciamientos and reforms all this was wrongutterly wrong but she fascinated him and sometimes the sheer sagacity of a phrase would break the charm replace the fascination by a sudden unwilling thrill of interest some women hovered as it were on the threshold of genius he reflected they did not want to know or think or understand passion stood for all that and he was ready to believe that some startlingly profound remark some appreciation of character or a judgment upon an event bordered on the miraculous in the mature antonia he could see with an extraordinary vividness the austere schoolgirl of the earlier days she seduced his attention sometimes he could not restrain a murmur of assent now and then he advanced an objection quite seriously gradually they began to argue the curtain half hid them from the people in the sala  outside it had grown dark from the deep trench of shadow between the houses lit up vaguely by the glimmer of street lamps ascended the evening silence of sulaco the silence of a town with few carriages of unshod horses and a softly sandalled population the windows of the casa gould flung their shining parallelograms upon the house of the avellanos now and then a shuffle of feet passed below with the pulsating red glow of a cigarette at the foot of the walls and the night air as if cooled by the snows of higuerota refreshed their faces  we occidentals said martin decoud using the usual term the provincials of sulaco applied to themselves have been always distinct and separated as long as we hold cayta nothing can reach us in all our troubles no army has marched over those mountains a revolution in the central provinces isolates us at once look how complete it is now the news of barrios movement will be cabled to the united states and only in that way will it reach sta marta by the cable from the other seaboard we have the greatest riches the greatest fertility the purest blood in our great families the most laborious population the occidental province should stand alone the early federalism was not bad for us then came this union which don henrique gould resisted it opened the road to tyranny and ever since the rest of costaguana hangs like a millstone round our necks the occidental territory is large enough to make any mans country look at the mountains nature itself seems to cry to us separate  she made an energetic gesture of negation a silence fell  oh yes i know its contrary to the doctrine laid down in the history of fifty years misrule i am only trying to be sensible but my sense seems always to give you cause for offence have i startled you very much with this perfectly reasonable aspiration  she shook her head no she was not startled but the idea shocked her early convictions her patriotism was larger she had never considered that possibility  it may yet be the means of saving some of your convictions he said prophetically  she did not answer she seemed tired they leaned side by side on the rail of the little balcony very friendly having exhausted politics giving themselves up to the silent feeling of their nearness in one of those profound pauses that fall upon the rhythm of passion towards the plaza end of the street the glowing coals in the brazeros of the market women cooking their evening meal gleamed red along the edge of the pavement a man appeared without a sound in the light of a street lamp showing the coloured inverted triangle of his bordered poncho square on his shoulders hanging to a point below his knees from the harbour end of the calle a horseman walked his softstepping mount gleaming silvergrey abreast each lamp under the dark shape of the rider  behold the illustrious capataz de cargadores said decoud gently coming in all his splendour after his work is done the next great man of sulaco after don carlos gould but he is goodnatured and let me make friends with him  ah indeed said antonia how did you make friends  a journalist ought to have his finger on the popular pulse and this man is one of the leaders of the populace a journalist ought to know remarkable menand this man is remarkable in his way  ah yes said antonia thoughtfully it is known that this italian has a great influence  the horseman had passed below them with a gleam of dim light on the shining broad quarters of the grey mare on a bright heavy stirrup on a long silver spur but the short flick of yellowish flame in the dusk was powerless against the muffledup mysteriousness of the dark figure with an invisible face concealed by a great sombrero  decoud and antonia remained leaning over the balcony side by side touching elbows with their heads overhanging the darkness of the street and the brilliantly lighted sala at their backs this was a teteatete of extreme impropriety something of which in the whole extent of the republic only the extraordinary antonia could be capablethe poor motherless girl never accompanied with a careless father who had thought only of making her learned even decoud himself seemed to feel that this was as much as he could expect of having her to himself tilltill the revolution was over and he could carry her off to europe away from the endlessness of civil strife whose folly seemed even harder to bear than its ignominy after one montero there would be another the lawlessness of a populace of all colours and races barbarism irremediable tyranny as the great liberator bolivar had said in the bitterness of his spirit america is ungovernable those who worked for her independence have ploughed the sea he did not care he declared boldly he seized every opportunity to tell her that though she had managed to make a blanco journalist of him he was no patriot first of all the word had no sense for cultured minds to whom the narrowness of every belief is odious and secondly in connection with the everlasting troubles of this unhappy country it was hopelessly besmirched it had been the cry of dark barbarism the cloak of lawlessness of crimes of rapacity of simple thieving  he was surprised at the warmth of his own utterance he had no need to drop his voice it had been low all the time a mere murmur in the silence of dark houses with their shutters closed early against the night air as is the custom of sulaco only the sala of the casa gould flung out defiantly the blaze of its four windows the bright appeal of light in the whole dumb obscurity of the street and the murmur on the little balcony went on after a short pause  but we are labouring to change all that antonia protested it is exactly what we desire it is our object it is the great cause and the word you despise has stood also for sacrifice for courage for constancy for suffering papa who  ploughing the sea interrupted decoud looking down  there was below the sound of hasty and ponderous footsteps  your uncle the grandvicar of the cathedral has just turned under the gate observed decoud he said mass for the troops in the plaza this morning they had built for him an altar of drums you know and they brought outside all the painted blocks to take the air all the wooden saints stood militarily in a row at the top of the great flight of steps they looked like a gorgeous escort attending the vicargeneral i saw the great function from the windows of the porvenir he is amazing your uncle the last of the corbelans he glittered exceedingly in his vestments with a great crimson velvet cross down his back and all the time our saviour barrios sat in the amarilla club drinking punch at an open window esprit fortour barrios i expected every moment your uncle to launch an excommunication there and then at the black eyepatch in the window across the plaza but not at all ultimately the troops marched off later barrios came down with some of the officers and stood with his uniform all unbuttoned discoursing at the edge of the pavement suddenly your uncle appeared no longer glittering but all black at the cathedral door with that threatening aspect he hasyou know like a sort of avenging spirit he gives one look strides over straight at the group of uniforms and leads away the general by the elbow he walked him for a quarter of an hour in the shade of a wall never let go his elbow for a moment talking all the time with exaltation and gesticulating with a long black arm it was a curious scene the officers seemed struck with astonishment remarkable man your missionary uncle he hates an infidel much less than a heretic and prefers a heathen many times to an infidel he condescends graciously to call me a heathen sometimes you know  antonia listened with her hands over the balustrade opening and shutting the fan gently and decoud talked a little nervously as if afraid that she would leave him at the first pause their comparative isolation the precious sense of intimacy the slight contact of their arms affected him softly for now and then a tender inflection crept into the flow of his ironic murmurs  any slight sign of favour from a relative of yours is welcome antonia and perhaps he understands me after all but i know him too our padre corbelan the idea of political honour justice and honesty for him consists in the restitution of the confiscated church property nothing else could have drawn that fierce converter of savage indians out of the wilds to work for the ribierist cause nothing else but that wild hope he would make a pronunciamiento himself for such an object against any government if he could only get followers what does don carlos gould think of that but of course with his english impenetrability nobody can tell what he thinks probably he thinks of nothing apart from his mine of his imperium in imperio as to mrs gould she thinks of her schools of her hospitals of the mothers with the young babies of every sick old man in the three villages if you were to turn your head now you would see her extracting a report from that sinister doctor in a check shirtwhats his name monyghamor else catechising don pepe or perhaps listening to padre roman they are all down here todayall her ministers of state well she is a sensible woman and perhaps don carlos is a sensible man its a part of solid english sense not to think too much to see only what may be of practical use at the moment these people are not like ourselves we have no political reason we have political passionssometimes what is a conviction a particular view of our personal advantage either practical or emotional no one is a patriot for nothing the word serves us well but i am clearsighted and i shall not use that word to you antonia i have no patriotic illusions i have only the supreme illusion of a lover  he paused then muttered almost inaudibly that can lead one very far though  behind their backs the political tide that once in every twentyfour hours set with a strong flood through the gould drawingroom could be heard rising higher in a hum of voices men had been dropping in singly or in twos and threes the higher officials of the province engineers of the railway sunburnt and in tweeds with the frosted head of their chief smiling with slow humorous indulgence amongst the young eager faces scarfe the lover of fandangos had already slipped out in search of some dance no matter where on the outskirts of the town don juste lopez after taking his daughters home had entered solemnly in a black creased coat buttoned up under his spreading brown beard the few members of the provincial assembly present clustered at once around their president to discuss the news of the war and the last proclamation of the rebel montero the miserable montero calling in the name of a justly incensed democracy upon all the provincial assemblies of the republic to suspend their sittings till his sword had made peace and the will of the people could be consulted it was practically an invitation to dissolve an unheardof audacity of that evil madman  the indignation ran high in the knot of deputies behind jose avellanos don jose lifting up his voice cried out to them over the high back of his chair sulaco has answered by sending today an army upon his flank if all the other provinces show only half as much patriotism as we occidentals  a great outburst of acclamations covered the vibrating treble of the life and soul of the party yes yes this was true a great truth sulaco was in the forefront as ever it was a boastful tumult the hopefulness inspired by the event of the day breaking out amongst those caballeros of the campo thinking of their herds of their lands of the safety of their families everything was at stake    no it was impossible that montero should succeed this criminal this shameless indio the clamour continued for some time everybody else in the room looking towards the group where don juste had put on his air of impartial solemnity as if presiding at a sitting of the provincial assembly decoud had turned round at the noise and leaning his back on the balustrade shouted into the room with all the strength of his lungs gran bestia  this unexpected cry had the effect of stilling the noise all the eyes were directed to the window with an approving expectation but decoud had already turned his back upon the room and was again leaning out over the quiet street  this is the quintessence of my journalism that is the supreme argument he said to antonia i have invented this definition this last word on a great question but i am no patriot i am no more of a patriot than the capataz of the sulaco cargadores this genoese who has done such great things for this harbourthis active usherin of the material implements for our progress you have heard captain mitchell confess over and over again that till he got this man he could never tell how long it would take to unload a ship that is bad for progress you have seen him pass by after his labours on his famous horse to dazzle the girls in some ballroom with an earthen floor he is a fortunate fellow his work is an exercise of personal powers his leisure is spent in receiving the marks of extraordinary adulation and he likes it too can anybody be more fortunate to be feared and admired is  and are these your highest aspirations don martin interrupted antonia  i was speaking of a man of that sort said decoud curtly the heroes of the world have been feared and admired what more could he want  decoud had often felt his familiar habit of ironic thought fall shattered against antonias gravity she irritated him as if she too had suffered from that inexplicable feminine obtuseness which stands so often between a man and a woman of the more ordinary sort but he overcame his vexation at once he was very far from thinking antonia ordinary whatever verdict his scepticism might have pronounced upon himself with a touch of penetrating tenderness in his voice he assured her that his only aspiration was to a felicity so high that it seemed almost unrealizable on this earth  she coloured invisibly with a warmth against which the breeze from the sierra seemed to have lost its cooling power in the sudden melting of the snows his whisper could not have carried so far though there was enough ardour in his tone to melt a heart of ice antonia turned away abruptly as if to carry his whispered assurance into the room behind full of light noisy with voices  the tide of political speculation was beating high within the four walls of the great sala as if driven beyond the marks by a great gust of hope don justes fanshaped beard was still the centre of loud and animated discussions there was a selfconfident ring in all the voices even the few europeans around charles goulda dane a couple of frenchmen a discreet fat german smiling with downcast eyes the representatives of those material interests that had got a footing in sulaco under the protecting might of the san tome minehad infused a lot of good humour into their deference charles gould to whom they were paying their court was the visible sign of the stability that could be achieved on the shifting ground of revolutions they felt hopeful about their various undertakings one of the two frenchmen small black with glittering eyes lost in an immense growth of bushy beard waved his tiny brown hands and delicate wrists he had been travelling in the interior of the province for a syndicate of european capitalists his forcible monsieur ladministrateur returning every minute shrilled above the steady hum of conversations he was relating his discoveries he was ecstatic charles gould glanced down at him courteously  at a given moment of these necessary receptions it was mrs goulds habit to withdraw quietly into a little drawingroom especially her own next to the great sala she had risen and waiting for antonia listened with a slightly worried graciousness to the engineerinchief of the railway who stooped over her relating slowly without the slightest gesture something apparently amusing for his eyes had a humorous twinkle antonia before she advanced into the room to join mrs gould turned her head over her shoulder towards decoud only for a moment  why should any one of us think his aspirations unrealizable she said rapidly  i am going to cling to mine to the end antonia he answered through clenched teeth then bowed very low a little distantly  the engineerinchief had not finished telling his amusing story the humours of railway building in south america appealed to his keen appreciation of the absurd and he told his instances of ignorant prejudice and as ignorant cunning very well now mrs gould gave him all her attention as he walked by her side escorting the ladies out of the room finally all three passed unnoticed through the glass doors in the gallery only a tall priest stalking silently in the noise of the sala checked himself to look after them father corbelan whom decoud had seen from the balcony turning into the gateway of the casa gould had addressed no one since coming in the long skimpy soutane accentuated the tallness of his stature he carried his powerful torso thrown forward and the straight black bar of his joined eyebrows the pugnacious outline of the bony face the white spot of a scar on the bluish shaven cheeks a testimonial to his apostolic zeal from a party of unconverted indians suggested something unlawful behind his priesthood the idea of a chaplain of bandits  he separated his bony knotted hands clasped behind his back to shake his finger at martin  decoud had stepped into the room after antonia but he did not go far he had remained just within against the curtain with an expression of not quite genuine gravity like a grownup person taking part in a game of children he gazed quietly at the threatening finger  i have watched your reverence converting general barrios by a special sermon on the plaza he said without making the slightest movement  what miserable nonsense father corbelans deep voice resounded all over the room making all the heads turn on the shoulders the man is a drunkard senores the god of your general is a bottle  his contemptuous arbitrary voice caused an uneasy suspension of every sound as if the selfconfidence of the gathering had been staggered by a blow but nobody took up father corbelans declaration  it was known that father corbelan had come out of the wilds to advocate the sacred rights of the church with the same fanatical fearlessness with which he had gone preaching to bloodthirsty savages devoid of human compassion or worship of any kind rumours of legendary proportions told of his successes as a missionary beyond the eye of christian men he had baptized whole nations of indians living with them like a savage himself it was related that the padre used to ride with his indians for days half naked carrying a bullockhide shield and no doubt a long lance toowho knows that he had wandered clothed in skins seeking for proselytes somewhere near the snow line of the cordillera of these exploits padre corbelan himself was never known to talk but he made no secret of his opinion that the politicians of sta marta had harder hearts and more corrupt minds than the heathen to whom he had carried the word of god his injudicious zeal for the temporal welfare of the church was damaging the ribierist cause it was common knowledge that he had refused to be made titular bishop of the occidental diocese till justice was done to a despoiled church the political gefe of sulaco the same dignitary whom captain mitchell saved from the mob afterwards hinted with naive cynicism that doubtless their excellencies the ministers sent the padre over the mountains to sulaco in the worst season of the year in the hope that he would be frozen to death by the icy blasts of the high paramos every year a few hardy muleteersmen inured to exposurewere known to perish in that way but what would you have their excellencies possibly had not realized what a tough priest he was meantime the ignorant were beginning to murmur that the ribierist reforms meant simply the taking away of the land from the people some of it was to be given to foreigners who made the railway the greater part was to go to the padres  these were the results of the grand vicars zeal even from the short allocution to the troops on the plaza which only the first ranks could have heard he had not been able to keep out his fixed idea of an outraged church waiting for reparation from a penitent country the political gefe had been exasperated but he could not very well throw the brotherinlaw of don jose into the prison of the cabildo the chief magistrate an easygoing and popular official visited the casa gould walking over after sunset from the intendencia unattended acknowledging with dignified courtesy the salutations of high and low alike that evening he had walked up straight to charles gould and had hissed out to him that he would have liked to deport the grand vicar out of sulaco anywhere to some desert island to the isabels for instance the one without water preferablyeh don carlos he had added in a tone between jest and earnest this uncontrollable priest who had rejected his offer of the episcopal palace for a residence and preferred to hang his shabby hammock amongst the rubble and spiders of the sequestrated dominican convent had taken into his head to advocate an unconditional pardon for hernandez the robber and this was not enough he seemed to have entered into communication with the most audacious criminal the country had known for years the sulaco police knew of course what was going on padre corbelan had got hold of that reckless italian the capataz de cargadores the only man fit for such an errand and had sent a message through him father corbelan had studied in rome and could speak italian the capataz was known to visit the old dominican convent at night an old woman who served the grand vicar had heard the name of hernandez pronounced and only last saturday afternoon the capataz had been observed galloping out of town he did not return for two days the police would have laid the italian by the heels if it had not been for fear of the cargadores a turbulent body of men quite apt to raise a tumult nowadays it was not so easy to govern sulaco bad characters flocked into it attracted by the money in the pockets of the railway workmen the populace was made restless by father corbelans discourses and the first magistrate explained to charles gould that now the province was stripped of troops any outbreak of lawlessness would find the authorities with their boots off as it were  then he went away moodily to sit in an armchair smoking a long thin cigar not very far from don jose with whom bending over sideways he exchanged a few words from time to time he ignored the entrance of the priest and whenever father corbelans voice was raised behind him he shrugged his shoulders impatiently  father corbelan had remained quite motionless for a time with that something vengeful in his immobility which seemed to characterize all his attitudes a lurid glow of strong convictions gave its peculiar aspect to the black figure but its fierceness became softened as the padre fixing his eyes upon decoud raised his long black arm slowly impressively  and youyou are a perfect heathen he said in a subdued deep voice  he made a step nearer pointing a forefinger at the young mans breast decoud very calm felt the wall behind the curtain with the back of his head then with his chin tilted well up he smiled  very well he agreed with the slightly weary nonchalance of a man well used to these passages but is it perhaps that you have not discovered yet what is the god of my worship it was an easier task with our barrios  the priest suppressed a gesture of discouragement you believe neither in stick nor stone he said  nor bottle added decoud without stirring neither does the other of your reverences confidants i mean the capataz of the cargadores he does not drink your reading of my character does honour to your perspicacity but why call me a heathen  true retorted the priest you are ten times worse a miracle could not convert you  i certainly do not believe in miracles said decoud quietly father corbelan shrugged his high broad shoulders doubtfully  a sort of frenchmangodlessa materialist he pronounced slowly as if weighing the terms of a careful analysis neither the son of his own country nor of any other he continued thoughtfully  scarcely human in fact decoud commented under his breath his head at rest against the wall his eyes gazing up at the ceiling  the victim of this faithless age father corbelan resumed in a deep but subdued voice  but of some use as a journalist decoud changed his pose and spoke in a more animated tone has your worship neglected to read the last number of the porvenir i assure you it is just like the others on the general policy it continues to call montero a gran bestia and stigmatize his brother the guerrillero for a combination of lackey and spy what could be more effective in local affairs it urges the provincial government to enlist bodily into the national army the band of hernandez the robberwho is apparently the protege of the churchor at least of the grand vicar nothing could be more sound  the priest nodded and turned on the heels of his squaretoed shoes with big steel buckles again with his hands clasped behind his back he paced to and fro planting his feet firmly when he swung about the skirt of his soutane was inflated slightly by the brusqueness of his movements  the great sala had been emptying itself slowly when the gefe politico rose to go most of those still remaining stood up suddenly in sign of respect and don jose avellanos stopped the rocking of his chair but the goodnatured first official made a deprecatory gesture waved his hand to charles gould and went out discreetly  in the comparative peace of the room the screaming monsieur ladministrateur of the frail hairy frenchman seemed to acquire a preternatural shrillness the explorer of the capitalist syndicate was still enthusiastic ten million dollars worth of copper practically in sight monsieur ladministrateur ten millions in sight and a railway cominga railway they will never believe my report cest trop beau he fell a prey to a screaming ecstasy in the midst of sagely nodding heads before charles goulds imperturbable calm  and only the priest continued his pacing flinging round the skirt of his soutane at each end of his beat decoud murmured to him ironically those gentlemen talk about their gods  father corbelan stopped short looked at the journalist of sulaco fixedly for a moment shrugged his shoulders slightly and resumed his plodding walk of an obstinate traveller  and now the europeans were dropping off from the group around charles gould till the administrador of the great silver mine could be seen in his whole lank length from head to foot left stranded by the ebbing tide of his guests on the great square of carpet as it were a multicoloured shoal of flowers and arabesques under his brown boots father corbelan approached the rockingchair of don jose avellanos  come brother he said with kindly brusqueness and a touch of relieved impatience a man may feel at the end of a perfectly useless ceremony a la casa a la casa this has been all talk let us now go and think and pray for guidance from heaven  he rolled his black eyes upwards by the side of the frail diplomatistthe life and soul of the partyhe seemed gigantic with a gleam of fanaticism in the glance but the voice of the party or rather its mouthpiece the son decoud from paris turned journalist for the sake of antonias eyes knew very well that it was not so that he was only a strenuous priest with one idea feared by the women and execrated by the men of the people martin decoud the dilettante in life imagined himself to derive an artistic pleasure from watching the picturesque extreme of wrongheadedness into which an honest almost sacred conviction may drive a man it is like madness it must bebecause its selfdestructive decoud had said to himself often it seemed to him that every conviction as soon as it became effective turned into that form of dementia the gods send upon those they wish to destroy but he enjoyed the bitter flavour of that example with the zest of a connoisseur in the art of his choice those two men got on well together as if each had felt respectively that a masterful conviction as well as utter scepticism may lead a man very far on the bypaths of political action  don jose obeyed the touch of the big hairy hand decoud followed out the brothersinlaw and there remained only one visitor in the vast empty sala bluishly hazy with tobacco smoke a heavyeyed roundcheeked man with a drooping moustache a hide merchant from esmeralda who had come overland to sulaco riding with a few peons across the coast range he was very full of his journey undertaken mostly for the purpose of seeing the senor administrador of san tome in relation to some assistance he required in his hideexporting business he hoped to enlarge it greatly now that the country was going to be settled it was going to be settled he repeated several times degrading by a strange anxious whine the sonority of the spanish language which he pattered rapidly like some sort of cringing jargon a plain man could carry on his little business now in the country and even think of enlarging itwith safety was it not so he seemed to beg charles gould for a confirmatory word a grunt of assent a simple nod even  he could get nothing his alarm increased and in the pauses he would dart his eyes here and there then loth to give up he would branch off into feeling allusion to the dangers of his journey the audacious hernandez leaving his usual haunts had crossed the campo of sulaco and was known to be lurking in the ravines of the coast range yesterday when distant only a few hours from sulaco the hide merchant and his servants had seen three men on the road arrested suspiciously with their horses heads together two of these rode off at once and disappeared in a shallow quebrada to the left we stopped continued the man from esmeralda and i tried to hide behind a small bush but none of my mozos would go forward to find out what it meant and the third horseman seemed to be waiting for us to come up it was no use we had been seen so we rode slowly on trembling he let us passa man on a grey horse with his hat down on his eyeswithout a word of greeting but byandby we heard him galloping after us we faced about but that did not seem to intimidate him he rode up at speed and touching my foot with the toe of his boot asked me for a cigar with a bloodcurdling laugh he did not seem armed but when he put his hand back to reach for the matches i saw an enormous revolver strapped to his waist i shuddered he had very fierce whiskers don carlos and as he did not offer to go on we dared not move at last blowing the smoke of my cigar into the air through his nostrils he said senor it would be perhaps better for you if i rode behind your party you are not very far from sulaco now go you with god what would you we went on there was no resisting him he might have been hernandez himself though my servant who has been many times to sulaco by sea assured me that he had recognized him very well for the capataz of the steamship companys cargadores later that same evening i saw that very man at the corner of the plaza talking to a girl a morenita who stood by the stirrup with her hand on the grey horses mane  i assure you senor hirsch murmured charles gould that you ran no risk on this occasion  that may be senor though i tremble yet a most fierce manto look at and what does it mean a person employed by the steamship company talking with salteadoresno less senor the other horsemen were salteadoresin a lonely place and behaving like a robber himself a cigar is nothing but what was there to prevent him asking me for my purse  no no senor hirsch charles gould murmured letting his glance stray away a little vacantly from the round face with its hooked beak upturned towards him in an almost childlike appeal if it was the capataz de cargadores you metand there is no doubt is thereyou were perfectly safe  thank you you are very good a very fiercelooking man don carlos he asked me for a cigar in a most familiar manner what would have happened if i had not had a cigar i shudder yet what business had he to be talking with robbers in a lonely place  but charles gould openly preoccupied now gave not a sign made no sound the impenetrability of the embodied gould concession had its surface shades to be dumb is merely a fatal affliction but the king of sulaco had words enough to give him all the mysterious weight of a taciturn force his silences backed by the power of speech had as many shades of significance as uttered words in the way of assent of doubt of negationeven of simple comment some seemed to say plainly think it over others meant clearly go ahead a simple low i see with an affirmative nod at the end of a patient listening halfhour was the equivalent of a verbal contract which men had learned to trust implicitly since behind it all there was the great san tome mine the head and front of the material interests so strong that it depended on no mans goodwill in the whole length and breadth of the occidental provincethat is on no goodwill which it could not buy ten times over but to the little hooknosed man from esmeralda anxious about the export of hides the silence of charles gould portended a failure evidently this was no time for extending a modest mans business he enveloped in a swift mental malediction the whole country with all its inhabitants partisans of ribiera and montero alike and there were incipient tears in his mute anger at the thought of the innumerable oxhides going to waste upon the dreamy expanse of the campo with its single palms rising like ships at sea within the perfect circle of the horizon its clumps of heavy timber motionless like solid islands of leaves above the running waves of grass there were hides there rotting with no profit to anybodyrotting where they had been dropped by men called away to attend the urgent necessities of political revolutions the practical mercantile soul of senor hirsch rebelled against all that foolishness while he was taking a respectful but disconcerted leave of the might and majesty of the san tome mine in the person of charles gould he could not restrain a heartbroken murmur wrung out of his very aching heart as it were  it is a great great foolishness don carlos all this the price of hides in hamburg is gone upup of course the ribierist government will do away with all thatwhen it gets established firmly meantime  he sighed  yes meantime repeated charles gould inscrutably  the other shrugged his shoulders but he was not ready to go yet there was a little matter he would like to mention very much if permitted it appeared he had some good friends in hamburg he murmured the name of the firm who were very anxious to do business in dynamite he explained a contract for dynamite with the san tome mine and then perhaps later on other mines which were sure tothe little man from esmeralda was ready to enlarge but charles interrupted him it seemed as though the patience of the senor administrador was giving way at last  senor hirsch he said i have enough dynamite stored up at the mountain to send it down crashing into the valleyhis voice rose a littleto send half sulaco into the air if i liked  charles gould smiled at the round startled eyes of the dealer in hides who was murmuring hastily just so just so and now he was going it was impossible to do business in explosives with an administrador so well provided and so discouraging he had suffered agonies in the saddle and had exposed himself to the atrocities of the bandit hernandez for nothing at all neither hides nor dynamiteand the very shoulders of the enterprising israelite expressed dejection at the door he bowed low to the engineerinchief but at the bottom of the stairs in the patio he stopped short with his podgy hand over his lips in an attitude of meditative astonishment  what does he want to keep so much dynamite for he muttered and why does he talk like this to me  the engineerinchief looking in at the door of the empty sala whence the political tide had ebbed out to the last insignificant drop nodded familiarly to the master of the house standing motionless like a tall beacon amongst the deserted shoals of furniture  goodnight i am going got my bike downstairs the railway will know where to go for dynamite should we get short at any time we have done cutting and chopping for a while now we shall begin soon to blast our way through  dont come to me said charles gould with perfect serenity i shant have an ounce to spare for anybody not an ounce not for my own brother if i had a brother and he were the engineerinchief of the most promising railway in the world  whats that asked the engineerinchief with equanimity unkindness  no said charles gould stolidly policy  radical i should think the engineerinchief observed from the doorway  is that the right name charles gould said from the middle of the room  i mean going to the roots you know the engineer explained with an air of enjoyment  why yes charles pronounced slowly the gould concession has struck such deep roots in this country in this province in that gorge of the mountains that nothing but dynamite shall be allowed to dislodge it from there its my choice its my last card to play  the engineerinchief whistled low a pretty game he said with a shade of discretion and have you told holroyd of that extraordinary trump card you hold in your hand  card only when its played when it falls at the end of the game till then you may call it aa  weapon suggested the railway man  no you may call it rather an argument corrected charles gould gently and thats how ive presented it to mr holroyd  and what did he say to it asked the engineer with undisguised interest  hecharles gould spoke after a slight pausehe said something about holding on like grim death and putting our trust in god i should imagine he must have been rather startled but thenpursued the administrador of the san tome minebut then he is very far away you know and as they say in this country god is very high above  the engineers appreciative laugh died away down the stairs where the madonna with the child on her arm seemed to look after his shaking broad back from her shallow niche    chapter six  a profound stillness reigned in the casa gould the master of the house walking along the corredor opened the door of his room and saw his wife sitting in a big armchairhis own smoking armchairthoughtful contemplating her little shoes and she did not raise her eyes when he walked in  tired asked charles gould  a little said mrs gould still without looking up she added with feeling there is an awful sense of unreality about all this  charles gould before the long table strewn with papers on which lay a hunting crop and a pair of spurs stood looking at his wife the heat and dust must have been awful this afternoon by the waterside he murmured sympathetically the glare on the water must have been simply terrible  one could close ones eyes to the glare said mrs gould but my dear charley it is impossible for me to close my eyes to our position to this awful     she raised her eyes and looked at her husbands face from which all sign of sympathy or any other feeling had disappeared why dont you tell me something she almost wailed  i thought you had understood me perfectly from the first charles gould said slowly i thought we had said all there was to say a long time ago there is nothing to say now there were things to be done we have done them we have gone on doing them there is no going back now i dont suppose that even from the first there was really any possible way back and whats more we cant even afford to stand still  ah if one only knew how far you mean to go said his wife inwardly trembling but in an almost playful tone  any distance any length of course was the answer in a matteroffact tone which caused mrs gould to make another effort to repress a shudder  she stood up smiling graciously and her little figure seemed to be diminished still more by the heavy mass of her hair and the long train of her gown  but always to success she said persuasively  charles gould enveloping her in the steely blue glance of his attentive eyes answered without hesitation  oh there is no alternative  he put an immense assurance into his tone as to the words this was all that his conscience would allow him to say  mrs goulds smile remained a shade too long upon her lips she murmured  i will leave you ive a slight headache the heat the dust were indeedi suppose you are going back to the mine before the morning  at midnight said charles gould we are bringing down the silver tomorrow then i shall take three whole days off in town with you  ah you are going to meet the escort i shall be on the balcony at five oclock to see you pass till then goodbye  charles gould walked rapidly round the table and seizing her hands bent down pressing them both to his lips before he straightened himself up again to his full height she had disengaged one to smooth his cheek with a light touch as if he were a little boy  try to get some rest for a couple of hours she murmured with a glance at a hammock stretched in a distant part of the room her long train swished softly after her on the red tiles at the door she looked back  two big lamps with unpolished glass globes bathed in a soft and abundant light the four white walls of the room with a glass case of arms the brass hilt of henry goulds cavalry sabre on its square of velvet and the watercolour sketch of the san tome gorge and mrs gould gazing at the last in its black wooden frame sighed out  ah if we had left it alone charley  no charles gould said moodily it was impossible to leave it alone  perhaps it was impossible mrs gould admitted slowly her lips quivered a little but she smiled with an air of dainty bravado we have disturbed a good many snakes in that paradise charley havent we  yes i remember said charles gould it was don pepe who called the gorge the paradise of snakes no doubt we have disturbed a great many but remember my dear that it is not now as it was when you made that sketch he waved his hand towards the small watercolour hanging alone upon the great bare wall it is no longer a paradise of snakes we have brought mankind into it and we cannot turn our backs upon them to go and begin a new life elsewhere  he confronted his wife with a firm concentrated gaze which mrs gould returned with a brave assumption of fearlessness before she went out closing the door gently after her  in contrast with the white glaring room the dimly lit corredor had a restful mysteriousness of a forest glade suggested by the stems and the leaves of the plants ranged along the balustrade of the open side in the streaks of light falling through the open doors of the receptionrooms the blossoms white and red and pale lilac came out vivid with the brilliance of flowers in a stream of sunshine and mrs gould passing on had the vividness of a figure seen in the clear patches of sun that chequer the gloom of open glades in the woods the stones in the rings upon her hand pressed to her forehead glittered in the lamplight abreast of the door of the sala  whos there she asked in a startled voice is that you basilio she looked in and saw martin decoud walking about with an air of having lost something amongst the chairs and tables  antonia has forgotten her fan in here said decoud with a strange air of distraction so i entered to see  but even as he said this he had obviously given up his search and walked straight towards mrs gould who looked at him with doubtful surprise  senora he began in a low voice  what is it don martin asked mrs gould and then she added with a slight laugh i am so nervous today as if to explain the eagerness of the question  nothing immediately dangerous said decoud who now could not conceal his agitation pray dont distress yourself no really you must not distress yourself  mrs gould with her candid eyes very wide open her lips composed into a smile was steadying herself with a little bejewelled hand against the side of the door  perhaps you dont know how alarming you are appearing like this unexpectedly  i alarming he protested sincerely vexed and surprised i assure you that i am not in the least alarmed myself a fan is lost well it will be found again but i dont think it is here it is a fan i am looking for i cannot understand how antonia couldwell have you found it amigo  no senor said behind mrs gould the soft voice of basilio the head servant of the casa i dont think the senorita could have left it in this house at all  go and look for it in the patio again go now my friend look for it on the steps under the gate examine every flagstone search for it till i come down again    that fellowhe addressed himself in english to mrs gouldis always stealing up behind ones back on his bare feet i set him to look for that fan directly i came in to justify my reappearance my sudden return  he paused and mrs gould said amiably you are always welcome she paused for a second too but i am waiting to learn the cause of your return  decoud affected suddenly the utmost nonchalance  i cant bear to be spied upon oh the cause yes there is a cause there is something else that is lost besides antonias favourite fan as i was walking home after seeing don jose and antonia to their house the capataz de cargadores riding down the street spoke to me  has anything happened to the violas inquired mrs gould  the violas you mean the old garibaldino who keeps the hotel where the engineers live nothing happened there the capataz said nothing of them he only told me that the telegraphist of the cable company was walking on the plaza bareheaded looking out for me there is news from the interior mrs gould i should rather say rumours of news  good news said mrs gould in a low voice  worthless i should think but if i must define them i would say bad they are to the effect that a two days battle had been fought near sta marta and that the ribierists are defeated it must have happened a few days agoperhaps a week the rumour has just reached cayta and the man in charge of the cable station there has telegraphed the news to his colleague here we might just as well have kept barrios in sulaco  whats to be done now murmured mrs gould  nothing hes at sea with the troops he will get to cayta in a couple of days time and learn the news there what he will do then who can say hold cayta offer his submission to montero disband his armythis last most likely and go himself in one of the osn companys steamers north or southto valparaiso or to san francisco no matter where our barrios has a great practice in exiles and repatriations which mark the points in the political game  decoud exchanging a steady stare with mrs gould added tentatively as it were and yet if we had could have been done  montero victorious completely victorious mrs gould breathed out in a tone of unbelief  a canard probably that sort of bird is hatched in great numbers in such times as these and even if it were true well let us put things at their worst let us say it is true  then everything is lost said mrs gould with the calmness of despair  suddenly she seemed to divine she seemed to see decouds tremendous excitement under its cloak of studied carelessness it was indeed becoming visible in his audacious and watchful stare in the curve halfreckless halfcontemptuous of his lips and a french phrase came upon them as if for this costaguanero of the boulevard that had been the only forcible language  non madame rien nest perdu  it electrified mrs gould out of her benumbed attitude and she said vivaciously  what would you think of doing  but already there was something of mockery in decouds suppressed excitement  what would you expect a true costaguanero to do another revolution of course on my word of honour mrs gould i believe i am a true hijo del pays a true son of the country whatever father corbelan may say and im not so much of an unbeliever as not to have faith in my own ideas in my own remedies in my own desires  yes said mrs gould doubtfully  you dont seem convinced decoud went on again in french say then in my passions  mrs gould received this addition unflinchingly to understand it thoroughly she did not require to hear his muttered assurance  there is nothing i would not do for the sake of antonia there is nothing i am not prepared to undertake there is no risk i am not ready to run  decoud seemed to find a fresh audacity in this voicing of his thoughts you would not believe me if i were to say that it is the love of the country which  she made a sort of discouraged protest with her arm as if to express that she had given up expecting that motive from any one  a sulaco revolution decoud pursued in a forcible undertone the great cause may be served here on the very spot of its inception in the place of its birth mrs gould  frowning and biting her lower lip thoughtfully she made a step away from the door  you are not going to speak to your husband decoud arrested her anxiously  but you will need his help  no doubt decoud admitted without hesitation everything turns upon the san tome mine but i would rather he didnt know anything as yet of mymy hopes  a puzzled look came upon mrs goulds face and decoud approaching explained confidentially  dont you see hes such an idealist  mrs gould flushed pink and her eyes grew darker at the same time  charley an idealist she said as if to herself wonderingly what on earth do you mean  yes conceded decoud its a wonderful thing to say with the sight of the san tome mine the greatest fact in the whole of south america perhaps before our very eyes but look even at that he has idealized this fact to a point he paused mrs gould are you aware to what point he has idealized the existence the worth the meaning of the san tome mine are you aware of it  he must have known what he was talking about  the effect he expected was produced mrs gould ready to take fire gave it up suddenly with a low little sound that resembled a moan  what do you know she asked in a feeble voice  nothing answered decoud firmly but then dont you see hes an englishman  well what of that asked mrs gould  simply that he cannot act or exist without idealizing every simple feeling desire or achievement he could not believe his own motives if he did not make them first a part of some fairy tale the earth is not quite good enough for him i fear do you excuse my frankness besides whether you excuse it or not it is part of the truth of things which hurts thewhat do you call themthe anglosaxons susceptibilities and at the present moment i dont feel as if i could treat seriously either his conception of things orif you allow me to say soor yet yours  mrs gould gave no sign of being offended i suppose antonia understands you thoroughly  understands well yes but i am not sure that she approves that however makes no difference i am honest enough to tell you that mrs gould  your idea of course is separation she said  separation of course declared martin yes separation of the whole occidental province from the rest of the unquiet body but my true idea the only one i care for is not to be separated from antonia  and that is all asked mrs gould without severity  absolutely i am not deceiving myself about my motives she wont leave sulaco for my sake therefore sulaco must leave the rest of the republic to its fate nothing could be clearer than that i like a clearly defined situation i cannot part with antonia therefore the one and indivisible republic of costaguana must be made to part with its western province fortunately it happens to be also a sound policy the richest the most fertile part of this land may be saved from anarchy personally i care little very little but its a fact that the establishment of montero in power would mean death to me in all the proclamations of general pardon which i have seen my name with a few others is specially excepted the brothers hate me as you know very well mrs gould and behold here is the rumour of them having won a battle you say that supposing it is true i have plenty of time to run away  the slight protesting murmur on the part of mrs gould made him pause for a moment while he looked at her with a sombre and resolute glance  ah but i would mrs gould i would run away if it served that which at present is my only desire i am courageous enough to say that and to do it too but women even our women are idealists it is antonia that wont run away a novel sort of vanity  you call it vanity said mrs gould in a shocked voice  say pride then which father corbelan would tell you is a mortal sin but i am not proud i am simply too much in love to run away at the same time i want to live there is no love for a dead man therefore it is necessary that sulaco should not recognize the victorious montero  and you think my husband will give you his support  i think he can be drawn into it like all idealists when he once sees a sentimental basis for his action but i wouldnt talk to him mere clear facts wont appeal to his sentiment it is much better for him to convince himself in his own way and frankly i could not perhaps just now pay sufficient respect to either his motives or even perhaps to yours mrs gould  it was evident that mrs gould was very determined not to be offended she smiled vaguely while she seemed to think the matter over as far as she could judge from the girls halfconfidences antonia understood that young man obviously there was promise of safety in his plan or rather in his idea moreover right or wrong the idea could do no harm and it was quite possible also that the rumour was false  you have some sort of a plan she said  simplicity itself barrios has started let him go on then he will hold cayta which is the door of the sea route to sulaco they cannot send a sufficient force over the mountains no not even to cope with the band of hernandez meantime we shall organize our resistance here and for that this very hernandez will be useful he has defeated troops as a bandit he will no doubt accomplish the same thing if he is made a colonel or even a general you know the country well enough not to be shocked by what i say mrs gould i have heard you assert that this poor bandit was the living breathing example of cruelty injustice stupidity and oppression that ruin mens souls as well as their fortunes in this country well there would be some poetical retribution in that man arising to crush the evils which had driven an honest ranchero into a life of crime a fine idea of retribution in that isnt there  decoud had dropped easily into english which he spoke with precision very correctly but with too many z sounds  think also of your hospitals of your schools of your ailing mothers and feeble old men of all that population which you and your husband have brought into the rocky gorge of san tome are you not responsible to your conscience for all these people is it not worth while to make another effort which is not at all so desperate as it looks rather than  decoud finished his thought with an upward toss of the arm suggesting annihilation and mrs gould turned away her head with a look of horror  why dont you say all this to my husband she asked without looking at decoud who stood watching the effect of his words  ah but don carlos is so english he began mrs gould interrupted  leave that alone don martin hes as much a costaguanerono hes more of a costaguanero than yourself  sentimentalist sentimentalist decoud almost cooed in a tone of gentle and soothing deference sentimentalist after the amazing manner of your people i have been watching el rey de sulaco since i came here on a fools errand and perhaps impelled by some treason of fate lurking behind the unaccountable turns of a mans life but i dont matter i am not a sentimentalist i cannot endow my personal desires with a shining robe of silk and jewels life is not for me a moral romance derived from the tradition of a pretty fairy tale no mrs gould i am practical i am not afraid of my motives but pardon me i have been rather carried away what i wish to say is that i have been observing i wont tell you what i have discovered  no that is unnecessary whispered mrs gould once more averting her head  it is except one little fact that your husband does not like me its a small matter which in the circumstances seems to acquire a perfectly ridiculous importance ridiculous and immense for clearly money is required for my plan he reflected then added meaningly and we have two sentimentalists to deal with  i dont know that i understand you don martin said mrs gould coldly preserving the low key of their conversation but speaking as if i did who is the other  the great holroyd in san francisco of course decoud whispered lightly i think you understand me very well women are idealists but then they are so perspicacious  but whatever was the reason of that remark disparaging and complimentary at the same time mrs gould seemed not to pay attention to it the name of holroyd had given a new tone to her anxiety  the silver escort is coming down to the harbour tomorrow a whole six months working don martin she cried in dismay  let it come down then breathed out decoud earnestly almost into her ear  but if the rumour should get about and especially if it turned out true troubles might break out in the town objected mrs gould  decoud admitted that it was possible he knew well the town children of the sulaco campo sullen thievish vindictive and bloodthirsty whatever great qualities their brothers of the plain might have had but then there was that other sentimentalist who attached a strangely idealistic meaning to concrete facts this stream of silver must be kept flowing north to return in the form of financial backing from the great house of holroyd up at the mountain in the strong room of the mine the silver bars were worth less for his purpose than so much lead from which at least bullets may be run let it come down to the harbour ready for shipment  the next northgoing steamer would carry it off for the very salvation of the san tome mine which had produced so much treasure and moreover the rumour was probably false he remarked with much conviction in his hurried tone  besides senora concluded decoud we may suppress it for many days i have been talking with the telegraphist in the middle of the plaza mayor thus i am certain that we could not have been overheard there was not even a bird in the air near us and also let me tell you something more i have been making friends with this man called nostromo the capataz we had a conversation this very evening i walking by the side of his horse as he rode slowly out of the town just now he promised me that if a riot took place for any reasoneven for the most political of reasons you understandhis cargadores an important part of the populace you will admit should be found on the side of the europeans  he has promised you that mrs gould inquired with interest what made him make that promise to you  upon my word i dont know declared decoud in a slightly surprised tone he certainly promised me that but now you ask me why i could not tell you his reasons he talked with his usual carelessness which if he had been anything else but a common sailor i would call a pose or an affectation  decoud interrupting himself looked at mrs gould curiously  upon the whole he continued i suppose he expects something to his advantage from it you mustnt forget that he does not exercise his extraordinary power over the lower classes without a certain amount of personal risk and without a great profusion in spending his money one must pay in some way or other for such a solid thing as individual prestige he told me after we made friends at a dance in a posada kept by a mexican just outside the walls that he had come here to make his fortune i suppose he looks upon his prestige as a sort of investment  perhaps he prizes it for its own sake mrs gould said in a tone as if she were repelling an undeserved aspersion viola the garibaldino with whom he has lived for some years calls him the incorruptible  ah he belongs to the group of your proteges out there towards the harbour mrs gould muy bien and captain mitchell calls him wonderful i have heard no end of tales of his strength his audacity his fidelity no end of fine things hm incorruptible it is indeed a name of honour for the capataz of the cargadores of sulaco incorruptible fine but vague however i suppose hes sensible too and i talked to him upon that sane and practical assumption  i prefer to think him disinterested and therefore trustworthy mrs gould said with the nearest approach to curtness it was in her nature to assume  well if so then the silver will be still more safe let it come down senora let it come down so that it may go north and return to us in the shape of credit  mrs gould glanced along the corredor towards the door of her husbands room decoud watching her as if she had his fate in her hands detected an almost imperceptible nod of assent he bowed with a smile and putting his hand into the breast pocket of his coat pulled out a fan of light feathers set upon painted leaves of sandalwood i had it in my pocket he murmured triumphantly for a plausible pretext he bowed again goodnight senora  mrs gould continued along the corredor away from her husbands room the fate of the san tome mine was lying heavy upon her heart it was a long time now since she had begun to fear it it had been an idea she had watched it with misgivings turning into a fetish and now the fetish had grown into a monstrous and crushing weight it was as if the inspiration of their early years had left her heart to turn into a wall of silverbricks erected by the silent work of evil spirits between her and her husband he seemed to dwell alone within a circumvallation of precious metal leaving her outside with her school her hospital the sick mothers and the feeble old men mere insignificant vestiges of the initial inspiration those poor people she murmured to herself  below she heard the voice of martin decoud in the patio speaking loudly  i have found dona antonias fan basilio look here it is    chapter seven  it was part of what decoud would have called his sane materialism that he did not believe in the possibility of friendship between man and woman  the one exception he allowed confirmed he maintained that absolute rule friendship was possible between brother and sister meaning by friendship the frank unreserve as before another human being of thoughts and sensations all the objectless and necessary sincerity of ones innermost life trying to react upon the profound sympathies of another existence  his favourite sister the handsome slightly arbitrary and resolute angel ruling the father and mother decoud in the firstfloor apartments of a very fine parisian house was the recipient of martin decouds confidences as to his thoughts actions purposes doubts and even failures     prepare our little circle in paris for the birth of another south american republic one more or less what does it matter they may come into the world like evil flowers on a hotbed of rotten institutions but the seed of this one has germinated in your brothers brain and that will be enough for your devoted assent i am writing this to you by the light of a single candle in a sort of inn near the harbour kept by an italian called viola a protege of mrs gould the whole building which for all i know may have been contrived by a conquistador farmer of the pearl fishery three hundred years ago is perfectly silent so is the plain between the town and the harbour silent but not so dark as the house because the pickets of italian workmen guarding the railway have lighted little fires all along the line it was not so quiet around here yesterday we had an awful riota sudden outbreak of the populace which was not suppressed till late today its object no doubt was loot and that was defeated as you may have learned already from the cablegram sent via san francisco and new york last night when the cables were still open you have read already there that the energetic action of the europeans of the railway has saved the town from destruction and you may believe that i wrote out the cable myself we have no reuters agency man here i have also fired at the mob from the windows of the club in company with some other young men of position our object was to keep the calle de la constitucion clear for the exodus of the ladies and children who have taken refuge on board a couple of cargo ships now in the harbour here that was yesterday you should also have learned from the cable that the missing president ribiera who had disappeared after the battle of sta marta has turned up here in sulaco by one of those strange coincidences that are almost incredible riding on a lame mule into the very midst of the street fighting it appears that he had fled in company of a muleteer called bonifacio across the mountains from the threats of montero into the arms of an enraged mob  the capataz of cargadores that italian sailor of whom i have written to you before has saved him from an ignoble death that man seems to have a particular talent for being on the spot whenever there is something picturesque to be done  he was with me at four oclock in the morning at the offices of the porvenir where he had turned up so early in order to warn me of the coming trouble and also to assure me that he would keep his cargadores on the side of order when the full daylight came we were looking together at the crowd on foot and on horseback demonstrating on the plaza and shying stones at the windows of the intendencia nostromo that is the name they call him by here was pointing out to me his cargadores interspersed in the mob  the sun shines late upon sulaco for it has first to climb above the mountains in that clear morning light brighter than twilight nostromo saw right across the vast plaza at the end of the street beyond the cathedral a mounted man apparently in difficulties with a yelling knot of leperos at once he said to me thats a stranger what is it they are doing to him then he took out the silver whistle he is in the habit of using on the wharf this man seems to disdain the use of any metal less precious than silver and blew into it twice evidently a preconcerted signal for his cargadores he ran out immediately and they rallied round him i ran out too but was too late to follow them and help in the rescue of the stranger whose animal had fallen i was set upon at once as a hated aristocrat and was only too glad to get into the club where don jaime berges you may remember him visiting at our house in paris some three years ago thrust a sporting gun into my hands they were already firing from the windows there were little heaps of cartridges lying about on the open cardtables i remember a couple of overturned chairs some bottles rolling on the floor amongst the packs of cards scattered suddenly as the caballeros rose from their game to open fire upon the mob most of the young men had spent the night at the club in the expectation of some such disturbance in two of the candelabra on the consoles the candles were burning down in their sockets a large iron nut probably stolen from the railway workshops flew in from the street as i entered and broke one of the large mirrors set in the wall i noticed also one of the club servants tied up hand and foot with the cords of the curtain and flung in a corner i have a vague recollection of don jaime assuring me hastily that the fellow had been detected putting poison into the dishes at supper but i remember distinctly he was shrieking for mercy without stopping at all continuously and so absolutely disregarded that nobody even took the trouble to gag him the noise he made was so disagreeable that i had half a mind to do it myself but there was no time to waste on such trifles i took my place at one of the windows and began firing  i didnt learn till later in the afternoon whom it was that nostromo with his cargadores and some italian workmen as well had managed to save from those drunken rascals that man has a peculiar talent when anything striking to the imagination has to be done i made that remark to him afterwards when we met after some sort of order had been restored in the town and the answer he made rather surprised me he said quite moodily and how much do i get for that senor then it dawned upon me that perhaps this mans vanity has been satiated by the adulation of the common people and the confidence of his superiors  decoud paused to light a cigarette then with his head still over his writing he blew a cloud of smoke which seemed to rebound from the paper he took up the pencil again  that was yesterday evening on the plaza while he sat on the steps of the cathedral his hands between his knees holding the bridle of his famous silvergrey mare he had led his body of cargadores splendidly all day long he looked fatigued i dont know how i looked very dirty i suppose but i suppose i also looked pleased from the time the fugitive president had been got off to the s s minerva the tide of success had turned against the mob they had been driven off the harbour and out of the better streets of the town into their own maze of ruins and tolderias you must understand that this riot whose primary object was undoubtedly the getting hold of the san tome silver stored in the lower rooms of the custom house besides the general looting of the ricos had acquired a political colouring from the fact of two deputies to the provincial assembly senores gamacho and fuentes both from bolson putting themselves at the head of itlate in the afternoon it is true when the mob disappointed in their hopes of loot made a stand in the narrow streets to the cries of viva la libertad down with feudalism i wonder what they imagine feudalism to be down with the goths and paralytics i suppose the senores gamacho and fuentes knew what they were doing they are prudent gentlemen in the assembly they called themselves moderates and opposed every energetic measure with philanthropic pensiveness at the first rumours of monteros victory they showed a subtle change of the pensive temper and began to defy poor don juste lopez in his presidential tribune with an effrontery to which the poor man could only respond by a dazed smoothing of his beard and the ringing of the presidential bell then when the downfall of the ribierist cause became confirmed beyond the shadow of a doubt they have blossomed into convinced liberals acting together as if they were siamese twins and ultimately taking charge as it were of the riot in the name of monterist principles  their last move of eight oclock last night was to organize themselves into a monterist committee which sits as far as i know in a posada kept by a retired mexican bullfighter a great politician too whose name i have forgotten thence they have issued a communication to us the goths and paralytics of the amarilla club who have our own committee inviting us to come to some provisional understanding for a truce in order they have the impudence to say that the noble cause of liberty should not be stained by the criminal excesses of conservative selfishness as i came out to sit with nostromo on the cathedral steps the club was busy considering a proper reply in the principal room littered with exploded cartridges with a lot of broken glass blood smears candlesticks and all sorts of wreckage on the floor but all this is nonsense nobody in the town has any real power except the railway engineers whose men occupy the dismantled houses acquired by the company for their town station on one side of the plaza and nostromo whose cargadores were sleeping under the arcades along the front of anzanis shops a fire of broken furniture out of the intendencia saloons mostly gilt was burning on the plaza in a high flame swaying right upon the statue of charles iv the dead body of a man was lying on the steps of the pedestal his arms thrown wide open and his sombrero covering his facethe attention of some friend perhaps the light of the flames touched the foliage of the first trees on the alameda and played on the end of a side street near by blocked up by a jumble of oxcarts and dead bullocks sitting on one of the carcasses a lepero muffled up smoked a cigarette it was a truce you understand the only other living being on the plaza besides ourselves was a cargador walking to and fro with a long bare knife in his hand like a sentry before the arcades where his friends were sleeping and the only other spot of light in the dark town were the lighted windows of the club at the corner of the calle  after having written so far don martin decoud the exotic dandy of the parisian boulevard got up and walked across the sanded floor of the cafe at one end of the albergo of united italy kept by giorgio viola the old companion of garibaldi the highly coloured lithograph of the faithful hero seemed to look dimly in the light of one candle at the man with no faith in anything except the truth of his own sensations looking out of the window decoud was met by a darkness so impenetrable that he could see neither the mountains nor the town nor yet the buildings near the harbour and there was not a sound as if the tremendous obscurity of the placid gulf spreading from the waters over the land had made it dumb as well as blind presently decoud felt a light tremor of the floor and a distant clank of iron a bright white light appeared deep in the darkness growing bigger with a thundering noise the rolling stock usually kept on the sidings in rincon was being run back to the yards for safe keeping like a mysterious stirring of the darkness behind the headlight of the engine the train passed in a gust of hollow uproar by the end of the house which seemed to vibrate all over in response and nothing was clearly visible but on the end of the last flat car a negro in white trousers and naked to the waist swinging a blazing torch basket incessantly with a circular movement of his bare arm decoud did not stir  behind him on the back of the chair from which he had risen hung his elegant parisian overcoat with a pearlgrey silk lining but when he turned back to come to the table the candlelight fell upon a face that was grimy and scratched his rosy lips were blackened with heat the smoke of gunpowder dirt and rust tarnished the lustre of his short beard his shirt collar and cuffs were crumpled the blue silken tie hung down his breast like a rag a greasy smudge crossed his white brow he had not taken off his clothing nor used water except to snatch a hasty drink greedily for some forty hours an awful restlessness had made him its own had marked him with all the signs of desperate strife and put a dry sleepless stare into his eyes he murmured to himself in a hoarse voice i wonder if theres any bread here looked vaguely about him then dropped into the chair and took the pencil up again he became aware he had not eaten anything for many hours  it occurred to him that no one could understand him so well as his sister in the most sceptical heart there lurks at such moments when the chances of existence are involved a desire to leave a correct impression of the feelings like a light by which the action may be seen when personality is gone gone where no light of investigation can ever reach the truth which every death takes out of the world therefore instead of looking for something to eat or trying to snatch an hour or so of sleep decoud was filling the pages of a large pocketbook with a letter to his sister  in the intimacy of that intercourse he could not keep out his weariness his great fatigue the close touch of his bodily sensations he began again as if he were talking to her with almost an illusion of her presence he wrote the phrase i am very hungry  i have the feeling of a great solitude around me he continued is it perhaps because i am the only man with a definite idea in his head in the complete collapse of every resolve intention and hope about me but the solitude is also very real all the engineers are out and have been for two days looking after the property of the national central railway of that great costaguana undertaking which is to put money into the pockets of englishmen frenchmen americans germans and god knows who else the silence about me is ominous there is above the middle part of this house a sort of first floor with narrow openings like loopholes for windows probably used in old times for the better defence against the savages when the persistent barbarism of our native continent did not wear the black coats of politicians but went about yelling halfnaked with bows and arrows in its hands the woman of the house is dying up there i believe all alone with her old husband there is a narrow staircase the sort of staircase one man could easily defend against a mob leading up there and i have just heard through the thickness of the wall the old fellow going down into their kitchen for something or other it was a sort of noise a mouse might make behind the plaster of a wall all the servants they had ran away yesterday and have not returned yet if ever they do for the rest there are only two children here two girls the father has sent them downstairs and they have crept into this cafe perhaps because i am here they huddle together in a corner in each others arms i just noticed them a few minutes ago and i feel more lonely than ever  decoud turned half round in his chair and asked is there any bread here  lindas dark head was shaken negatively in response above the fair head of her sister nestling on her breast  you couldnt get me some bread insisted decoud the child did not move he saw her large eyes stare at him very dark from the corner youre not afraid of me he said  no said linda we are not afraid of you you came here with gian battista  you mean nostromo said decoud  the english call him so but that is no name either for man or beast said the girl passing her hand gently over her sisters hair  but he lets people call him so remarked decoud  not in this house retorted the child  ah well i shall call him the capataz then  decoud gave up the point and after writing steadily for a while turned round again  when do you expect him back he asked  after he brought you here he rode off to fetch the senor doctor from the town for mother he will be back soon  he stands a good chance of getting shot somewhere on the road decoud murmured to himself audibly and linda declared in her highpitched voice  nobody would dare to fire a shot at gian battista  you believe that asked decoud do you  i know it said the child with conviction there is no one in this place brave enough to attack gian battista  it doesnt require much bravery to pull a trigger behind a bush muttered decoud to himself fortunately the night is dark or there would be but little chance of saving the silver of the mine  he turned again to his pocketbook glanced back through the pages and again started his pencil  that was the position yesterday after the minerva with the fugitive president had gone out of harbour and the rioters had been driven back into the side lanes of the town i sat on the steps of the cathedral with nostromo after sending out the cable message for the information of a more or less attentive world strangely enough though the offices of the cable company are in the same building as the porvenir the mob which has thrown my presses out of the window and scattered the type all over the plaza has been kept from interfering with the instruments on the other side of the courtyard as i sat talking with nostromo bernhardt the telegraphist came out from under the arcades with a piece of paper in his hand the little man had tied himself up to an enormous sword and was hung all over with revolvers he is ridiculous but the bravest german of his size that ever tapped the key of a morse transmitter he had received the message from cayta reporting the transports with barrioss army just entering the port and ending with the words the greatest enthusiasm prevails i walked off to drink some water at the fountain and i was shot at from the alameda by somebody hiding behind a tree but i drank and didnt care with barrios in cayta and the great cordillera between us and monteros victorious army i seemed notwithstanding messrs gamacho and fuentes to hold my new state in the hollow of my hand i was ready to sleep but when i got as far as the casa gould i found the patio full of wounded laid out on straw lights were burning and in that enclosed courtyard on that hot night a faint odour of chloroform and blood hung about at one end doctor monygham the doctor of the mine was dressing the wounds at the other near the stairs father corbelan kneeling listened to the confession of a dying cargador mrs gould was walking about through these shambles with a large bottle in one hand and a lot of cotton wool in the other she just looked at me and never even winked her camerista was following her also holding a bottle and sobbing gently to herself  i busied myself for some time in fetching water from the cistern for the wounded afterwards i wandered upstairs meeting some of the first ladies of sulaco paler than i had ever seen them before with bandages over their arms not all of them had fled to the ships a good many had taken refuge for the day in the casa gould on the landing a girl with her hair half down was kneeling against the wall under the niche where stands a madonna in blue robes and a gilt crown on her head i think it was the eldest miss lopez i couldnt see her face but i remember looking at the high french heel of her little shoe she did not make a sound she did not stir she was not sobbing she remained there perfectly still all black against the white wall a silent figure of passionate piety i am sure she was no more frightened than the other whitefaced ladies i met carrying bandages one was sitting on the top step tearing a piece of linen hastily into stripsthe young wife of an elderly man of fortune here she interrupted herself to wave her hand to my bow as though she were in her carriage on the alameda the women of our country are worth looking at during a revolution the rouge and pearl powder fall off together with that passive attitude towards the outer world which education tradition custom impose upon them from the earliest infancy i thought of your face which from your infancy had the stamp of intelligence instead of that patient and resigned cast which appears when some political commotion tears down the veil of cosmetics and usage  in the great sala upstairs a sort of junta of notables was sitting the remnant of the vanished provincial assembly don juste lopez had had half his beard singed off at the muzzle of a trabuco loaded with slugs of which every one missed him providentially and as he turned his head from side to side it was exactly as if there had been two men inside his frockcoat one nobly whiskered and solemn the other untidy and scared  they raised a cry of decoud don martin at my entrance i asked them what are you deliberating upon gentlemen there did not seem to be any president though don jose avellanos sat at the head of the table they all answered together on the preservation of life and property till the new officials arrive don juste explained to me with the solemn side of his face offered to my view it was as if a stream of water had been poured upon my glowing idea of a new state there was a hissing sound in my ears and the room grew dim as if suddenly filled with vapour  i walked up to the table blindly as though i had been drunk you are deliberating upon surrender i said they all sat still with their noses over the sheet of paper each had before him god only knows why only don jose hid his face in his hands muttering never never but as i looked at him it seemed to me that i could have blown him away with my breath he looked so frail so weak so worn out whatever happens he will not survive the deception is too great for a man of his age and hasnt he seen the sheets of fifty years of misrule which we have begun printing on the presses of the porvenir littering the plaza floating in the gutters fired out as wads for trabucos loaded with handfuls of type blown in the wind trampled in the mud i have seen pages floating upon the very waters of the harbour it would be unreasonable to expect him to survive it would be cruel  do you know i cried what surrender means to you to your women to your children to your property  i declaimed for five minutes without drawing breath it seems to me harping on our best chances on the ferocity of montero whom i made out to be as great a beast as i have no doubt he would like to be if he had intelligence enough to conceive a systematic reign of terror and then for another five minutes or more i poured out an impassioned appeal to their courage and manliness with all the passion of my love for antonia for if ever man spoke well it would be from a personal feeling denouncing an enemy defending himself or pleading for what really may be dearer than life my dear girl i absolutely thundered at them it seemed as if my voice would burst the walls asunder and when i stopped i saw all their scared eyes looking at me dubiously and that was all the effect i had produced only don joses head had sunk lower and lower on his breast i bent my ear to his withered lips and made out his whisper something like in gods name then martin my son i dont know exactly there was the name of god in it i am certain it seems to me i have caught his last breaththe breath of his departing soul on his lips  he lives yet it is true i have seen him since but it was only a senile body lying on its back covered to the chin with open eyes and so still that you might have said it was breathing no longer i left him thus with antonia kneeling by the side of the bed just before i came to this italians posada where the ubiquitous death is also waiting but i know that don jose has really died there in the casa gould with that whisper urging me to attempt what no doubt his soul wrapped up in the sanctity of diplomatic treaties and solemn declarations must have abhorred i had exclaimed very loud there is never any god in a country where men will not help themselves  meanwhile don juste had begun a pondered oration whose solemn effect was spoiled by the ridiculous disaster to his beard i did not wait to make it out he seemed to argue that monteros he called him the general intentions were probably not evil though he went on that distinguished man only a week ago we used to call him a gran bestia was perhaps mistaken as to the true means as you may imagine i didnt stay to hear the rest i know the intentions of monteros brother pedrito the guerrillero whom i exposed in paris some years ago in a cafe frequented by south american students where he tried to pass himself off for a secretary of legation he used to come in and talk for hours twisting his felt hat in his hairy paws and his ambition seemed to become a sort of duc de morny to a sort of napoleon already then he used to talk of his brother in inflated terms he seemed fairly safe from being found out because the students all of the blanco families did not as you may imagine frequent the legation it was only decoud a man without faith and principles as they used to say that went in there sometimes for the sake of the fun as it were to an assembly of trained monkeys i know his intentions i have seen him change the plates at table whoever is allowed to live on in terror i must die the death  no i didnt stay to the end to hear don juste lopez trying to persuade himself in a grave oration of the clemency and justice and honesty and purity of the brothers montero i went out abruptly to seek antonia i saw her in the gallery as i opened the door she extended to me her clasped hands  what are they doing in there she asked  talking i said with my eyes looking into hers  yes yes but  empty speeches i interrupted her hiding their fears behind imbecile hopes they are all great parliamentarians thereon the english model as you know i was so furious that i could hardly speak she made a gesture of despair  through the door i held a little ajar behind me we heard dun justes measured mouthing monotone go on from phrase to phrase like a sort of awful and solemn madness  after all the democratic aspirations have perhaps their legitimacy the ways of human progress are inscrutable and if the fate of the country is in the hand of montero we ought  i crashed the door to on that it was enough it was too much there was never a beautiful face expressing more horror and despair than the face of antonia i couldnt bear it i seized her wrists  have they killed my father in there she asked  her eyes blazed with indignation but as i looked on fascinated the light in them went out  it is a surrender i said and i remember i was shaking her wrists i held apart in my hands but its more than talk your father told me to go on in gods name  my dear girl there is that in antonia which would make me believe in the feasibility of anything one look at her face is enough to set my brain on fire and yet i love her as any other man wouldwith the heart and with that alone she is more to me than his church to father corbelan the grand vicar disappeared last night from the town perhaps gone to join the band of hernandez she is more to me than his precious mine to that sentimental englishman i wont speak of his wife she may have been sentimental once the san tome mine stands now between those two people your father himself antonia i repeated your father do you understand has told me to go on  she averted her face and in a pained voice  he has she cried then indeed i fear he will never speak again  she freed her wrists from my clutch and began to cry in her handkerchief i disregarded her sorrow i would rather see her miserable than not see her at all never any more for whether i escaped or stayed to die there was for us no coming together no future and that being so i had no pity to waste upon the passing moments of her sorrow i sent her off in tears to fetch dona emilia and don carlos too their sentiment was necessary to the very life of my plan the sentimentalism of the people that will never do anything for the sake of their passionate desire unless it comes to them clothed in the fair robes of an idea  late at night we formed a small junta of fourthe two women don carlos and myselfin mrs goulds blueandwhite boudoir  el rey de sulaco thinks himself no doubt a very honest man and so he is if one could look behind his taciturnity perhaps he thinks that this alone makes his honesty unstained those englishmen live on illusions which somehow or other help them to get a firm hold of the substance when he speaks it is by a rare yes or no that seems as impersonal as the words of an oracle but he could not impose on me by his dumb reserve i knew what he had in his head he has his mine in his head and his wife had nothing in her head but his precious person which he has bound up with the gould concession and tied up to that little womans neck no matter the thing was to make him present the affair to holroyd the steel and silver king in such a manner as to secure his financial support at that time last night just twentyfour hours ago we thought the silver of the mine safe in the custom house vaults till the northbound steamer came to take it away and as long as the treasure flowed north without a break that utter sentimentalist holroyd would not drop his idea of introducing not only justice industry peace to the benighted continents but also that pet dream of his of a purer form of christianity later on the principal european really in sulaco the engineerinchief of the railway came riding up the calle from the harbour and was admitted to our conclave meantime the junta of the notables in the great sala was still deliberating only one of them had run out in the corredor to ask the servant whether something to eat couldnt be sent in the first words the engineerinchief said as he came into the boudoir were what is your house dear mrs gould a war hospital below and apparently a restaurant above i saw them carrying trays full of good things into the sala  and here in this boudoir i said you behold the inner cabinet of the occidental republic that is to be  he was so preoccupied that he didnt smile at that he didnt even look surprised  he told us that he was attending to the general dispositions for the defence of the railway property at the railway yards when he was sent for to go into the railway telegraph office the engineer of the railhead at the foot of the mountains wanted to talk to him from his end of the wire there was nobody in the office but himself and the operator of the railway telegraph who read off the clicks aloud as the tape coiled its length upon the floor and the purport of that talk clicked nervously from a wooden shed in the depths of the forests had informed the chief that president ribiera had been or was being pursued this was news indeed to all of us in sulaco ribiera himself when rescued revived and soothed by us had been inclined to think that he had not been pursued  ribiera had yielded to the urgent solicitations of his friends and had left the headquarters of his discomfited army alone under the guidance of bonifacio the muleteer who had been willing to take the responsibility with the risk he had departed at daybreak of the third day his remaining forces had melted away during the night bonifacio and he rode hard on horses towards the cordillera then they obtained mules entered the passes and crossed the paramo of ivie just before a freezing blast swept over that stony plateau burying in a drift of snow the little shelterhut of stones in which they had spent the night afterwards poor ribiera had many adventures got separated from his guide lost his mount struggled down to the campo on foot and if he had not thrown himself on the mercy of a ranchero would have perished a long way from sulaco that man who as a matter of fact recognized him at once let him have a fresh mule which the fugitive heavy and unskilful had ridden to death and it was true he had been pursued by a party commanded by no less a person than pedro montero the brother of the general the cold wind of the paramo luckily caught the pursuers on the top of the pass some few men and all the animals perished in the icy blast the stragglers died but the main body kept on they found poor bonifacio lying halfdead at the foot of a snow slope and bayoneted him promptly in the true civil war style they would have had ribiera too if they had not for some reason or other turned off the track of the old camino real only to lose their way in the forests at the foot of the lower slopes and there they were at last having stumbled in unexpectedly upon the construction camp the engineer at the railhead told his chief by wire that he had pedro montero absolutely there in the very office listening to the clicks he was going to take possession of sulaco in the name of the democracy he was very overbearing his men slaughtered some of the railway companys cattle without asking leave and went to work broiling the meat on the embers pedrito made many pointed inquiries as to the silver mine and what had become of the product of the last six months working he had said peremptorily ask your chief up there by wire he ought to know tell him that don pedro montero chief of the campo and minister of the interior of the new government desires to be correctly informed  he had his feet wrapped up in bloodstained rags a lean haggard face ragged beard and hair and had walked in limping with a crooked branch of a tree for a staff his followers were perhaps in a worse plight but apparently they had not thrown away their arms and at any rate not all their ammunition their lean faces filled the door and the windows of the telegraph hut as it was at the same time the bedroom of the engineerincharge there montero had thrown himself on his clean blankets and lay there shivering and dictating requisitions to be transmitted by wire to sulaco he demanded a train of cars to be sent down at once to transport his men up  to this i answered from my end the engineerinchief related to us that i dared not risk the rollingstock in the interior as there had been attempts to wreck trains all along the line several times i did that for your sake gould said the chief engineer the answer to this was in the words of my subordinate the filthy brute on my bed said suppose i were to have you shot to which my subordinate who it appears was himself operating remarked that it would not bring the cars up upon that the other yawning said never mind there is no lack of horses on the campo and turning over went to sleep on harriss bed  this is why my dear girl i am a fugitive tonight the last wire from railhead says that pedro montero and his men left at daybreak after feeding on asado beef all night they took all the horses they will find more on the road theyll be here in less than thirty hours and thus sulaco is no place either for me or the great store of silver belonging to the gould concession  but that is not the worst the garrison of esmeralda has gone over to the victorious party we have heard this by means of the telegraphist of the cable company who came to the casa gould in the early morning with the news in fact it was so early that the day had not yet quite broken over sulaco his colleague in esmeralda had called him up to say that the garrison after shooting some of their officers had taken possession of a government steamer laid up in the harbour it is really a heavy blow for me i thought i could depend on every man in this province it was a mistake it was a monterist revolution in esmeralda just such as was attempted in sulaco only that that one came off the telegraphist was signalling to bernhardt all the time and his last transmitted words were they are bursting in the door and taking possession of the cable office you are cut off can do no more  but as a matter of fact he managed somehow to escape the vigilance of his captors who had tried to stop the communication with the outer world he did manage it how it was done i dont know but a few hours afterwards he called up sulaco again and what he said was the insurgent army has taken possession of the government transport in the bay and are filling her with troops with the intention of going round the coast to sulaco therefore look out for yourselves they will be ready to start in a few hours and may be upon you before daybreak  this is all he could say they drove him away from his instrument this time for good because bernhardt has been calling up esmeralda ever since without getting an answer  after setting these words down in the pocketbook which he was filling up for the benefit of his sister decoud lifted his head to listen but there were no sounds neither in the room nor in the house except the drip of the water from the filter into the vast earthenware jar under the wooden stand and outside the house there was a great silence decoud lowered his head again over the pocketbook  i am not running away you understand he wrote on i am simply going away with that great treasure of silver which must be saved at all costs pedro montero from the campo and the revolted garrison of esmeralda from the sea are converging upon it that it is there lying ready for them is only an accident the real objective is the san tome mine itself as you may well imagine otherwise the occidental province would have been no doubt left alone for many weeks to be gathered at leisure into the arms of the victorious party don carlos gould will have enough to do to save his mine with its organization and its people this imperium in imperio this wealthproducing thing to which his sentimentalism attaches a strange idea of justice he holds to it as some men hold to the idea of love or revenge unless i am much mistaken in the man it must remain inviolate or perish by an act of his will alone a passion has crept into his cold and idealistic life a passion which i can only comprehend intellectually a passion that is not like the passions we know we men of another blood but it is as dangerous as any of ours  his wife has understood it too that is why she is such a good ally of mine she seizes upon all my suggestions with a sure instinct that in the end they make for the safety of the gould concession and he defers to her because he trusts her perhaps but i fancy rather as if he wished to make up for some subtle wrong for that sentimental unfaithfulness which surrenders her happiness her life to the seduction of an idea the little woman has discovered that he lives for the mine rather than for her but let them be to each his fate shaped by passion or sentiment the principal thing is that she has backed up my advice to get the silver out of the town out of the country at once at any cost at any risk don carlos mission is to preserve unstained the fair fame of his mine mrs goulds mission is to save him from the effects of that cold and overmastering passion which she dreads more than if it were an infatuation for another woman nostromos mission is to save the silver the plan is to load it into the largest of the companys lighters and send it across the gulf to a small port out of costaguana territory just on the other side the azuera where the first northbound steamer will get orders to pick it up the waters here are calm we shall slip away into the darkness of the gulf before the esmeralda rebels arrive and by the time the day breaks over the ocean we shall be out of sight invisible hidden by azuera which itself looks from the sulaco shore like a faint blue cloud on the horizon  the incorruptible capataz de cargadores is the man for that work and i the man with a passion but without a mission i go with him to returnto play my part in the farce to the end and if successful to receive my reward which no one but antonia can give me  i shall not see her again now before i depart i left her as i have said by don joses bedside the street was dark the houses shut up and i walked out of the town in the night not a single streetlamp had been lit for two days and the archway of the gate was only a mass of darkness in the vague form of a tower in which i heard low dismal groans that seemed to answer the murmurs of a mans voice  i recognized something impassive and careless in its tone characteristic of that genoese sailor who like me has come casually here to be drawn into the events for which his scepticism as well as mine seems to entertain a sort of passive contempt the only thing he seems to care for as far as i have been able to discover is to be well spoken of an ambition fit for noble souls but also a profitable one for an exceptionally intelligent scoundrel yes his very words to be well spoken of si senor he does not seem to make any difference between speaking and thinking is it sheer naiveness or the practical point of view i wonder exceptional individualities always interest me because they are true to the general formula expressing the moral state of humanity  he joined me on the harbour road after i had passed them under the dark archway without stopping it was a woman in trouble he had been talking to through discretion i kept silent while he walked by my side after a time he began to talk himself it was not what i expected it was only an old woman an old lacemaker in search of her son one of the streetsweepers employed by the municipality friends had come the day before at daybreak to the door of their hovel calling him out he had gone with them and she had not seen him since so she had left the food she had been preparing halfcooked on the extinct embers and had crawled out as far as the harbour where she had heard that some town mozos had been killed on the morning of the riot one of the cargadores guarding the custom house had brought out a lantern and had helped her to look at the few dead left lying about there now she was creeping back having failed in her search so she sat down on the stone seat under the arch moaning because she was very tired the capataz had questioned her and after hearing her broken and groaning tale had advised her to go and look amongst the wounded in the patio of the casa gould he had also given her a quarter dollar he mentioned carelessly  why did you do that i asked do you know her  no senor i dont suppose i have ever seen her before how should i she has not probably been out in the streets for years she is one of those old women that you find in this country at the back of huts crouching over fireplaces with a stick on the ground by their side and almost too feeble to drive away the stray dogs from their cookingpots caramba i could tell by her voice that death had forgotten her but old or young they like money and will speak well of the man who gives it to them he laughed a little senor you should have felt the clutch of her paw as i put the piece in her palm he paused my last too he added  i made no comment hes known for his liberality and his bad luck at the game of monte which keeps him as poor as when he first came here  i suppose don martin he began in a thoughtful speculative tone that the senor administrador of san tome will reward me some day if i save his silver  i said that it could not be otherwise surely he walked on muttering to himself si si without doubt without doubt and look you senor martin what it is to be well spoken of there is not another man that could have been even thought of for such a thing i shall get something great for it some day and let it come soon he mumbled time passes in this country as quick as anywhere else  this soeur cherie is my companion in the great escape for the sake of the great cause he is more naive than shrewd more masterful than crafty more generous with his personality than the people who make use of him are with their money at least that is what he thinks himself with more pride than sentiment i am glad i have made friends with him as a companion he acquires more importance than he ever had as a sort of minor genius in his wayas an original italian sailor whom i allowed to come in in the small hours and talk familiarly to the editor of the porvenir while the paper was going through the press and it is curious to have met a man for whom the value of life seems to consist in personal prestige  i am waiting for him here now on arriving at the posada kept by viola we found the children alone down below and the old genoese shouted to his countryman to go and fetch the doctor otherwise we would have gone on to the wharf where it appears captain mitchell with some volunteer europeans and a few picked cargadores are loading the lighter with the silver that must be saved from monteros clutches in order to be used for monteros defeat nostromo galloped furiously back towards the town he has been long gone already this delay gives me time to talk to you by the time this pocketbook reaches your hands much will have happened but now it is a pause under the hovering wing of death in this silent house buried in the black night with this dying woman the two children crouching without a sound and that old man whom i can hear through the thickness of the wall passing up and down with a light rubbing noise no louder than a mouse and i the only other with them dont really know whether to count myself with the living or with the dead quien sabe as the people here are prone to say in answer to every question but no feeling for you is certainly not dead and the whole thing the house the dark night the silent children in this dim room my very presence hereall this is life must be life since it is so much like a dream  with the writing of the last line there came upon decoud a moment of sudden and complete oblivion he swayed over the table as if struck by a bullet the next moment he sat up confused with the idea that he had heard his pencil roll on the floor the low door of the cafe wide open was filled with the glare of a torch in which was visible half of a horse switching its tail against the leg of a rider with a long iron spur strapped to the naked heel the two girls were gone and nostromo standing in the middle of the room looked at him from under the round brim of the sombrero low down over his brow  i have brought that sourfaced english doctor in senora goulds carriage said nostromo i doubt if with all his wisdom he can save the padrona this time they have sent for the children a bad sign that  he sat down on the end of a bench she wants to give them her blessing i suppose  dazedly decoud observed that he must have fallen sound asleep and nostromo said with a vague smile that he had looked in at the window and had seen him lying still across the table with his head on his arms the english senora had also come in the carriage and went upstairs at once with the doctor she had told him not to wake up don martin yet but when they sent for the children he had come into the cafe  the half of the horse with its half of the rider swung round outside the door the torch of tow and resin in the iron basket which was carried on a stick at the saddlebow flared right into the room for a moment and mrs gould entered hastily with a very white tired face the hood of her dark blue cloak had fallen back both men rose  teresa wants to see you nostromo she said the capataz did not move decoud with his back to the table began to button up his coat  the silver mrs gould the silver he murmured in english dont forget that the esmeralda garrison have got a steamer they may appear at any moment at the harbour entrance  the doctor says there is no hope mrs gould spoke rapidly also in english i shall take you down to the wharf in my carriage and then come back to fetch away the girls she changed swiftly into spanish to address nostromo why are you wasting time old giorgios wife wishes to see you  i am going to her senora muttered the capataz dr monygham now showed himself bringing back the children to mrs goulds inquiring glance he only shook his head and went outside at once followed by nostromo  the horse of the torchbearer motionless hung his head low and the rider had dropped the reins to light a cigarette the glare of the torch played on the front of the house crossed by the big black letters of its inscription in which only the word italia was lighted fully the patch of wavering glare reached as far as mrs goulds carriage waiting on the road with the yellowfaced portly ignacio apparently dozing on the box by his side basilio dark and skinny held a winchester carbine in front of him with both hands and peered fearfully into the darkness nostromo touched lightly the doctors shoulder  is she really dying senor doctor  yes said the doctor with a strange twitch of his scarred cheek and why she wants to see you i cannot imagine  she has been like that before suggested nostromo looking away  well capataz i can assure you she will never be like that again snarled dr monygham you may go to her or stay away there is very little to be got from talking to the dying but she told dona emilia in my hearing that she has been like a mother to you ever since you first set foot ashore here  si and she never had a good word to say for me to anybody it is more as if she could not forgive me for being alive and such a man too as she would have liked her son to be  maybe exclaimed a mournful deep voice near them women have their own ways of tormenting themselves giorgio viola had come out of the house he threw a heavy black shadow in the torchlight and the glare fell on his big face on the great bushy head of white hair he motioned the capataz indoors with his extended arm  dr monygham after busying himself with a little medicament box of polished wood on the seat of the landau turned to old giorgio and thrust into his big trembling hand one of the glassstoppered bottles out of the case  give her a spoonful of this now and then in water he said it will make her easier  and there is nothing more for her asked the old man patiently  no not on earth said the doctor with his back to him clicking the lock of the medicine case  nostromo slowly crossed the large kitchen all dark but for the glow of a heap of charcoal under the heavy mantel of the cookingrange where water was boiling in an iron pot with a loud bubbling sound between the two walls of a narrow staircase a bright light streamed from the sickroom above and the magnificent capataz de cargadores stepping noiselessly in soft leather sandals bushy whiskered his muscular neck and bronzed chest bare in the open check shirt resembled a mediterranean sailor just come ashore from some wine or fruitladen felucca at the top he paused broad shouldered narrow hipped and supple looking at the large bed like a white couch of state with a profusion of snowy linen amongst which the padrona sat unpropped and bowed her handsome blackbrowed face bent over her chest a mass of raven hair with only a few white threads in it covered her shoulders one thick strand fallen forward half veiled her cheek perfectly motionless in that pose expressing physical anxiety and unrest she turned her eyes alone towards nostromo  the capataz had a red sash wound many times round his waist and a heavy silver ring on the forefinger of the hand he raised to give a twist to his moustache  their revolutions their revolutions gasped senora teresa look gian battista it has killed me at last  nostromo said nothing and the sick woman with an upward glance insisted look this one has killed me while you were away fighting for what did not concern you foolish man  why talk like this mumbled the capataz between his teeth will you never believe in my good sense it concerns me to keep on being what i am every day alike  you never change indeed she said bitterly always thinking of yourself and taking your pay out in fine words from those who care nothing for you  there was between them an intimacy of antagonism as close in its way as the intimacy of accord and affection he had not walked along the way of teresas expectations it was she who had encouraged him to leave his ship in the hope of securing a friend and defender for the girls the wife of old giorgio was aware of her precarious health and was haunted by the fear of her aged husbands loneliness and the unprotected state of the children she had wanted to annex that apparently quiet and steady young man affectionate and pliable an orphan from his tenderest age as he had told her with no ties in italy except an uncle owner and master of a felucca from whose illusage he had run away before he was fourteen he had seemed to her courageous a hard worker determined to make his way in the world from gratitude and the ties of habit he would become like a son to herself and giorgio and then who knows when linda had grown up    ten years difference between husband and wife was not so much her own great man was nearly twenty years older than herself gian battista was an attractive young fellow besides attractive to men women and children just by that profound quietness of personality which like a serene twilight rendered more seductive the promise of his vigorous form and the resolution of his conduct  old giorgio in profound ignorance of his wifes views and hopes had a great regard for his young countryman a man ought not to be tame he used to tell her quoting the spanish proverb in defence of the splendid capataz she was growing jealous of his success he was escaping from her she feared she was practical and he seemed to her to be an absurd spendthrift of these qualities which made him so valuable he got too little for them he scattered them with both hands amongst too many people she thought he laid no money by she railed at his poverty his exploits his adventures his loves and his reputation but in her heart she had never given him up as though indeed he had been her son  even now ill as she was ill enough to feel the chill black breath of the approaching end she had wished to see him it was like putting out her benumbed hand to regain her hold but she had presumed too much on her strength she could not command her thoughts they had become dim like her vision the words faltered on her lips and only the paramount anxiety and desire of her life seemed to be too strong for death  the capataz said i have heard these things many times you are unjust but it does not hurt me only now you do not seem to have much strength to talk and i have but little time to listen i am engaged in a work of very great moment  she made an effort to ask him whether it was true that he had found time to go and fetch a doctor for her nostromo nodded affirmatively  she was pleased it relieved her sufferings to know that the man had condescended to do so much for those who really wanted his help it was a proof of his friendship her voice become stronger  i want a priest more than a doctor she said pathetically she did not move her head only her eyes ran into the corners to watch the capataz standing by the side of her bed would you go to fetch a priest for me now think a dying woman asks you  nostromo shook his head resolutely he did not believe in priests in their sacerdotal character a doctor was an efficacious person but a priest as priest was nothing incapable of doing either good or harm nostromo did not even dislike the sight of them as old giorgio did the utter uselessness of the errand was what struck him most  padrona he said you have been like this before and got better after a few days i have given you already the very last moments i can spare ask senora gould to send you one  he was feeling uneasy at the impiety of this refusal the padrona believed in priests and confessed herself to them but all women did that it could not be of much consequence and yet his heart felt oppressed for a momentat the thought what absolution would mean to her if she believed in it only ever so little no matter it was quite true that he had given her already the very last moment he could spare  you refuse to go she gasped ah you are always yourself indeed  listen to reason padrona he said i am needed to save the silver of the mine do you hear a greater treasure than the one which they say is guarded by ghosts and devils on azuera it is true i am resolved to make this the most desperate affair i was ever engaged on in my whole life  she felt a despairing indignation the supreme test had failed standing above her nostromo did not see the distorted features of her face distorted by a paroxysm of pain and anger only she began to tremble all over her bowed head shook the broad shoulders quivered  then god perhaps will have mercy upon me but do you look to it man that you get something for yourself out of it besides the remorse that shall overtake you some day  she laughed feebly get riches at least for once you indispensable admired gian battista to whom the peace of a dying woman is less than the praise of people who have given you a silly nameand nothing besidesin exchange for your soul and body  the capataz de cargadores swore to himself under his breath  leave my soul alone padrona and i shall know how to take care of my body where is the harm of people having need of me what are you envying me that i have robbed you and the children of those very people you are throwing in my teeth have done more for old giorgio than they ever thought of doing for me  he struck his breast with his open palm his voice had remained low though he had spoken in a forcible tone he twisted his moustaches one after another and his eyes wandered a little about the room  is it my fault that i am the only man for their purposes what angry nonsense are you talking mother would you rather have me timid and foolish selling watermelons on the marketplace or rowing a boat for passengers along the harbour like a soft neapolitan without courage or reputation would you have a young man live like a monk i do not believe it would you want a monk for your eldest girl let her grow what are you afraid of you have been angry with me for everything i did for years ever since you first spoke to me in secret from old giorgio about your linda husband to one and brother to the other did you say well why not i like the little ones and a man must marry some time but ever since that time you have been making little of me to everyone why did you think you could put a collar and chain on me as if i were one of the watchdogs they keep over there in the railway yards look here padrona i am the same man who came ashore one evening and sat down in the thatched ranche you lived in at that time on the other side of the town and told you all about himself you were not unjust to me then what has happened since i am no longer an insignificant youth a good name giorgio says is a treasure padrona  they have turned your head with their praises gasped the sick woman they have been paying you with words your folly shall betray you into poverty misery starvation the very leperos shall laugh at youthe great capataz  nostromo stood for a time as if struck dumb she never looked at him a selfconfident mirthless smile passed quickly from his lips and then he backed away his disregarded figure sank down beyond the doorway he descended the stairs backwards with the usual sense of having been somehow baffled by this womans disparagement of this reputation he had obtained and desired to keep  downstairs in the big kitchen a candle was burning surrounded by the shadows of the walls of the ceiling but no ruddy glare filled the open square of the outer door the carriage with mrs gould and don martin preceded by the horseman bearing the torch had gone on to the jetty dr monygham who had remained sat on the corner of a hard wood table near the candlestick his seamed shaven face inclined sideways his arms crossed on his breast his lips pursed up and his prominent eyes glaring stonily upon the floor of black earth near the overhanging mantel of the fireplace where the pot of water was still boiling violently old giorgio held his chin in his hand one foot advanced as if arrested by a sudden thought  adios viejo said nostromo feeling the handle of his revolver in the belt and loosening his knife in its sheath he picked up a blue poncho lined with red from the table and put it over his head adios look after the things in my sleepingroom and if you hear from me no more give up the box to paquita there is not much of value there except my new serape from mexico and a few silver buttons on my best jacket no matter the things will look well enough on the next lover she gets and the man need not be afraid i shall linger on earth after i am dead like those gringos that haunt the azuera  dr monygham twisted his lips into a bitter smile after old giorgio with an almost imperceptible nod and without a word had gone up the narrow stairs he said  why capataz i thought you could never fail in anything  nostromo glancing contemptuously at the doctor lingered in the doorway rolling a cigarette then struck a match and after lighting it held the burning piece of wood above his head till the flame nearly touched his fingers  no wind he muttered to himself look here senordo you know the nature of my undertaking  dr monygham nodded sourly  it is as if i were taking up a curse upon me senor doctor a man with a treasure on this coast will have every knife raised against him in every place upon the shore you see that senor doctor i shall float along with a spell upon my life till i meet somewhere the northbound steamer of the company and then indeed they will talk about the capataz of the sulaco cargadores from one end of america to another  dr monygham laughed his short throaty laugh nostromo turned round in the doorway  but if your worship can find any other man ready and fit for such business i will stand back i am not exactly tired of my life though i am so poor that i can carry all i have with myself on my horses back  you gamble too much and never say no to a pretty face capataz said dr monygham with sly simplicity thats not the way to make a fortune but nobody that i know ever suspected you of being poor i hope you have made a good bargain in case you come back safe from this adventure  what bargain would your worship have made asked nostromo blowing the smoke out of his lips through the doorway  dr monygham listened up the staircase for a moment before he answered with another of his short abrupt laughs  illustrious capataz for taking the curse of death upon my back as you call it nothing else but the whole treasure would do  nostromo vanished out of the doorway with a grunt of discontent at this jeering answer dr monygham heard him gallop away nostromo rode furiously in the dark there were lights in the buildings of the osn company near the wharf but before he got there he met the gould carriage the horseman preceded it with the torch whose light showed the white mules trotting the portly ignacio driving and basilio with the carbine on the box from the dark body of the landau mrs goulds voice cried they are waiting for you capataz she was returning chilly and excited with decouds pocketbook still held in her hand he had confided it to her to send to his sister perhaps my last words to her he had said pressing mrs goulds hand  the capataz never checked his speed at the head of the wharf vague figures with rifles leapt to the head of his horse others closed upon himcargadores of the company posted by captain mitchell on the watch at a word from him they fell back with subservient murmurs recognizing his voice at the other end of the jetty near a cargo crane in a dark group with glowing cigars his name was pronounced in a tone of relief most of the europeans in sulaco were there rallied round charles gould as if the silver of the mine had been the emblem of a common cause the symbol of the supreme importance of material interests they had loaded it into the lighter with their own hands nostromo recognized don carlos gould a thin tall shape standing a little apart and silent to whom another tall shape the engineerinchief said aloud if it must be lost it is a million times better that it should go to the bottom of the sea  martin decoud called out from the lighter au revoir messieurs till we clasp hands again over the newborn occidental republic only a subdued murmur responded to his clear ringing tones and then it seemed to him that the wharf was floating away into the night but it was nostromo who was already pushing against a pile with one of the heavy sweeps decoud did not move the effect was that of being launched into space after a splash or two there was not a sound but the thud of nostromos feet leaping about the boat he hoisted the big sail a breath of wind fanned decouds cheek everything had vanished but the light of the lantern captain mitchell had hoisted upon the post at the end of the jetty to guide nostromo out of the harbour  the two men unable to see each other kept silent till the lighter slipping before the fitful breeze passed out between almost invisible headlands into the still deeper darkness of the gulf for a time the lantern on the jetty shone after them the wind failed then fanned up again but so faintly that the big halfdecked boat slipped along with no more noise than if she had been suspended in the air  we are out in the gulf now said the calm voice of nostromo a moment after he added senor mitchell has lowered the light  yes said decoud nobody can find us now  a great recrudescence of obscurity embraced the boat the sea in the gulf was as black as the clouds above nostromo after striking a couple of matches to get a glimpse of the boatcompass he had with him in the lighter steered by the feel of the wind on his cheek  it was a new experience for decoud this mysteriousness of the great waters spread out strangely smooth as if their restlessness had been crushed by the weight of that dense night the placido was sleeping profoundly under its black poncho  the main thing now for success was to get away from the coast and gain the middle of the gulf before day broke the isabels were somewhere at hand on your left as you look forward senor said nostromo suddenly when his voice ceased the enormous stillness without light or sound seemed to affect decouds senses like a powerful drug he didnt even know at times whether he were asleep or awake like a man lost in slumber he heard nothing he saw nothing even his hand held before his face did not exist for his eyes the change from the agitation the passions and the dangers from the sights and sounds of the shore was so complete that it would have resembled death had it not been for the survival of his thoughts in this foretaste of eternal peace they floated vivid and light like unearthly clear dreams of earthly things that may haunt the souls freed by death from the misty atmosphere of regrets and hopes decoud shook himself shuddered a bit though the air that drifted past him was warm he had the strangest sensation of his soul having just returned into his body from the circumambient darkness in which land sea sky the mountains and the rocks were as if they had not been  nostromos voice was speaking though he at the tiller was also as if he were not have you been asleep don martin caramba if it were possible i would think that i too have dozed off i have a strange notion somehow of having dreamt that there was a sound of blubbering a sound a sorrowing man could make somewhere near this boat something between a sigh and a sob  strange muttered decoud stretched upon the pile of treasure boxes covered by many tarpaulins could it be that there is another boat near us in the gulf we could not see it you know  nostromo laughed a little at the absurdity of the idea they dismissed it from their minds the solitude could almost be felt and when the breeze ceased the blackness seemed to weigh upon decoud like a stone  this is overpowering he muttered do we move at all capataz  not so fast as a crawling beetle tangled in the grass answered nostromo and his voice seemed deadened by the thick veil of obscurity that felt warm and hopeless all about them there were long periods when he made no sound invisible and inaudible as if he had mysteriously stepped out of the lighter  in the featureless night nostromo was not even certain which way the lighter headed after the wind had completely died out he peered for the islands there was not a hint of them to be seen as if they had sunk to the bottom of the gulf he threw himself down by the side of decoud at last and whispered into his ear that if daylight caught them near the sulaco shore through want of wind it would be possible to sweep the lighter behind the cliff at the high end of the great isabel where she would lie concealed decoud was surprised at the grimness of his anxiety to him the removal of the treasure was a political move it was necessary for several reasons that it should not fall into the hands of montero but here was a man who took another view of this enterprise the caballeros over there did not seem to have the slightest idea of what they had given him to do nostromo as if affected by the gloom around seemed nervously resentful decoud was surprised the capataz indifferent to those dangers that seemed obvious to his companion allowed himself to become scornfully exasperated by the deadly nature of the trust put as a matter of course into his hands it was more dangerous nostromo said with a laugh and a curse than sending a man to get the treasure that people said was guarded by devils and ghosts in the deep ravines of azuera senor he said we must catch the steamer at sea we must keep out in the open looking for her till we have eaten and drunk all that has been put on board here and if we miss her by some mischance we must keep away from the land till we grow weak and perhaps mad and die and drift dead until one or another of the steamers of the compania comes upon the boat with the two dead men who have saved the treasure that senor is the only way to save it for dont you see for us to come to the land anywhere in a hundred miles along this coast with this silver in our possession is to run the naked breast against the point of a knife this thing has been given to me like a deadly disease if men discover it i am dead and you too senor since you would come with me there is enough silver to make a whole province rich let alone a seaboard pueblo inhabited by thieves and vagabonds senor they would think that heaven itself sent these riches into their hands and would cut our throats without hesitation i would trust no fair words from the best man around the shores of this wild gulf reflect that even by giving up the treasure at the first demand we would not be able to save our lives do you understand this or must i explain  no you neednt explain said decoud a little listlessly i can see it well enough myself that the possession of this treasure is very much like a deadly disease for men situated as we are but it had to be removed from sulaco and you were the man for the task  i was but i cannot believe said nostromo that its loss would have impoverished don carlos gould very much there is more wealth in the mountain i have heard it rolling down the shoots on quiet nights when i used to ride to rincon to see a certain girl after my work at the harbour was done for years the rich rocks have been pouring down with a noise like thunder and the miners say that there is enough at the heart of the mountain to thunder on for years and years to come and yet the day before yesterday we have been fighting to save it from the mob and tonight i am sent out with it into this darkness where there is no wind to get away with as if it were the last lot of silver on earth to get bread for the hungry with ha ha well i am going to make it the most famous and desperate affair of my lifewind or no wind it shall be talked about when the little children are grown up and the grown men are old aha the monterists must not get hold of it i am told whatever happens to nostromo the capataz and they shall not have it i tell you since it has been tied for safety round nostromos neck  i see it murmured decoud he saw indeed that his companion had his own peculiar view of this enterprise  nostromo interrupted his reflections upon the way mens qualities are made use of without any fundamental knowledge of their nature by the proposal they should slip the long oars out and sweep the lighter in the direction of the isabels it wouldnt do for daylight to reveal the treasure floating within a mile or so of the harbour entrance the denser the darkness generally the smarter were the puffs of wind on which he had reckoned to make his way but tonight the gulf under its poncho of clouds remained breathless as if dead rather than asleep  don martins soft hands suffered cruelly tugging at the thick handle of the enormous oar he stuck to it manfully setting his teeth he too was in the toils of an imaginative existence and that strange work of pulling a lighter seemed to belong naturally to the inception of a new state acquired an ideal meaning from his love for antonia for all their efforts the heavily laden lighter hardly moved nostromo could be heard swearing to himself between the regular splashes of the sweeps we are making a crooked path he muttered to himself i wish i could see the islands  in his unskilfulness don martin overexerted himself now and then a sort of muscular faintness would run from the tips of his aching fingers through every fibre of his body and pass off in a flush of heat he had fought talked suffered mentally and physically exerting his mind and body for the last fortyeight hours without intermission he had had no rest very little food no pause in the stress of his thoughts and his feelings even his love for antonia whence he drew his strength and his inspiration had reached the point of tragic tension during their hurried interview by don joses bedside and now suddenly he was thrown out of all this into a dark gulf whose very gloom silence and breathless peace added a torment to the necessity for physical exertion he imagined the lighter sinking to the bottom with an extraordinary shudder of delight i am on the verge of delirium he thought he mastered the trembling of all his limbs of his breast the inward trembling of all his body exhausted of its nervous force  shall we rest capataz he proposed in a careless tone there are many hours of night yet before us  true it is but a mile or so i suppose rest your arms senor if that is what you mean you will find no other sort of rest i can promise you since you let yourself be bound to this treasure whose loss would make no poor man poorer no senor there is no rest till we find a northbound steamer or else some ship finds us drifting about stretched out dead upon the englishmans silver or ratherno por dios i shall cut down the gunwale with the axe right to the waters edge before thirst and hunger rob me of my strength by all the saints and devils i shall let the sea have the treasure rather than give it up to any stranger since it was the good pleasure of the caballeros to send me off on such an errand they shall learn i am just the man they take me for  decoud lay on the silver boxes panting all his active sensations and feelings from as far back as he could remember seemed to him the maddest of dreams even his passionate devotion to antonia into which he had worked himself up out of the depths of his scepticism had lost all appearance of reality for a moment he was the prey of an extremely languid but not unpleasant indifference  i am sure they didnt mean you to take such a desperate view of this affair he said  what was it then a joke snarled the man who on the paysheets of the osn companys establishment in sulaco was described as foreman of the wharf against the figure of his wages was it for a joke they woke me up from my sleep after two days of street fighting to make me stake my life upon a bad card everybody knows too that i am not a lucky gambler  yes everybody knows of your good luck with women capataz decoud propitiated his companion in a weary drawl  look here senor nostromo went on i never even remonstrated about this affair directly i heard what was wanted i saw what a desperate affair it must be and i made up my mind to see it out every minute was of importance i had to wait for you first then when we arrived at the italia una old giorgio shouted to me to go for the english doctor later on that poor dying woman wanted to see me as you know senor i was reluctant to go i felt already this cursed silver growing heavy upon my back and i was afraid that knowing herself to be dying she would ask me to ride off again for a priest father corbelan who is fearless would have come at a word but father corbelan is far away safe with the band of hernandez and the populace that would have liked to tear him to pieces are much incensed against the priests not a single fat padre would have consented to put his head out of his hidingplace tonight to save a christian soul except perhaps under my protection that was in her mind i pretended i did not believe she was going to die senor i refused to fetch a priest for a dying woman     decoud was heard to stir  you did capataz he exclaimed his tone changed well you knowit was rather fine  you do not believe in priests don martin neither do i what was the use of wasting time but sheshe believes in them the thing sticks in my throat she may be dead already and here we are floating helpless with no wind at all curse on all superstition she died thinking i deprived her of paradise i suppose it shall be the most desperate affair of my life  decoud remained lost in reflection he tried to analyze the sensations awaked by what he had been told the voice of the capataz was heard again  now don martin let us take up the sweeps and try to find the isabels it is either that or sinking the lighter if the day overtakes us we must not forget that the steamer from esmeralda with the soldiers may be coming along we will pull straight on now i have discovered a bit of a candle here and we must take the risk of a small light to make a course by the boat compass there is not enough wind to blow it outmay the curse of heaven fall upon this blind gulf  a small flame appeared burning quite straight it showed fragmentarily the stout ribs and planking in the hollow empty part of the lighter decoud could see nostromo standing up to pull he saw him as high as the red sash on his waist with a gleam of a whitehandled revolver and the wooden haft of a long knife protruding on his left side decoud nerved himself for the effort of rowing certainly there was not enough wind to blow the candle out but its flame swayed a little to the slow movement of the heavy boat it was so big that with their utmost efforts they could not move it quicker than about a mile an hour this was sufficient however to sweep them amongst the isabels long before daylight came there was a good six hours of darkness before them and the distance from the harbour to the great isabel did not exceed two miles decoud put this heavy toil to the account of the capatazs impatience sometimes they paused and then strained their ears to hear the boat from esmeralda in this perfect quietness a steamer moving would have been heard from far off as to seeing anything it was out of the question they could not see each other even the lighters sail which remained set was invisible very often they rested  caramba said nostromo suddenly during one of those intervals when they lolled idly against the heavy handles of the sweeps what is it are you distressed don martin  decoud assured him that he was not distressed in the least nostromo for a time kept perfectly still and then in a whisper invited martin to come aft  with his lips touching decouds ear he declared his belief that there was somebody else besides themselves upon the lighter twice now he had heard the sound of stifled sobbing  senor he whispered with awed wonder i am certain that there is somebody weeping in this lighter  decoud had heard nothing he expressed his incredulity however it was easy to ascertain the truth of the matter  it is most amazing muttered nostromo could anybody have concealed himself on board while the lighter was lying alongside the wharf  and you say it was like sobbing asked decoud lowering his voice too if he is weeping whoever he is he cannot be very dangerous  clambering over the precious pile in the middle they crouched low on the foreside of the mast and groped under the halfdeck right forward in the narrowest part their hands came upon the limbs of a man who remained as silent as death too startled themselves to make a sound they dragged him aft by one arm and the collar of his coat he was limplifeless  the light of the bit of candle fell upon a round hooknosed face with black moustaches and little sidewhiskers he was extremely dirty a greasy growth of beard was sprouting on the shaven parts of the cheeks the thick lips were slightly parted but the eyes remained closed decoud to his immense astonishment recognized senor hirsch the hide merchant from esmeralda nostromo too had recognized him and they gazed at each other across the body lying with its naked feet higher than its head in an absurd pretence of sleep faintness or death    chapter eight  for a moment before this extraordinary find they forgot their own concerns and sensations senor hirschs sensations as he lay there must have been those of extreme terror for a long time he refused to give a sign of life till at last decouds objurgations and perhaps more nostromos impatient suggestion that he should be thrown overboard as he seemed to be dead induced him to raise one eyelid first and then the other  it appeared that he had never found a safe opportunity to leave sulaco he lodged with anzani the universal storekeeper on the plaza mayor but when the riot broke out he had made his escape from his hosts house before daylight and in such a hurry that he had forgotten to put on his shoes he had run out impulsively in his socks and with his hat in his hand into the garden of anzanis house fear gave him the necessary agility to climb over several low walls and afterwards he blundered into the overgrown cloisters of the ruined franciscan convent in one of the bystreets he forced himself into the midst of matted bushes with the recklessness of desperation and this accounted for his scratched body and his torn clothing he lay hidden there all day his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth with all the intensity of thirst engendered by heat and fear three times different bands of men invaded the place with shouts and imprecations looking for father corbelan but towards the evening still lying on his face in the bushes he thought he would die from the fear of silence he was not very clear as to what had induced him to leave the place but evidently he had got out and slunk successfully out of town along the deserted back lanes he wandered in the darkness near the railway so maddened by apprehension that he dared not even approach the fires of the pickets of italian workmen guarding the line he had a vague idea evidently of finding refuge in the railway yards but the dogs rushed upon him barking men began to shout a shot was fired at random he fled away from the gates by the merest accident as it happened he took the direction of the osn companys offices twice he stumbled upon the bodies of men killed during the day but everything living frightened him much more he crouched crept crawled made dashes guided by a sort of animal instinct keeping away from every light and from every sound of voices his idea was to throw himself at the feet of captain mitchell and beg for shelter in the companys offices it was all dark there as he approached on his hands and knees but suddenly someone on guard challenged loudly quien vive there were more dead men lying about and he flattened himself down at once by the side of a cold corpse he heard a voice saying here is one of those wounded rascals crawling about shall i go and finish him and another voice objected that it was not safe to go out without a lantern upon such an errand perhaps it was only some negro liberal looking for a chance to stick a knife into the stomach of an honest man hirsch didnt stay to hear any more but crawling away to the end of the wharf hid himself amongst a lot of empty casks after a while some people came along talking and with glowing cigarettes he did not stop to ask himself whether they would be likely to do him any harm but bolted incontinently along the jetty saw a lighter lying moored at the end and threw himself into it in his desire to find cover he crept right forward under the halfdeck and he had remained there more dead than alive suffering agonies of hunger and thirst and almost fainting with terror when he heard numerous footsteps and the voices of the europeans who came in a body escorting the wagonload of treasure pushed along the rails by a squad of cargadores he understood perfectly what was being done from the talk but did not disclose his presence from the fear that he would not be allowed to remain his only idea at the time overpowering and masterful was to get away from this terrible sulaco and now he regretted it very much he had heard nostromo talk to decoud and wished himself back on shore he did not desire to be involved in any desperate affairin a situation where one could not run away the involuntary groans of his anguished spirit had betrayed him to the sharp ears of the capataz  they had propped him up in a sitting posture against the side of the lighter and he went on with the moaning account of his adventures till his voice broke his head fell forward water he whispered with difficulty decoud held one of the cans to his lips he revived after an extraordinarily short time and scrambled up to his feet wildly nostromo in an angry and threatening voice ordered him forward hirsch was one of those men whom fear lashes like a whip and he must have had an appalling idea of the capatazs ferocity he displayed an extraordinary agility in disappearing forward into the darkness they heard him getting over the tarpaulin then there was the sound of a heavy fall followed by a weary sigh afterwards all was still in the forepart of the lighter as though he had killed himself in his headlong tumble nostromo shouted in a menacing voice  lie still there do not move a limb if i hear as much as a loud breath from you i shall come over there and put a bullet through your head  the mere presence of a coward however passive brings an element of treachery into a dangerous situation nostromos nervous impatience passed into gloomy thoughtfulness decoud in an undertone as if speaking to himself remarked that after all this bizarre event made no great difference he could not conceive what harm the man could do at most he would be in the way like an inanimate and useless objectlike a block of wood for instance  i would think twice before getting rid of a piece of wood said nostromo calmly something may happen unexpectedly where you could make use of it but in an affair like ours a man like this ought to be thrown overboard even if he were as brave as a lion we would not want him here we are not running away for our lives senor there is no harm in a brave man trying to save himself with ingenuity and courage but you have heard his tale don martin his being here is a miracle of fear nostromo paused there is no room for fear in this lighter he added through his teeth  decoud had no answer to make it was not a position for argument for a display of scruples or feelings there were a thousand ways in which a panicstricken man could make himself dangerous it was evident that hirsch could not be spoken to reasoned with or persuaded into a rational line of conduct the story of his own escape demonstrated that clearly enough decoud thought that it was a thousand pities the wretch had not died of fright nature who had made him what he was seemed to have calculated cruelly how much he could bear in the way of atrocious anguish without actually expiring some compassion was due to so much terror decoud though imaginative enough for sympathy resolved not to interfere with any action that nostromo would take but nostromo did nothing and the fate of senor hirsch remained suspended in the darkness of the gulf at the mercy of events which could not be foreseen  the capataz extending his hand put out the candle suddenly it was to decoud as if his companion had destroyed by a single touch the world of affairs of loves of revolution where his complacent superiority analyzed fearlessly all motives and all passions including his own  he gasped a little decoud was affected by the novelty of his position intellectually selfconfident he suffered from being deprived of the only weapon he could use with effect no intelligence could penetrate the darkness of the placid gulf there remained only one thing he was certain of and that was the overweening vanity of his companion it was direct uncomplicated naive and effectual decoud who had been making use of him had tried to understand his man thoroughly he had discovered a complete singleness of motive behind the varied manifestations of a consistent character this was why the man remained so astonishingly simple in the jealous greatness of his conceit and now there was a complication it was evident that he resented having been given a task in which there were so many chances of failure i wonder thought decoud how he would behave if i were not here  he heard nostromo mutter again no there is no room for fear on this lighter courage itself does not seem good enough i have a good eye and a steady hand no man can say he ever saw me tired or uncertain what to do but por dios don martin i have been sent out into this black calm on a business where neither a good eye nor a steady hand nor judgment are any use    he swore a string of oaths in spanish and italian under his breath nothing but sheer desperation will do for this affair  these words were in strange contrast to the prevailing peaceto this almost solid stillness of the gulf a shower fell with an abrupt whispering sound all round the boat and decoud took off his hat and letting his head get wet felt greatly refreshed presently a steady little draught of air caressed his cheek the lighter began to move but the shower distanced it the drops ceased to fall upon his head and hands the whispering died out in the distance nostromo emitted a grunt of satisfaction and grasping the tiller chirruped softly as sailors do to encourage the wind never for the last three days had decoud felt less the need for what the capataz would call desperation  i fancy i hear another shower on the water he observed in a tone of quiet content i hope it will catch us up  nostromo ceased chirruping at once you hear another shower he said doubtfully a sort of thinning of the darkness seemed to have taken place and decoud could see now the outline of his companions figure and even the sail came out of the night like a square block of dense snow  the sound which decoud had detected came along the water harshly nostromo recognized that noise partaking of a hiss and a rustle which spreads out on all sides of a steamer making her way through a smooth water on a quiet night it could be nothing else but the captured transport with troops from esmeralda she carried no lights the noise of her steaming growing louder every minute would stop at times altogether and then begin again abruptly and sound startlingly nearer as if that invisible vessel whose position could not be precisely guessed were making straight for the lighter meantime that last kept on sailing slowly and noiselessly before a breeze so faint that it was only by leaning over the side and feeling the water slip through his fingers that decoud convinced himself they were moving at all his drowsy feeling had departed he was glad to know that the lighter was moving after so much stillness the noise of the steamer seemed uproarious and distracting there was a weirdness in not being able to see her suddenly all was still she had stopped but so close to them that the steam blowing off sent its rumbling vibration right over their heads  they are trying to make out where they are said decoud in a whisper again he leaned over and put his fingers into the water we are moving quite smartly he informed nostromo  we seem to be crossing her bows said the capataz in a cautious tone but this is a blind game with death moving on is of no use we mustnt be seen or heard  his whisper was hoarse with excitement of all his face there was nothing visible but a gleam of white eyeballs his fingers gripped decouds shoulder that is the only way to save this treasure from this steamer full of soldiers any other would have carried lights but you observe there is not a gleam to show us where she is  decoud stood as if paralyzed only his thoughts were wildly active in the space of a second he remembered the desolate glance of antonia as he left her at the bedside of her father in the gloomy house of avellanos with shuttered windows but all the doors standing open and deserted by all the servants except an old negro at the gate he remembered the casa gould on his last visit the arguments the tones of his voice the impenetrable attitude of charles mrs goulds face so blanched with anxiety and fatigue that her eyes seemed to have changed colour appearing nearly black by contrast even whole sentences of the proclamation which he meant to make barrios issue from his headquarters at cayta as soon as he got there passed through his mind the very germ of the new state the separationist proclamation which he had tried before he left to read hurriedly to don jose stretched out on his bed under the fixed gaze of his daughter god knows whether the old statesman had understood it he was unable to speak but he had certainly lifted his arm off the coverlet his hand had moved as if to make the sign of the cross in the air a gesture of blessing of consent decoud had that very draft in his pocket written in pencil on several loose sheets of paper with the heavilyprinted heading administration of the san tome silver mine sulaco republic of costaguana he had written it furiously snatching page after page on charles goulds table mrs gould had looked several times over his shoulder as he wrote but the senor administrador standing straddlelegged would not even glance at it when it was finished he had waved it away firmly it must have been scorn and not caution since he never made a remark about the use of the administrations paper for such a compromising document and that showed his disdain the true english disdain of common prudence as if everything outside the range of their own thoughts and feelings were unworthy of serious recognition decoud had the time in a second or two to become furiously angry with charles gould and even resentful against mrs gould in whose care tacitly it is true he had left the safety of antonia better perish a thousand times than owe your preservation to such people he exclaimed mentally the grip of nostromos fingers never removed from his shoulder tightening fiercely recalled him to himself  the darkness is our friend the capataz murmured into his ear i am going to lower the sail and trust our escape to this black gulf no eyes could make us out lying silent with a naked mast i will do it now before this steamer closes still more upon us the faint creak of a block would betray us and the san tome treasure into the hands of those thieves  he moved about as warily as a cat decoud heard no sound and it was only by the disappearance of the square blotch of darkness that he knew the yard had come down lowered as carefully as if it had been made of glass next moment he heard nostromos quiet breathing by his side  you had better not move at all from where you are don martin advised the capataz earnestly you might stumble or displace something which would make a noise the sweeps and the punting poles are lying about move not for your life por dios don martin he went on in a keen but friendly whisper i am so desperate that if i didnt know your worship to be a man of courage capable of standing stock still whatever happens i would drive my knife into your heart  a deathlike stillness surrounded the lighter it was difficult to believe that there was near a steamer full of men with many pairs of eyes peering from her bridge for some hint of land in the night her steam had ceased blowing off and she remained stopped too far off apparently for any other sound to reach the lighter  perhaps you would capataz decoud began in a whisper however you need not trouble there are other things than the fear of your knife to keep my heart steady it shall not betray you only have you forgotten  i spoke to you openly as to a man as desperate as myself explained the capataz the silver must be saved from the monterists i told captain mitchell three times that i preferred to go alone i told don carlos gould too it was in the casa gould they had sent for me the ladies were there and when i tried to explain why i did not wish to have you with me they promised me both of them great rewards for your safety a strange way to talk to a man you are sending out to an almost certain death those gentlefolk do not seem to have sense enough to understand what they are giving one to do i told them i could do nothing for you you would have been safer with the bandit hernandez it would have been possible to ride out of the town with no greater risk than a chance shot sent after you in the dark but it was as if they had been deaf i had to promise i would wait for you under the harbour gate i did wait and now because you are a brave man you are as safe as the silver neither more nor less  at that moment as if by way of comment upon nostromos words the invisible steamer went ahead at half speed only as could be judged by the leisurely beat of her propeller the sound shifted its place markedly but without coming nearer it even grew a little more distant right abeam of the lighter and then ceased again  they are trying for a sight of the isabels muttered nostromo in order to make for the harbour in a straight line and seize the custom house with the treasure in it have you ever seen the commandant of esmeralda sotillo a handsome fellow with a soft voice when i first came here i used to see him in the calle talking to the senoritas at the windows of the houses and showing his white teeth all the time but one of my cargadores who had been a soldier told me that he had once ordered a man to be flayed alive in the remote campo where he was sent recruiting amongst the people of the estancias it has never entered his head that the compania had a man capable of baffling his game  the murmuring loquacity of the capataz disturbed decoud like a hint of weakness and yet talkative resolution may be as genuine as grim silence  sotillo is not baffled so far he said have you forgotten that crazy man forward  nostromo had not forgotten senor hirsch he reproached himself bitterly for not having visited the lighter carefully before leaving the wharf he reproached himself for not having stabbed and flung hirsch overboard at the very moment of discovery without even looking at his face that would have been consistent with the desperate character of the affair whatever happened sotillo was already baffled even if that wretch now as silent as death did anything to betray the nearness of the lighter sotilloif sotillo it was in command of the troops on boardwould be still baffled of his plunder  i have an axe in my hand nostromo whispered wrathfully that in three strokes would cut through the side down to the waters edge moreover each lighter has a plug in the stern and i know exactly where it is i feel it under the sole of my foot  decoud recognized the ring of genuine determination in the nervous murmurs the vindictive excitement of the famous capataz before the steamer guided by a shriek or two for there could be no more than that nostromo said gnashing his teeth audibly could find the lighter there would be plenty of time to sink this treasure tied up round his neck  the last words he hissed into decouds ear decoud said nothing he was perfectly convinced the usual characteristic quietness of the man was gone it was not equal to the situation as he conceived it something deeper something unsuspected by everyone had come to the surface decoud with careful movements slipped off his overcoat and divested himself of his boots he did not consider himself bound in honour to sink with the treasure his object was to get down to barrios in cayta as the capataz knew very well and he too meant in his own way to put into that attempt all the desperation of which he was capable nostromo muttered true true you are a politician senor rejoin the army and start another revolution he pointed out however that there was a little boat belonging to every lighter fit to carry two men if not more theirs was towing behind  of that decoud had not been aware of course it was too dark to see and it was only when nostromo put his hand upon its painter fastened to a cleat in the stern that he experienced a full measure of relief the prospect of finding himself in the water and swimming overwhelmed by ignorance and darkness probably in a circle till he sank from exhaustion was revolting the barren and cruel futility of such an end intimidated his affectation of careless pessimism in comparison to it the chance of being left floating in a boat exposed to thirst hunger discovery imprisonment execution presented itself with an aspect of amenity worth securing even at the cost of some selfcontempt he did not accept nostromos proposal that he should get into the boat at once something sudden may overwhelm us senor the capataz remarked promising faithfully at the same time to let go the painter at the moment when the necessity became manifest  but decoud assured him lightly that he did not mean to take to the boat till the very last moment and that then he meant the capataz to come along too the darkness of the gulf was no longer for him the end of all things it was part of a living world since pervading it failure and death could be felt at your elbow and at the same time it was a shelter he exulted in its impenetrable obscurity like a wall like a wall he muttered to himself  the only thing which checked his confidence was the thought of senor hirsch not to have bound and gagged him seemed to decoud now the height of improvident folly as long as the miserable creature had the power to raise a yell he was a constant danger his abject terror was mute now but there was no saying from what cause it might suddenly find vent in shrieks  this very madness of fear which both decoud and nostromo had seen in the wild and irrational glances and in the continuous twitchings of his mouth protected senor hirsch from the cruel necessities of this desperate affair the moment of silencing him for ever had passed as nostromo remarked in answer to decouds regrets it was too late it could not be done without noise especially in the ignorance of the mans exact position wherever he had elected to crouch and tremble it was too hazardous to go near him he would begin probably to yell for mercy it was much better to leave him quite alone since he was keeping so still but to trust to his silence became every moment a greater strain upon decouds composure  i wish capataz you had not let the right moment pass he murmured  what to silence him for ever i thought it good to hear first how he came to be here it was too strange who could imagine that it was all an accident afterwards senor when i saw you giving him water to drink i could not do it not after i had seen you holding up the can to his lips as though he were your brother senor that sort of necessity must not be thought of too long and yet it would have been no cruelty to take away from him his wretched life it is nothing but fear your compassion saved him then don martin and now it is too late it couldnt be done without noise  in the steamer they were keeping a perfect silence and the stillness was so profound that decoud felt as if the slightest sound conceivable must travel unchecked and audible to the end of the world what if hirsch coughed or sneezed to feel himself at the mercy of such an idiotic contingency was too exasperating to be looked upon with irony nostromo too seemed to be getting restless was it possible he asked himself that the steamer finding the night too dark altogether intended to remain stopped where she was till daylight he began to think that this after all was the real danger he was afraid that the darkness which was his protection would in the end cause his undoing  sotillo as nostromo had surmised was in command on board the transport the events of the last fortyeight hours in sulaco were not known to him neither was he aware that the telegraphist in esmeralda had managed to warn his colleague in sulaco like a good many officers of the troops garrisoning the province sotillo had been influenced in his adoption of the ribierist cause by the belief that it had the enormous wealth of the gould concession on its side he had been one of the frequenters of the casa gould where he had aired his blanco convictions and his ardour for reform before don jose avellanos casting frank honest glances towards mrs gould and antonia the while he was known to belong to a good family persecuted and impoverished during the tyranny of guzman bento the opinions he expressed appeared eminently natural and proper in a man of his parentage and antecedents and he was not a deceiver it was perfectly natural for him to express elevated sentiments while his whole faculties were taken up with what seemed then a solid and practical notionthe notion that the husband of antonia avellanos would be naturally the intimate friend of the gould concession he even pointed this out to anzani once when negotiating the sixth or seventh small loan in the gloomy damp apartment with enormous iron bars behind the principal shop in the whole row under the arcades he hinted to the universal shopkeeper at the excellent terms he was on with the emancipated senorita who was like a sister to the englishwoman he would advance one leg and put his arms akimbo posing for anzanis inspection and fixing him with a haughty stare  look miserable shopkeeper how can a man like me fail with any woman let alone an emancipated girl living in scandalous freedom he seemed to say  his manner in the casa gould was of course very differentdevoid of all truculence and even slightly mournful like most of his countrymen he was carried away by the sound of fine words especially if uttered by himself he had no convictions of any sort upon anything except as to the irresistible power of his personal advantages but that was so firm that even decouds appearance in sulaco and his intimacy with the goulds and the avellanos did not disquiet him on the contrary he tried to make friends with that rich costaguanero from europe in the hope of borrowing a large sum byandby the only guiding motive of his life was to get money for the satisfaction of his expensive tastes which he indulged recklessly having no selfcontrol he imagined himself a master of intrigue but his corruption was as simple as an animal instinct at times in solitude he had his moments of ferocity and also on such occasions as for instance when alone in a room with anzani trying to get a loan  he had talked himself into the command of the esmeralda garrison that small seaport had its importance as the station of the main submarine cable connecting the occidental provinces with the outer world and the junction with it of the sulaco branch don jose avellanos proposed him and barrios with a rude and jeering guffaw had said oh let sotillo go he is a very good man to keep guard over the cable and the ladies of esmeralda ought to have their turn barrios an indubitably brave man had no great opinion of sotillo  it was through the esmeralda cable alone that the san tome mine could be kept in constant touch with the great financier whose tacit approval made the strength of the ribierist movement this movement had its adversaries even there sotillo governed esmeralda with repressive severity till the adverse course of events upon the distant theatre of civil war forced upon him the reflection that after all the great silver mine was fated to become the spoil of the victors but caution was necessary he began by assuming a dark and mysterious attitude towards the faithful ribierist municipality of esmeralda later on the information that the commandant was holding assemblies of officers in the dead of night which had leaked out somehow caused those gentlemen to neglect their civil duties altogether and remain shut up in their houses suddenly one day all the letters from sulaco by the overland courier were carried off by a file of soldiers from the post office to the commandancia without disguise concealment or apology sotillo had heard through cayta of the final defeat of ribiera  this was the first open sign of the change in his convictions presently notorious democrats who had been living till then in constant fear of arrest leg irons and even floggings could be observed going in and out at the great door of the commandancia where the horses of the orderlies doze under their heavy saddles while the men in ragged uniforms and pointed straw hats lounge on a bench with their naked feet stuck out beyond the strip of shade and a sentry in a red baize coat with holes at the elbows stands at the top of the steps glaring haughtily at the common people who uncover their heads to him as they pass  sotillos ideas did not soar above the care for his personal safety and the chance of plundering the town in his charge but he feared that such a late adhesion would earn but scant gratitude from the victors he had believed just a little too long in the power of the san tome mine the seized correspondence had confirmed his previous information of a large amount of silver ingots lying in the sulaco custom house to gain possession of it would be a clear monterist move a sort of service that would have to be rewarded with the silver in his hands he could make terms for himself and his soldiers he was aware neither of the riots nor of the presidents escape to sulaco and the close pursuit led by monteros brother the guerrillero the game seemed in his own hands the initial moves were the seizure of the cable telegraph office and the securing of the government steamer lying in the narrow creek which is the harbour of esmeralda the last was effected without difficulty by a company of soldiers swarming with a rush over the gangways as she lay alongside the quay but the lieutenant charged with the duty of arresting the telegraphist halted on the way before the only cafe in esmeralda where he distributed some brandy to his men and refreshed himself at the expense of the owner a known ribierist the whole party became intoxicated and proceeded on their mission up the street yelling and firing random shots at the windows this little festivity which might have turned out dangerous to the telegraphists life enabled him in the end to send his warning to sulaco the lieutenant staggering upstairs with a drawn sabre was before long kissing him on both cheeks in one of those swift changes of mood peculiar to a state of drunkenness he clasped the telegraphist close round the neck assuring him that all the officers of the esmeralda garrison were going to be made colonels while tears of happiness streamed down his sodden face thus it came about that the town major coming along later found the whole party sleeping on the stairs and in passages and the telegraphist who scorned this chance of escape very busy clicking the key of the transmitter the major led him away bareheaded with his hands tied behind his back but concealed the truth from sotillo who remained in ignorance of the warning despatched to sulaco  the colonel was not the man to let any sort of darkness stand in the way of the planned surprise it appeared to him a dead certainty his heart was set upon his object with an ungovernable childlike impatience ever since the steamer had rounded punta mala to enter the deeper shadow of the gulf he had remained on the bridge in a group of officers as excited as himself distracted between the coaxings and menaces of sotillo and his staff the miserable commander of the steamer kept her moving with as much prudence as they would let him exercise some of them had been drinking heavily no doubt but the prospect of laying hands on so much wealth made them absurdly foolhardy and at the same time extremely anxious the old major of the battalion a stupid suspicious man who had never been afloat in his life distinguished himself by putting out suddenly the binnacle light the only one allowed on board for the necessities of navigation he could not understand of what use it could be for finding the way to the vehement protestations of the ships captain he stamped his foot and tapped the handle of his sword aha i have unmasked you he cried triumphantly you are tearing your hair from despair at my acuteness am i a child to believe that a light in that brass box can show you where the harbour is i am an old soldier i am i can smell a traitor a league off you wanted that gleam to betray our approach to your friend the englishman a thing like that show you the way what a miserable lie que picardia you sulaco people are all in the pay of those foreigners you deserve to be run through the body with my sword other officers crowding round tried to calm his indignation repeating persuasively no no this is an appliance of the mariners major this is no treachery the captain of the transport flung himself face downwards on the bridge and refused to rise put an end to me at once he repeated in a stifled voice sotillo had to interfere  the uproar and confusion on the bridge became so great that the helmsman fled from the wheel he took refuge in the engineroom and alarmed the engineers who disregarding the threats of the soldiers set on guard over them stopped the engines protesting that they would rather be shot than run the risk of being drowned down below  this was the first time nostromo and decoud heard the steamer stop after order had been restored and the binnacle lamp relighted she went ahead again passing wide of the lighter in her search for the isabels the group could not be made out and at the pitiful entreaties of the captain sotillo allowed the engines to be stopped again to wait for one of those periodical lightenings of darkness caused by the shifting of the cloud canopy spread above the waters of the gulf  sotillo on the bridge muttered from time to time angrily to the captain the other in an apologetic and cringing tone begged su merced the colonel to take into consideration the limitations put upon human faculties by the darkness of the night sotillo swelled with rage and impatience it was the chance of a lifetime  if your eyes are of no more use to you than this i shall have them put out he yelled  the captain of the steamer made no answer for just then the mass of the great isabel loomed up darkly after a passing shower then vanished as if swept away by a wave of greater obscurity preceding another downpour this was enough for him in the voice of a man come back to life again he informed sotillo that in an hour he would be alongside the sulaco wharf the ship was put then full speed on the course and a great bustle of preparation for landing arose among the soldiers on her deck  it was heard distinctly by decoud and nostromo the capataz understood its meaning they had made out the isabels and were going on now in a straight line for sulaco he judged that they would pass close but believed that lying still like this with the sail lowered the lighter could not be seen no not even if they rubbed sides with us he muttered  the rain began to fall again first like a wet mist then with a heavier touch thickening into a smart perpendicular downpour and the hiss and thump of the approaching steamer was coming extremely near decoud with his eyes full of water and lowered head asked himself how long it would be before she drew past when unexpectedly he felt a lurch an inrush of foam broke swishing over the stern simultaneously with a crack of timbers and a staggering shock he had the impression of an angry hand laying hold of the lighter and dragging it along to destruction the shock of course had knocked him down and he found himself rolling in a lot of water at the bottom of the lighter a violent churning went on alongside a strange and amazed voice cried out something above him in the night he heard a piercing shriek for help from senor hirsch he kept his teeth hard set all the time it was a collision  the steamer had struck the lighter obliquely heeling her over till she was half swamped starting some of her timbers and swinging her head parallel to her own course with the force of the blow the shock of it on board of her was hardly perceptible all the violence of that collision was as usual felt only on board the smaller craft even nostromo himself thought that this was perhaps the end of his desperate adventure he too had been flung away from the long tiller which took charge in the lurch next moment the steamer would have passed on leaving the lighter to sink or swim after having shouldered her thus out of her way and without even getting a glimpse of her form had it not been that being deeply laden with stores and the great number of people on board her anchor was low enough to hook itself into one of the wire shrouds of the lighters mast for the space of two or three gasping breaths that new rope held against the sudden strain it was this that gave decoud the sensation of the snatching pull dragging the lighter away to destruction the cause of it of course was inexplicable to him the whole thing was so sudden that he had no time to think but all his sensations were perfectly clear he had kept complete possession of himself in fact he was even pleasantly aware of that calmness at the very moment of being pitched head first over the transom to struggle on his back in a lot of water senor hirschs shriek he had heard and recognized while he was regaining his feet always with that mysterious sensation of being dragged headlong through the darkness not a word not a cry escaped him he had no time to see anything and following upon the despairing screams for help the dragging motion ceased so suddenly that he staggered forward with open arms and fell against the pile of the treasure boxes he clung to them instinctively in the vague apprehension of being flung about again and immediately he heard another lot of shrieks for help prolonged and despairing not near him at all but unaccountably in the distance away from the lighter altogether as if some spirit in the night were mocking at senor hirschs terror and despair  then all was stillas still as when you wake up in your bed in a dark room from a bizarre and agitated dream the lighter rocked slightly the rain was still falling two groping hands took hold of his bruised sides from behind and the capatazs voice whispered in his ear silence for your life silence the steamer has stopped  decoud listened the gulf was dumb he felt the water nearly up to his knees are we sinking he asked in a faint breath  i dont know nostromo breathed back to him senor make not the slightest sound  hirsch when ordered forward by nostromo had not returned into his first hidingplace he had fallen near the mast and had no strength to rise moreover he feared to move he had given himself up for dead but not on any rational grounds it was simply a cruel and terrifying feeling whenever he tried to think what would become of him his teeth would start chattering violently he was too absorbed in the utter misery of his fear to take notice of anything  though he was stifling under the lighters sail which nostromo had unwittingly lowered on top of him he did not even dare to put out his head till the very moment of the steamer striking then indeed he leaped right out spurred on to new miracles of bodily vigour by this new shape of danger the inrush of water when the lighter heeled over unsealed his lips his shriek save me was the first distinct warning of the collision for the people on board the steamer next moment the wire shroud parted and the released anchor swept over the lighters forecastle it came against the breast of senor hirsch who simply seized hold of it without in the least knowing what it was but curling his arms and legs upon the part above the fluke with an invincible unreasonable tenacity the lighter yawed off wide and the steamer moving on carried him away clinging hard and shouting for help it was some time however after the steamer had stopped that his position was discovered his sustained yelping for help seemed to come from somebody swimming in the water at last a couple of men went over the bows and hauled him on board he was carried straight off to sotillo on the bridge his examination confirmed the impression that some craft had been run over and sunk but it was impracticable on such a dark night to look for the positive proof of floating wreckage sotillo was more anxious than ever now to enter the harbour without loss of time the idea that he had destroyed the principal object of his expedition was too intolerable to be accepted this feeling made the story he had heard appear the more incredible senor hirsch after being beaten a little for telling lies was thrust into the chartroom but he was beaten only a little his tale had taken the heart out of sotillos staff though they all repeated round their chief impossible impossible with the exception of the old major who triumphed gloomily  i told you i told you he mumbled i could smell some treachery some diableria a league off  meantime the steamer had kept on her way towards sulaco where only the truth of that matter could be ascertained decoud and nostromo heard the loud churning of her propeller diminish and die out and then with no useless words busied themselves in making for the isabels the last shower had brought with it a gentle but steady breeze the danger was not over yet and there was no time for talk the lighter was leaking like a sieve they splashed in the water at every step the capataz put into decouds hands the handle of the pump which was fitted at the side aft and at once without question or remark decoud began to pump in utter forgetfulness of every desire but that of keeping the treasure afloat nostromo hoisted the sail flew back to the tiller pulled at the sheet like mad the short flare of a match they had been kept dry in a tight tin box though the man himself was completely wet disclosed to the toiling decoud the eagerness of his face bent low over the box of the compass and the attentive stare of his eyes he knew now where he was and he hoped to run the sinking lighter ashore in the shallow cove where the high clifflike end of the great isabel is divided in two equal parts by a deep and overgrown ravine  decoud pumped without intermission nostromo steered without relaxing for a second the intense peering effort of his stare each of them was as if utterly alone with his task it did not occur to them to speak there was nothing in common between them but the knowledge that the damaged lighter must be slowly but surely sinking in that knowledge which was like the crucial test of their desires they seemed to have become completely estranged as if they had discovered in the very shock of the collision that the loss of the lighter would not mean the same thing to them both this common danger brought their differences in aim in view in character and in position into absolute prominence in the private vision of each there was no bond of conviction of common idea they were merely two adventurers pursuing each his own adventure involved in the same imminence of deadly peril therefore they had nothing to say to each other but this peril this only incontrovertible truth in which they shared seemed to act as an inspiration to their mental and bodily powers  there was certainly something almost miraculous in the way the capataz made the cove with nothing but the shadowy hint of the islands shape and the vague gleam of a small sandy strip for a guide where the ravine opens between the cliffs and a slender shallow rivulet meanders out of the bushes to lose itself in the sea the lighter was run ashore and the two men with a taciturn undaunted energy began to discharge her precious freight carrying each oxhide box up the bed of the rivulet beyond the bushes to a hollow place which the caving in of the soil had made below the roots of a large tree its big smooth trunk leaned like a falling column far over the trickle of water running amongst the loose stones  a couple of years before nostromo had spent a whole sunday all alone exploring the island he explained this to decoud after their task was done and they sat weary in every limb with their legs hanging down the low bank and their backs against the tree like a pair of blind men aware of each other and their surroundings by some indefinable sixth sense  yes nostromo repeated i never forget a place i have carefully looked at once he spoke slowly almost lazily as if there had been a whole leisurely life before him instead of the scanty two hours before daylight the existence of the treasure barely concealed in this improbable spot laid a burden of secrecy upon every contemplated step upon every intention and plan of future conduct he felt the partial failure of this desperate affair entrusted to the great reputation he had known how to make for himself however it was also a partial success his vanity was half appeased his nervous irritation had subsided  you never know what may be of use he pursued with his usual quietness of tone and manner i spent a whole miserable sunday in exploring this crumb of land  a misanthropic sort of occupation muttered decoud viciously you had no money i suppose to gamble with and to fling about amongst the girls in your usual haunts capataz  e vero exclaimed the capataz surprised into the use of his native tongue by so much perspicacity i had not therefore i did not want to go amongst those beggarly people accustomed to my generosity it is looked for from the capataz of the cargadores who are the rich men and as it were the caballeros amongst the common people i dont care for cards but as a pastime and as to those girls that boast of having opened their doors to my knock you know i wouldnt look at any one of them twice except for what the people would say they are queer the good people of sulaco and i have got much useful information simply by listening patiently to the talk of the women that everybody believed i was in love with poor teresa could never understand that on that particular sunday senor she scolded so that i went out of the house swearing that i would never darken their door again unless to fetch away my hammock and my chest of clothes senor there is nothing more exasperating than to hear a woman you respect rail against your good reputation when you have not a single brass coin in your pocket i untied one of the small boats and pulled myself out of the harbour with nothing but three cigars in my pocket to help me spend the day on this island but the water of this rivulet you hear under your feet is cool and sweet and good senor both before and after a smoke he was silent for a while then added reflectively that was the first sunday after i brought down the whitewhiskered english rico all the way down the mountains from the paramo on the top of the entrada passand in the coach too no coach had gone up or down that mountain road within the memory of man senor till i brought this one down in charge of fifty peons working like one man with ropes pickaxes and poles under my direction that was the rich englishman who as people say pays for the making of this railway he was very pleased with me but my wages were not due till the end of the month  he slid down the bank suddenly decoud heard the splash of his feet in the brook and followed his footsteps down the ravine his form was lost among the bushes till he had reached the strip of sand under the cliff as often happens in the gulf when the showers during the first part of the night had been frequent and heavy the darkness had thinned considerably towards the morning though there were no signs of daylight as yet  the cargolighter relieved of its precious burden rocked feebly halfafloat with her forefoot on the sand a long rope stretched away like a black cotton thread across the strip of white beach to the grapnel nostromo had carried ashore and hooked to the stem of a treelike shrub in the very opening of the ravine  there was nothing for decoud but to remain on the island he received from nostromos hands whatever food the foresight of captain mitchell had put on board the lighter and deposited it temporarily in the little dinghy which on their arrival they had hauled up out of sight amongst the bushes it was to be left with him the island was to be a hidingplace not a prison he could pull out to a passing ship the osn companys mail boats passed close to the islands when going into sulaco from the north but the minerva carrying off the expresident had taken the news up north of the disturbances in sulaco it was possible that the next steamer down would get instructions to miss the port altogether since the town as far as the minervas officers knew was for the time being in the hands of the rabble this would mean that there would be no steamer for a month as far as the mail service went but decoud had to take his chance of that the island was his only shelter from the proscription hanging over his head the capataz was of course going back the unloaded lighter leaked much less and he thought that she would keep afloat as far as the harbour  he passed to decoud standing kneedeep alongside one of the two spades which belonged to the equipment of each lighter for use when ballasting ships by working with it carefully as soon as there was daylight enough to see decoud could loosen a mass of earth and stones overhanging the cavity in which they had deposited the treasure so that it would look as if it had fallen naturally it would cover up not only the cavity but even all traces of their work the footsteps the displaced stones and even the broken bushes  besides who would think of looking either for you or the treasure here nostromo continued as if he could not tear himself away from the spot nobody is ever likely to come here what could any man want with this piece of earth as long as there is room for his feet on the mainland the people in this country are not curious there are even no fishermen here to intrude upon your worship all the fishing that is done in the gulf goes on near zapiga over there senor if you are forced to leave this island before anything can be arranged for you do not try to make for zapiga it is a settlement of thieves and matreros where they would cut your throat promptly for the sake of your gold watch and chain and senor think twice before confiding in any one whatever even in the officers of the companys steamers if you ever get on board one honesty alone is not enough for security you must look to discretion and prudence in a man and always remember senor before you open your lips for a confidence that this treasure may be left safely here for hundreds of years time is on its side senor and silver is an incorruptible metal that can be trusted to keep its value for ever    an incorruptible metal he repeated as if the idea had given him a profound pleasure  as some men are said to be decoud pronounced inscrutably while the capataz who busied himself in baling out the lighter with a wooden bucket went on throwing the water over the side with a regular splash decoud incorrigible in his scepticism reflected not cynically but with general satisfaction that this man was made incorruptible by his enormous vanity that finest form of egoism which can take on the aspect of every virtue  nostromo ceased baling and as if struck with a sudden thought dropped the bucket with a clatter into the lighter  have you any message he asked in a lowered voice remember i shall be asked questions  you must find the hopeful words that ought to be spoken to the people in town i trust for that your intelligence and your experience capataz you understand  si senor    for the ladies  yes yes said decoud hastily your wonderful reputation will make them attach great value to your words therefore be careful what you say i am looking forward he continued feeling the fatal touch of contempt for himself to which his complex nature was subject i am looking forward to a glorious and successful ending to my mission do you hear capataz use the words glorious and successful when you speak to the senorita your own mission is accomplished gloriously and successfully you have indubitably saved the silver of the mine not only this silver but probably all the silver that shall ever come out of it  nostromo detected the ironic tone i dare say senor don martin he said moodily there are very few things that i am not equal to ask the foreign signori i a man of the people who cannot always understand what you mean but as to this lot which i must leave here let me tell you that i would believe it in greater safety if you had not been with me at all  an exclamation escaped decoud and a short pause followed shall i go back with you to sulaco he asked in an angry tone  shall i strike you dead with my knife where you stand retorted nostromo contemptuously it would be the same thing as taking you to sulaco come senor your reputation is in your politics and mine is bound up with the fate of this silver do you wonder i wish there had been no other man to share my knowledge i wanted no one with me senor  you could not have kept the lighter afloat without me decoud almost shouted you would have gone to the bottom with her  yes uttered nostromo slowly alone  here was a man decoud reflected that seemed as though he would have preferred to die rather than deface the perfect form of his egoism such a man was safe in silence he helped the capataz to get the grapnel on board nostromo cleared the shelving shore with one push of the heavy oar and decoud found himself solitary on the beach like a man in a dream a sudden desire to hear a human voice once more seized upon his heart the lighter was hardly distinguishable from the black water upon which she floated  what do you think has become of hirsch he shouted  knocked overboard and drowned cried nostromos voice confidently out of the black wastes of sky and sea around the islet keep close in the ravine senor i shall try to come out to you in a night or two  a slight swishing rustle showed that nostromo was setting the sail it filled all at once with a sound as of a single loud drumtap decoud went back to the ravine nostromo at the tiller looked back from time to time at the vanishing mass of the great isabel which little by little merged into the uniform texture of the night at last when he turned his head again he saw nothing but a smooth darkness like a solid wall  then he too experienced that feeling of solitude which had weighed heavily on decoud after the lighter had slipped off the shore but while the man on the island was oppressed by a bizarre sense of unreality affecting the very ground upon which he walked the mind of the capataz of the cargadores turned alertly to the problem of future conduct nostromos faculties working on parallel lines enabled him to steer straight to keep a lookout for hermosa near which he had to pass and to try to imagine what would happen tomorrow in sulaco tomorrow or as a matter of fact today since the dawn was not very far sotillo would find out in what way the treasure had gone a gang of cargadores had been employed in loading it into a railway truck from the custom house storerooms and running the truck on to the wharf there would be arrests made and certainly before noon sotillo would know in what manner the silver had left sulaco and who it was that took it out  nostromos intention had been to sail right into the harbour but at this thought by a sudden touch of the tiller he threw the lighter into the wind and checked her rapid way his reappearance with the very boat would raise suspicions would cause surmises would absolutely put sotillo on the track he himself would be arrested and once in the calabozo there was no saying what they would do to him to make him speak he trusted himself but he stood up to look round near by hermosa showed low its white surface as flat as a table with the slight run of the sea raised by the breeze washing over its edges noisily the lighter must be sunk at once  he allowed her to drift with her sail aback there was already a good deal of water in her he allowed her to drift towards the harbour entrance and letting the tiller swing about squatted down and busied himself in loosening the plug with that out she would fill very quickly and every lighter carried a little iron ballastenough to make her go down when full of water when he stood up again the noisy wash about the hermosa sounded far away almost inaudible and already he could make out the shape of land about the harbour entrance this was a desperate affair and he was a good swimmer a mile was nothing to him and he knew of an easy place for landing just below the earthworks of the old abandoned fort it occurred to him with a peculiar fascination that this fort was a good place in which to sleep the day through after so many sleepless nights  with one blow of the tiller he unshipped for the purpose he knocked the plug out but did not take the trouble to lower the sail he felt the water welling up heavily about his legs before he leaped on to the taffrail there upright and motionless in his shirt and trousers only he stood waiting when he had felt her settle he sprang far away with a mighty splash  at once he turned his head the gloomy clouded dawn from behind the mountains showed him on the smooth waters the upper corner of the sail a dark wet triangle of canvas waving slightly to and fro he saw it vanish as if jerked under and then struck out for the shore      part third the lighthouse   chapter one  directly the cargo boat had slipped away from the wharf and got lost in the darkness of the harbour the europeans of sulaco separated to prepare for the coming of the monterist regime which was approaching sulaco from the mountains as well as from the sea  this bit of manual work in loading the silver was their last concerted action it ended the three days of danger during which according to the newspaper press of europe their energy had preserved the town from the calamities of popular disorder at the shore end of the jetty captain mitchell said goodnight and turned back his intention was to walk the planks of the wharf till the steamer from esmeralda turned up the engineers of the railway staff collecting their basque and italian workmen marched them away to the railway yards leaving the custom house so well defended on the first day of the riot standing open to the four winds of heaven their men had conducted themselves bravely and faithfully during the famous three days of sulaco in a great part this faithfulness and that courage had been exercised in selfdefence rather than in the cause of those material interests to which charles gould had pinned his faith amongst the cries of the mob not the least loud had been the cry of death to foreigners it was indeed a lucky circumstance for sulaco that the relations of those imported workmen with the people of the country had been uniformly bad from the first  doctor monygham going to the door of violas kitchen observed this retreat marking the end of the foreign interference this withdrawal of the army of material progress from the field of costaguana revolutions  algarrobe torches carried on the outskirts of the moving body sent their penetrating aroma into his nostrils their light sweeping along the front of the house made the letters of the inscription albergo dltalia una leap out black from end to end of the long wall his eyes blinked in the clear blaze several young men mostly fair and tall shepherding this mob of dark bronzed heads surmounted by the glint of slanting rifle barrels nodded to him familiarly as they went by the doctor was a wellknown character some of them wondered what he was doing there then on the flank of their workmen they tramped on following the line of rails  withdrawing your people from the harbour said the doctor addressing himself to the chief engineer of the railway who had accompanied charles gould so far on his way to the town walking by the side of the horse with his hand on the saddlebow they had stopped just outside the open door to let the workmen cross the road  as quick as i can we are not a political faction answered the engineer meaningly and we are not going to give our new rulers a handle against the railway you approve me gould  absolutely said charles goulds impassive voice high up and outside the dim parallelogram of light falling on the road through the open door  with sotillo expected from one side and pedro montero from the other the engineerinchiefs only anxiety now was to avoid a collision with either sulaco for him was a railway station a terminus workshops a great accumulation of stores as against the mob the railway defended its property but politically the railway was neutral he was a brave man and in that spirit of neutrality he had carried proposals of truce to the selfappointed chiefs of the popular party the deputies fuentes and gamacho bullets were still flying about when he had crossed the plaza on that mission waving above his head a white napkin belonging to the table linen of the amarilla club  he was rather proud of this exploit and reflecting that the doctor busy all day with the wounded in the patio of the casa gould had not had time to hear the news he began a succinct narrative he had communicated to them the intelligence from the construction camp as to pedro montero the brother of the victorious general he had assured them could be expected at sulaco at any time now this news as he anticipated when shouted out of the window by senor gamacho induced a rush of the mob along the campo road towards rincon the two deputies also after shaking hands with him effusively mounted and galloped off to meet the great man i have misled them a little as to the time the chief engineer confessed however hard he rides he can scarcely get here before the morning but my object is attained ive secured several hours peace for the losing party but i did not tell them anything about sotillo for fear they would take it into their heads to try to get hold of the harbour again either to oppose him or welcome himtheres no saying which there was goulds silver on which rests the remnant of our hopes decouds retreat had to be thought of too i think the railway has done pretty well by its friends without compromising itself hopelessly now the parties must be left to themselves  costaguana for the costaguaneros interjected the doctor sardonically it is a fine country and they have raised a fine crop of hates vengeance murder and rapinethose sons of the country  well i am one of them charles goulds voice sounded calmly and i must be going on to see to my own crop of trouble my wife has driven straight on doctor  yes all was quiet on this side mrs gould has taken the two girls with her  charles gould rode on and the engineerinchief followed the doctor indoors  that man is calmness personified he said appreciatively dropping on a bench and stretching his wellshaped legs in cycling stockings nearly across the doorway he must be extremely sure of himself  if thats all he is sure of then he is sure of nothing said the doctor he had perched himself again on the end of the table he nursed his cheek in the palm of one hand while the other sustained the elbow it is the last thing a man ought to be sure of the candle halfconsumed and burning dimly with a long wick lighted up from below his inclined face whose expression affected by the drawnin cicatrices in the cheeks had something vaguely unnatural an exaggerated remorseful bitterness as he sat there he had the air of meditating upon sinister things the engineerinchief gazed at him for a time before he protested  i really dont see that for me there seems to be nothing else however  he was a wise man but he could not quite conceal his contempt for that sort of paradox in fact dr monygham was not liked by the europeans of sulaco his outward aspect of an outcast which he preserved even in mrs goulds drawingroom provoked unfavourable criticism there could be no doubt of his intelligence and as he had lived for over twenty years in the country the pessimism of his outlook could not be altogether ignored but instinctively in selfdefence of their activities and hopes his hearers put it to the account of some hidden imperfection in the mans character it was known that many years before when quite young he had been made by guzman bento chief medical officer of the army not one of the europeans then in the service of costaguana had been so much liked and trusted by the fierce old dictator  afterwards his story was not so clear it lost itself amongst the innumerable tales of conspiracies and plots against the tyrant as a stream is lost in an arid belt of sandy country before it emerges diminished and troubled perhaps on the other side the doctor made no secret of it that he had lived for years in the wildest parts of the republic wandering with almost unknown indian tribes in the great forests of the far interior where the great rivers have their sources but it was mere aimless wandering he had written nothing collected nothing brought nothing for science out of the twilight of the forests which seemed to cling to his battered personality limping about sulaco where it had drifted in casually only to get stranded on the shores of the sea  it was also known that he had lived in a state of destitution till the arrival of the goulds from europe don carlos and dona emilia had taken up the mad english doctor when it became apparent that for all his savage independence he could be tamed by kindness perhaps it was only hunger that had tamed him in years gone by he had certainly been acquainted with charles goulds father in sta marta and now no matter what were the dark passages of his history as the medical officer of the san tome mine he became a recognized personality he was recognized but not unreservedly accepted so much defiant eccentricity and such an outspoken scorn for mankind seemed to point to mere recklessness of judgment the bravado of guilt besides since he had become again of some account vague whispers had been heard that years ago when fallen into disgrace and thrown into prison by guzman bento at the time of the socalled great conspiracy he had betrayed some of his best friends amongst the conspirators nobody pretended to believe that whisper the whole story of the great conspiracy was hopelessly involved and obscure it is admitted in costaguana that there never had been a conspiracy except in the diseased imagination of the tyrant and therefore nothing and no one to betray though the most distinguished costaguaneros had been imprisoned and executed upon that accusation the procedure had dragged on for years decimating the better class like a pestilence the mere expression of sorrow for the fate of executed kinsmen had been punished with death don jose avellanos was perhaps the only one living who knew the whole story of those unspeakable cruelties he had suffered from them himself and he with a shrug of the shoulders and a nervous jerky gesture of the arm was wont to put away from him as it were every allusion to it but whatever the reason dr monygham a personage in the administration of the gould concession treated with reverent awe by the miners and indulged in his peculiarities by mrs gould remained somehow outside the pale  it was not from any liking for the doctor that the engineerinchief had lingered in the inn upon the plain he liked old viola much better he had come to look upon the albergo dltalia una as a dependence of the railway many of his subordinates had their quarters there mrs goulds interest in the family conferred upon it a sort of distinction the engineerinchief with an army of workers under his orders appreciated the moral influence of the old garibaldino upon his countrymen his austere oldworld republicanism had a severe soldierlike standard of faithfulness and duty as if the world were a battlefield where men had to fight for the sake of universal love and brotherhood instead of a more or less large share of booty  poor old chap he said after he had heard the doctors account of teresa hell never be able to keep the place going by himself i shall be sorry  hes quite alone up there grunted doctor monygham with a toss of his heavy head towards the narrow staircase every living soul has cleared out and mrs gould took the girls away just now it might not be oversafe for them out here before very long of course as a doctor i can do nothing more here but she has asked me to stay with old viola and as i have no horse to get back to the mine where i ought to be i made no difficulty to stay they can do without me in the town  i have a good mind to remain with you doctor till we see whether anything happens tonight at the harbour declared the engineerinchief he must not be molested by sotillos soldiery who may push on as far as this at once sotillo used to be very cordial to me at the goulds and at the club how that manll ever dare to look any of his friends here in the face i cant imagine  hell no doubt begin by shooting some of them to get over the first awkwardness said the doctor nothing in this country serves better your military man who has changed sides than a few summary executions he spoke with a gloomy positiveness that left no room for protest the engineerinchief did not attempt any he simply nodded several times regretfully then said  i think we shall be able to mount you in the morning doctor our peons have recovered some of our stampeded horses by riding hard and taking a wide circuit by los hatos and along the edge of the forest clear of rincon altogether you may hope to reach the san tome bridge without being interfered with the mine is just now to my mind the safest place for anybody at all compromised i only wish the railway was as difficult to touch  am i compromised doctor monygham brought out slowly after a short silence  the whole gould concession is compromised it could not have remained for ever outside the political life of the countryif those convulsions may be called life the thing iscan it be touched the moment was bound to come when neutrality would become impossible and charles gould understood this well i believe he is prepared for every extremity a man of his sort has never contemplated remaining indefinitely at the mercy of ignorance and corruption it was like being a prisoner in a cavern of banditti with the price of your ransom in your pocket and buying your life from day to day your mere safety not your liberty mind doctor i know what i am talking about the image at which you shrug your shoulders is perfectly correct especially if you conceive such a prisoner endowed with the power of replenishing his pocket by means as remote from the faculties of his captors as if they were magic you must have understood that as well as i do doctor he was in the position of the goose with the golden eggs i broached this matter to him as far back as sir johns visit here the prisoner of stupid and greedy banditti is always at the mercy of the first imbecile ruffian who may blow out his brains in a fit of temper or for some prospect of an immediate big haul the tale of killing the goose with the golden eggs has not been evolved for nothing out of the wisdom of mankind it is a story that will never grow old that is why charles gould in his deep dumb way has countenanced the ribierist mandate the first public act that promised him safety on other than venal grounds ribierism has failed as everything merely rational fails in this country but gould remains logical in wishing to save this big lot of silver decouds plan of a counterrevolution may be practicable or not it may have a chance or it may not have a chance with all my experience of this revolutionary continent i can hardly yet look at their methods seriously decoud has been reading to us his draft of a proclamation and talking very well for two hours about his plan of action he had arguments which should have appeared solid enough if we members of old stable political and national organizations were not startled by the mere idea of a new state evolved like this out of the head of a scoffing young man fleeing for his life with a proclamation in his pocket to a rough jeering halfbred swashbuckler who in this part of the world is called a general it sounds like a comic fairy taleand behold it may come off because it is true to the very spirit of the country  is the silver gone off then asked the doctor moodily  the chief engineer pulled out his watch by captain mitchells reckoningand he ought to knowit has been gone long enough now to be some three or four miles outside the harbour and as mitchell says nostromo is the sort of seaman to make the best of his opportunities here the doctor grunted so heavily that the other changed his tone  you have a poor opinion of that move doctor but why charles gould has got to play his game out though he is not the man to formulate his conduct even to himself perhaps let alone to others it may be that the game has been partly suggested to him by holroyd but it accords with his character too and that is why it has been so successful havent they come to calling him el rey de sulaco in sta marta a nickname may be the best record of a success thats what i call putting the face of a joke upon the body of a truth my dear sir when i first arrived in sta marta i was struck by the way all those journalists demagogues members of congress and all those generals and judges cringed before a sleepyeyed advocate without practice simply because he was the plenipotentiary of the gould concession sir john when he came out was impressed too  a new state with that plump dandy decoud for the first president mused dr monygham nursing his cheek and swinging his legs all the time  upon my word and why not the chief engineer retorted in an unexpectedly earnest and confidential voice it was as if something subtle in the air of costaguana had inoculated him with the local faith in pronunciamientos all at once he began to talk like an expert revolutionist of the instrument ready to hand in the intact army at cayta which could be brought back in a few days to sulaco if only decoud managed to make his way at once down the coast for the military chief there was barrios who had nothing but a bullet to expect from montero his former professional rival and bitter enemy barrioss concurrence was assured as to his army it had nothing to expect from montero either not even a months pay from that point of view the existence of the treasure was of enormous importance the mere knowledge that it had been saved from the monterists would be a strong inducement for the cayta troops to embrace the cause of the new state  the doctor turned round and contemplated his companion for some time  this decoud i see is a persuasive young beggar he remarked at last and pray is it for this then that charles gould has let the whole lot of ingots go out to sea in charge of that nostromo  charles gould said the engineerinchief has said no more about his motive than usual you know he doesnt talk but we all here know his motive and he has only onethe safety of the san tome mine with the preservation of the gould concession in the spirit of his compact with holroyd holroyd is another uncommon man they understand each others imaginative side one is thirty the other nearly sixty and they have been made for each other to be a millionaire and such a millionaire as holroyd is like being eternally young the audacity of youth reckons upon what it fancies an unlimited time at its disposal but a millionaire has unlimited means in his handwhich is better ones time on earth is an uncertain quantity but about the long reach of millions there is no doubt the introduction of a pure form of christianity into this continent is a dream for a youthful enthusiast and i have been trying to explain to you why holroyd at fiftyeight is like a man on the threshold of life and better too hes not a missionary but the san tome mine holds just that for him i assure you in sober truth that he could not manage to keep this out of a strictly business conference upon the finances of costaguana he had with sir john a couple of years ago sir john mentioned it with amazement in a letter he wrote to me here from san francisco when on his way home upon my word doctor things seem to be worth nothing by what they are in themselves i begin to believe that the only solid thing about them is the spiritual value which everyone discovers in his own form of activity  bah interrupted the doctor without stopping for an instant the idle swinging movement of his legs selfflattery food for that vanity which makes the world go round meantime what do you think is going to happen to the treasure floating about the gulf with the great capataz and the great politician  why are you uneasy about it doctor  i uneasy and what the devil is it to me i put no spiritual value into my desires or my opinions or my actions they have not enough vastness to give me room for selfflattery look for instance i should certainly have liked to ease the last moments of that poor woman and i cant its impossible have you met the impossible face to faceor have you the napoleon of railways no such word in your dictionary  is she bound to have a very bad time of it asked the chief engineer with humane concern  slow heavy footsteps moved across the planks above the heavy hard wood beams of the kitchen then down the narrow opening of the staircase made in the thickness of the wall and narrow enough to be defended by one man against twenty enemies came the murmur of two voices one faint and broken the other deep and gentle answering it and in its graver tone covering the weaker sound  the two men remained still and silent till the murmurs ceased then the doctor shrugged his shoulders and muttered  yes shes bound to and i could do nothing if i went up now  a long period of silence above and below ensued  i fancy began the engineer in a subdued voice that you mistrust captain mitchells capataz  mistrust him muttered the doctor through his teeth i believe him capable of anythingeven of the most absurd fidelity i am the last person he spoke to before he left the wharf you know the poor woman up there wanted to see him and i let him go up to her the dying must not be contradicted you know she seemed then fairly calm and resigned but the scoundrel in those ten minutes or so has done or said something which seems to have driven her into despair you know went on the doctor hesitatingly women are so very unaccountable in every position and at all times of life that i thought sometimes she was in a way dont you see in love with himthe capataz the rascal has his own charm indubitably or he would not have made the conquest of all the populace of the town no no i am not absurd i may have given a wrong name to some strong sentiment for him on her part to an unreasonable and simple attitude a woman is apt to take up emotionally towards a man she used to abuse him to me frequently which of course is not inconsistent with my idea not at all it looked to me as if she were always thinking of him he was something important in her life you know i have seen a lot of those people whenever i came down from the mine mrs gould used to ask me to keep my eye on them she likes italians she has lived a long time in italy i believe and she took a special fancy to that old garibaldino a remarkable chap enough a rugged and dreamy character living in the republicanism of his young days as if in a cloud he has encouraged much of the capatazs confounded nonsensethe highstrung exalted old beggar  what sort of nonsense wondered the chief engineer i found the capataz always a very shrewd and sensible fellow absolutely fearless and remarkably useful a perfect handy man sir john was greatly impressed by his resourcefulness and attention when he made that overland journey from sta marta later on as you might have heard he rendered us a service by disclosing to the then chief of police the presence in the town of some professional thieves who came from a distance to wreck and rob our monthly pay train he has certainly organized the lighterage service of the harbour for the osn company with great ability he knows how to make himself obeyed foreigner though he is it is true that the cargadores are strangers here too for the most partimmigrants islenos  his prestige is his fortune muttered the doctor sourly  the man has proved his trustworthiness up to the hilt on innumerable occasions and in all sorts of ways argued the engineer when this question of the silver arose captain mitchell naturally was very warmly of the opinion that his capataz was the only man fit for the trust as a sailor of course i suppose so but as a man dont you know gould decoud and myself judged that it didnt matter in the least who went any boatman would have done just as well pray what could a thief do with such a lot of ingots if he ran off with them he would have in the end to land somewhere and how could he conceal his cargo from the knowledge of the people ashore we dismissed that consideration from our minds moreover decoud was going there have been occasions when the capataz has been more implicitly trusted  he took a slightly different view the doctor said i heard him declare in this very room that it would be the most desperate affair of his life he made a sort of verbal will here in my hearing appointing old viola his executor and by jove do you know hehes not grown rich by his fidelity to you good people of the railway and the harbour i suppose he obtains somehow do you say thatsome spiritual value for his labours or else i dont know why the devil he should be faithful to you gould mitchell or anybody else he knows this country well he knows for instance that gamacho the deputy from javira has been nothing else but a tramposo of the commonest sort a petty pedlar of the campo till he managed to get enough goods on credit from anzani to open a little store in the wilds and got himself elected by the drunken mozos that hang about the estancias and the poorest sort of rancheros who were in his debt and gamacho who tomorrow will be probably one of our high officials is a stranger tooan isleno he might have been a cargador on the o s n wharf had he not the posadero of rincon is ready to swear it murdered a pedlar in the woods and stolen his pack to begin life on and do you think that gamacho then would have ever become a hero with the democracy of this place like our capataz of course not he isnt half the man no decidedly i think that nostromo is a fool  the doctors talk was distasteful to the builder of railways it is impossible to argue that point he said philosophically each man has his gifts you should have heard gamacho haranguing his friends in the street he has a howling voice and he shouted like mad lifting his clenched fist right above his head and throwing his body half out of the window at every pause the rabble below yelled down with the oligarchs viva la libertad fuentes inside looked extremely miserable you know he is the brother of jorge fuentes who has been minister of the interior for six months or so some few years back of course he has no conscience but he is a man of birth and educationat one time the director of the customs of cayta that idiotbrute gamacho fastened himself upon him with his following of the lowest rabble his sickly fear of that ruffian was the most rejoicing sight imaginable  he got up and went to the door to look out towards the harbour all quiet he said i wonder if sotillo really means to turn up here    chapter two  captain mitchell pacing the wharf was asking himself the same question there was always the doubt whether the warning of the esmeralda telegraphista fragmentary and interrupted messagehad been properly understood however the good man had made up his mind not to go to bed till daylight if even then he imagined himself to have rendered an enormous service to charles gould when he thought of the saved silver he rubbed his hands together with satisfaction in his simple way he was proud at being a party to this extremely clever expedient it was he who had given it a practical shape by suggesting the possibility of intercepting at sea the northbound steamer and it was advantageous to his company too which would have lost a valuable freight if the treasure had been left ashore to be confiscated the pleasure of disappointing the monterists was also very great authoritative by temperament and the long habit of command captain mitchell was no democrat he even went so far as to profess a contempt for parliamentarism itself his excellency don vincente ribiera he used to say whom i and that fellow of mine nostromo had the honour sir and the pleasure of saving from a cruel death deferred too much to his congress it was a mistakea distinct mistake sir  the guileless old seaman superintending the osn service imagined that the last three days had exhausted every startling surprise the political life of costaguana could offer he used to confess afterwards that the events which followed surpassed his imagination to begin with sulaco because of the seizure of the cables and the disorganization of the steam service remained for a whole fortnight cut off from the rest of the world like a besieged city  one would not have believed it possible but so it was sir a full fortnight  the account of the extraordinary things that happened during that time and the powerful emotions he experienced acquired a comic impressiveness from the pompous manner of his personal narrative he opened it always by assuring his hearer that he was in the thick of things from first to last then he would begin by describing the getting away of the silver and his natural anxiety lest his fellow in charge of the lighter should make some mistake apart from the loss of so much precious metal the life of senor martin decoud an agreeable wealthy and wellinformed young gentleman would have been jeopardized through his falling into the hands of his political enemies captain mitchell also admitted that in his solitary vigil on the wharf he had felt a certain measure of concern for the future of the whole country  a feeling sir he explained perfectly comprehensible in a man properly grateful for the many kindnesses received from the best families of merchants and other native gentlemen of independent means who barely saved by us from the excesses of the mob seemed to my minds eye destined to become the prey in person and fortune of the native soldiery which as is well known behave with regrettable barbarity to the inhabitants during their civil commotions and then sir there were the goulds for both of whom man and wife i could not but entertain the warmest feelings deserved by their hospitality and kindness i felt too the dangers of the gentlemen of the amarilla club who had made me honorary member and had treated me with uniform regard and civility both in my capacity of consular agent and as superintendent of an important steam service miss antonia avellanos the most beautiful and accomplished young lady whom it had ever been my privilege to speak to was not a little in my mind i confess how the interests of my company would be affected by the impending change of officials claimed a large share of my attention too in short sir i was extremely anxious and very tired as you may suppose by the exciting and memorable events in which i had taken my little part the companys building containing my residence was within five minutes walk with the attraction of some supper and of my hammock i always take my nightly rest in a hammock as the most suitable to the climate but somehow sir though evidently i could do nothing for any one by remaining about i could not tear myself away from that wharf where the fatigue made me stumble painfully at times the night was excessively darkthe darkest i remember in my life so that i began to think that the arrival of the transport from esmeralda could not possibly take place before daylight owing to the difficulty of navigating the gulf the mosquitoes bit like fury we have been infested here with mosquitoes before the late improvements a peculiar harbour brand sir renowned for its ferocity they were like a cloud about my head and i shouldnt wonder that but for their attacks i would have dozed off as i walked up and down and got a heavy fall i kept on smoking cigar after cigar more to protect myself from being eaten up alive than from any real relish for the weed then sir when perhaps for the twentieth time i was approaching my watch to the lighted end in order to see the time and observing with surprise that it wanted yet ten minutes to midnight i heard the splash of a ships propelleran unmistakable sound to a sailors ear on such a calm night it was faint indeed because they were advancing with precaution and dead slow both on account of the darkness and from their desire of not revealing too soon their presence a very unnecessary care because i verily believe in all the enormous extent of this harbour i was the only living soul about even the usual staff of watchmen and others had been absent from their posts for several nights owing to the disturbances i stood stock still after dropping and stamping out my cigara circumstance highly agreeable i should think to the mosquitoes if i may judge from the state of my face next morning but that was a trifling inconvenience in comparison with the brutal proceedings i became victim of on the part of sotillo something utterly inconceivable sir more like the proceedings of a maniac than the action of a sane man however lost to all sense of honour and decency but sotillo was furious at the failure of his thievish scheme  in this captain mitchell was right sotillo was indeed infuriated captain mitchell however had not been arrested at once a vivid curiosity induced him to remain on the wharf which is nearly four hundred feet long to see or rather hear the whole process of disembarkation concealed by the railway truck used for the silver which had been run back afterwards to the shore end of the jetty captain mitchell saw the small detachment thrown forward pass by taking different directions upon the plain meantime the troops were being landed and formed into a column whose head crept up gradually so close to him that he made it out barring nearly the whole width of the wharf only a very few yards from him then the low shuffling murmuring clinking sounds ceased and the whole mass remained for about an hour motionless and silent awaiting the return of the scouts on land nothing was to be heard except the deep baying of the mastiffs at the railway yards answered by the faint barking of the curs infesting the outer limits of the town a detached knot of dark shapes stood in front of the head of the column  presently the picket at the end of the wharf began to challenge in undertones single figures approaching from the plain those messengers sent back from the scouting parties flung to their comrades brief sentences and passed on rapidly becoming lost in the great motionless mass to make their report to the staff it occurred to captain mitchell that his position could become disagreeable and perhaps dangerous when suddenly at the head of the jetty there was a shout of command a bugle call followed by a stir and a rattling of arms and a murmuring noise that ran right up the column near by a loud voice directed hurriedly push that railway car out of the way at the rush of bare feet to execute the order captain mitchell skipped back a pace or two the car suddenly impelled by many hands flew away from him along the rails and before he knew what had happened he found himself surrounded and seized by his arms and the collar of his coat  we have caught a man hiding here mi teniente cried one of his captors  hold him on one side till the rearguard comes along answered the voice the whole column streamed past captain mitchell at a run the thundering noise of their feet dying away suddenly on the shore his captors held him tightly disregarding his declaration that he was an englishman and his loud demands to be taken at once before their commanding officer finally he lapsed into dignified silence with a hollow rumble of wheels on the planks a couple of field guns dragged by hand rolled by then after a small body of men had marched past escorting four or five figures which walked in advance with a jingle of steel scabbards he felt a tug at his arms and was ordered to come along during the passage from the wharf to the custom house it is to be feared that captain mitchell was subjected to certain indignities at the hands of the soldierssuch as jerks thumps on the neck forcible application of the butt of a rifle to the small of his back their ideas of speed were not in accord with his notion of his dignity he became flustered flushed and helpless it was as if the world were coming to an end  the long building was surrounded by troops which were already piling arms by companies and preparing to pass the night lying on the ground in their ponchos with their sacks under their heads corporals moved with swinging lanterns posting sentries all round the walls wherever there was a door or an opening sotillo was taking his measures to protect his conquest as if it had indeed contained the treasure his desire to make his fortune at one audacious stroke of genius had overmastered his reasoning faculties he would not believe in the possibility of failure the mere hint of such a thing made his brain reel with rage every circumstance pointing to it appeared incredible the statement of hirsch which was so absolutely fatal to his hopes could by no means be admitted it is true too that hirschs story had been told so incoherently with such excessive signs of distraction that it really looked improbable it was extremely difficult as the saying is to make head or tail of it on the bridge of the steamer directly after his rescue sotillo and his officers in their impatience and excitement would not give the wretched man time to collect such few wits as remained to him he ought to have been quieted soothed and reassured whereas he had been roughly handled cuffed shaken and addressed in menacing tones his struggles his wriggles his attempts to get down on his knees followed by the most violent efforts to break away as if he meant incontinently to jump overboard his shrieks and shrinkings and cowering wild glances had filled them first with amazement then with a doubt of his genuineness as men are wont to suspect the sincerity of every great passion his spanish too became so mixed up with german that the better half of his statements remained incomprehensible he tried to propitiate them by calling them hochwohlgeboren herren which in itself sounded suspicious when admonished sternly not to trifle he repeated his entreaties and protestations of loyalty and innocence again in german obstinately because he was not aware in what language he was speaking his identity of course was perfectly known as an inhabitant of esmeralda but this made the matter no clearer as he kept on forgetting decouds name mixing him up with several other people he had seen in the casa gould it looked as if they all had been in the lighter together and for a moment sotillo thought that he had drowned every prominent ribierist of sulaco the improbability of such a thing threw a doubt upon the whole statement hirsch was either mad or playing a partpretending fear and distraction on the spur of the moment to cover the truth sotillos rapacity excited to the highest pitch by the prospect of an immense booty could believe in nothing adverse this jew might have been very much frightened by the accident but he knew where the silver was concealed and had invented this story with his jewish cunning to put him entirely off the track as to what had been done  sotillo had taken up his quarters on the upper floor in a vast apartment with heavy black beams but there was no ceiling and the eye lost itself in the darkness under the high pitch of the roof the thick shutters stood open on a long table could be seen a large inkstand some stumpy inky quill pens and two square wooden boxes each holding half a hundredweight of sand sheets of grey coarse official paper bestrewed the floor it must have been a room occupied by some higher official of the customs because a large leathern armchair stood behind the table with other highbacked chairs scattered about a net hammock was swung under one of the beamsfor the officials afternoon siesta no doubt a couple of candles stuck into tall iron candlesticks gave a dim reddish light the colonels hat sword and revolver lay between them and a couple of his more trusty officers lounged gloomily against the table the colonel threw himself into the armchair and a big negro with a sergeants stripes on his ragged sleeve kneeling down pulled off his boots sotillos ebony moustache contrasted violently with the livid colouring of his cheeks his eyes were sombre and as if sunk very far into his head he seemed exhausted by his perplexities languid with disappointment but when the sentry on the landing thrust his head in to announce the arrival of a prisoner he revived at once  let him be brought in he shouted fiercely  the door flew open and captain mitchell bareheaded his waistcoat open the bow of his tie under his ear was hustled into the room  sotillo recognized him at once he could not have hoped for a more precious capture here was a man who could tell him if he chose everything he wished to knowand directly the problem of how best to make him talk to the point presented itself to his mind the resentment of a foreign nation had no terrors for sotillo the might of the whole armed europe would not have protected captain mitchell from insults and illusage so well as the quick reflection of sotillo that this was an englishman who would most likely turn obstinate under bad treatment and become quite unmanageable at all events the colonel smoothed the scowl on his brow  what the excellent senor mitchell he cried in affected dismay the pretended anger of his swift advance and of his shout release the caballero at once was so effective that the astounded soldiers positively sprang away from their prisoner thus suddenly deprived of forcible support captain mitchell reeled as though about to fall sotillo took him familiarly under the arm led him to a chair waved his hand at the room go out all of you he commanded  when they had been left alone he stood looking down irresolute and silent watching till captain mitchell had recovered his power of speech  here in his very grasp was one of the men concerned in the removal of the silver sotillos temperament was of that sort that he experienced an ardent desire to beat him just as formerly when negotiating with difficulty a loan from the cautious anzani his fingers always itched to take the shopkeeper by the throat as to captain mitchell the suddenness unexpectedness and general inconceivableness of this experience had confused his thoughts moreover he was physically out of breath  ive been knocked down three times between this and the wharf he gasped out at last somebody shall be made to pay for this he had certainly stumbled more than once and had been dragged along for some distance before he could regain his stride with his recovered breath his indignation seemed to madden him he jumped up crimson all his white hair bristling his eyes glaring vengefully and shook violently the flaps of his ruined waistcoat before the disconcerted sotillo look those uniformed thieves of yours downstairs have robbed me of my watch  the old sailors aspect was very threatening sotillo saw himself cut off from the table on which his sabre and revolver were lying  i demand restitution and apologies mitchell thundered at him quite beside himself from you yes from you  for the space of a second or so the colonel stood with a perfectly stony expression of face then as captain mitchell flung out an arm towards the table as if to snatch up the revolver sotillo with a yell of alarm bounded to the door and was gone in a flash slamming it after him surprise calmed captain mitchells fury behind the closed door sotillo shouted on the landing and there was a great tumult of feet on the wooden staircase  disarm him bind him the colonel could be heard vociferating  captain mitchell had just the time to glance once at the windows with three perpendicular bars of iron each and some twenty feet from the ground as he well knew before the door flew open and the rush upon him took place in an incredibly short time he found himself bound with many turns of a hide rope to a highbacked chair so that his head alone remained free not till then did sotillo who had been leaning in the doorway trembling visibly venture again within the soldiers picking up from the floor the rifles they had dropped to grapple with the prisoner filed out of the room the officers remained leaning on their swords and looking on  the watch the watch raved the colonel pacing to and fro like a tiger in a cage give me that mans watch  it was true that when searched for arms in the hall downstairs before being taken into sotillos presence captain mitchell had been relieved of his watch and chain but at the colonels clamour it was produced quickly enough a corporal bringing it up carried carefully in the palms of his joined hands sotillo snatched it and pushed the clenched fist from which it dangled close to captain mitchells face  now then you arrogant englishman you dare to call the soldiers of the army thieves behold your watch  he flourished his fist as if aiming blows at the prisoners nose captain mitchell helpless as a swathed infant looked anxiously at the sixtyguinea gold halfchronometer presented to him years ago by a committee of underwriters for saving a ship from total loss by fire sotillo too seemed to perceive its valuable appearance he became silent suddenly stepped aside to the table and began a careful examination in the light of the candles he had never seen anything so fine his officers closed in and craned their necks behind his back  he became so interested that for an instant he forgot his precious prisoner there is always something childish in the rapacity of the passionate clearminded southern races wanting in the misty idealism of the northerners who at the smallest encouragement dream of nothing less than the conquest of the earth sotillo was fond of jewels gold trinkets of personal adornment after a moment he turned about and with a commanding gesture made all his officers fall back he laid down the watch on the table then negligently pushed his hat over it  ha he began going up very close to the chair you dare call my valiant soldiers of the esmeralda regiment thieves you dare what impudence you foreigners come here to rob our country of its wealth you never have enough your audacity knows no bounds  he looked towards the officers amongst whom there was an approving murmur the older major was moved to declare  si mi colonel they are all traitors  i shall say nothing continued sotillo fixing the motionless and powerless mitchell with an angry but uneasy stare i shall say nothing of your treacherous attempt to get possession of my revolver to shoot me while i was trying to treat you with consideration you did not deserve you have forfeited your life your only hope is in my clemency  he watched for the effect of his words but there was no obvious sign of fear on captain mitchells face his white hair was full of dust which covered also the rest of his helpless person as if he had heard nothing he twitched an eyebrow to get rid of a bit of straw which hung amongst the hairs  sotillo advanced one leg and put his arms akimbo it is you mitchell he said emphatically who are the thief not my soldiers he pointed at his prisoner a forefinger with a long almondshaped nail where is the silver of the san tome mine i ask you mitchell where is the silver that was deposited in this custom house answer me that you stole it you were a party to stealing it it was stolen from the government aha you think i do not know what i say but i am up to your foreign tricks it is gone the silver no gone in one of your lanchas you miserable man how dared you  this time he produced his effect how on earth could sotillo know that thought mitchell his head the only part of his body that could move betrayed his surprise by a sudden jerk  ha you tremble sotillo shouted suddenly it is a conspiracy it is a crime against the state did you not know that the silver belongs to the republic till the government claims are satisfied where is it where have you hidden it you miserable thief  at this question captain mitchells sinking spirits revived in whatever incomprehensible manner sotillo had already got his information about the lighter he had not captured it that was clear in his outraged heart captain mitchell had resolved that nothing would induce him to say a word while he remained so disgracefully bound but his desire to help the escape of the silver made him depart from this resolution his wits were very much at work he detected in sotillo a certain air of doubt of irresolution  that man he said to himself is not certain of what he advances for all his pomposity in social intercourse captain mitchell could meet the realities of life in a resolute and ready spirit now he had got over the first shock of the abominable treatment he was cool and collected enough the immense contempt he felt for sotillo steadied him and he said oracularly no doubt it is well concealed by this time  sotillo too had time to cool down muy bien mitchell he said in a cold and threatening manner but can you produce the government receipt for the royalty and the custom house permit of embarkation hey can you no then the silver has been removed illegally and the guilty shall be made to suffer unless it is produced within five days from this he gave orders for the prisoner to be unbound and locked up in one of the smaller rooms downstairs he walked about the room moody and silent till captain mitchell with each of his arms held by a couple of men stood up shook himself and stamped his feet  how did you like to be tied up mitchell he asked derisively  it is the most incredible abominable use of power captain mitchell declared in a loud voice and whatever your purpose you shall gain nothing from it i can promise you  the tall colonel livid with his coalblack ringlets and moustache crouched as it were to look into the eyes of the short thickset redfaced prisoner with rumpled white hair  that we shall see you shall know my power a little better when i tie you up to a potalon outside in the sun for a whole day he drew himself up haughtily and made a sign for captain mitchell to be led away  what about my watch cried captain mitchell hanging back from the efforts of the men pulling him towards the door  sotillo turned to his officers no but only listen to this picaro caballeros he pronounced with affected scorn and was answered by a chorus of derisive laughter he demands his watch    he ran up again to captain mitchell for the desire to relieve his feelings by inflicting blows and pain upon this englishman was very strong within him your watch you are a prisoner in war time mitchell in war time you have no rights and no property caramba the very breath in your body belongs to me remember that  bosh said captain mitchell concealing a disagreeable impression  down below in a great hall with the earthen floor and with a tall mound thrown up by white ants in a corner the soldiers had kindled a small fire with broken chairs and tables near the arched gateway through which the faint murmur of the harbour waters on the beach could be heard while captain mitchell was being led down the staircase an officer passed him running up to report to sotillo the capture of more prisoners a lot of smoke hung about in the vast gloomy place the fire crackled and as if through a haze captain mitchell made out surrounded by short soldiers with fixed bayonets the heads of three tall prisonersthe doctor the engineerinchief and the white leonine mane of old viola who stood halfturned away from the others with his chin on his breast and his arms crossed mitchells astonishment knew no bounds he cried out the other two exclaimed also but he hurried on diagonally across the big cavernlike hall lots of thoughts surmises hints of caution and so on crowded his head to distraction  is he actually keeping you shouted the chief engineer whose single eyeglass glittered in the firelight  an officer from the top of the stairs was shouting urgently bring them all upall three  in the clamour of voices and the rattle of arms captain mitchell made himself heard imperfectly by heavens the fellow has stolen my watch  the engineerinchief on the staircase resisted the pressure long enough to shout what what did you say  my chronometer captain mitchell yelled violently at the very moment of being thrust head foremost through a small door into a sort of cell perfectly black and so narrow that he fetched up against the opposite wall the door had been instantly slammed he knew where they had put him this was the strong room of the custom house whence the silver had been removed only a few hours earlier it was almost as narrow as a corridor with a small square aperture barred by a heavy grating at the distant end captain mitchell staggered for a few steps then sat down on the earthen floor with his back to the wall nothing not even a gleam of light from anywhere interfered with captain mitchells meditation he did some hard but not very extensive thinking it was not of a gloomy cast the old sailor with all his small weaknesses and absurdities was constitutionally incapable of entertaining for any length of time a fear of his personal safety it was not so much firmness of soul as the lack of a certain kind of imaginationthe kind whose undue development caused intense suffering to senor hirsch that sort of imagination which adds the blind terror of bodily suffering and of death envisaged as an accident to the body alone strictlyto all the other apprehensions on which the sense of ones existence is based unfortunately captain mitchell had not much penetration of any kind characteristic illuminating trifles of expression action or movement escaped him completely he was too pompously and innocently aware of his own existence to observe that of others for instance he could not believe that sotillo had been really afraid of him and this simply because it would never have entered into his head to shoot any one except in the most pressing case of selfdefence anybody could see he was not a murdering kind of man he reflected quite gravely then why this preposterous and insulting charge he asked himself but his thoughts mainly clung around the astounding and unanswerable question how the devil the fellow got to know that the silver had gone off in the lighter it was obvious that he had not captured it and obviously he could not have captured it in this last conclusion captain mitchell was misled by the assumption drawn from his observation of the weather during his long vigil on the wharf he thought that there had been much more wind than usual that night in the gulf whereas as a matter of fact the reverse was the case  how in the name of all thats marvellous did that confounded fellow get wind of the affair was the first question he asked directly after the bang clatter and flash of the open door which was closed again almost before he could lift his dropped head informed him that he had a companion of captivity dr monyghams voice stopped muttering curses in english and spanish  is that you mitchell he made answer surlily i struck my forehead against this confounded wall with enough force to fell an ox where are you  captain mitchell accustomed to the darkness could make out the doctor stretching out his hands blindly  i am sitting here on the floor dont fall over my legs captain mitchells voice announced with great dignity of tone the doctor entreated not to walk about in the dark sank down to the ground too the two prisoners of sotillo with their heads nearly touching began to exchange confidences  yes the doctor related in a low tone to captain mitchells vehement curiosity we have been nabbed in old violas place it seems that one of their pickets commanded by an officer pushed as far as the town gate they had orders not to enter but to bring along every soul they could find on the plain we had been talking in there with the door open and no doubt they saw the glimmer of our light they must have been making their approaches for some time the engineer laid himself on a bench in a recess by the fireplace and i went upstairs to have a look i hadnt heard any sound from there for a long time old viola as soon as he saw me come up lifted his arm for silence i stole in on tiptoe by jove his wife was lying down and had gone to sleep the woman had actually dropped off to sleep senor doctor viola whispers to me it looks as if her oppression was going to get better yes i said very much surprised your wife is a wonderful woman giorgio just then a shot was fired in the kitchen which made us jump and cower as if at a thunderclap it seems that the party of soldiers had stolen quite close up and one of them had crept up to the door he looked in thought there was no one there and holding his rifle ready entered quietly the chief told me that he had just closed his eyes for a moment when he opened them he saw the man already in the middle of the room peering into the dark corners the chief was so startled that without thinking he made one leap from the recess right out in front of the fireplace the soldier no less startled up with his rifle and pulls the trigger deafening and singeing the engineer but in his flurry missing him completely but look what happens at the noise of the report the sleeping woman sat up as if moved by a spring with a shriek the children gian battista save the children i have it in my ears now it was the truest cry of distress i ever heard i stood as if paralyzed but the old husband ran across to the bedside stretching out his hands she clung to them i could see her eyes go glazed the old fellow lowered her down on the pillows and then looked round at me she was dead all this took less than five minutes and then i ran down to see what was the matter it was no use thinking of any resistance nothing we two could say availed with the officer so i volunteered to go up with a couple of soldiers and fetch down old viola he was sitting at the foot of the bed looking at his wifes face and did not seem to hear what i said but after i had pulled the sheet over her head he got up and followed us downstairs quietly in a sort of thoughtful way they marched us off along the road leaving the door open and the candle burning the chief engineer strode on without a word but i looked back once or twice at the feeble gleam after we had gone some considerable distance the garibaldino who was walking by my side suddenly said i have buried many men on battlefields on this continent the priests talk of consecrated ground bah all the earth made by god is holy but the sea which knows nothing of kings and priests and tyrants is the holiest of all doctor i should like to bury her in the sea no mummeries candles incense no holy water mumbled over by priests the spirit of liberty is upon the waters    amazing old man he was saying all this in an undertone as if talking to himself  yes yes interrupted captain mitchell impatiently poor old chap but have you any idea how that ruffian sotillo obtained his information he did not get hold of any of our cargadores who helped with the truck did he but no it is impossible these were picked men weve had in our boats for these five years and i paid them myself specially for the job with instructions to keep out of the way for twentyfour hours at least i saw them with my own eyes march on with the italians to the railway yards the chief promised to give them rations as long as they wanted to remain there  well said the doctor slowly i can tell you that you may say goodbye for ever to your best lighter and to the capataz of cargadores  at this captain mitchell scrambled up to his feet in the excess of his excitement the doctor without giving him time to exclaim stated briefly the part played by hirsch during the night  captain mitchell was overcome drowned he muttered in a bewildered and appalled whisper drowned afterwards he kept still apparently listening but too absorbed in the news of the catastrophe to follow the doctors narrative with attention  the doctor had taken up an attitude of perfect ignorance till at last sotillo was induced to have hirsch brought in to repeat the whole story which was got out of him again with the greatest difficulty because every moment he would break out into lamentations at last hirsch was led away looking more dead than alive and shut up in one of the upstairs rooms to be close at hand then the doctor keeping up his character of a man not admitted to the inner councils of the san tome administration remarked that the story sounded incredible of course he said he couldnt tell what had been the action of the europeans as he had been exclusively occupied with his own work in looking after the wounded and also in attending don jose avellanos he had succeeded in assuming so well a tone of impartial indifference that sotillo seemed to be completely deceived till then a show of regular inquiry had been kept up one of the officers sitting at the table wrote down the questions and the answers the others lounging about the room listened attentively puffing at their long cigars and keeping their eyes on the doctor but at that point sotillo ordered everybody out    chapter three  directly they were alone the colonels severe official manner changed he rose and approached the doctor his eyes shone with rapacity and hope he became confidential the silver might have been indeed put on board the lighter but it was not conceivable that it should have been taken out to sea the doctor watching every word nodded slightly smoking with apparent relish the cigar which sotillo had offered him as a sign of his friendly intentions the doctors manner of cold detachment from the rest of the europeans led sotillo on till from conjecture to conjecture he arrived at hinting that in his opinion this was a putup job on the part of charles gould in order to get hold of that immense treasure all to himself the doctor observant and selfpossessed muttered he is very capable of that  here captain mitchell exclaimed with amazement amusement and indignation you said that of charles gould disgust and even some suspicion crept into his tone for to him too as to other europeans there appeared to be something dubious about the doctors personality  what on earth made you say that to this watchstealing scoundrel he asked whats the object of an infernal lie of that sort that confounded pickpocket was quite capable of believing you  he snorted for a time the doctor remained silent in the dark  yes that is exactly what i did say he uttered at last in a tone which would have made it clear enough to a third party that the pause was not of a reluctant but of a reflective character captain mitchell thought that he had never heard anything so brazenly impudent in his life  well well he muttered to himself but he had not the heart to voice his thoughts they were swept away by others full of astonishment and regret a heavy sense of discomfiture crushed him the loss of the silver the death of nostromo which was really quite a blow to his sensibilities because he had become attached to his capataz as people get attached to their inferiors from love of ease and almost unconscious gratitude and when he thought of decoud being drowned too his sensibility was almost overcome by this miserable end what a heavy blow for that poor young woman captain mitchell did not belong to the species of crabbed old bachelors on the contrary he liked to see young men paying attentions to young women it seemed to him a natural and proper thing proper especially as to sailors it was different it was not their place to marry he maintained but it was on moral grounds as a matter of selfdenial for he explained life on board ship is not fit for a woman even at best and if you leave her on shore first of all it is not fair and next she either suffers from it or doesnt care a bit which in both cases is bad he couldnt have told what upset him mostcharles goulds immense material loss the death of nostromo which was a heavy loss to himself or the idea of that beautiful and accomplished young woman being plunged into mourning  yes the doctor who had been apparently reflecting began again he believed me right enough i thought he would have hugged me si si he said he will write to that partner of his the rich americano in san francisco that it is all lost why not there is enough to share with many people  but this is perfectly imbecile cried captain mitchell  the doctor remarked that sotillo was imbecile and that his imbecility was ingenious enough to lead him completely astray he had helped him only but a little way  i mentioned the doctor said in a sort of casual way that treasure is generally buried in the earth rather than set afloat upon the sea at this my sotillo slapped his forehead por dios yes he said they must have buried it on the shores of this harbour somewhere before they sailed out  heavens and earth muttered captain mitchell i should not have believed that anybody could be ass enough he paused then went on mournfully but whats the good of all this it would have been a clever enough lie if the lighter had been still afloat it would have kept that inconceivable idiot perhaps from sending out the steamer to cruise in the gulf that was the danger that worried me no end captain mitchell sighed profoundly  i had an object the doctor pronounced slowly  had you muttered captain mitchell well thats lucky or else i would have thought that you went on fooling him for the fun of the thing and perhaps that was your object well i must say i personally wouldnt condescend to that sort of thing it is not to my taste no no blackening a friends character is not my idea of fun if it were to fool the greatest blackguard on earth  had it not been for captain mitchells depression caused by the fatal news his disgust of dr monygham would have taken a more outspoken shape but he thought to himself that now it really did not matter what that man whom he had never liked would say and do  i wonder he grumbled why they have shut us up together or why sotillo should have shut you up at all since it seems to me you have been fairly chummy up there  yes i wonder said the doctor grimly  captain mitchells heart was so heavy that he would have preferred for the time being a complete solitude to the best of company but any company would have been preferable to the doctors at whom he had always looked askance as a sort of beachcomber of superior intelligence partly reclaimed from his abased state that feeling led him to ask  what has that ruffian done with the other two  the chief engineer he would have let go in any case said the doctor he wouldnt like to have a quarrel with the railway upon his hands not just yet at any rate i dont think captain mitchell that you understand exactly what sotillos position is  i dont see why i should bother my head about it snarled captain mitchell  no assented the doctor with the same grim composure i dont see why you should it wouldnt help a single human being in the world if you thought ever so hard upon any subject whatever  no said captain mitchell simply and with evident depression a man locked up in a confounded dark hole is not much use to anybody  as to old viola the doctor continued as though he had not heard sotillo released him for the same reason he is presently going to release you  eh what exclaimed captain mitchell staring like an owl in the darkness what is there in common between me and old viola more likely because the old chap has no watch and chain for the pickpocket to steal and i tell you what dr monygham he went on with rising choler he will find it more difficult than he thinks to get rid of me he will burn his fingers over that job yet i can tell you to begin with i wont go without my watch and as to the restwe shall see i dare say it is no great matter for you to be locked up but joe mitchell is a different kind of man sir i dont mean to submit tamely to insult and robbery i am a public character sir  and then captain mitchell became aware that the bars of the opening had become visible a black grating upon a square of grey the coming of the day silenced captain mitchell as if by the reflection that now in all the future days he would be deprived of the invaluable services of his capataz he leaned against the wall with his arms folded on his breast and the doctor walked up and down the whole length of the place with his peculiar hobbling gait as if slinking about on damaged feet at the end furthest from the grating he would be lost altogether in the darkness only the slight limping shuffle could be heard there was an air of moody detachment in that painful prowl kept up without a pause when the door of the prison was suddenly flung open and his name shouted out he showed no surprise he swerved sharply in his walk and passed out at once as though much depended upon his speed but captain mitchell remained for some time with his shoulders against the wall quite undecided in the bitterness of his spirit whether it wouldnt be better to refuse to stir a limb in the way of protest he had half a mind to get himself carried out but after the officer at the door had shouted three or four times in tones of remonstrance and surprise he condescended to walk out  sotillos manner had changed the colonels offhand civility was slightly irresolute as though he were in doubt if civility were the proper course in this case he observed captain mitchell attentively before he spoke from the big armchair behind the table in a condescending voice  i have concluded not to detain you senor mitchell i am of a forgiving disposition i make allowances let this be a lesson to you however  the peculiar dawn of sulaco which seems to break far away to the westward and creep back into the shade of the mountains mingled with the reddish light of the candles captain mitchell in sign of contempt and indifference let his eyes roam all over the room and he gave a hard stare to the doctor perched already on the casement of one of the windows with his eyelids lowered careless and thoughtfulor perhaps ashamed  sotillo ensconced in the vast armchair remarked i should have thought that the feelings of a caballero would have dictated to you an appropriate reply  he waited for it but captain mitchell remaining mute more from extreme resentment than from reasoned intention sotillo hesitated glanced towards the doctor who looked up and nodded then went on with a slight effort  here senor mitchell is your watch learn how hasty and unjust has been your judgment of my patriotic soldiers  lying back in his seat he extended his arm over the table and pushed the watch away slightly captain mitchell walked up with undisguised eagerness put it to his ear then slipped it into his pocket coolly  sotillo seemed to overcome an immense reluctance again he looked aside at the doctor who stared at him unwinkingly  but as captain mitchell was turning away without as much as a nod or a glance he hastened to say  you may go and wait downstairs for the senor doctor whom i am going to liberate too you foreigners are insignificant to my mind  he forced a slight discordant laugh out of himself while captain mitchell for the first time looked at him with some interest  the law shall take note later on of your transgressions sotillo hurried on but as for me you can live free unguarded unobserved do you hear senor mitchell you may depart to your affairs you are beneath my notice my attention is claimed by matters of the very highest importance  captain mitchell was very nearly provoked to an answer it displeased him to be liberated insultingly but want of sleep prolonged anxieties a profound disappointment with the fatal ending of the silversaving business weighed upon his spirits it was as much as he could do to conceal his uneasiness not about himself perhaps but about things in general it occurred to him distinctly that something underhand was going on as he went out he ignored the doctor pointedly  a brute said sotillo as the door shut  dr monygham slipped off the windowsill and thrusting his hands into the pockets of the long grey dust coat he was wearing made a few steps into the room  sotillo got up too and putting himself in the way examined him from head to foot  so your countrymen do not confide in you very much senor doctor they do not love you eh why is that i wonder  the doctor lifting his head answered by a long lifeless stare and the words perhaps because i have lived too long in costaguana  sotillo had a gleam of white teeth under the black moustache  aha but you love yourself he said encouragingly  if you leave them alone the doctor said looking with the same lifeless stare at sotillos handsome face they will betray themselves very soon meantime i may try to make don carlos speak  ah senor doctor said sotillo wagging his head you are a man of quick intelligence we were made to understand each other he turned away he could bear no longer that expressionless and motionless stare which seemed to have a sort of impenetrable emptiness like the black depth of an abyss  even in a man utterly devoid of moral sense there remains an appreciation of rascality which being conventional is perfectly clear sotillo thought that dr monygham so different from all europeans was ready to sell his countrymen and charles gould his employer for some share of the san tome silver sotillo did not despise him for that the colonels want of moral sense was of a profound and innocent character it bordered upon stupidity moral stupidity nothing that served his ends could appear to him really reprehensible nevertheless he despised dr monygham he had for him an immense and satisfactory contempt he despised him with all his heart because he did not mean to let the doctor have any reward at all he despised him not as a man without faith and honour but as a fool dr monyghams insight into his character had deceived sotillo completely therefore he thought the doctor a fool  since his arrival in sulaco the colonels ideas had undergone some modification  he no longer wished for a political career in monteros administration he had always doubted the safety of that course since he had learned from the chief engineer that at daylight most likely he would be confronted by pedro montero his misgivings on that point had considerably increased the guerrillero brother of the generalthe pedrito of popular speechhad a reputation of his own he wasnt safe to deal with sotillo had vaguely planned seizing not only the treasure but the town itself and then negotiating at leisure but in the face of facts learned from the chief engineer who had frankly disclosed to him the whole situation his audacity never of a very dashing kind had been replaced by a most cautious hesitation  an armyan army crossed the mountains under pedrito already he had repeated unable to hide his consternation if it had not been that i am given the news by a man of your position i would never have believed it astonishing  an armed force corrected the engineer suavely his aim was attained it was to keep sulaco clear of any armed occupation for a few hours longer to let those whom fear impelled leave the town in the general dismay there were families hopeful enough to fly upon the road towards los hatos which was left open by the withdrawal of the armed rabble under senores fuentes and gamacho to rincon with their enthusiastic welcome for pedro montero it was a hasty and risky exodus and it was said that hernandez occupying with his band the woods about los hatos was receiving the fugitives that a good many people he knew were contemplating such a flight had been well known to the chief engineer  father corbelans efforts in the cause of that most pious robber had not been altogether fruitless the political chief of sulaco had yielded at the last moment to the urgent entreaties of the priest had signed a provisional nomination appointing hernandez a general and calling upon him officially in this new capacity to preserve order in the town the fact is that the political chief seeing the situation desperate did not care what he signed it was the last official document he signed before he left the palace of the intendencia for the refuge of the osn companys office but even had he meant his act to be effective it was already too late the riot which he feared and expected broke out in less than an hour after father corbelan had left him indeed father corbelan who had appointed a meeting with nostromo in the dominican convent where he had his residence in one of the cells never managed to reach the place from the intendencia he had gone straight on to the avellanoss house to tell his brotherinlaw and though he stayed there no more than half an hour he had found himself cut off from his ascetic abode nostromo after waiting there for some time watching uneasily the increasing uproar in the street had made his way to the offices of the porvenir and stayed there till daylight as decoud had mentioned in the letter to his sister thus the capataz instead of riding towards the los hatos woods as bearer of hernandezs nomination had remained in town to save the life of the president dictator to assist in repressing the outbreak of the mob and at last to sail out with the silver of the mine  but father corbelan escaping to hernandez had the document in his pocket a piece of official writing turning a bandit into a general in a memorable last official act of the ribierist party whose watchwords were honesty peace and progress probably neither the priest nor the bandit saw the irony of it father corbelan must have found messengers to send into the town for early on the second day of the disturbances there were rumours of hernandez being on the road to los hatos ready to receive those who would put themselves under his protection a strangelooking horseman elderly and audacious had appeared in the town riding slowly while his eyes examined the fronts of the houses as though he had never seen such high buildings before before the cathedral he had dismounted and kneeling in the middle of the plaza his bridle over his arm and his hat lying in front of him on the ground had bowed his head crossing himself and beating his breast for some little time remounting his horse with a fearless but not unfriendly look round the little gathering formed about his public devotions he had asked for the casa avellanos a score of hands were extended in answer with fingers pointing up the calle de la constitucion  the horseman had gone on with only a glance of casual curiosity upwards to the windows of the amarilla club at the corner his stentorian voice shouted periodically in the empty street which is the casa avellanos till an answer came from the scared porter and he disappeared under the gate the letter he was bringing written by father corbelan with a pencil by the campfire of hernandez was addressed to don jose of whose critical state the priest was not aware antonia read it and after consulting charles gould sent it on for the information of the gentlemen garrisoning the amarilla club for herself her mind was made up she would rejoin her uncle she would entrust the last daythe last hours perhapsof her fathers life to the keeping of the bandit whose existence was a protest against the irresponsible tyranny of all parties alike against the moral darkness of the land the gloom of los hatos woods was preferable a life of hardships in the train of a robber band less debasing antonia embraced with all her soul her uncles obstinate defiance of misfortune it was grounded in the belief in the man whom she loved  in his message the vicargeneral answered upon his head for hernandezs fidelity as to his power he pointed out that he had remained unsubdued for so many years in that letter decouds idea of the new occidental state whose flourishing and stable condition is a matter of common knowledge now was for the first time made public and used as an argument hernandez exbandit and the last general of ribierist creation was confident of being able to hold the tract of country between the woods of los hatos and the coast range till that devoted patriot don martin decoud could bring general barrios back to sulaco for the reconquest of the town  heaven itself wills it providence is on our side wrote father corbelan there was no time to reflect upon or to controvert his statement and if the discussion started upon the reading of that letter in the amarilla club was violent it was also shortlived in the general bewilderment of the collapse some jumped at the idea with joyful astonishment as upon the amazing discovery of a new hope others became fascinated by the prospect of immediate personal safety for their women and children the majority caught at it as a drowning man catches at a straw father corbelan was unexpectedly offering them a refuge from pedrito montero with his llaneros allied to senores fuentes and gamacho with their armed rabble  all the latter part of the afternoon an animated discussion went on in the big rooms of the amarilla club even those members posted at the windows with rifles and carbines to guard the end of the street in case of an offensive return of the populace shouted their opinions and arguments over their shoulders as dusk fell don juste lopez inviting those caballeros who were of his way of thinking to follow him withdrew into the corredor where at a little table in the light of two candles he busied himself in composing an address or rather a solemn declaration to be presented to pedrito montero by a deputation of such members of assembly as had elected to remain in town his idea was to propitiate him in order to save the form at least of parliamentary institutions seated before a blank sheet of paper a goosequill pen in his hand and surged upon from all sides he turned to the right and to the left repeating with solemn insistence  caballeros a moment of silence a moment of silence we ought to make it clear that we bow in all good faith to the accomplished facts  the utterance of that phrase seemed to give him a melancholy satisfaction the hubbub of voices round him was growing strained and hoarse in the sudden pauses the excited grimacing of the faces would sink all at once into the stillness of profound dejection  meantime the exodus had begun carretas full of ladies and children rolled swaying across the plaza with men walking or riding by their side mounted parties followed on mules and horses the poorest were setting out on foot men and women carrying bundles clasping babies in their arms leading old people dragging along the bigger children when charles gould after leaving the doctor and the engineer at the casa viola entered the town by the harbour gate all those that had meant to go were gone and the others had barricaded themselves in their houses in the whole dark street there was only one spot of flickering lights and moving figures where the senor administrador recognized his wifes carriage waiting at the door of the avellanoss house he rode up almost unnoticed and looked on without a word while some of his own servants came out of the gate carrying don jose avellanos who with closed eyes and motionless features appeared perfectly lifeless his wife and antonia walked on each side of the improvised stretcher which was put at once into the carriage the two women embraced while from the other side of the landau father corbelans emissary with his ragged beard all streaked with grey and high bronzed cheekbones stared sitting upright in the saddle then antonia dryeyed got in by the side of the stretcher and after making the sign of the cross rapidly lowered a thick veil upon her face the servants and the three or four neighbours who had come to assist stood back uncovering their heads on the box ignacio resigned now to driving all night and to having perhaps his throat cut before daylight looked back surlily over his shoulder  drive carefully cried mrs gould in a tremulous voice  si carefully si nina he mumbled chewing his lips his round leathery cheeks quivering and the landau rolled slowly out of the light  i will see them as far as the ford said charles gould to his wife she stood on the edge of the sidewalk with her hands clasped lightly and nodded to him as he followed after the carriage and now the windows of the amarilla club were dark the last spark of resistance had died out turning his head at the corner charles gould saw his wife crossing over to their own gate in the lighted patch of the street one of their neighbours a wellknown merchant and landowner of the province followed at her elbow talking with great gestures as she passed in all the lights went out in the street which remained dark and empty from end to end  the houses of the vast plaza were lost in the night high up like a star there was a small gleam in one of the towers of the cathedral and the equestrian statue gleamed pale against the black trees of the alameda like a ghost of royalty haunting the scenes of revolution the rare prowlers they met ranged themselves against the wall beyond the last houses the carriage rolled noiselessly on the soft cushion of dust and with a greater obscurity a feeling of freshness seemed to fall from the foliage of the trees bordering the country road the emissary from hernandezs camp pushed his horse close to charles gould  caballero he said in an interested voice you are he whom they call the king of sulaco the master of the mine is it not so  yes i am the master of the mine answered charles gould  the man cantered for a time in silence then said i have a brother a sereno in your service in the san tome valley you have proved yourself a just man there has been no wrong done to any one since you called upon the people to work in the mountains my brother says that no official of the government no oppressor of the campo has been seen on your side of the stream your own officials do not oppress the people in the gorge doubtless they are afraid of your severity you are a just man and a powerful one he added  he spoke in an abrupt independent tone but evidently he was communicative with a purpose he told charles gould that he had been a ranchero in one of the lower valleys far south a neighbour of hernandez in the old days and godfather to his eldest boy one of those who joined him in his resistance to the recruiting raid which was the beginning of all their misfortunes it was he that when his compadre had been carried off had buried his wife and children murdered by the soldiers  si senor he muttered hoarsely i and two or three others the lucky ones left at liberty buried them all in one grave near the ashes of their ranch under the tree that had shaded its roof  it was to him too that hernandez came after he had deserted three years afterwards he had still his uniform on with the sergeants stripes on the sleeve and the blood of his colonel upon his hands and breast three troopers followed him of those who had started in pursuit but had ridden on for liberty and he told charles gould how he and a few friends seeing those soldiers lay in ambush behind some rocks ready to pull the trigger on them when he recognized his compadre and jumped up from cover shouting his name because he knew that hernandez could not have been coming back on an errand of injustice and oppression those three soldiers together with the party who lay behind the rocks had formed the nucleus of the famous band and he the narrator had been the favourite lieutenant of hernandez for many many years he mentioned proudly that the officials had put a price upon his head too but it did not prevent it getting sprinkled with grey upon his shoulders and now he had lived long enough to see his compadre made a general  he had a burst of muffled laughter and now from robbers we have become soldiers but look caballero at those who made us soldiers and him a general look at these people  ignacio shouted the light of the carriage lamps running along the nopal hedges that crowned the bank on each side flashed upon the scared faces of people standing aside in the road sunk deep like an english country lane into the soft soil of the campo they cowered their eyes glistened very big for a second and then the light running on fell upon the halfdenuded roots of a big tree on another stretch of nopal hedge caught up another bunch of faces glaring back apprehensively three womenof whom one was carrying a childand a couple of men in civilian dressone armed with a sabre and another with a gunwere grouped about a donkey carrying two bundles tied up in blankets further on ignacio shouted again to pass a carreta a long wooden box on two high wheels with the door at the back swinging open some ladies in it must have recognized the white mules because they screamed out is it you dona emilia  at the turn of the road the glare of a big fire filled the short stretch vaulted over by the branches meeting overhead near the ford of a shallow stream a roadside rancho of woven rushes and a roof of grass had been set on fire by accident and the flames roaring viciously lit up an open space blocked with horses mules and a distracted shouting crowd of people when ignacio pulled up several ladies on foot assailed the carriage begging antonia for a seat to their clamour she answered by pointing silently to her father  i must leave you here said charles gould in the uproar the flames leaped up skyhigh and in the recoil from the scorching heat across the road the stream of fugitives pressed against the carriage a middleaged lady dressed in black silk but with a coarse manta over her head and a rough branch for a stick in her hand staggered against the front wheel two young girls frightened and silent were clinging to her arms charles gould knew her very well  misericordia we are getting terribly bruised in this crowd she exclaimed smiling up courageously to him we have started on foot all our servants ran away yesterday to join the democrats we are going to put ourselves under the protection of father corbelan of your sainted uncle antonia he has wrought a miracle in the heart of a most merciless robber a miracle  she raised her voice gradually up to a scream as she was borne along by the pressure of people getting out of the way of some carts coming up out of the ford at a gallop with loud yells and cracking of whips great masses of sparks mingled with black smoke flew over the road the bamboos of the walls detonated in the fire with the sound of an irregular fusillade and then the bright blaze sank suddenly leaving only a red dusk crowded with aimless dark shadows drifting in contrary directions the noise of voices seemed to die away with the flame and the tumult of heads arms quarrelling and imprecations passed on fleeing into the darkness  i must leave you now repeated charles gould to antonia she turned her head slowly and uncovered her face the emissary and compadre of hernandez spurred his horse close up  has not the master of the mine any message to send to hernandez the master of the campo  the truth of the comparison struck charles gould heavily in his determined purpose he held the mine and the indomitable bandit held the campo by the same precarious tenure they were equals before the lawlessness of the land it was impossible to disentangle ones activity from its debasing contacts a closemeshed net of crime and corruption lay upon the whole country an immense and weary discouragement sealed his lips for a time  you are a just man urged the emissary of hernandez look at those people who made my compadre a general and have turned us all into soldiers look at those oligarchs fleeing for life with only the clothes on their backs my compadre does not think of that but our followers may be wondering greatly and i would speak for them to you listen senor for many months now the campo has been our own we need ask no man for anything but soldiers must have their pay to live honestly when the wars are over it is believed that your soul is so just that a prayer from you would cure the sickness of every beast like the orison of the upright judge let me have some words from your lips that would act like a charm upon the doubts of our partida where all are men  do you hear what he says charles gould said in english to antonia  forgive us our misery she exclaimed hurriedly it is your character that is the inexhaustible treasure which may save us all yet your character carlos not your wealth i entreat you to give this man your word that you will accept any arrangement my uncle may make with their chief one word he will want no more  on the site of the roadside hut there remained nothing but an enormous heap of embers throwing afar a darkening red glow in which antonias face appeared deeply flushed with excitement charles gould with only a short hesitation pronounced the required pledge he was like a man who had ventured on a precipitous path with no room to turn where the only chance of safety is to press forward at that moment he understood it thoroughly as he looked down at don jose stretched out hardly breathing by the side of the erect antonia vanquished in a lifelong struggle with the powers of moral darkness whose stagnant depths breed monstrous crimes and monstrous illusions in a few words the emissary from hernandez expressed his complete satisfaction stoically antonia lowered her veil resisting the longing to inquire about decouds escape but ignacio leered morosely over his shoulder  take a good look at the mules mi amo he grumbled you shall never see them again    chapter four  charles gould turned towards the town before him the jagged peaks of the sierra came out all black in the clear dawn here and there a muffled lepero whisked round the corner of a grassgrown street before the ringing hoofs of his horse dogs barked behind the walls of the gardens and with the colourless light the chill of the snows seemed to fall from the mountains upon the disjointed pavements and the shuttered houses with broken cornices and the plaster peeling in patches between the flat pilasters of the fronts the daybreak struggled with the gloom under the arcades on the plaza with no signs of country people disposing their goods for the days market piles of fruit bundles of vegetables ornamented with flowers on low benches under enormous mat umbrellas with no cheery early morning bustle of villagers women children and loaded donkeys only a few scattered knots of revolutionists stood in the vast space all looking one way from under their slouched hats for some sign of news from rincon the largest of those groups turned about like one man as charles gould passed and shouted viva la libertad after him in a menacing tone  charles gould rode on and turned into the archway of his house in the patio littered with straw a practicante one of dr monyghams native assistants sat on the ground with his back against the rim of the fountain fingering a guitar discreetly while two girls of the lower class standing up before him shuffled their feet a little and waved their arms humming a popular dance tune  most of the wounded during the two days of rioting had been taken away already by their friends and relations but several figures could be seen sitting up balancing their bandaged heads in time to the music charles gould dismounted a sleepy mozo coming out of the bakery door took hold of the horses bridle the practicante endeavoured to conceal his guitar hastily the girls unabashed stepped back smiling and charles gould on his way to the staircase glanced into a dark corner of the patio at another group a mortally wounded cargador with a woman kneeling by his side she mumbled prayers rapidly trying at the same time to force a piece of orange between the stiffening lips of the dying man  the cruel futility of things stood unveiled in the levity and sufferings of that incorrigible people the cruel futility of lives and of deaths thrown away in the vain endeavour to attain an enduring solution of the problem unlike decoud charles gould could not play lightly a part in a tragic farce it was tragic enough for him in all conscience but he could see no farcical element he suffered too much under a conviction of irremediable folly he was too severely practical and too idealistic to look upon its terrible humours with amusement as martin decoud the imaginative materialist was able to do in the dry light of his scepticism to him as to all of us the compromises with his conscience appeared uglier than ever in the light of failure his taciturnity assumed with a purpose had prevented him from tampering openly with his thoughts but the gould concession had insidiously corrupted his judgment he might have known he said to himself leaning over the balustrade of the corredor that ribierism could never come to anything the mine had corrupted his judgment by making him sick of bribing and intriguing merely to have his work left alone from day to day like his father he did not like to be robbed it exasperated him he had persuaded himself that apart from higher considerations the backing up of don joses hopes of reform was good business he had gone forth into the senseless fray as his poor uncle whose sword hung on the wall of his study had gone forthin the defence of the commonest decencies of organized society only his weapon was the wealth of the mine more farreaching and subtle than an honest blade of steel fitted into a simple brass guard  more dangerous to the wielder too this weapon of wealth doubleedged with the cupidity and misery of mankind steeped in all the vices of selfindulgence as in a concoction of poisonous roots tainting the very cause for which it is drawn always ready to turn awkwardly in the hand there was nothing for it now but to go on using it but he promised himself to see it shattered into small bits before he let it be wrenched from his grasp  after all with his english parentage and english upbringing he perceived that he was an adventurer in costaguana the descendant of adventurers enlisted in a foreign legion of men who had sought fortune in a revolutionary war who had planned revolutions who had believed in revolutions for all the uprightness of his character he had something of an adventurers easy morality which takes count of personal risk in the ethical appraising of his action he was prepared if need be to blow up the whole san tome mountain sky high out of the territory of the republic this resolution expressed the tenacity of his character the remorse of that subtle conjugal infidelity through which his wife was no longer the sole mistress of his thoughts something of his fathers imaginative weakness and something too of the spirit of a buccaneer throwing a lighted match into the magazine rather than surrender his ship  down below in the patio the wounded cargador had breathed his last the woman cried out once and her cry unexpected and shrill made all the wounded sit up the practicante scrambled to his feet and guitar in hand gazed steadily in her direction with elevated eyebrows the two girlssitting now one on each side of their wounded relative with their knees drawn up and long cigars between their lipsnodded at each other significantly  charles gould looking down over the balustrade saw three men dressed ceremoniously in black frockcoats with white shirts and wearing european round hats enter the patio from the street one of them head and shoulders taller than the two others advanced with marked gravity leading the way this was don juste lopez accompanied by two of his friends members of assembly coming to call upon the administrador of the san tome mine at this early hour they saw him too waved their hands to him urgently walking up the stairs as if in procession  don juste astonishingly changed by having shaved off altogether his damaged beard had lost with it ninetenths of his outward dignity even at that time of serious preoccupation charles gould could not help noting the revealed ineptitude in the aspect of the man his companions looked crestfallen and sleepy one kept on passing the tip of his tongue over his parched lips the others eyes strayed dully over the tiled floor of the corredor while don juste standing a little in advance harangued the senor administrador of the san tome mine it was his firm opinion that forms had to be observed a new governor is always visited by deputations from the cabildo which is the municipal council from the consulado the commercial board and it was proper that the provincial assembly should send a deputation too if only to assert the existence of parliamentary institutions don juste proposed that don carlos gould as the most prominent citizen of the province should join the assemblys deputation his position was exceptional his personality known through the length and breadth of the whole republic official courtesies must not be neglected if they are gone through with a bleeding heart the acceptance of accomplished facts may save yet the precious vestiges of parliamentary institutions don justes eyes glowed dully he believed in parliamentary institutionsand the convinced drone of his voice lost itself in the stillness of the house like the deep buzzing of some ponderous insect  charles gould had turned round to listen patiently leaning his elbow on the balustrade he shook his head a little refusing almost touched by the anxious gaze of the president of the provincial assembly it was not charles goulds policy to make the san tome mine a party to any formal proceedings  my advice senores is that you should wait for your fate in your houses there is no necessity for you to give yourselves up formally into monteros hands submission to the inevitable as don juste calls it is all very well but when the inevitable is called pedrito montero there is no need to exhibit pointedly the whole extent of your surrender the fault of this country is the want of measure in political life flat acquiescence in illegality followed by sanguinary reactionthat senores is not the way to a stable and prosperous future  charles gould stopped before the sad bewilderment of the faces the wondering anxious glances of the eyes the feeling of pity for those men putting all their trust into words of some sort while murder and rapine stalked over the land had betrayed him into what seemed empty loquacity don juste murmured  you are abandoning us don carlos    and yet parliamentary institutions  he could not finish from grief for a moment he put his hand over his eyes charles gould in his fear of empty loquacity made no answer to the charge he returned in silence their ceremonious bows his taciturnity was his refuge he understood that what they sought was to get the influence of the san tome mine on their side they wanted to go on a conciliating errand to the victor under the wing of the gould concession other public bodiesthe cabildo the consuladowould be coming too presently seeking the support of the most stable the most effective force they had ever known to exist in their province  the doctor arriving with his sharp jerky walk found that the master had retired into his own room with orders not to be disturbed on any account but dr monygham was not anxious to see charles gould at once he spent some time in a rapid examination of his wounded he gazed down upon each in turn rubbing his chin between his thumb and forefinger his steady stare met without expression their silently inquisitive look all these cases were doing well but when he came to the dead cargador he stopped a little longer surveying not the man who had ceased to suffer but the woman kneeling in silent contemplation of the rigid face with its pinched nostrils and a white gleam in the imperfectly closed eyes she lifted her head slowly and said in a dull voice  it is not long since he had become a cargadoronly a few weeks his worship the capataz had accepted him after many entreaties  i am not responsible for the great capataz muttered the doctor moving off  directing his course upstairs towards the door of charles goulds room the doctor at the last moment hesitated then turning away from the handle with a shrug of his uneven shoulders slunk off hastily along the corredor in search of mrs goulds camerista  leonardo told him that the senora had not risen yet the senora had given into her charge the girls belonging to that italian posadero she leonarda had put them to bed in her own room the fair girl had cried herself to sleep but the dark onethe biggerhad not closed her eyes yet she sat up in bed clutching the sheets right up under her chin and staring before her like a little witch leonarda did not approve of the viola children being admitted to the house she made this feeling clear by the indifferent tone in which she inquired whether their mother was dead yet as to the senora she must be asleep ever since she had gone into her room after seeing the departure of dona antonia with her dying father there had been no sound behind her door  the doctor rousing himself out of profound reflection told her abruptly to call her mistress at once he hobbled off to wait for mrs gould in the sala he was very tired but too excited to sit down in this great drawingroom now empty in which his withered soul had been refreshed after many arid years and his outcast spirit had accepted silently the toleration of many sideglances he wandered haphazard amongst the chairs and tables till mrs gould enveloped in a morning wrapper came in rapidly  you know that i never approved of the silver being sent away the doctor began at once as a preliminary to the narrative of his nights adventures in association with captain mitchell the engineerinchief and old viola at sotillos headquarters to the doctor with his special conception of this political crisis the removal of the silver had seemed an irrational and illomened measure it was as if a general were sending the best part of his troops away on the eve of battle upon some recondite pretext the whole lot of ingots might have been concealed somewhere where they could have been got at for the purpose of staving off the dangers which were menacing the security of the gould concession the administrador had acted as if the immense and powerful prosperity of the mine had been founded on methods of probity on the sense of usefulness and it was nothing of the kind the method followed had been the only one possible the gould concession had ransomed its way through all those years it was a nauseous process he quite understood that charles gould had got sick of it and had left the old path to back up that hopeless attempt at reform the doctor did not believe in the reform of costaguana and now the mine was back again in its old path with the disadvantage that henceforth it had to deal not only with the greed provoked by its wealth but with the resentment awakened by the attempt to free itself from its bondage to moral corruption that was the penalty of failure what made him uneasy was that charles gould seemed to him to have weakened at the decisive moment when a frank return to the old methods was the only chance listening to decouds wild scheme had been a weakness  the doctor flung up his arms exclaiming decoud decoud he hobbled about the room with slight angry laughs many years ago both his ankles had been seriously damaged in the course of a certain investigation conducted in the castle of sta marta by a commission composed of military men their nomination had been signified to them unexpectedly at the dead of night with scowling brow flashing eyes and in a tempestuous voice by guzman bento the old tyrant maddened by one of his sudden accesses of suspicion mingled spluttering appeals to their fidelity with imprecations and horrible menaces the cells and casements of the castle on the hill had been already filled with prisoners the commission was charged now with the task of discovering the iniquitous conspiracy against the citizensaviour of his country  their dread of the raving tyrant translated itself into a hasty ferocity of procedure the citizensaviour was not accustomed to wait a conspiracy had to be discovered the courtyards of the castle resounded with the clanking of legirons sounds of blows yells of pain and the commission of high officers laboured feverishly concealing their distress and apprehensions from each other and especially from their secretary father beron an army chaplain at that time very much in the confidence of the citizensaviour that priest was a big roundshouldered man with an uncleanlooking overgrown tonsure on the top of his flat head of a dingy yellow complexion softly fat with greasy stains all down the front of his lieutenants uniform and a small cross embroidered in white cotton on his left breast he had a heavy nose and a pendant lip dr monygham remembered him still he remembered him against all the force of his will striving its utmost to forget father beron had been adjoined to the commission by guzman bento expressly for the purpose that his enlightened zeal should assist them in their labours dr monygham could by no manner of means forget the zeal of father beron or his face or the pitiless monotonous voice in which he pronounced the words will you confess now  this memory did not make him shudder but it had made of him what he was in the eyes of respectable people a man careless of common decencies something between a clever vagabond and a disreputable doctor but not all respectable people would have had the necessary delicacy of sentiment to understand with what trouble of mind and accuracy of vision dr monygham medical officer of the san tome mine remembered father beron army chaplain and once a secretary of a military commission after all these years dr monygham in his rooms at the end of the hospital building in the san tome gorge remembered father beron as distinctly as ever he remembered that priest at night sometimes in his sleep on such nights the doctor waited for daylight with a candle lighted and walking the whole length of his rooms to and fro staring down at his bare feet his arms hugging his sides tightly he would dream of father beron sitting at the end of a long black table behind which in a row appeared the heads shoulders and epaulettes of the military members nibbling the feather of a quill pen and listening with weary and impatient scorn to the protestations of some prisoner calling heaven to witness of his innocence till he burst out whats the use of wasting time over that miserable nonsense let me take him outside for a while and father beron would go outside after the clanking prisoner led away between two soldiers such interludes happened on many days many times with many prisoners when the prisoner returned he was ready to make a full confession father beron would declare leaning forward with that dull surfeited look which can be seen in the eyes of gluttonous persons after a heavy meal  the priests inquisitorial instincts suffered but little from the want of classical apparatus of the inquisition at no time of the worlds history have men been at a loss how to inflict mental and bodily anguish upon their fellowcreatures this aptitude came to them in the growing complexity of their passions and the early refinement of their ingenuity but it may safely be said that primeval man did not go to the trouble of inventing tortures he was indolent and pure of heart he brained his neighbour ferociously with a stone axe from necessity and without malice the stupidest mind may invent a rankling phrase or brand the innocent with a cruel aspersion a piece of string and a ramrod a few muskets in combination with a length of hide rope or even a simple mallet of heavy hard wood applied with a swing to human fingers or to the joints of a human body is enough for the infliction of the most exquisite torture the doctor had been a very stubborn prisoner and as a natural consequence of that bad disposition so father beron called it his subjugation had been very crushing and very complete that is why the limp in his walk the twist of his shoulders the scars on his cheeks were so pronounced his confessions when they came at last were very complete too sometimes on the nights when he walked the floor he wondered grinding his teeth with shame and rage at the fertility of his imagination when stimulated by a sort of pain which makes truth honour selfrespect and life itself matters of little moment  and he could not forget father beron with his monotonous phrase will you confess now reaching him in an awful iteration and lucidity of meaning through the delirious incoherence of unbearable pain he could not forget but that was not the worst had he met father beron in the street after all these years dr monygham was sure he would have quailed before him this contingency was not to be feared now father beron was dead but the sickening certitude prevented dr monygham from looking anybody in the face  dr monygham had become in a manner the slave of a ghost it was obviously impossible to take his knowledge of father beron home to europe when making his extorted confessions to the military board dr monygham was not seeking to avoid death he longed for it sitting halfnaked for hours on the wet earth of his prison and so motionless that the spiders his companions attached their webs to his matted hair he consoled the misery of his soul with acute reasonings that he had confessed to crimes enough for a sentence of deaththat they had gone too far with him to let him live to tell the tale  but as if by a refinement of cruelty dr monygham was left for months to decay slowly in the darkness of his gravelike prison it was no doubt hoped that it would finish him off without the trouble of an execution but dr monygham had an iron constitution it was guzman bento who died not by the knife thrust of a conspirator but from a stroke of apoplexy and dr monygham was liberated hastily his fetters were struck off by the light of a candle which after months of gloom hurt his eyes so much that he had to cover his face with his hands he was raised up his heart was beating violently with the fear of this liberty when he tried to walk the extraordinary lightness of his feet made him giddy and he fell down two sticks were thrust into his hands and he was pushed out of the passage it was dusk candles glimmered already in the windows of the officers quarters round the courtyard but the twilight sky dazed him by its enormous and overwhelming brilliance a thin poncho hung over his naked bony shoulders the rags of his trousers came down no lower than his knees an eighteen months growth of hair fell in dirty grey locks on each side of his sharp cheekbones as he dragged himself past the guardroom door one of the soldiers lolling outside moved by some obscure impulse leaped forward with a strange laugh and rammed a broken old straw hat on his head and dr monygham after having tottered continued on his way he advanced one stick then one maimed foot then the other stick the other foot followed only a very short distance along the ground toilfully as though it were almost too heavy to be moved at all and yet his legs under the hanging angles of the poncho appeared no thicker than the two sticks in his hands a ceaseless trembling agitated his bent body all his wasted limbs his bony head the conical ragged crown of the sombrero whose ample flat rim rested on his shoulders  in such conditions of manner and attire did dr monygham go forth to take possession of his liberty and these conditions seemed to bind him indissolubly to the land of costaguana like an awful procedure of naturalization involving him deep in the national life far deeper than any amount of success and honour could have done they did away with his europeanism for dr monygham had made himself an ideal conception of his disgrace it was a conception eminently fit and proper for an officer and a gentleman dr monygham before he went out to costaguana had been surgeon in one of her majestys regiments of foot it was a conception which took no account of physiological facts or reasonable arguments but it was not stupid for all that it was simple a rule of conduct resting mainly on severe rejections is necessarily simple dr monyghams view of what it behoved him to do was severe it was an ideal view in so much that it was the imaginative exaggeration of a correct feeling it was also in its force influence and persistency the view of an eminently loyal nature  there was a great fund of loyalty in dr monyghams nature he had settled it all on mrs goulds head he believed her worthy of every devotion at the bottom of his heart he felt an angry uneasiness before the prosperity of the san tome mine because its growth was robbing her of all peace of mind costaguana was no place for a woman of that kind what could charles gould have been thinking of when he brought her out there it was outrageous and the doctor had watched the course of events with a grim and distant reserve which he imagined his lamentable history imposed upon him  loyalty to mrs gould could not however leave out of account the safety of her husband the doctor had contrived to be in town at the critical time because he mistrusted charles gould he considered him hopelessly infected with the madness of revolutions that is why he hobbled in distress in the drawingroom of the casa gould on that morning exclaiming decoud decoud in a tone of mournful irritation  mrs gould her colour heightened and with glistening eyes looked straight before her at the sudden enormity of that disaster the fingertips on one hand rested lightly on a low little table by her side and the arm trembled right up to the shoulder the sun which looks late upon sulaco issuing in all the fulness of its power high up on the sky from behind the dazzling snowedge of higuerota had precipitated the delicate smooth pearly greyness of light in which the town lies steeped during the early hours into sharpcut masses of black shade and spaces of hot blinding glare three long rectangles of sunshine fell through the windows of the sala while just across the street the front of the avellanoss house appeared very sombre in its own shadow seen through the flood of light  a voice said at the door what of decoud  it was charles gould they had not heard him coming along the corredor his glance just glided over his wife and struck full at the doctor  you have brought some news doctor  dr monygham blurted it all out at once in the rough for some time after he had done the administrador of the san tome mine remained looking at him without a word mrs gould sank into a low chair with her hands lying on her lap a silence reigned between those three motionless persons then charles gould spoke  you must want some breakfast  he stood aside to let his wife pass first she caught up her husbands hand and pressed it as she went out raising her handkerchief to her eyes the sight of her husband had brought antonias position to her mind and she could not contain her tears at the thought of the poor girl when she rejoined the two men in the diningroom after having bathed her face charles gould was saying to the doctor across the table  no there does not seem any room for doubt  and the doctor assented  no i dont see myself how we could question that wretched hirschs tale its only too true i fear  she sat down desolately at the head of the table and looked from one to the other the two men without absolutely turning their heads away tried to avoid her glance the doctor even made a show of being hungry he seized his knife and fork and began to eat with emphasis as if on the stage charles gould made no pretence of the sort with his elbows raised squarely he twisted both ends of his flaming moustachesthey were so long that his hands were quite away from his face  i am not surprised he muttered abandoning his moustaches and throwing one arm over the back of his chair his face was calm with that immobility of expression which betrays the intensity of a mental struggle he felt that this accident had brought to a point all the consequences involved in his line of conduct with its conscious and subconscious intentions there must be an end now of this silent reserve of that air of impenetrability behind which he had been safeguarding his dignity it was the least ignoble form of dissembling forced upon him by that parody of civilized institutions which offended his intelligence his uprightness and his sense of right he was like his father he had no ironic eye he was not amused at the absurdities that prevail in this world they hurt him in his innate gravity he felt that the miserable death of that poor decoud took from him his inaccessible position of a force in the background it committed him openly unless he wished to throw up the gameand that was impossible the material interests required from him the sacrifice of his aloofnessperhaps his own safety too and he reflected that decouds separationist plan had not gone to the bottom with the lost silver  the only thing that was not changed was his position towards mr holroyd the head of silver and steel interests had entered into costaguana affairs with a sort of passion costaguana had become necessary to his existence in the san tome mine he had found the imaginative satisfaction which other minds would get from drama from art or from a risky and fascinating sport it was a special form of the great mans extravagance sanctioned by a moral intention big enough to flatter his vanity even in this aberration of his genius he served the progress of the world charles gould felt sure of being understood with precision and judged with the indulgence of their common passion nothing now could surprise or startle this great man and charles gould imagined himself writing a letter to san francisco in some such words     the men at the head of the movement are dead or have fled the civil organization of the province is at an end for the present the blanco party in sulaco has collapsed inexcusably but in the characteristic manner of this country but barrios untouched in cayta remains still available i am forced to take up openly the plan of a provincial revolution as the only way of placing the enormous material interests involved in the prosperity and peace of sulaco in a position of permanent safety    that was clear he saw these words as if written in letters of fire upon the wall at which he was gazing abstractedly  mrs gould watched his abstraction with dread it was a domestic and frightful phenomenon that darkened and chilled the house for her like a thundercloud passing over the sun charles goulds fits of abstraction depicted the energetic concentration of a will haunted by a fixed idea a man haunted by a fixed idea is insane he is dangerous even if that idea is an idea of justice for may he not bring the heaven down pitilessly upon a loved head the eyes of mrs gould watching her husbands profile filled with tears again and again she seemed to see the despair of the unfortunate antonia  what would i have done if charley had been drowned while we were engaged she exclaimed mentally with horror her heart turned to ice while her cheeks flamed up as if scorched by the blaze of a funeral pyre consuming all her earthly affections the tears burst out of her eyes  antonia will kill herself she cried out  this cry fell into the silence of the room with strangely little effect only the doctor crumbling up a piece of bread with his head inclined on one side raised his face and the few long hairs sticking out of his shaggy eyebrows stirred in a slight frown dr monygham thought quite sincerely that decoud was a singularly unworthy object for any womans affection then he lowered his head again with a curl of his lip and his heart full of tender admiration for mrs gould  she thinks of that girl he said to himself she thinks of the viola children she thinks of me of the wounded of the miners she always thinks of everybody who is poor and miserable but what will she do if charles gets the worst of it in this infernal scrimmage those confounded avellanos have drawn him into no one seems to be thinking of her  charles gould staring at the wall pursued his reflections subtly  i shall write to holroyd that the san tome mine is big enough to take in hand the making of a new state itll please him itll reconcile him to the risk  but was barrios really available perhaps but he was inaccessible to send off a boat to cayta was no longer possible since sotillo was master of the harbour and had a steamer at his disposal and now with all the democrats in the province up and every campo township in a state of disturbance where could he find a man who would make his way successfully overland to cayta with a message a ten days ride at least a man of courage and resolution who would avoid arrest or murder and if arrested would faithfully eat the paper the capataz de cargadores would have been just such a man but the capataz of the cargadores was no more  and charles gould withdrawing his eyes from the wall said gently that hirsch what an extraordinary thing saved himself by clinging to the anchor did he i had no idea that he was still in sulaco i thought he had gone back overland to esmeralda more than a week ago he came here once to talk to me about his hide business and some other things i made it clear to him that nothing could be done  he was afraid to start back on account of hernandez being about remarked the doctor  and but for him we might not have known anything of what has happened marvelled charles gould  mrs gould cried out  antonia must not know she must not be told not now  nobodys likely to carry the news remarked the doctor its no ones interest moreover the people here are afraid of hernandez as if he were the devil he turned to charles gould its even awkward because if you wanted to communicate with the refugees you could find no messenger when hernandez was ranging hundreds of miles away from here the sulaco populace used to shudder at the tales of him roasting his prisoners alive  yes murmured charles gould captain mitchells capataz was the only man in the town who had seen hernandez eye to eye father corbelan employed him he opened the communications first it is a pity that  his voice was covered by the booming of the great bell of the cathedral three single strokes one after another burst out explosively dying away in deep and mellow vibrations and then all the bells in the tower of every church convent or chapel in town even those that had remained shut up for years pealed out together with a crash in this furious flood of metallic uproar there was a power of suggesting images of strife and violence which blanched mrs goulds cheek basilio who had been waiting at table shrinking within himself clung to the sideboard with chattering teeth it was impossible to hear yourself speak  shut these windows charles gould yelled at him angrily all the other servants terrified at what they took for the signal of a general massacre had rushed upstairs tumbling over each other men and women the obscure and generally invisible population of the ground floor on the four sides of the patio the women screaming misericordia ran right into the room and falling on their knees against the walls began to cross themselves convulsively the staring heads of men blocked the doorway in an instantmozos from the stable gardeners nondescript helpers living on the crumbs of the munificent houseand charles gould beheld all the extent of his domestic establishment even to the gatekeeper this was a halfparalyzed old man whose long white locks fell down to his shoulders an heirloom taken up by charles goulds familial piety he could remember henry gould an englishman and a costaguanero of the second generation chief of the sulaco province he had been his personal mozo years and years ago in peace and war had been allowed to attend his master in prison had on the fatal morning followed the firing squad and peeping from behind one of the cypresses growing along the wall of the franciscan convent had seen with his eyes starting out of his head don enrique throw up his hands and fall with his face in the dust charles gould noted particularly the big patriarchal head of that witness in the rear of the other servants but he was surprised to see a shrivelled old hag or two of whose existence within the walls of his house he had not been aware they must have been the mothers or even the grandmothers of some of his people there were a few children too more or less naked crying and clinging to the legs of their elders he had never before noticed any sign of a child in his patio even leonarda the camerista came in a fright pushing through with her spoiled pouting face of a favourite maid leading the viola girls by the hand the crockery rattled on table and sideboard and the whole house seemed to sway in the deafening wave of sound    chapter five  during the night the expectant populace had taken possession of all the belfries in the town in order to welcome pedrito montero who was making his entry after having slept the night in rincon and first came straggling in through the land gate the armed mob of all colours complexions types and states of raggedness calling themselves the sulaco national guard and commanded by senor gamacho through the middle of the street streamed like a torrent of rubbish a mass of straw hats ponchos gunbarrels with an enormous green and yellow flag flapping in their midst in a cloud of dust to the furious beating of drums the spectators recoiled against the walls of the houses shouting their vivas behind the rabble could be seen the lances of the cavalry the army of pedro montero he advanced between senores fuentes and gamacho at the head of his llaneros who had accomplished the feat of crossing the paramos of the higuerota in a snowstorm they rode four abreast mounted on confiscated campo horses clad in the heterogeneous stock of roadside stores they had looted hurriedly in their rapid ride through the northern part of the province for pedro montero had been in a great hurry to occupy sulaco the handkerchiefs knotted loosely around their bare throats were glaringly new and all the right sleeves of their cotton shirts had been cut off close to the shoulder for greater freedom in throwing the lazo emaciated greybeards rode by the side of lean dark youths marked by all the hardships of campaigning with strips of raw beef twined round the crowns of their hats and huge iron spurs fastened to their naked heels those that in the passes of the mountain had lost their lances had provided themselves with the goads used by the campo cattlemen slender shafts of palm fully ten feet long with a lot of loose rings jingling under the ironshod point they were armed with knives and revolvers a haggard fearlessness characterized the expression of all these sunblacked countenances they glared down haughtily with their scorched eyes at the crowd or blinking upwards insolently pointed out to each other some particular head amongst the women at the windows when they had ridden into the plaza and caught sight of the equestrian statue of the king dazzlingly white in the sunshine towering enormous and motionless above the surges of the crowd with its eternal gesture of saluting a murmur of surprise ran through their ranks what is that saint in the big hat they asked each other  they were a good sample of the cavalry of the plains with which pedro montero had helped so much the victorious career of his brother the general the influence which that man brought up in coast towns acquired in a short time over the plainsmen of the republic can be ascribed only to a genius for treachery of so effective a kind that it must have appeared to those violent men but little removed from a state of utter savagery as the perfection of sagacity and virtue the popular lore of all nations testifies that duplicity and cunning together with bodily strength were looked upon even more than courage as heroic virtues by primitive mankind to overcome your adversary was the great affair of life courage was taken for granted but the use of intelligence awakened wonder and respect stratagems providing they did not fail were honourable the easy massacre of an unsuspecting enemy evoked no feelings but those of gladness pride and admiration not perhaps that primitive men were more faithless than their descendants of today but that they went straighter to their aim and were more artless in their recognition of success as the only standard of morality  we have changed since the use of intelligence awakens little wonder and less respect but the ignorant and barbarous plainsmen engaging in civil strife followed willingly a leader who often managed to deliver their enemies bound as it were into their hands pedro montero had a talent for lulling his adversaries into a sense of security and as men learn wisdom with extreme slowness and are always ready to believe promises that flatter their secret hopes pedro montero was successful time after time whether only a servant or some inferior official in the costaguana legation in paris he had rushed back to his country directly he heard that his brother had emerged from the obscurity of his frontier commandancia he had managed to deceive by his gift of plausibility the chiefs of the ribierist movement in the capital and even the acute agent of the san tome mine had failed to understand him thoroughly at once he had obtained an enormous influence over his brother they were very much alike in appearance both bald with bunches of crisp hair above their ears arguing the presence of some negro blood only pedro was smaller than the general more delicate altogether with an apelike faculty for imitating all the outward signs of refinement and distinction and with a parrotlike talent for languages both brothers had received some elementary instruction by the munificence of a great european traveller to whom their father had been a bodyservant during his journeys in the interior of the country in general monteros case it enabled him to rise from the ranks pedrito the younger incorrigibly lazy and slovenly had drifted aimlessly from one coast town to another hanging about countinghouses attaching himself to strangers as a sort of valetdeplace picking up an easy and disreputable living his ability to read did nothing for him but fill his head with absurd visions his actions were usually determined by motives so improbable in themselves as to escape the penetration of a rational person  thus at first sight the agent of the gould concession in sta marta had credited him with the possession of sane views and even with a restraining power over the generals everlastingly discontented vanity it could never have entered his head that pedrito montero lackey or inferior scribe lodged in the garrets of the various parisian hotels where the costaguana legation used to shelter its diplomatic dignity had been devouring the lighter sort of historical works in the french language such for instance as the books of imbert de saint amand upon the second empire but pedrito had been struck by the splendour of a brilliant court and had conceived the idea of an existence for himself where like the duc de morny he would associate the command of every pleasure with the conduct of political affairs and enjoy power supremely in every way nobody could have guessed that and yet this was one of the immediate causes of the monterist revolution this will appear less incredible by the reflection that the fundamental causes were the same as ever rooted in the political immaturity of the people in the indolence of the upper classes and the mental darkness of the lower  pedrito montero saw in the elevation of his brother the road wide open to his wildest imaginings this was what made the monterist pronunciamiento so unpreventable the general himself probably could have been bought off pacified with flatteries despatched on a diplomatic mission to europe it was his brother who had egged him on from first to last he wanted to become the most brilliant statesman of south america he did not desire supreme power he would have been afraid of its labour and risk in fact before all pedrito montero taught by his european experience meant to acquire a serious fortune for himself with this object in view he obtained from his brother on the very morrow of the successful battle the permission to push on over the mountains and take possession of sulaco sulaco was the land of future prosperity the chosen land of material progress the only province in the republic of interest to european capitalists pedrito montero following the example of the duc de morny meant to have his share of this prosperity this is what he meant literally now his brother was master of the country whether as president dictator or even as emperorwhy not as an emperorhe meant to demand a share in every enterprisein railways in mines in sugar estates in cotton mills in land companies in each and every undertakingas the price of his protection the desire to be on the spot early was the real cause of the celebrated ride over the mountains with some two hundred llaneros an enterprise of which the dangers had not appeared at first clearly to his impatience coming from a series of victories it seemed to him that a montero had only to appear to be master of the situation this illusion had betrayed him into a rashness of which he was becoming aware as he rode at the head of his llaneros he regretted that there were so few of them the enthusiasm of the populace reassured him they yelled viva montero viva pedrito in order to make them still more enthusiastic and from the natural pleasure he had in dissembling he dropped the reins on his horses neck and with a tremendous effect of familiarity and confidence slipped his hands under the arms of senores fuentes and gamacho in that posture with a ragged town mozo holding his horse by the bridle he rode triumphantly across the plaza to the door of the intendencia its old gloomy walls seemed to shake in the acclamations that rent the air and covered the crashing peals of the cathedral bells  pedro montero the brother of the general dismounted into a shouting and perspiring throng of enthusiasts whom the ragged nationals were pushing back fiercely ascending a few steps he surveyed the large crowd gaping at him and the bulletspeckled walls of the houses opposite lightly veiled by a sunny haze of dust the word pourvenir in immense black capitals alternating with broken windows stared at him across the vast space and he thought with delight of the hour of vengeance because he was very sure of laying his hands upon decoud on his left hand gamacho big and hot wiping his hairy wet face uncovered a set of yellow fangs in a grin of stupid hilarity on his right senor fuentes small and lean looked on with compressed lips the crowd stared literally openmouthed lost in eager stillness as though they had expected the great guerrillero the famous pedrito to begin scattering at once some sort of visible largesse what he began was a speech he began it with the shouted word citizens which reached even those in the middle of the plaza afterwards the greater part of the citizens remained fascinated by the orators action alone his tiptoeing the arms flung above his head with the fists clenched a hand laid flat upon the heart the silver gleam of rolling eyes the sweeping pointing embracing gestures a hand laid familiarly on gamachos shoulder a hand waved formally towards the little blackcoated person of senor fuentes advocate and politician and a true friend of the people the vivas of those nearest to the orator bursting out suddenly propagated themselves irregularly to the confines of the crowd like flames running over dry grass and expired in the opening of the streets in the intervals over the swarming plaza brooded a heavy silence in which the mouth of the orator went on opening and shutting and detached phrasesthe happiness of the people sons of the country the entire world el mundo entieroreached even the packed steps of the cathedral with a feeble clear ring thin as the buzzing of a mosquito but the orator struck his breast he seemed to prance between his two supporters it was the supreme effort of his peroration then the two smaller figures disappeared from the public gaze and the enormous gamacho left alone advanced raising his hat high above his head then he covered himself proudly and yelled out ciudadanos a dull roar greeted senor gamacho expedlar of the campo commandante of the national guards  upstairs pedrito montero walked about rapidly from one wrecked room of the intendencia to another snarling incessantly  what stupidity what destruction  senor fuentes following would relax his taciturn disposition to murmur  it is all the work of gamacho and his nationals and then inclining his head on his left shoulder would press together his lips so firmly that a little hollow would appear at each corner he had his nomination for political chief of the town in his pocket and was all impatience to enter upon his functions  in the long audience room with its tall mirrors all starred by stones the hangings torn down and the canopy over the platform at the upper end pulled to pieces the vast deep muttering of the crowd and the howling voice of gamacho speaking just below reached them through the shutters as they stood idly in dimness and desolation  the brute observed his excellency don pedro montero through clenched teeth we must contrive as quickly as possible to send him and his nationals out there to fight hernandez  the new gefe politico only jerked his head sideways and took a puff at his cigarette in sign of his agreement with this method for ridding the town of gamacho and his inconvenient rabble  pedrito montero looked with disgust at the absolutely bare floor and at the belt of heavy gilt pictureframes running round the room out of which the remnants of torn and slashed canvases fluttered like dingy rags  we are not barbarians he said  this was what said his excellency the popular pedrito the guerrillero skilled in the art of laying ambushes charged by his brother at his own demand with the organization of sulaco on democratic principles the night before during the consultation with his partisans who had come out to meet him in rincon he had opened his intentions to senor fuentes  we shall organize a popular vote by yes or no confiding the destinies of our beloved country to the wisdom and valiance of my heroic brother the invincible general a plebiscite do you understand  and senor fuentes puffing out his leathery cheeks had inclined his head slightly to the left letting a thin bluish jet of smoke escape through his pursed lips he had understood  his excellency was exasperated at the devastation not a single chair table sofa etagere or console had been left in the state rooms of the intendencia his excellency though twitching all over with rage was restrained from bursting into violence by a sense of his remoteness and isolation his heroic brother was very far away meantime how was he going to take his siesta he had expected to find comfort and luxury in the intendencia after a year of hard camp life ending with the hardships and privations of the daring dash upon sulacoupon the province which was worth more in wealth and influence than all the rest of the republics territory he would get even with gamacho byandby and senor gamachos oration delectable to popular ears went on in the heat and glare of the plaza like the uncouth howlings of an inferior sort of devil cast into a whitehot furnace every moment he had to wipe his streaming face with his bare forearm he had flung off his coat and had turned up the sleeves of his shirt high above the elbows but he kept on his head the large cocked hat with white plumes his ingenuousness cherished this sign of his rank as commandante of the national guards approving and grave murmurs greeted his periods his opinion was that war should be declared at once against france england germany and the united states who by introducing railways mining enterprises colonization and under such other shallow pretences aimed at robbing poor people of their lands and with the help of these goths and paralytics the aristocrats would convert them into toiling and miserable slaves and the leperos flinging about the corners of their dirty white mantas yelled their approbation general montero gamacho howled with conviction was the only man equal to the patriotic task they assented to that too  the morning was wearing on there were already signs of disruption currents and eddies in the crowd some were seeking the shade of the walls and under the trees of the alameda horsemen spurred through shouting groups of sombreros set level on heads against the vertical sun were drifting away into the streets where the open doors of pulperias revealed an enticing gloom resounding with the gentle tinkling of guitars the national guards were thinking of siesta and the eloquence of gamacho their chief was exhausted later on when in the cooler hours of the afternoon they tried to assemble again for further consideration of public affairs detachments of monteros cavalry camped on the alameda charged them without parley at speed with long lances levelled at their flying backs as far as the ends of the streets the national guards of sulaco were surprised by this proceeding but they were not indignant no costaguanero had ever learned to question the eccentricities of a military force they were part of the natural order of things this must be they concluded some kind of administrative measure no doubt but the motive of it escaped their unaided intelligence and their chief and orator gamacho commandante of the national guard was lying drunk and asleep in the bosom of his family his bare feet were upturned in the shadows repulsively in the manner of a corpse his eloquent mouth had dropped open his youngest daughter scratching her head with one hand with the other waved a green bough over his scorched and peeling face    chapter six  the declining sun had shifted the shadows from west to east amongst the houses of the town it had shifted them upon the whole extent of the immense campo with the white walls of its haciendas on the knolls dominating the green distances with its grassthatched ranches crouching in the folds of ground by the banks of streams with the dark islands of clustered trees on a clear sea of grass and the precipitous range of the cordillera immense and motionless emerging from the billows of the lower forests like the barren coast of a land of giants the sunset rays striking the snowslope of higuerota from afar gave it an air of rosy youth while the serrated mass of distant peaks remained black as if calcined in the fiery radiance the undulating surface of the forests seemed powdered with pale gold dust and away there beyond rincon hidden from the town by two wooded spurs the rocks of the san tome gorge with the flat wall of the mountain itself crowned by gigantic ferns took on warm tones of brown and yellow with red rusty streaks and the dark green clumps of bushes rooted in crevices from the plain the stamp sheds and the houses of the mine appeared dark and small high up like the nests of birds clustered on the ledges of a cliff the zigzag paths resembled faint tracings scratched on the wall of a cyclopean blockhouse to the two serenos of the mine on patrol duty strolling carbine in hand and watchful eyes in the shade of the trees lining the stream near the bridge don pepe descending the path from the upper plateau appeared no bigger than a large beetle  with his air of aimless insectlike going to and fro upon the face of the rock don pepes figure kept on descending steadily and when near the bottom sank at last behind the roofs of storehouses forges and workshops for a time the pair of serenos strolled back and forth before the bridge on which they had stopped a horseman holding a large white envelope in his hand then don pepe emerging in the village street from amongst the houses not a stones throw from the frontier bridge approached striding in wide dark trousers tucked into boots a white linen jacket sabre at his side and revolver at his belt in this disturbed time nothing could find the senor gobernador with his boots off as the saying is  at a slight nod from one of the serenos the man a messenger from the town dismounted and crossed the bridge leading his horse by the bridle  don pepe received the letter from his other hand slapped his left side and his hips in succession feeling for his spectacle case after settling the heavy silvermounted affair astride his nose and adjusting it carefully behind his ears he opened the envelope holding it up at about a foot in front of his eyes the paper he pulled out contained some three lines of writing he looked at them for a long time his grey moustache moved slightly up and down and the wrinkles radiating at the corners of his eyes ran together he nodded serenely bueno he said there is no answer  then in his quiet kindly way he engaged in a cautious conversation with the man who was willing to talk cheerily as if something lucky had happened to him recently he had seen from a distance sotillos infantry camped along the shore of the harbour on each side of the custom house they had done no damage to the buildings the foreigners of the railway remained shut up within the yards they were no longer anxious to shoot poor people he cursed the foreigners then he reported monteros entry and the rumours of the town the poor were going to be made rich now that was very good more he did not know and breaking into propitiatory smiles he intimated that he was hungry and thirsty the old major directed him to go to the alcalde of the first village the man rode off and don pepe striding slowly in the direction of a little wooden belfry looked over a hedge into a little garden and saw father roman sitting in a white hammock slung between two orange trees in front of the presbytery  an enormous tamarind shaded with its dark foliage the whole white framehouse a young indian girl with long hair big eyes and small hands and feet carried out a wooden chair while a thin old woman crabbed and vigilant watched her all the time from the verandah  don pepe sat down in the chair and lighted a cigar the priest drew in an immense quantity of snuff out of the hollow of his palm on his reddishbrown face worn hollowed as if crumbled the eyes fresh and candid sparkled like two black diamonds  don pepe in a mild and humorous voice informed father roman that pedrito montero by the hand of senor fuentes had asked him on what terms he would surrender the mine in proper working order to a legally constituted commission of patriotic citizens escorted by a small military force the priest cast his eyes up to heaven however don pepe continued the mozo who brought the letter said that don carlos gould was alive and so far unmolested  father roman expressed in a few words his thankfulness at hearing of the senor administradors safety  the hour of oration had gone by in the silvery ringing of a bell in the little belfry the belt of forest closing the entrance of the valley stood like a screen between the low sun and the street of the village at the other end of the rocky gorge between the walls of basalt and granite a forestclad mountain hiding all the range from the san tome dwellers rose steeply lighted up and leafy to the very top three small rosy clouds hung motionless overhead in the great depth of blue knots of people sat in the street between the wattled huts before the casa of the alcalde the foremen of the nightshift already assembled to lead their men squatted on the ground in a circle of leather skullcaps and bowing their bronze backs were passing round the gourd of mate the mozo from the town having fastened his horse to a wooden post before the door was telling them the news of sulaco as the blackened gourd of the decoction passed from hand to hand the grave alcalde himself in a white waistcloth and a flowered chintz gown with sleeves open wide upon his naked stout person with an effect of a gaudy bathing robe stood by wearing a rough beaver hat at the back of his head and grasping a tall staff with a silver knob in his hand these insignia of his dignity had been conferred upon him by the administration of the mine the fountain of honour of prosperity and peace he had been one of the first immigrants into this valley his sons and sonsinlaw worked within the mountain which seemed with its treasures to pour down the thundering ore shoots of the upper mesa the gifts of wellbeing security and justice upon the toilers he listened to the news from the town with curiosity and indifference as if concerning another world than his own and it was true that they appeared to him so in a very few years the sense of belonging to a powerful organization had been developed in these harassed halfwild indians they were proud of and attached to the mine it had secured their confidence and belief they invested it with a protecting and invincible virtue as though it were a fetish made by their own hands for they were ignorant and in other respects did not differ appreciably from the rest of mankind which puts infinite trust in its own creations it never entered the alcaldes head that the mine could fail in its protection and force politics were good enough for the people of the town and the campo his yellow round face with wide nostrils and motionless in expression resembled a fierce full moon he listened to the excited vapourings of the mozo without misgivings without surprise without any active sentiment whatever  padre roman sat dejectedly balancing himself his feet just touching the ground his hands gripping the edge of the hammock with less confidence but as ignorant as his flock he asked the major what did he think was going to happen now  don pepe bolt upright in the chair folded his hands peacefully on the hilt of his sword standing perpendicular between his thighs and answered that he did not know the mine could be defended against any force likely to be sent to take possession on the other hand from the arid character of the valley when the regular supplies from the campo had been cut off the population of the three villages could be starved into submission don pepe exposed these contingencies with serenity to father roman who as an old campaigner was able to understand the reasoning of a military man they talked with simplicity and directness father roman was saddened at the idea of his flock being scattered or else enslaved he had no illusions as to their fate not from penetration but from long experience of political atrocities which seemed to him fatal and unavoidable in the life of a state the working of the usual public institutions presented itself to him most distinctly as a series of calamities overtaking private individuals and flowing logically from each other through hate revenge folly and rapacity as though they had been part of a divine dispensation father romans clearsightedness was served by an uninformed intelligence but his heart preserving its tenderness amongst scenes of carnage spoliation and violence abhorred these calamities the more as his association with the victims was closer he entertained towards the indians of the valley feelings of paternal scorn he had been marrying baptizing confessing absolving and burying the workers of the san tome mine with dignity and unction for five years or more and he believed in the sacredness of these ministrations which made them his own in a spiritual sense they were dear to his sacerdotal supremacy mrs goulds earnest interest in the concerns of these people enhanced their importance in the priests eyes because it really augmented his own when talking over with her the innumerable marias and brigidas of the villages he felt his own humanity expand padre roman was incapable of fanaticism to an almost reprehensible degree the english senora was evidently a heretic but at the same time she seemed to him wonderful and angelic whenever that confused state of his feelings occurred to him while strolling for instance his breviary under his arm in the wide shade of the tamarind he would stop short to inhale with a strong snuffling noise a large quantity of snuff and shake his head profoundly at the thought of what might befall the illustrious senora presently he became gradually overcome with dismay he voiced it in an agitated murmur even don pepe lost his serenity for a moment he leaned forward stiffly  listen padre the very fact that those thieving macaques in sulaco are trying to find out the price of my honour proves that senor don carlos and all in the casa gould are safe as to my honour that also is safe as every man woman and child knows but the negro liberals who have snatched the town by surprise do not know that bueno let them sit and wait while they wait they can do no harm  and he regained his composure he regained it easily because whatever happened his honour of an old officer of paez was safe he had promised charles gould that at the approach of an armed force he would defend the gorge just long enough to give himself time to destroy scientifically the whole plant buildings and workshops of the mine with heavy charges of dynamite block with ruins the main tunnel break down the pathways blow up the dam of the waterpower shatter the famous gould concession into fragments flying sky high out of a horrified world the mine had got hold of charles gould with a grip as deadly as ever it had laid upon his father but this extreme resolution had seemed to don pepe the most natural thing in the world his measures had been taken with judgment everything was prepared with a careful completeness and don pepe folded his hands pacifically on his sword hilt and nodded at the priest in his excitement father roman had flung snuff in handfuls at his face and all besmeared with tobacco roundeyed and beside himself had got out of the hammock to walk about uttering exclamations  don pepe stroked his grey and pendant moustache whose fine ends hung far below the cleancut line of his jaw and spoke with a conscious pride in his reputation  so padre i dont know what will happen but i know that as long as i am here don carlos can speak to that macaque pedrito montero and threaten the destruction of the mine with perfect assurance that he will be taken seriously for people know me  he began to turn the cigar in his lips a little nervously and went on  but that is talkgood for the politicos i am a military man i do not know what may happen but i know what ought to be donethe mine should march upon the town with guns axes knives tied up to stickspor dios that is what should be done only  his folded hands twitched on the hilt the cigar turned faster in the corner of his lips  and who should lead but i unfortunatelyobservei have given my word of honour to don carlos not to let the mine fall into the hands of these thieves in waryou know this padrethe fate of battles is uncertain and whom could i leave here to act for me in case of defeat the explosives are ready but it would require a man of high honour of intelligence of judgment of courage to carry out the prepared destruction somebody i can trust with my honour as i can trust myself another old officer of paez for instance ororperhaps one of paezs old chaplains would do  he got up long lank upright hard with his martial moustache and the bony structure of his face from which the glance of the sunken eyes seemed to transfix the priest who stood still an empty wooden snuffbox held upside down in his hand and glared back speechless at the governor of the mine    chapter seven  at about that time in the intendencia of sulaco charles gould was assuring pedrito montero who had sent a request for his presence there that he would never let the mine pass out of his hands for the profit of a government who had robbed him of it the gould concession could not be resumed his father had not desired it the son would never surrender it he would never surrender it alive and once dead where was the power capable of resuscitating such an enterprise in all its vigour and wealth out of the ashes and ruin of destruction there was no such power in the country and where was the skill and capital abroad that would condescend to touch such an illomened corpse charles gould talked in the impassive tone which had for many years served to conceal his anger and contempt he suffered he was disgusted with what he had to say it was too much like heroics in him the strictly practical instinct was in profound discord with the almost mystic view he took of his right the gould concession was symbolic of abstract justice let the heavens fall but since the san tome mine had developed into worldwide fame his threat had enough force and effectiveness to reach the rudimentary intelligence of pedro montero wrapped up as it was in the futilities of historical anecdotes the gould concession was a serious asset in the countrys finance and what was more in the private budgets of many officials as well it was traditional it was known it was said it was credible every minister of interior drew a salary from the san tome mine it was natural and pedrito intended to be minister of the interior and president of the council in his brothers government the duc de morny had occupied those high posts during the second french empire with conspicuous advantage to himself  a table a chair a wooden bedstead had been procured for his excellency who after a short siesta rendered absolutely necessary by the labours and the pomps of his entry into sulaco had been getting hold of the administrative machine by making appointments giving orders and signing proclamations alone with charles gould in the audience room his excellency managed with his wellknown skill to conceal his annoyance and consternation he had begun at first to talk loftily of confiscation but the want of all proper feeling and mobility in the senor administradors features ended by affecting adversely his power of masterful expression charles gould had repeated the government can certainly bring about the destruction of the san tome mine if it likes but without me it can do nothing else it was an alarming pronouncement and well calculated to hurt the sensibilities of a politician whose mind is bent upon the spoils of victory and charles gould said also that the destruction of the san tome mine would cause the ruin of other undertakings the withdrawal of european capital the withholding most probably of the last instalment of the foreign loan that stony fiend of a man said all these things which were accessible to his excellencys intelligence in a coldblooded manner which made one shudder  a long course of reading historical works light and gossipy in tone carried out in garrets of parisian hotels sprawling on an untidy bed to the neglect of his duties menial or otherwise had affected the manners of pedro montero had he seen around him the splendour of the old intendencia the magnificent hangings the gilt furniture ranged along the walls had he stood upon a dais on a noble square of red carpet he would have probably been very dangerous from a sense of success and elevation but in this sacked and devastated residence with the three pieces of common furniture huddled up in the middle of the vast apartment pedritos imagination was subdued by a feeling of insecurity and impermanence that feeling and the firm attitude of charles gould who had not once so far pronounced the word excellency diminished him in his own eyes he assumed the tone of an enlightened man of the world and begged charles gould to dismiss from his mind every cause for alarm he was now conversing he reminded him with the brother of the master of the country charged with a reorganizing mission the trusted brother of the master of the country he repeated nothing was further from the thoughts of that wise and patriotic hero than ideas of destruction i entreat you don carlos not to give way to your antidemocratic prejudices he cried in a burst of condescending effusion  pedrito montero surprised one at first sight by the vast development of his bald forehead a shiny yellow expanse between the crinkly coalblack tufts of hair without any lustre the engaging form of his mouth and an unexpectedly cultivated voice but his eyes very glistening as if freshly painted on each side of his hooked nose had a round hopeless birdlike stare when opened fully now however he narrowed them agreeably throwing his square chin up and speaking with closed teeth slightly through the nose with what he imagined to be the manner of a grand seigneur  in that attitude he declared suddenly that the highest expression of democracy was caesarism the imperial rule based upon the direct popular vote caesarism was conservative it was strong it recognized the legitimate needs of democracy which requires orders titles and distinctions they would be showered upon deserving men caesarism was peace it was progressive it secured the prosperity of a country pedrito montero was carried away look at what the second empire had done for france it was a regime which delighted to honour men of don carloss stamp the second empire fell but that was because its chief was devoid of that military genius which had raised general montero to the pinnacle of fame and glory pedrito elevated his hand jerkily to help the idea of pinnacle of fame we shall have many talks yet we shall understand each other thoroughly don carlos he cried in a tone of fellowship republicanism had done its work imperial democracy was the power of the future pedrito the guerrillero showing his hand lowered his voice forcibly a man singled out by his fellowcitizens for the honourable nickname of el rey de sulaco could not but receive a full recognition from an imperial democracy as a great captain of industry and a person of weighty counsel whose popular designation would be soon replaced by a more solid title eh don carlos no what do you say conde de sulacoehor marquis     he ceased the air was cool on the plaza where a patrol of cavalry rode round and round without penetrating into the streets which resounded with shouts and the strumming of guitars issuing from the open doors of pulperias the orders were not to interfere with the enjoyments of the people and above the roofs next to the perpendicular lines of the cathedral towers the snowy curve of higuerota blocked a large space of darkening blue sky before the windows of the intendencia after a time pedrito montero thrusting his hand in the bosom of his coat bowed his head with slow dignity the audience was over  charles gould on going out passed his hand over his forehead as if to disperse the mists of an oppressive dream whose grotesque extravagance leaves behind a subtle sense of bodily danger and intellectual decay in the passages and on the staircases of the old palace monteros troopers lounged about insolently smoking and making way for no one the clanking of sabres and spurs resounded all over the building three silent groups of civilians in severe black waited in the main gallery formal and helpless a little huddled up each keeping apart from the others as if in the exercise of a public duty they had been overcome by a desire to shun the notice of every eye these were the deputations waiting for their audience the one from the provincial assembly more restless and uneasy in its corporate expression was overtopped by the big face of don juste lopez soft and white with prominent eyelids and wreathed in impenetrable solemnity as if in a dense cloud the president of the provincial assembly coming bravely to save the last shred of parliamentary institutions on the english model averted his eyes from the administrador of the san tome mine as a dignified rebuke of his little faith in that only saving principle  the mournful severity of that reproof did not affect charles gould but he was sensible to the glances of the others directed upon him without reproach as if only to read their own fate upon his face all of them had talked shouted and declaimed in the great sala of the casa gould the feeling of compassion for those men struck with a strange impotence in the toils of moral degradation did not induce him to make a sign he suffered from his fellowship in evil with them too much he crossed the plaza unmolested the amarilla club was full of festive ragamuffins their frowsy heads protruded from every window and from within came drunken shouts the thumping of feet and the twanging of harps broken bottles strewed the pavement below charles gould found the doctor still in his house  dr monygham came away from the crack in the shutter through which he had been watching the street  ah you are back at last he said in a tone of relief i have been telling mrs gould that you were perfectly safe but i was not by any means certain that the fellow would have let you go  neither was i confessed charles gould laying his hat on the table  you will have to take action  the silence of charles gould seemed to admit that this was the only course this was as far as charles gould was accustomed to go towards expressing his intentions  i hope you did not warn montero of what you mean to do the doctor said anxiously  i tried to make him see that the existence of the mine was bound up with my personal safety continued charles gould looking away from the doctor and fixing his eyes upon the watercolour sketch upon the wall  he believed you the doctor asked eagerly  god knows said charles gould i owed it to my wife to say that much he is well enough informed he knows that i have don pepe there fuentes must have told him they know that the old major is perfectly capable of blowing up the san tome mine without hesitation or compunction had it not been for that i dont think id have left the intendencia a free man he would blow everything up from loyalty and from hatefrom hate of these liberals as they call themselves liberals the words one knows so well have a nightmarish meaning in this country liberty democracy patriotism governmentall of them have a flavour of folly and murder havent they doctor    i alone can restrain don pepe if they were toto do away with me nothing could prevent him  they will try to tamper with him the doctor suggested thoughtfully  it is very possible charles gould said very low as if speaking to himself and still gazing at the sketch of the san tome gorge upon the wall yes i expect they will try that charles gould looked for the first time at the doctor it would give me time he added  exactly said dr monygham suppressing his excitement especially if don pepe behaves diplomatically why shouldnt he give them some hope of success eh otherwise you wouldnt gain so much time couldnt he be instructed to  charles gould looking at the doctor steadily shook his head but the doctor continued with a certain amount of fire  yes to enter into negotiations for the surrender of the mine it is a good notion you would mature your plan of course i dont ask what it is i dont want to know i would refuse to listen to you if you tried to tell me i am not fit for confidences  what nonsense muttered charles gould with displeasure  he disapproved of the doctors sensitiveness about that faroff episode of his life so much memory shocked charles gould it was like morbidness and again he shook his head he refused to tamper with the open rectitude of don pepes conduct both from taste and from policy instructions would have to be either verbal or in writing in either case they ran the risk of being intercepted it was by no means certain that a messenger could reach the mine and besides there was no one to send it was on the tip of charless tongue to say that only the late capataz de cargadores could have been employed with some chance of success and the certitude of discretion but he did not say that he pointed out to the doctor that it would have been bad policy directly don pepe let it be supposed that he could be bought over the administradors personal safety and the safety of his friends would become endangered for there would be then no reason for moderation the incorruptibility of don pepe was the essential and restraining fact the doctor hung his head and admitted that in a way it was so  he couldnt deny to himself that the reasoning was sound enough don pepes usefulness consisted in his unstained character as to his own usefulness he reflected bitterly it was also his own character he declared to charles gould that he had the means of keeping sotillo from joining his forces with montero at least for the present  if you had had all this silver here the doctor said or even if it had been known to be at the mine you could have bribed sotillo to throw off his recent monterism you could have induced him either to go away in his steamer or even to join you  certainly not that last charles gould declared firmly what could one do with a man like that afterwardstell me doctor the silver is gone and i am glad of it it would have been an immediate and strong temptation the scramble for that visible plunder would have precipitated a disastrous ending i would have had to defend it too i am glad weve removed iteven if it is lost it would have been a danger and a curse  perhaps he is right the doctor an hour later said hurriedly to mrs gould whom he met in the corridor the thing is done and the shadow of the treasure may do just as well as the substance let me try to serve you to the whole extent of my evil reputation i am off now to play my game of betrayal with sotillo and keep him off the town  she put out both her hands impulsively dr monygham you are running a terrible risk she whispered averting from his face her eyes full of tears for a short glance at the door of her husbands room she pressed both his hands and the doctor stood as if rooted to the spot looking down at her and trying to twist his lips into a smile  oh i know you will defend my memory he uttered at last and ran tottering down the stairs across the patio and out of the house in the street he kept up a great pace with his smart hobbling walk a case of instruments under his arm he was known for being loco nobody interfered with him from under the seaward gate across the dusty arid plain interspersed with low bushes he saw more than a mile away the ugly enormity of the custom house and the two or three other buildings which at that time constituted the seaport of sulaco far away to the south groves of palm trees edged the curve of the harbour shore the distant peaks of the cordillera had lost their identity of clearcut shapes in the steadily deepening blue of the eastern sky the doctor walked briskly a darkling shadow seemed to fall upon him from the zenith the sun had set for a time the snows of higuerota continued to glow with the reflected glory of the west the doctor holding a straight course for the custom house appeared lonely hopping amongst the dark bushes like a tall bird with a broken wing  tints of purple gold and crimson were mirrored in the clear water of the harbour a long tongue of land straight as a wall with the grassgrown ruins of the fort making a sort of rounded green mound plainly visible from the inner shore closed its circuit while beyond the placid gulf repeated those splendours of colouring on a greater scale and with a more sombre magnificence the great mass of cloud filling the head of the gulf had long red smears amongst its convoluted folds of grey and black as of a floating mantle stained with blood the three isabels overshadowed and clear cut in a great smoothness confounding the sea and sky appeared suspended purpleblack in the air the little wavelets seemed to be tossing tiny red sparks upon the sandy beaches the glassy bands of water along the horizon gave out a fiery red glow as if fire and water had been mingled together in the vast bed of the ocean  at last the conflagration of sea and sky lying embraced and still in a flaming contact upon the edge of the world went out the red sparks in the water vanished together with the stains of blood in the black mantle draping the sombre head of the placid gulf a sudden breeze sprang up and died out after rustling heavily the growth of bushes on the ruined earthwork of the fort nostromo woke up from a fourteen hours sleep and arose full length from his lair in the long grass he stood knee deep amongst the whispering undulations of the green blades with the lost air of a man just born into the world handsome robust and supple he threw back his head flung his arms open and stretched himself with a slow twist of the waist and a leisurely growling yawn of white teeth as natural and free from evil in the moment of waking as a magnificent and unconscious wild beast then in the suddenly steadied glance fixed upon nothing from under a thoughtful frown appeared the man    chapter eight  after landing from his swim nostromo had scrambled up all dripping into the main quadrangle of the old fort and there amongst ruined bits of walls and rotting remnants of roofs and sheds he had slept the day through he had slept in the shadow of the mountains in the white blaze of noon in the stillness and solitude of that overgrown piece of land between the oval of the harbour and the spacious semicircle of the gulf he lay as if dead a reyzamuro appearing like a tiny black speck in the blue stooped circling prudently with a stealthiness of flight startling in a bird of that great size the shadow of his pearlywhite body of his blacktipped wings fell on the grass no more silently than he alighted himself on a hillock of rubbish within three yards of that man lying as still as a corpse the bird stretched his bare neck craned his bald head loathsome in the brilliance of varied colouring with an air of voracious anxiety towards the promising stillness of that prostrate body then sinking his head deeply into his soft plumage he settled himself to wait the first thing upon which nostromos eyes fell on waking was this patient watcher for the signs of death and corruption when the man got up the vulture hopped away in great sidelong fluttering jumps he lingered for a while morose and reluctant before he rose circling noiselessly with a sinister droop of beak and claws  long after he had vanished nostromo lifting his eyes up to the sky muttered i am not dead yet  the capataz of the sulaco cargadores had lived in splendour and publicity up to the very moment as it were when he took charge of the lighter containing the treasure of silver ingots  the last act he had performed in sulaco was in complete harmony with his vanity and as such perfectly genuine he had given his last dollar to an old woman moaning with the grief and fatigue of a dismal search under the arch of the ancient gate performed in obscurity and without witnesses it had still the characteristics of splendour and publicity and was in strict keeping with his reputation but this awakening in solitude except for the watchful vulture amongst the ruins of the fort had no such characteristics his first confused feeling was exactly thisthat it was not in keeping it was more like the end of things the necessity of living concealed somehow for god knows how long which assailed him on his return to consciousness made everything that had gone before for years appear vain and foolish like a flattering dream come suddenly to an end  he climbed the crumbling slope of the rampart and putting aside the bushes looked upon the harbour he saw a couple of ships at anchor upon the sheet of water reflecting the last gleams of light and sotillos steamer moored to the jetty and behind the pale long front of the custom house there appeared the extent of the town like a grove of thick timber on the plain with a gateway in front and the cupolas towers and miradors rising above the trees all dark as if surrendered already to the night the thought that it was no longer open to him to ride through the streets recognized by everyone great and little as he used to do every evening on his way to play monte in the posada of the mexican domingo or to sit in the place of honour listening to songs and looking at dances made it appear to him as a town that had no existence  for a long time he gazed on then let the parted bushes spring back and crossing over to the other side of the fort surveyed the vaster emptiness of the great gulf the isabels stood out heavily upon the narrowing long band of red in the west which gleamed low between their black shapes and the capataz thought of decoud alone there with the treasure that man was the only one who cared whether he fell into the hands of the monterists or not the capataz reflected bitterly and that merely would be an anxiety for his own sake as to the rest they neither knew nor cared what he had heard giorgio viola say once was very true kings ministers aristocrats the rich in general kept the people in poverty and subjection they kept them as they kept dogs to fight and hunt for their service  the darkness of the sky had descended to the line of the horizon enveloping the whole gulf the islets and the lover of antonia alone with the treasure on the great isabel the capataz turning his back on these things invisible and existing sat down and took his face between his fists he felt the pinch of poverty for the first time in his life to find himself without money after a run of bad luck at monte in the low smoky room of domingos posada where the fraternity of cargadores gambled sang and danced of an evening to remain with empty pockets after a burst of public generosity to some peyne doro girl or other for whom he did not care had none of the humiliation of destitution he remained rich in glory and reputation but since it was no longer possible for him to parade the streets of the town and be hailed with respect in the usual haunts of his leisure this sailor felt himself destitute indeed  his mouth was dry it was dry with heavy sleep and extremely anxious thinking as it had never been dry before it may be said that nostromo tasted the dust and ashes of the fruit of life into which he had bitten deeply in his hunger for praise without removing his head from between his fists he tried to spit before himtfuiand muttered a curse upon the selfishness of all the rich people  since everything seemed lost in sulaco and that was the feeling of his waking the idea of leaving the country altogether had presented itself to nostromo at that thought he had seen like the beginning of another dream a vision of steep and tideless shores with dark pines on the heights and white houses low down near a very blue sea he saw the quays of a big port where the coasting feluccas with their lateen sails outspread like motionless wings enter gliding silently between the end of long moles of squared blocks that project angularly towards each other hugging a cluster of shipping to the superb bosom of a hill covered with palaces he remembered these sights not without some filial emotion though he had been habitually and severely beaten as a boy on one of these feluccas by a shortnecked shaven genoese with a deliberate and distrustful manner who he firmly believed had cheated him out of his orphans inheritance but it is mercifully decreed that the evils of the past should appear but faintly in retrospect under the sense of loneliness abandonment and failure the idea of return to these things appeared tolerable but what return with bare feet and head with one check shirt and a pair of cotton calzoneros for all worldly possessions  the renowned capataz his elbows on his knees and a fist dug into each cheek laughed with selfderision as he had spat with disgust straight out before him into the night the confused and intimate impressions of universal dissolution which beset a subjective nature at any strong check to its ruling passion had a bitterness approaching that of death itself he was simple he was as ready to become the prey of any belief superstition or desire as a child  the facts of his situation he could appreciate like a man with a distinct experience of the country he saw them clearly he was as if sobered after a long bout of intoxication his fidelity had been taken advantage of he had persuaded the body of cargadores to side with the blancos against the rest of the people he had had interviews with don jose he had been made use of by father corbelan for negotiating with hernandez it was known that don martin decoud had admitted him to a sort of intimacy so that he had been free of the offices of the porvenir all these things had flattered him in the usual way what did he care about their politics nothing at all and at the end of it allnostromo here and nostromo therewhere is nostromo nostromo can do this and thatwork all day and ride all nightbehold he found himself a marked ribierist for any sort of vengeance gamacho for instance would choose to take now the montero party had after all mastered the town the europeans had given up the caballeros had given up don martin had indeed explained it was only temporarythat he was going to bring barrios to the rescue where was that nowwith don martin whose ironic manner of talk had always made the capataz feel vaguely uneasy stranded on the great isabel everybody had given up even don carlos had given up the hurried removal of the treasure out to sea meant nothing else than that the capataz de cargadores on a revulsion of subjectiveness exasperated almost to insanity beheld all his world without faith and courage he had been betrayed  with the boundless shadows of the sea behind him out of his silence and immobility facing the lofty shapes of the lower peaks crowded around the white misty sheen of higuerota nostromo laughed aloud again sprang abruptly to his feet and stood still he must go but where  there is no mistake they keep us and encourage us as if we were dogs born to fight and hunt for them the vecchio is right he said slowly and scathingly he remembered old giorgio taking his pipe out of his mouth to throw these words over his shoulder at the cafe full of enginedrivers and fitters from the railway workshops this image fixed his wavering purpose he would try to find old giorgio if he could god knows what might have happened to him he made a few steps then stopped again and shook his head to the left and right in front and behind him the scrubby bush rustled mysteriously in the darkness  teresa was right too he added in a low tone touched with awe he wondered whether she was dead in her anger with him or still alive as if in answer to this thought half of remorse and half of hope with a soft flutter and oblique flight a big owl whose appalling cry yaacabo yaacaboit is finished it is finishedannounces calamity and death in the popular belief drifted vaguely like a large dark ball across his path in the downfall of all the realities that made his force he was affected by the superstition and shuddered slightly signora teresa must have died then it could mean nothing else the cry of the illomened bird the first sound he was to hear on his return was a fitting welcome for his betrayed individuality the unseen powers which he had offended by refusing to bring a priest to a dying woman were lifting up their voice against him she was dead with admirable and human consistency he referred everything to himself she had been a woman of good counsel always and the bereaved old giorgio remained stunned by his loss just as he was likely to require the advice of his sagacity the blow would render the dreamy old man quite stupid for a time  as to captain mitchell nostromo after the manner of trusted subordinates considered him as a person fitted by education perhaps to sign papers in an office and to give orders but otherwise of no use whatever and something of a fool the necessity of winding round his little finger almost daily the pompous and testy selfimportance of the old seaman had grown irksome with use to nostromo at first it had given him an inward satisfaction but the necessity of overcoming small obstacles becomes wearisome to a selfconfident personality as much by the certitude of success as by the monotony of effort he mistrusted his superiors proneness to fussy action that old englishman had no judgment he said to himself it was useless to suppose that acquainted with the true state of the case he would keep it to himself he would talk of doing impracticable things nostromo feared him as one would fear saddling ones self with some persistent worry he had no discretion he would betray the treasure and nostromo had made up his mind that the treasure should not be betrayed  the word had fixed itself tenaciously in his intelligence his imagination had seized upon the clear and simple notion of betrayal to account for the dazed feeling of enlightenment as to being done for of having inadvertently gone out of his existence on an issue in which his personality had not been taken into account a man betrayed is a man destroyed signora teresa may god have her soul had been right he had never been taken into account destroyed her white form sitting up bowed in bed the falling black hair the widebrowed suffering face raised to him the anger of her denunciations appeared to him now majestic with the awfulness of inspiration and of death for it was not for nothing that the evil bird had uttered its lamentable shriek over his head she was deadmay god have her soul  sharing in the antipriestly freethought of the masses his mind used the pious formula from the superficial force of habit but with a deepseated sincerity the popular mind is incapable of scepticism and that incapacity delivers their helpless strength to the wiles of swindlers and to the pitiless enthusiasms of leaders inspired by visions of a high destiny she was dead but would god consent to receive her soul she had died without confession or absolution because he had not been willing to spare her another moment of his time his scorn of priests as priests remained but after all it was impossible to know whether what they affirmed was not true power punishment pardon are simple and credible notions the magnificent capataz de cargadores deprived of certain simple realities such as the admiration of women the adulation of men the admired publicity of his life was ready to feel the burden of sacrilegious guilt descend upon his shoulders  bareheaded in a thin shirt and drawers he felt the lingering warmth of the fine sand under the soles of his feet the narrow strand gleamed far ahead in a long curve defining the outline of this wild side of the harbour he flitted along the shore like a pursued shadow between the sombre palmgroves and the sheet of water lying as still as death on his right hand he strode with headlong haste in the silence and solitude as though he had forgotten all prudence and caution but he knew that on this side of the water he ran no risk of discovery the only inhabitant was a lonely silent apathetic indian in charge of the palmarias who brought sometimes a load of cocoanuts to the town for sale he lived without a woman in an open shed with a perpetual fire of dry sticks smouldering near an old canoe lying bottom up on the beach he could be easily avoided  the barking of the dogs about that mans ranche was the first thing that checked his speed he had forgotten the dogs he swerved sharply and plunged into the palmgrove as into a wilderness of columns in an immense hall whose dense obscurity seemed to whisper and rustle faintly high above his head he traversed it entered a ravine and climbed to the top of a steep ridge free of trees and bushes  from there open and vague in the starlight he saw the plain between the town and the harbour in the woods above some nightbird made a strange drumming noise below beyond the palmaria on the beach the indians dogs continued to bark uproariously he wondered what had upset them so much and peering down from his elevation was surprised to detect unaccountable movements of the ground below as if several oblong pieces of the plain had been in motion those dark shifting patches alternately catching and eluding the eye altered their place always away from the harbour with a suggestion of consecutive order and purpose a light dawned upon him it was a column of infantry on a night march towards the higher broken country at the foot of the hills but he was too much in the dark about everything for wonder and speculation  the plain had resumed its shadowy immobility he descended the ridge and found himself in the open solitude between the harbour and the town its spaciousness extended indefinitely by an effect of obscurity rendered more sensible his profound isolation his pace became slower no one waited for him no one thought of him no one expected or wished his return betrayed betrayed he muttered to himself no one cared he might have been drowned by this time no one would have caredunless perhaps the children he thought to himself but they were with the english signora and not thinking of him at all  he wavered in his purpose of making straight for the casa viola to what end what could he expect there his life seemed to fail him in all its details even to the scornful reproaches of teresa he was aware painfully of his reluctance was it that remorse which she had prophesied with what he saw now was her last breath  meantime he had deviated from the straight course inclining by a sort of instinct to the right towards the jetty and the harbour the scene of his daily labours the great length of the custom house loomed up all at once like the wall of a factory not a soul challenged his approach and his curiosity became excited as he passed cautiously towards the front by the unexpected sight of two lighted windows  they had the fascination of a lonely vigil kept by some mysterious watcher up there those two windows shining dimly upon the harbour in the whole vast extent of the abandoned building the solitude could almost be felt a strong smell of wood smoke hung about in a thin haze which was faintly perceptible to his raised eyes against the glitter of the stars as he advanced in the profound silence the shrilling of innumerable cicalas in the dry grass seemed positively deafening to his strained ears slowly step by step he found himself in the great hall sombre and full of acrid smoke  a fire built against the staircase had burnt down impotently to a low heap of embers the hard wood had failed to catch only a few steps at the bottom smouldered with a creeping glow of sparks defining their charred edges at the top he saw a streak of light from an open door it fell upon the vast landing all foggy with a slow drift of smoke that was the room he climbed the stairs then checked himself because he had seen within the shadow of a man cast upon one of the walls it was a shapeless highshouldered shadow of somebody standing still with lowered head out of his line of sight the capataz remembering that he was totally unarmed stepped aside and effacing himself upright in a dark corner waited with his eyes fixed on the door  the whole enormous ruined barrack of a place unfinished without ceilings under its lofty roof was pervaded by the smoke swaying to and fro in the faint cross draughts playing in the obscurity of many lofty rooms and barnlike passages once one of the swinging shutters came against the wall with a single sharp crack as if pushed by an impatient hand a piece of paper scurried out from somewhere rustling along the landing the man whoever he was did not darken the lighted doorway twice the capataz advancing a couple of steps out of his corner craned his neck in the hope of catching sight of what he could be at so quietly in there but every time he saw only the distorted shadow of broad shoulders and bowed head he was doing apparently nothing and stirred not from the spot as though he were meditatingor perhaps reading a paper and not a sound issued from the room  once more the capataz stepped back he wondered who it wassome monterist but he dreaded to show himself to discover his presence on shore unless after many days would he believed endanger the treasure with his own knowledge possessing his whole soul it seemed impossible that anybody in sulaco should fail to jump at the right surmise after a couple of weeks or so it would be different who could tell he had not returned overland from some port beyond the limits of the republic the existence of the treasure confused his thoughts with a peculiar sort of anxiety as though his life had become bound up with it it rendered him timorous for a moment before that enigmatic lighted door devil take the fellow he did not want to see him there would be nothing to learn from his face known or unknown he was a fool to waste his time there in waiting  less than five minutes after entering the place the capataz began his retreat he got away down the stairs with perfect success gave one upward look over his shoulder at the light on the landing and ran stealthily across the hall but at the very moment he was turning out of the great door with his mind fixed upon escaping the notice of the man upstairs somebody he had not heard coming briskly along the front ran full into him both muttered a stifled exclamation of surprise and leaped back and stood still each indistinct to the other nostromo was silent the other man spoke first in an amazed and deadened tone  who are you  already nostromo had seemed to recognize dr monygham he had no doubt now he hesitated the space of a second the idea of bolting without a word presented itself to his mind no use an inexplicable repugnance to pronounce the name by which he was known kept him silent a little longer at last he said in a low voice  a cargador  he walked up to the other dr monygham had received a shock he flung his arms up and cried out his wonder aloud forgetting himself before the marvel of this meeting nostromo angrily warned him to moderate his voice the custom house was not so deserted as it looked there was somebody in the lighted room above  there is no more evanescent quality in an accomplished fact than its wonderfulness solicited incessantly by the considerations affecting its fears and desires the human mind turns naturally away from the marvellous side of events and it was in the most natural way possible that the doctor asked this man whom only two minutes before he believed to have been drowned in the gulf  you have seen somebody up there have you  no i have not seen him  then how do you know  i was running away from his shadow when we met  his shadow  yes his shadow in the lighted room said nostromo in a contemptuous tone leaning back with folded arms at the foot of the immense building he dropped his head biting his lips slightly and not looking at the doctor now he thought to himself he will begin asking me about the treasure  but the doctors thoughts were concerned with an event not as marvellous as nostromos appearance but in itself much less clear why had sotillo taken himself off with his whole command with this suddenness and secrecy what did this move portend however it dawned upon the doctor that the man upstairs was one of the officers left behind by the disappointed colonel to communicate with him  i believe he is waiting for me he said  it is possible  i must see do not go away yet capataz  go away where muttered nostromo  already the doctor had left him he remained leaning against the wall staring at the dark water of the harbour the shrilling of cicalas filled his ears an invincible vagueness coming over his thoughts took from them all power to determine his will  capataz capataz the doctors voice called urgently from above  the sense of betrayal and ruin floated upon his sombre indifference as upon a sluggish sea of pitch but he stepped out from under the wall and looking up saw dr monygham leaning out of a lighted window  come up and see what sotillo has done you need not fear the man up here  he answered by a slight bitter laugh fear a man the capataz of the sulaco cargadores fear a man it angered him that anybody should suggest such a thing it angered him to be disarmed and skulking and in danger because of the accursed treasure which was of so little account to the people who had tied it round his neck he could not shake off the worry of it to nostromo the doctor represented all these people    and he had never even asked after it not a word of inquiry about the most desperate undertaking of his life  thinking these thoughts nostromo passed again through the cavernous hall where the smoke was considerably thinned and went up the stairs not so warm to his feet now towards the streak of light at the top the doctor appeared in it for a moment agitated and impatient  come up come up  at the moment of crossing the doorway the capataz experienced a shock of surprise the man had not moved he saw his shadow in the same place he started then stepped in with a feeling of being about to solve a mystery  it was very simple for an infinitesimal fraction of a second against the light of two flaring and guttering candles through a blue pungent thin haze which made his eyes smart he saw the man standing as he had imagined him with his back to the door casting an enormous and distorted shadow upon the wall swifter than a flash of lightning followed the impression of his constrained toppling attitudethe shoulders projecting forward the head sunk low upon the breast then he distinguished the arms behind his back and wrenched so terribly that the two clenched fists lashed together had been forced up higher than the shoulderblades from there his eyes traced in one instantaneous glance the hide rope going upwards from the tied wrists over a heavy beam and down to a staple in the wall he did not want to look at the rigid legs at the feet hanging down nervelessly with their bare toes some six inches above the floor to know that the man had been given the estrapade till he had swooned his first impulse was to dash forward and sever the rope at one blow he felt for his knife he had no knifenot even a knife he stood quivering and the doctor perched on the edge of the table facing thoughtfully the cruel and lamentable sight his chin in his hand uttered without stirring  torturedand shot dead through the breastgetting cold  this information calmed the capataz one of the candles flickering in the socket went out who did this he asked  sotillo i tell you who else torturedof course but why shot the doctor looked fixedly at nostromo who shrugged his shoulders slightly and mark shot suddenly on impulse it is evident i wish i had his secret  nostromo had advanced and stooped slightly to look i seem to have seen that face somewhere he muttered who is he  the doctor turned his eyes upon him again i may yet come to envying his fate what do you think of that capataz eh  but nostromo did not even hear these words seizing the remaining light he thrust it under the drooping head the doctor sat oblivious with a lost gaze then the heavy iron candlestick as if struck out of nostromos hand clattered on the floor  hullo exclaimed the doctor looking up with a start he could hear the capataz stagger against the table and gasp in the sudden extinction of the light within the dead blackness sealing the windowframes became alive with stars to his sight  of course of course the doctor muttered to himself in english enough to make him jump out of his skin  nostromos heart seemed to force itself into his throat his head swam hirsch the man was hirsch he held on tight to the edge of the table  but he was hiding in the lighter he almost shouted his voice fell in the lighter andand  and sotillo brought him in said the doctor he is no more startling to you than you were to me what i want to know is how he induced some compassionate soul to shoot him  so sotillo knows began nostromo in a more equable voice  everything interrupted the doctor  the capataz was heard striking the table with his fist everything what are you saying there everything know everything it is impossible everything  of course what do you mean by impossible i tell you i have heard this hirsch questioned last night here in this very room he knew your name decouds name and all about the loading of the silver    the lighter was cut in two he was grovelling in abject terror before sotillo but he remembered that much what do you want more he knew least about himself they found him clinging to their anchor he must have caught at it just as the lighter went to the bottom  went to the bottom repeated nostromo slowly sotillo believes that bueno  the doctor a little impatiently was unable to imagine what else could anybody believe yes sotillo believed that the lighter was sunk and the capataz de cargadores together with martin decoud and perhaps one or two other political fugitives had been drowned  i told you well senor doctor remarked nostromo at that point that sotillo did not know everything  eh what do you mean  he did not know i was not dead  neither did we  and you did not carenone of you caballeros on the wharfonce you got off a man of flesh and blood like yourselves on a fools business that could not end well  you forget capataz i was not on the wharf and i did not think well of the business so you need not taunt me i tell you what man we had but little leisure to think of the dead death stands near behind us all you were gone  i went indeed broke in nostromo and for the sake of whattell me  ah that is your own affair the doctor said roughly do not ask me  their flowing murmurs paused in the dark perched on the edge of the table with slightly averted faces they felt their shoulders touch and their eyes remained directed towards an upright shape nearly lost in the obscurity of the inner part of the room that with projecting head and shoulders in ghastly immobility seemed intent on catching every word  muy bien nostromo muttered at last so be it teresa was right it is my own affair  teresa is dead remarked the doctor absently while his mind followed a new line of thought suggested by what might have been called nostromos return to life she died the poor woman  without a priest the capataz asked anxiously  what a question who could have got a priest for her last night  may god keep her soul ejaculated nostromo with a gloomy and hopeless fervour which had no time to surprise dr monygham before reverting to their previous conversation he continued in a sinister tone si senor doctor as you were saying it is my own affair a very desperate affair  there are no two men in this part of the world that could have saved themselves by swimming as you have done the doctor said admiringly  and again there was silence between those two men they were both reflecting and the diversity of their natures made their thoughts born from their meeting swing afar from each other the doctor impelled to risky action by his loyalty to the goulds wondered with thankfulness at the chain of accident which had brought that man back where he would be of the greatest use in the work of saving the san tome mine the doctor was loyal to the mine it presented itself to his fiftyyears old eyes in the shape of a little woman in a soft dress with a long train with a head attractively overweighted by a great mass of fair hair and the delicate preciousness of her inner worth partaking of a gem and a flower revealed in every attitude of her person as the dangers thickened round the san tome mine this illusion acquired force permanency and authority it claimed him at last this claim exalted by a spiritual detachment from the usual sanctions of hope and reward made dr monyghams thinking acting individuality extremely dangerous to himself and to others all his scruples vanishing in the proud feeling that his devotion was the only thing that stood between an admirable woman and a frightful disaster  it was a sort of intoxication which made him utterly indifferent to decouds fate but left his wits perfectly clear for the appreciation of decouds political idea it was a good ideaand barrios was the only instrument of its realization the doctors soul withered and shrunk by the shame of a moral disgrace became implacable in the expansion of its tenderness nostromos return was providential he did not think of him humanely as of a fellowcreature just escaped from the jaws of death the capataz for him was the only possible messenger to cayta the very man the doctors misanthropic mistrust of mankind the bitterer because based on personal failure did not lift him sufficiently above common weaknesses he was under the spell of an established reputation trumpeted by captain mitchell grown in repetition and fixed in general assent nostromos faithfulness had never been questioned by dr monygham as a fact it was not likely to be questioned now he stood in desperate need of it himself dr monygham was human he accepted the popular conception of the capatazs incorruptibility simply because no word or fact had ever contradicted a mere affirmation it seemed to be a part of the man like his whiskers or his teeth it was impossible to conceive him otherwise the question was whether he would consent to go on such a dangerous and desperate errand the doctor was observant enough to have become aware from the first of something peculiar in the mans temper he was no doubt sore about the loss of the silver  it will be necessary to take him into my fullest confidence he said to himself with a certain acuteness of insight into the nature he had to deal with  on nostromos side the silence had been full of black irresolution anger and mistrust he was the first to break it however  the swimming was no great matter he said it is what went beforeand what comes after that  he did not quite finish what he meant to say breaking off short as though his thought had butted against a solid obstacle the doctors mind pursued its own schemes with machiavellian subtlety he said as sympathetically as he was able  it is unfortunate capataz but no one would think of blaming you very unfortunate to begin with the treasure ought never to have left the mountain but it was decoud whohowever he is dead there is no need to talk of him  no assented nostromo as the doctor paused there is no need to talk of dead men but i am not dead yet  you are all right only a man of your intrepidity could have saved himself  in this dr monygham was sincere he esteemed highly the intrepidity of that man whom he valued but little being disillusioned as to mankind in general because of the particular instance in which his own manhood had failed having had to encounter singlehanded during his period of eclipse many physical dangers he was well aware of the most dangerous element common to them all of the crushing paralyzing sense of human littleness which is what really defeats a man struggling with natural forces alone far from the eyes of his fellows he was eminently fit to appreciate the mental image he made for himself of the capataz after hours of tension and anxiety precipitated suddenly into an abyss of waters and darkness without earth or sky and confronting it not only with an undismayed mind but with sensible success of course the man was an incomparable swimmer that was known but the doctor judged that this instance testified to a still greater intrepidity of spirit it was pleasing to him he augured well from it for the success of the arduous mission with which he meant to entrust the capataz so marvellously restored to usefulness and in a tone vaguely gratified he observed  it must have been terribly dark  it was the worst darkness of the golfo the capataz assented briefly he was mollified by what seemed a sign of some faint interest in such things as had befallen him and dropped a few descriptive phrases with an affected and curt nonchalance at that moment he felt communicative he expected the continuance of that interest which whether accepted or rejected would have restored to him his personalitythe only thing lost in that desperate affair but the doctor engrossed by a desperate adventure of his own was terrible in the pursuit of his idea he let an exclamation of regret escape him  i could almost wish you had shouted and shown a light  this unexpected utterance astounded the capataz by its character of coldblooded atrocity it was as much as to say i wish you had shown yourself a coward i wish you had had your throat cut for your pains naturally he referred it to himself whereas it related only to the silver being uttered simply and with many mental reservations surprise and rage rendered him speechless and the doctor pursued practically unheard by nostromo whose stirred blood was beating violently in his ears  for i am convinced sotillo in possession of the silver would have turned short round and made for some small port abroad economically it would have been wasteful but still less wasteful than having it sunk it was the next best thing to having it at hand in some safe place and using part of it to buy up sotillo but i doubt whether don carlos would have ever made up his mind to it he is not fit for costaguana and that is a fact capataz  the capataz had mastered the fury that was like a tempest in his ears in time to hear the name of don carlos he seemed to have come out of it a changed mana man who spoke thoughtfully in a soft and even voice  and would don carlos have been content if i had surrendered this treasure  i should not wonder if they were all of that way of thinking now the doctor said grimly i was never consulted decoud had it his own way their eyes are opened by this time i should think i for one know that if that silver turned up this moment miraculously ashore i would give it to sotillo and as things stand i would be approved  turned up miraculously repeated the capataz very low then raised his voice that senor would be a greater miracle than any saint could perform  i believe you capataz said the doctor drily  he went on to develop his view of sotillos dangerous influence upon the situation and the capataz listening as if in a dream felt himself of as little account as the indistinct motionless shape of the dead man whom he saw upright under the beam with his air of listening also disregarded forgotten like a terrible example of neglect  was it for an unconsidered and foolish whim that they came to me then he interrupted suddenly had i not done enough for them to be of some account por dios is it that the hombres finosthe gentlemenneed not think as long as there is a man of the people ready to risk his body and soul or perhaps we have no soulslike dogs  there was decoud too with his plan the doctor reminded him again  si and the rich man in san francisco who had something to do with that treasure toowhat do i know no i have heard too many things it seems to me that everything is permitted to the rich  i understand capataz the doctor began  what capataz broke in nostromo in a forcible but even voice the capataz is undone destroyed there is no capataz oh no you will find the capataz no more  come this is childish remonstrated the doctor and the other calmed down suddenly  i have been indeed like a little child he muttered  and as his eyes met again the shape of the murdered man suspended in his awful immobility which seemed the uncomplaining immobility of attention he asked wondering gently  why did sotillo give the estrapade to this pitiful wretch do you know no torture could have been worse than his fear killing i can understand his anguish was intolerable to behold but why should he torment him like this he could tell no more  no he could tell nothing more any sane man would have seen that he had told him everything but i tell you what it is capataz sotillo would not believe what he was told not everything  what is it he would not believe i cannot understand  i can because i have seen the man he refuses to believe that the treasure is lost  what the capataz cried out in a discomposed tone  that startles youeh  am i to understand senor nostromo went on in a deliberate and as it were watchful tone that sotillo thinks the treasure has been saved by some means  no no that would be impossible said the doctor with conviction and nostromo emitted a grunt in the dark that would be impossible he thinks that the silver was no longer in the lighter when she was sunk he has convinced himself that the whole show of getting it away to sea is a mere sham got up to deceive gamacho and his nationals pedrito montero senor fuentes our new gefe politico and himself too only he says he is no such fool  but he is devoid of sense he is the greatest imbecile that ever called himself a colonel in this country of evil growled nostromo  he is no more unreasonable than many sensible men said the doctor he has convinced himself that the treasure can be found because he desires passionately to possess himself of it and he is also afraid of his officers turning upon him and going over to pedrito whom he has not the courage either to fight or trust do you see that capataz he need fear no desertion as long as some hope remains of that enormous plunder turning up i have made it my business to keep this very hope up  you have the capataz de cargadores repeated cautiously well that is wonderful and how long do you think you are going to keep it up  as long as i can  what does that mean  i can tell you exactly as long as i live the doctor retorted in a stubborn voice then in a few words he described the story of his arrest and the circumstances of his release i was going back to that silly scoundrel when we met he concluded  nostromo had listened with profound attention you have made up your mind then to a speedy death he muttered through his clenched teeth  perhaps my illustrious capataz the doctor said testily you are not the only one here who can look an ugly death in the face  no doubt mumbled nostromo loud enough to be overheard there may be even more than two fools in this place who knows  and that is my affair said the doctor curtly  as taking out the accursed silver to sea was my affair retorted nostromo i see bueno each of us has his reasons but you were the last man i conversed with before i started and you talked to me as if i were a fool  nostromo had a great distaste for the doctors sardonic treatment of his great reputation decouds faintly ironic recognition used to make him uneasy but the familiarity of a man like don martin was flattering whereas the doctor was a nobody he could remember him a penniless outcast slinking about the streets of sulaco without a single friend or acquaintance till don carlos gould took him into the service of the mine  you may be very wise he went on thoughtfully staring into the obscurity of the room pervaded by the gruesome enigma of the tortured and murdered hirsch but i am not such a fool as when i started i have learned one thing since and that is that you are a dangerous man  dr monygham was too startled to do more than exclaim  what is it you say  if he could speak he would say the same thing pursued nostromo with a nod of his shadowy head silhouetted against the starlit window  i do not understand you said dr monygham faintly  no perhaps if you had not confirmed sotillo in his madness he would have been in no haste to give the estrapade to that miserable hirsch  the doctor started at the suggestion but his devotion absorbing all his sensibilities had left his heart steeled against remorse and pity still for complete relief he felt the necessity of repelling it loudly and contemptuously  bah you dare to tell me that with a man like sotillo i confess i did not give a thought to hirsch if i had it would have been useless anybody can see that the luckless wretch was doomed from the moment he caught hold of the anchor he was doomed i tell you just as i myself am doomedmost probably  this is what dr monygham said in answer to nostromos remark which was plausible enough to prick his conscience he was not a callous man but the necessity the magnitude the importance of the task he had taken upon himself dwarfed all merely humane considerations he had undertaken it in a fanatical spirit he did not like it to lie to deceive to circumvent even the basest of mankind was odious to him it was odious to him by training instinct and tradition to do these things in the character of a traitor was abhorrent to his nature and terrible to his feelings he had made that sacrifice in a spirit of abasement he had said to himself bitterly i am the only one fit for that dirty work and he believed this he was not subtle his simplicity was such that though he had no sort of heroic idea of seeking death the risk deadly enough to which he exposed himself had a sustaining and comforting effect to that spiritual state the fate of hirsch presented itself as part of the general atrocity of things he considered that episode practically what did it mean was it a sign of some dangerous change in sotillos delusion that the man should have been killed like this was what the doctor could not understand  yes but why shot he murmured to himself  nostromo kept very still    chapter nine  distracted between doubts and hopes dismayed by the sound of bells pealing out the arrival of pedrito montero sotillo had spent the morning in battling with his thoughts a contest to which he was unequal from the vacuity of his mind and the violence of his passions disappointment greed anger and fear made a tumult in the colonels breast louder than the din of bells in the town nothing he had planned had come to pass neither sulaco nor the silver of the mine had fallen into his hands he had performed no military exploit to secure his position and had obtained no enormous booty to make off with pedrito montero either as friend or foe filled him with dread the sound of bells maddened him  imagining at first that he might be attacked at once he had made his battalion stand to arms on the shore he walked to and fro all the length of the room stopping sometimes to gnaw the fingertips of his right hand with a lurid sideways glare fixed on the floor then with a sullen repelling glance all round he would resume his tramping in savage aloofness his hat horsewhip sword and revolver were lying on the table his officers crowding the window giving the view of the town gate disputed amongst themselves the use of his fieldglass bought last year on long credit from anzani it passed from hand to hand and the possessor for the time being was besieged by anxious inquiries  there is nothing there is nothing to see he would repeat impatiently  there was nothing and when the picket in the bushes near the casa viola had been ordered to fall back upon the main body no stir of life appeared on the stretch of dusty and arid land between the town and the waters of the port but late in the afternoon a horseman issuing from the gate was made out riding up fearlessly it was an emissary from senor fuentes being all alone he was allowed to come on dismounting at the great door he greeted the silent bystanders with cheery impudence and begged to be taken up at once to the muy valliente colonel  senor fuentes on entering upon his functions of gefe politico had turned his diplomatic abilities to getting hold of the harbour as well as of the mine the man he pitched upon to negotiate with sotillo was a notary public whom the revolution had found languishing in the common jail on a charge of forging documents liberated by the mob along with the other victims of blanco tyranny he had hastened to offer his services to the new government  he set out determined to display much zeal and eloquence in trying to induce sotillo to come into town alone for a conference with pedrito montero nothing was further from the colonels intentions the mere fleeting idea of trusting himself into the famous pedritos hands had made him feel unwell several times it was out of the questionit was madness and to put himself in open hostility was madness too it would render impossible a systematic search for that treasure for that wealth of silver which he seemed to feel somewhere about to scent somewhere near  but where where heavens where oh why had he allowed that doctor to go imbecile that he was but no it was the only right course he reflected distractedly while the messenger waited downstairs chatting agreeably to the officers it was in that scoundrelly doctors true interest to return with positive information but what if anything stopped him a general prohibition to leave the town for instance there would be patrols  the colonel seizing his head in his hands turned in his tracks as if struck with vertigo a flash of craven inspiration suggested to him an expedient not unknown to european statesmen when they wish to delay a difficult negotiation booted and spurred he scrambled into the hammock with undignified haste his handsome face had turned yellow with the strain of weighty cares the ridge of his shapely nose had grown sharp the audacious nostrils appeared mean and pinched the velvety caressing glance of his fine eyes seemed dead and even decomposed for these almondshaped languishing orbs had become inappropriately bloodshot with much sinister sleeplessness he addressed the surprised envoy of senor fuentes in a deadened exhausted voice it came pathetically feeble from under a pile of ponchos which buried his elegant person right up to the black moustaches uncurled pendant in sign of bodily prostration and mental incapacity fever fevera heavy fever had overtaken the muy valliente colonel a wavering wildness of expression caused by the passing spasms of a slight colic which had declared itself suddenly and the rattling teeth of repressed panic had a genuineness which impressed the envoy it was a cold fit the colonel explained that he was unable to think to listen to speak with an appearance of superhuman effort the colonel gasped out that he was not in a state to return a suitable reply or to execute any of his excellencys orders but tomorrow tomorrow ah tomorrow let his excellency don pedro be without uneasiness the brave esmeralda regiment held the harbour heldand closing his eyes he rolled his aching head like a halfdelirious invalid under the inquisitive stare of the envoy who was obliged to bend down over the hammock in order to catch the painful and broken accents meantime colonel sotillo trusted that his excellencys humanity would permit the doctor the english doctor to come out of town with his case of foreign remedies to attend upon him he begged anxiously his worship the caballero now present for the grace of looking in as he passed the casa gould and informing the english doctor who was probably there that his services were immediately required by colonel sotillo lying ill of fever in the custom house immediately most urgently required awaited with extreme impatience a thousand thanks he closed his eyes wearily and would not open them again lying perfectly still deaf dumb insensible overcome vanquished crushed annihilated by the fell disease  but as soon as the other had shut after him the door of the landing the colonel leaped out with a fling of both feet in an avalanche of woollen coverings his spurs having become entangled in a perfect welter of ponchos he nearly pitched on his head and did not recover his balance till the middle of the room concealed behind the halfclosed jalousies he listened to what went on below  the envoy had already mounted and turning to the morose officers occupying the great doorway took off his hat formally  caballeros he said in a very loud tone allow me to recommend you to take great care of your colonel it has done me much honour and gratification to have seen you all a fine body of men exercising the soldierly virtue of patience in this exposed situation where there is much sun and no water to speak of while a town full of wine and feminine charms is ready to embrace you for the brave men you are caballeros i have the honour to salute you there will be much dancing tonight in sulaco goodbye  but he reined in his horse and inclined his head sideways on seeing the old major step out very tall and meagre in a straight narrow coat coming down to his ankles as it were the casing of the regimental colours rolled round their staff  the intelligent old warrior after enunciating in a dogmatic tone the general proposition that the world was full of traitors went on pronouncing deliberately a panegyric upon sotillo he ascribed to him with leisurely emphasis every virtue under heaven summing it all up in an absurd colloquialism current amongst the lower class of occidentals especially about esmeralda and he concluded with a sudden rise in the voice a man of many teethhombre de muchos dientes si senor as to us he pursued portentous and impressive your worship is beholding the finest body of officers in the republic men unequalled for valour and sagacity y hombres de muchos dientes  what all of them inquired the disreputable envoy of senor fuentes with a faint derisive smile  todos si senor the major affirmed gravely with conviction men of many teeth  the other wheeled his horse to face the portal resembling the high gate of a dismal barn he raised himself in his stirrups extended one arm he was a facetious scoundrel entertaining for these stupid occidentals a feeling of great scorn natural in a native from the central provinces the folly of esmeraldians especially aroused his amused contempt he began an oration upon pedro montero keeping a solemn countenance he flourished his hand as if introducing him to their notice and when he saw every face set all the eyes fixed upon his lips he began to shout a sort of catalogue of perfections generous valorous affable profoundhe snatched off his hat enthusiasticallya statesman an invincible chief of partisans he dropped his voice startlingly to a deep hollow noteand a dentist  he was off instantly at a smart walk the rigid straddle of his legs the turnedout feet the stiff back the rakish slant of the sombrero above the square motionless set of the shoulders expressing an infinite aweinspiring impudence  upstairs behind the jalousies sotillo did not move for a long time the audacity of the fellow appalled him what were his officers saying below they were saying nothing complete silence he quaked it was not thus that he had imagined himself at that stage of the expedition he had seen himself triumphant unquestioned appeased the idol of the soldiers weighing in secret complacency the agreeable alternatives of power and wealth open to his choice alas how different distracted restless supine burning with fury or frozen with terror he felt a dread as fathomless as the sea creep upon him from every side that rogue of a doctor had to come out with his information that was clear it would be of no use to himalone he could do nothing with it malediction the doctor would never come out he was probably under arrest already shut up together with don carlos he laughed aloud insanely ha ha ha ha it was pedrito montero who would get the information ha ha ha haand the silver ha  all at once in the midst of the laugh he became motionless and silent as if turned into stone he too had a prisoner a prisoner who must must know the real truth he would have to be made to speak and sotillo who all that time had not quite forgotten hirsch felt an inexplicable reluctance at the notion of proceeding to extremities  he felt a reluctancepart of that unfathomable dread that crept on all sides upon him he remembered reluctantly too the dilated eyes of the hide merchant his contortions his loud sobs and protestations it was not compassion or even mere nervous sensibility the fact was that though sotillo did never for a moment believe his storyhe could not believe it nobody could believe such nonsenseyet those accents of despairing truth impressed him disagreeably they made him feel sick and he suspected also that the man might have gone mad with fear a lunatic is a hopeless subject bah a pretence nothing but a pretence he would know how to deal with that  he was working himself up to the right pitch of ferocity his fine eyes squinted slightly he clapped his hands a barefooted orderly appeared noiselessly a corporal with his bayonet hanging on his thigh and a stick in his hand  the colonel gave his orders and presently the miserable hirsch pushed in by several soldiers found him frowning awfully in a broad armchair hat on head knees wide apart arms akimbo masterful imposing irresistible haughty sublime terrible  hirsch with his arms tied behind his back had been bundled violently into one of the smaller rooms for many hours he remained apparently forgotten stretched lifelessly on the floor from that solitude full of despair and terror he was torn out brutally with kicks and blows passive sunk in hebetude he listened to threats and admonitions and afterwards made his usual answers to questions with his chin sunk on his breast his hands tied behind his back swaying a little in front of sotillo and never looking up when he was forced to hold up his head by means of a bayonetpoint prodding him under the chin his eyes had a vacant trancelike stare and drops of perspiration as big as peas were seen hailing down the dirt bruises and scratches of his white face then they stopped suddenly  sotillo looked at him in silence will you depart from your obstinacy you rogue he asked already a rope whose one end was fastened to senor hirschs wrists had been thrown over a beam and three soldiers held the other end waiting he made no answer his heavy lower lip hung stupidly sotillo made a sign hirsch was jerked up off his feet and a yell of despair and agony burst out in the room filled the passage of the great buildings rent the air outside caused every soldier of the camp along the shore to look up at the windows started some of the officers in the hall babbling excitedly with shining eyes others setting their lips looked gloomily at the floor  sotillo followed by the soldiers had left the room the sentry on the landing presented arms hirsch went on screaming all alone behind the halfclosed jalousies while the sunshine reflected from the water of the harbour made an everrunning ripple of light high up on the wall he screamed with uplifted eyebrows and a wideopen mouthincredibly wide black enormous full of teethcomical  in the still burning air of the windless afternoon he made the waves of his agony travel as far as the o s n companys offices captain mitchell on the balcony trying to make out what went on generally had heard him faintly but distinctly and the feeble and appalling sound lingered in his ears after he had retreated indoors with blanched cheeks he had been driven off the balcony several times during that afternoon  sotillo irritable moody walked restlessly about held consultations with his officers gave contradictory orders in this shrill clamour pervading the whole empty edifice sometimes there would be long and awful silences several times he had entered the torturechamber where his sword horsewhip revolver and fieldglass were lying on the table to ask with forced calmness will you speak the truth now no i can wait but he could not afford to wait much longer that was just it every time he went in and came out with a slam of the door the sentry on the landing presented arms and got in return a black venomous unsteady glance which in reality saw nothing at all being merely the reflection of the soul withina soul of gloomy hatred irresolution avarice and fury  the sun had set when he went in once more a soldier carried in two lighted candles and slunk out shutting the door without noise  speak thou jewish child of the devil the silver the silver i say where is it where have you foreign rogues hidden it confess or  a slight quiver passed up the taut rope from the racked limbs but the body of senor hirsch enterprising business man from esmeralda hung under the heavy beam perpendicular and silent facing the colonel awfully the inflow of the night air cooled by the snows of the sierra spread gradually a delicious freshness through the close heat of the room  speakthiefscoundrelpicaroor  sotillo had seized the ridingwhip and stood with his arm lifted up for a word for one little word he felt he would have knelt cringed grovelled on the floor before the drowsy conscious stare of those fixed eyeballs starting out of the grimy dishevelled head that drooped very still with its mouth closed askew the colonel ground his teeth with rage and struck the rope vibrated leisurely to the blow like the long string of a pendulum starting from a rest but no swinging motion was imparted to the body of senor hirsch the wellknown hide merchant on the coast with a convulsive effort of the twisted arms it leaped up a few inches curling upon itself like a fish on the end of a line senor hirschs head was flung back on his straining throat his chin trembled for a moment the rattle of his chattering teeth pervaded the vast shadowy room where the candles made a patch of light round the two flames burning side by side and as sotillo staying his raised hand waited for him to speak with the sudden flash of a grin and a straining forward of the wrenched shoulders he spat violently into his face  the uplifted whip fell and the colonel sprang back with a low cry of dismay as if aspersed by a jet of deadly venom quick as thought he snatched up his revolver and fired twice the report and the concussion of the shots seemed to throw him at once from ungovernable rage into idiotic stupor he stood with drooping jaw and stony eyes what had he done sangre de dios what had he done he was basely appalled at his impulsive act sealing for ever these lips from which so much was to be extorted what could he say how could he explain ideas of headlong flight somewhere anywhere passed through his mind even the craven and absurd notion of hiding under the table occurred to his cowardice it was too late his officers had rushed in tumultuously in a great clatter of scabbards clamouring with astonishment and wonder but since they did not immediately proceed to plunge their swords into his breast the brazen side of his character asserted itself passing the sleeve of his uniform over his face he pulled himself together his truculent glance turned slowly here and there checked the noise where it fell and the stiff body of the late senor hirsch merchant after swaying imperceptibly made a half turn and came to a rest in the midst of awed murmurs and uneasy shuffling  a voice remarked loudly behold a man who will never speak again and another from the back row of faces timid and pressing cried out  why did you kill him mi colonel  because he has confessed everything answered sotillo with the hardihood of desperation he felt himself cornered he brazened it out on the strength of his reputation with very fair success his hearers thought him very capable of such an act they were disposed to believe his flattering tale there is no credulity so eager and blind as the credulity of covetousness which in its universal extent measures the moral misery and the intellectual destitution of mankind ah he had confessed everything this fractious jew this bribon good then he was no longer wanted a sudden dense guffaw was heard from the senior captaina bigheaded man with little round eyes and monstrously fat cheeks which never moved the old major tall and fantastically ragged like a scarecrow walked round the body of the late senor hirsch muttering to himself with ineffable complacency that like this there was no need to guard against any future treacheries of that scoundrel the others stared shifting from foot to foot and whispering short remarks to each other  sotillo buckled on his sword and gave curt peremptory orders to hasten the retirement decided upon in the afternoon sinister impressive his sombrero pulled right down upon his eyebrows he marched first through the door in such disorder of mind that he forgot utterly to provide for dr monyghams possible return as the officers trooped out after him one or two looked back hastily at the late senor hirsch merchant from esmeralda left swinging rigidly at rest alone with the two burning candles in the emptiness of the room the burly shadow of head and shoulders on the wall had an air of life  below the troops fell in silently and moved off by companies without drum or trumpet the old scarecrow major commanded the rearguard but the party he left behind with orders to fire the custom house and burn the carcass of the treacherous jew where it hung failed somehow in their haste to set the staircase properly alight the body of the late senor hirsch dwelt alone for a time in the dismal solitude of the unfinished building resounding weirdly with sudden slams and clicks of doors and latches with rustling scurries of torn papers and the tremulous sighs that at each gust of wind passed under the high roof the light of the two candles burning before the perpendicular and breathless immobility of the late senor hirsch threw a gleam afar over land and water like a signal in the night he remained to startle nostromo by his presence and to puzzle dr monygham by the mystery of his atrocious end  but why shot the doctor again asked himself audibly this time he was answered by a dry laugh from nostromo  you seem much concerned at a very natural thing senor doctor i wonder why it is very likely that before long we shall all get shot one after another if not by sotillo then by pedrito or fuentes or gamacho and we may even get the estrapade too or worsequien sabewith your pretty tale of the silver you put into sotillos head  it was in his head already the doctor protested i only  yes and you only nailed it there so that the devil himself  that is precisely what i meant to do caught up the doctor  that is what you meant to do bueno it is as i say you are a dangerous man  their voices which without rising had been growing quarrelsome ceased suddenly the late senor hirsch erect and shadowy against the stars seemed to be waiting attentive in impartial silence  but dr monygham had no mind to quarrel with nostromo at this supremely critical point of sulacos fortunes it was borne upon him at last that this man was really indispensable more indispensable than ever the infatuation of captain mitchell his proud discoverer could conceive far beyond what decouds best dry raillery about my illustrious friend the unique capataz de cargadores had ever intended the fellow was unique he was not one in a thousand he was absolutely the only one the doctor surrendered there was something in the genius of that genoese seaman which dominated the destinies of great enterprises and of many people the fortunes of charles gould the fate of an admirable woman at this last thought the doctor had to clear his throat before he could speak  in a completely changed tone he pointed out to the capataz that to begin with he personally ran no great risk as far as everybody knew he was dead it was an enormous advantage he had only to keep out of sight in the casa viola where the old garibaldino was known to be alonewith his dead wife the servants had all run away no one would think of searching for him there or anywhere else on earth for that matter  that would be very true nostromo spoke up bitterly if i had not met you  for a time the doctor kept silent do you mean to say that you think i may give you away he asked in an unsteady voice why why should i do that  what do i know why not to gain a day perhaps it would take sotillo a day to give me the estrapade and try some other things perhaps before he puts a bullet through my heartas he did to that poor wretch here why not  the doctor swallowed with difficulty his throat had gone dry in a moment it was not from indignation the doctor pathetically enough believed that he had forfeited the right to be indignant with any onefor anything it was simple dread had the fellow heard his story by some chance if so there was an end of his usefulness in that direction the indispensable man escaped his influence because of that indelible blot which made him fit for dirty work a feeling as of sickness came upon the doctor he would have given anything to know but he dared not clear up the point the fanaticism of his devotion fed on the sense of his abasement hardened his heart in sadness and scorn  why not indeed he reechoed sardonically then the safe thing for you is to kill me on the spot i would defend myself but you may just as well know i am going about unarmed  por dios said the capataz passionately you fine people are all alike all dangerous all betrayers of the poor who are your dogs  you do not understand began the doctor slowly  i understand you all cried the other with a violent movement as shadowy to the doctors eyes as the persistent immobility of the late senor hirsch a poor man amongst you has got to look after himself i say that you do not care for those that serve you look at me after all these years suddenly here i find myself like one of these curs that bark outside the wallswithout a kennel or a dry bone for my teeth caramba but he relented with a contemptuous fairness of course he went on quietly i do not suppose that you would hasten to give me up to sotillo for example it is not that it is that i am nothing suddenly he swung his arm downwards nothing to any one he repeated  the doctor breathed freely listen capataz he said stretching out his arm almost affectionately towards nostromos shoulder i am going to tell you a very simple thing you are safe because you are needed i would not give you away for any conceivable reason because i want you  in the dark nostromo bit his lip he had heard enough of that he knew what that meant no more of that for him but he had to look after himself now he thought and he thought too that it would not be prudent to part in anger from his companion the doctor admitted to be a great healer had amongst the populace of sulaco the reputation of being an evil sort of man it was based solidly on his personal appearance which was strange and on his rough ironic mannerproofs visible sensible and incontrovertible of the doctors malevolent disposition and nostromo was of the people so he only grunted incredulously  you to speak plainly are the only man the doctor pursued it is in your power to save this town and    everybody from the destructive rapacity of men who  no senor said nostromo sullenly it is not in my power to get the treasure back for you to give up to sotillo or pedrito or gamacho what do i know  nobody expects the impossible was the answer  you have said it yourselfnobody muttered nostromo in a gloomy threatening tone  but dr monygham full of hope disregarded the enigmatic words and the threatening tone to their eyes accustomed to obscurity the late senor hirsch growing more distinct seemed to have come nearer and the doctor lowered his voice in exposing his scheme as though afraid of being overheard  he was taking the indispensable man into his fullest confidence its implied flattery and suggestion of great risks came with a familiar sound to the capataz his mind floating in irresolution and discontent recognized it with bitterness he understood well that the doctor was anxious to save the san tome mine from annihilation he would be nothing without it it was his interest just as it had been the interest of senor decoud of the blancos and of the europeans to get his cargadores on their side his thought became arrested upon decoud what would happen to him  nostromos prolonged silence made the doctor uneasy he pointed out quite unnecessarily that though for the present he was safe he could not live concealed for ever the choice was between accepting the mission to barrios with all its dangers and difficulties and leaving sulaco by stealth ingloriously in poverty  none of your friends could reward you and protect you just now capataz not even don carlos himself  i would have none of your protection and none of your rewards i only wish i could trust your courage and your sense when i return in triumph as you say with barrios i may find you all destroyed you have the knife at your throat now  it was the doctors turn to remain silent in the contemplation of horrible contingencies  well we would trust your courage and your sense and you too have a knife at your throat  ah and whom am i to thank for that what are your politics and your mines to meyour silver and your constitutionsyour don carlos this and don jose that  i dont know burst out the exasperated doctor there are innocent people in danger whose little finger is worth more than you or i and all the ribierists together i dont know you should have asked yourself before you allowed decoud to lead you into all this it was your place to think like a man but if you did not think then try to act like a man now did you imagine decoud cared very much for what would happen to you  no more than you care for what will happen to me muttered the other  no i care for what will happen to you as little as i care for what will happen to myself  and all this because you are such a devoted ribierist nostromo said in an incredulous tone  all this because i am such a devoted ribierist repeated dr monygham grimly  again nostromo gazing abstractedly at the body of the late senor hirsch remained silent thinking that the doctor was a dangerous person in more than one sense it was impossible to trust him  do you speak in the name of don carlos he asked at last  yes i do the doctor said loudly without hesitation he must come forward now he must he added in a mutter which nostromo did not catch  what did you say senor  the doctor started i say that you must be true to yourself capataz it would be worse than folly to fail now  true to myself repeated nostromo how do you know that i would not be true to myself if i told you to go to the devil with your propositions  i do not know maybe you would the doctor said with a roughness of tone intended to hide the sinking of his heart and the faltering of his voice all i know is that you had better get away from here some of sotillos men may turn up here looking for me  he slipped off the table listening intently the capataz too stood up  suppose i went to cayta what would you do meantime he asked  i would go to sotillo directly you had leftin the way i am thinking of  a very good wayif only that engineerinchief consents remind him senor that i looked after the old rich englishman who pays for the railway and that i saved the lives of some of his people that time when a gang of thieves came from the south to wreck one of his paytrains it was i who discovered it all at the risk of my life by pretending to enter into their plans just as you are doing with sotillo  yes yes of course but i can offer him better arguments the doctor said hastily leave it to me  ah yes true i am nothing  not at all you are everything  they moved a few paces towards the door behind them the late senor hirsch preserved the immobility of a disregarded man  that will be all right i know what to say to the engineer pursued the doctor in a low tone my difficulty will be with sotillo  and dr monygham stopped short in the doorway as if intimidated by the difficulty he had made the sacrifice of his life he considered this a fitting opportunity but he did not want to throw his life away too soon in his quality of betrayer of don carlos confidence he would have ultimately to indicate the hidingplace of the treasure that would be the end of his deception and the end of himself as well at the hands of the infuriated colonel he wanted to delay him to the very last moment and he had been racking his brains to invent some place of concealment at once plausible and difficult of access  he imparted his trouble to nostromo and concluded  do you know what capataz i think that when the time comes and some information must be given i shall indicate the great isabel that is the best place i can think of what is the matter  a low exclamation had escaped nostromo the doctor waited surprised and after a moment of profound silence heard a thick voice stammer out utter folly and stop with a gasp  why folly  ah you do not see it began nostromo scathingly gathering scorn as he went on three men in half an hour would see that no ground had been disturbed anywhere on that island do you think that such a treasure can be buried without leaving traces of the workeh senor doctor why you would not gain half a day more before having your throat cut by sotillo the isabel what stupidity what miserable invention ah you are all alike you fine men of intelligence all you are fit for is to betray men of the people into undertaking deadly risks for objects that you are not even sure about if it comes off you get the benefit if not then it does not matter he is only a dog ah madre de dios i would he shook his fists above his head  the doctor was overwhelmed at first by this fierce hissing vehemence  well it seems to me on your own showing that the men of the people are no mean fools too he said sullenly no but come you are so clever have you a better place  nostromo had calmed down as quickly as he had flared up  i am clever enough for that he said quietly almost with indifference you want to tell him of a hidingplace big enough to take days in ransackinga place where a treasure of silver ingots can be buried without leaving a sign on the surface  and close at hand the doctor put in  just so senor tell him it is sunk  this has the merit of being the truth the doctor said contemptuously he will not believe it  you tell him that it is sunk where he may hope to lay his hands on it and he will believe you quick enough tell him it has been sunk in the harbour in order to be recovered afterwards by divers tell him you found out that i had orders from don carlos gould to lower the cases quietly overboard somewhere in a line between the end of the jetty and the entrance the depth is not too great there he has no divers but he has a ship boats ropes chains sailorsof a sort let him fish for the silver let him set his fools to drag backwards and forwards and crossways while he sits and watches till his eyes drop out of his head  really this is an admirable idea muttered the doctor  si you tell him that and see whether he will not believe you he will spend days in rage and tormentand still he will believe he will have no thought for anything else he will not give up till he is driven offwhy he may even forget to kill you he will neither eat nor sleep he  the very thing the very thing the doctor repeated in an excited whisper capataz i begin to believe that you are a great genius in your way  nostromo had paused then began again in a changed tone sombre speaking to himself as though he had forgotten the doctors existence  there is something in a treasure that fastens upon a mans mind he will pray and blaspheme and still persevere and will curse the day he ever heard of it and will let his last hour come upon him unawares still believing that he missed it only by a foot he will see it every time he closes his eyes he will never forget it till he is deadand even thendoctor did you ever hear of the miserable gringos on azuera that cannot die ha ha sailors like myself there is no getting away from a treasure that once fastens upon your mind  you are a devil of a man capataz it is the most plausible thing  nostromo pressed his arm  it will be worse for him than thirst at sea or hunger in a town full of people do you know what that is he shall suffer greater torments than he inflicted upon that terrified wretch who had no invention none none not like me i could have told sotillo a deadly tale for very little pain  he laughed wildly and turned in the doorway towards the body of the late senor hirsch an opaque long blotch in the semitransparent obscurity of the room between the two tall parallelograms of the windows full of stars  you man of fear he cried you shall be avenged by menostromo out of my way doctor stand asideor by the suffering soul of a woman dead without confession i will strangle you with my two hands  he bounded downwards into the black smoky hall with a grunt of astonishment dr monygham threw himself recklessly into the pursuit at the bottom of the charred stairs he had a fall pitching forward on his face with a force that would have stunned a spirit less intent upon a task of love and devotion he was up in a moment jarred shaken with a queer impression of the terrestrial globe having been flung at his head in the dark but it wanted more than that to stop dr monyghams body possessed by the exaltation of selfsacrifice a reasonable exaltation determined not to lose whatever advantage chance put into its way he ran with headlong tottering swiftness his arms going like a windmill in his effort to keep his balance on his crippled feet he lost his hat the tails of his open gaberdine flew behind him he had no mind to lose sight of the indispensable man but it was a long time and a long way from the custom house before he managed to seize his arm from behind roughly out of breath  stop are you mad  already nostromo was walking slowly his head dropping as if checked in his pace by the weariness of irresolution  what is that to you ah i forgot you want me for something always siempre nostromo  what do you mean by talking of strangling me panted the doctor  what do i mean i mean that the king of the devils himself has sent you out of this town of cowards and talkers to meet me tonight of all the nights of my life  under the starry sky the albergo dltalia una emerged black and low breaking the dark level of the plain nostromo stopped altogether  the priests say he is a tempter do they not he added through his clenched teeth  my good man you drivel the devil has nothing to do with this neither has the town which you may call by what name you please but don carlos gould is neither a coward nor an empty talker you will admit that he waited well  could i see don carlos  great heavens no why what for exclaimed the doctor in agitation i tell you it is madness i will not let you go into the town for anything  i must  you must not hissed the doctor fiercely almost beside himself with the fear of the man doing away with his usefulness for an imbecile whim of some sort i tell you you shall not i would rather  he stopped at loss for words feeling fagged out powerless holding on to nostromos sleeve absolutely for support after his run  i am betrayed muttered the capataz to himself and the doctor who overheard the last word made an effort to speak calmly  that is exactly what would happen to you you would be betrayed  he thought with a sickening dread that the man was so well known that he could not escape recognition the house of the senor administrador was beset by spies no doubt and even the very servants of the casa were not to be trusted reflect capataz he said impressively    what are you laughing at  i am laughing to think that if somebody that did not approve of my presence in town for instanceyou understand senor doctorif somebody were to give me up to pedrito it would not be beyond my power to make friends even with him it is true what do you think of that  you are a man of infinite resource capataz said dr monygham dismally i recognize that but the town is full of talk about you and those few cargadores that are not in hiding with the railway people have been shouting viva montero on the plaza all day  my poor cargadores muttered nostromo betrayed betrayed  i understand that on the wharf you were pretty free in laying about you with a stick amongst your poor cargadores the doctor said in a grim tone which showed that he was recovering from his exertions make no mistake pedrito is furious at senor ribieras rescue and at having lost the pleasure of shooting decoud already there are rumours in the town of the treasure having been spirited away to have missed that does not please pedrito either but let me tell you that if you had all that silver in your hand for ransom it would not save you  turning swiftly and catching the doctor by the shoulders nostromo thrust his face close to his  maladetta you follow me speaking of the treasure you have sworn my ruin you were the last man who looked upon me before i went out with it and sidoni the enginedriver says you have an evil eye  he ought to know i saved his broken leg for him last year the doctor said stoically he felt on his shoulders the weight of these hands famed amongst the populace for snapping thick ropes and bending horseshoes and to you i offer the best means of saving yourselflet me goand of retrieving your great reputation you boasted of making the capataz de cargadores famous from one end of america to the other about this wretched silver but i bring you a better opportunitylet me go hombre  nostromo released him abruptly and the doctor feared that the indispensable man would run off again but he did not he walked on slowly the doctor hobbled by his side till within a stones throw from the casa viola nostromo stopped again  silent in inhospitable darkness the casa viola seemed to have changed its nature his home appeared to repel him with an air of hopeless and inimical mystery the doctor said  you will be safe there go in capataz  how can i go in nostromo seemed to ask himself in a low inward tone she cannot unsay what she said and i cannot undo what i have done  i tell you it is all right viola is all alone in there i looked in as i came out of the town you will be perfectly safe in that house till you leave it to make your name famous on the campo i am going now to arrange for your departure with the engineerinchief and i shall bring you news here long before daybreak  dr monygham disregarding or perhaps fearing to penetrate the meaning of nostromos silence clapped him lightly on the shoulder and starting off with his smart lame walk vanished utterly at the third or fourth hop in the direction of the railway track arrested between the two wooden posts for people to fasten their horses to nostromo did not move as if he too had been planted solidly in the ground at the end of half an hour he lifted his head to the deep baying of the dogs at the railway yards which had burst out suddenly tumultuous and deadened as if coming from under the plain that lame doctor with the evil eye had got there pretty fast  step by step nostromo approached the albergo ditalia una which he had never known so lightless so silent before the door all black in the pale wall stood open as he had left it twentyfour hours before when he had nothing to hide from the world he remained before it irresolute like a fugitive like a man betrayed poverty misery starvation where had he heard these words the anger of a dying woman had prophesied that fate for his folly it looked as if it would come true very quickly and the leperos would laughshe had said yes they would laugh if they knew that the capataz de cargadores was at the mercy of the mad doctor whom they could remember only a few years ago buying cooked food from a stall on the plaza for a copper coinlike one of themselves  at that moment the notion of seeking captain mitchell passed through his mind he glanced in the direction of the jetty and saw a small gleam of light in the osn companys building the thought of lighted windows was not attractive two lighted windows had decoyed him into the empty custom house only to fall into the clutches of that doctor no he would not go near lighted windows again on that night captain mitchell was there and what could he be told that doctor would worm it all out of him as if he were a child  on the threshold he called out giorgio in an undertone nobody answered he stepped in ola viejo are you there    in the impenetrable darkness his head swam with the illusion that the obscurity of the kitchen was as vast as the placid gulf and that the floor dipped forward like a sinking lighter ola viejo he repeated falteringly swaying where he stood his hand extended to steady himself fell upon the table moving a step forward he shifted it and felt a box of matches under his fingers he fancied he had heard a quiet sigh he listened for a moment holding his breath then with trembling hands tried to strike a light  the tiny piece of wood flamed up quite blindingly at the end of his fingers raised above his blinking eyes a concentrated glare fell upon the leonine white head of old giorgio against the black fireplaceshowed him leaning forward in a chair in staring immobility surrounded overhung by great masses of shadow his legs crossed his cheek in his hand an empty pipe in the corner of his mouth it seemed hours before he attempted to turn his face at the very moment the match went out and he disappeared overwhelmed by the shadows as if the walls and roof of the desolate house had collapsed upon his white head in ghostly silence  nostromo heard him stir and utter dispassionately the words  it may have been a vision  no he said softly it is no vision old man  a strong chest voice asked in the dark  is that you i hear giovann battista  si viejo steady not so loud  after his release by sotillo giorgio viola attended to the very door by the goodnatured engineerinchief had reentered his house which he had been made to leave almost at the very moment of his wifes death all was still the lamp above was burning he nearly called out to her by name and the thought that no call from him would ever again evoke the answer of her voice made him drop heavily into the chair with a loud groan wrung out by the pain as of a keen blade piercing his breast  the rest of the night he made no sound the darkness turned to grey and on the colourless clear glassy dawn the jagged sierra stood out flat and opaque as if cut out of paper  the enthusiastic and severe soul of giorgio viola sailor champion of oppressed humanity enemy of kings and by the grace of mrs gould hotelkeeper of the sulaco harbour had descended into the open abyss of desolation amongst the shattered vestiges of his past he remembered his wooing between two campaigns a single short week in the season of gathering olives nothing approached the grave passion of that time but the deep passionate sense of his bereavement he discovered all the extent of his dependence upon the silenced voice of that woman it was her voice that he missed abstracted busy lost in inward contemplation he seldom looked at his wife in those later years the thought of his girls was a matter of concern not of consolation it was her voice that he would miss and he remembered the other childthe little boy who died at sea ah a man would have been something to lean upon and alas even gian battistahe of whom and of linda his wife had spoken to him so anxiously before she dropped off into her last sleep on earth he on whom she had called aloud to save the children just before she diedeven he was dead  and the old man bent forward his head in his hand sat through the day in immobility and solitude he never heard the brazen roar of the bells in town when it ceased the earthenware filter in the corner of the kitchen kept on its swift musical drip drip into the great porous jar below  towards sunset he got up and with slow movements disappeared up the narrow staircase his bulk filled it and the rubbing of his shoulders made a small noise as of a mouse running behind the plaster of a wall while he remained up there the house was as dumb as a grave then with the same faint rubbing noise he descended he had to catch at the chairs and tables to regain his seat he seized his pipe off the high mantel of the fireplacebut made no attempt to reach the tobaccothrust it empty into the corner of his mouth and sat down again in the same staring pose the sun of pedritos entry into sulaco the last sun of senor hirschs life the first of decouds solitude on the great isabel passed over the albergo dltalia una on its way to the west the tinkling drip drip of the filter had ceased the lamp upstairs had burnt itself out and the night beset giorgio viola and his dead wife with its obscurity and silence that seemed invincible till the capataz de cargadores returning from the dead put them to flight with the splutter and flare of a match  si viejo it is me wait  nostromo after barricading the door and closing the shutters carefully groped upon a shelf for a candle and lit it  old viola had risen he followed with his eyes in the dark the sounds made by nostromo the light disclosed him standing without support as if the mere presence of that man who was loyal brave incorruptible who was all his son would have been were enough for the support of his decaying strength  he extended his hand grasping the briarwood pipe whose bowl was charred on the edge and knitted his bushy eyebrows heavily at the light  you have returned he said with shaky dignity ah very well i  he broke off nostromo leaning back against the table his arms folded on his breast nodded at him slightly  you thought i was drowned no the best dog of the rich of the aristocrats of these fine men who can only talk and betray the people is not dead yet  the garibaldino motionless seemed to drink in the sound of the wellknown voice his head moved slightly once as if in sign of approval but nostromo saw clearly that the old man understood nothing of the words there was no one to understand no one he could take into the confidence of decouds fate of his own into the secret of the silver that doctor was an enemy of the peoplea tempter     old giorgios heavy frame shook from head to foot with the effort to overcome his emotion at the sight of that man who had shared the intimacies of his domestic life as though he had been a grownup son  she believed you would return he said solemnly  nostromo raised his head  she was a wise woman how could i fail to come back  he finished the thought mentally since she has prophesied for me an end of poverty misery and starvation these words of teresas anger from the circumstances in which they had been uttered like the cry of a soul prevented from making its peace with god stirred the obscure superstition of personal fortune from which even the greatest genius amongst men of adventure and action is seldom free they reigned over nostromos mind with the force of a potent malediction and what a curse it was that which her words had laid upon him he had been orphaned so young that he could remember no other woman whom he called mother henceforth there would be no enterprise in which he would not fail the spell was working already death itself would elude him now    he said violently  come viejo get me something to eat i am hungry sangre de dios the emptiness of my belly makes me lightheaded  with his chin dropped again upon his bare breast above his folded arms barefooted watching from under a gloomy brow the movements of old viola foraging amongst the cupboards he seemed as if indeed fallen under a cursea ruined and sinister capataz  old viola walked out of a dark corner and without a word emptied upon the table out of his hollowed palms a few dry crusts of bread and half a raw onion  while the capataz began to devour this beggars fare taking up with stonyeyed voracity piece after piece lying by his side the garibaldino went off and squatting down in another corner filled an earthenware mug with red wine out of a wickercovered demijohn with a familiar gesture as when serving customers in the cafe he had thrust his pipe between his teeth to have his hands free  the capataz drank greedily a slight flush deepened the bronze of his cheek before him viola with a turn of his white and massive head towards the staircase took his empty pipe out of his mouth and pronounced slowly  after the shot was fired down here which killed her as surely as if the bullet had struck her oppressed heart she called upon you to save the children upon you gian battista  the capataz looked up  did she do that padrone to save the children they are with the english senora their rich benefactress hey old man of the people thy benefactress     i am old muttered giorgio viola an englishwoman was allowed to give a bed to garibaldi lying wounded in prison the greatest man that ever lived a man of the people tooa sailor i may let another keep a roof over my head si    i am old i may let her life lasts too long sometimes  and she herself may not have a roof over her head before many days are out unless i    what do you say am i to keep a roof over her head am i to tryand save all the blancos together with her  you shall do it said old viola in a strong voice you shall do it as my son would have     thy son viejo   there never has been a man like thy son ha i must try    but what if it were only a part of the curse to lure me on    and so she called upon me to saveand then  she spoke no more the heroic follower of garibaldi at the thought of the eternal stillness and silence fallen upon the shrouded form stretched out on the bed upstairs averted his face and raised his hand to his furrowed brow she was dead before i could seize her hands he stammered out pitifully  before the wide eyes of the capataz staring at the doorway of the dark staircase floated the shape of the great isabel like a strange ship in distress freighted with enormous wealth and the solitary life of a man it was impossible for him to do anything he could only hold his tongue since there was no one to trust the treasure would be lost probablyunless decoud    and his thought came abruptly to an end he perceived that he could not imagine in the least what decoud was likely to do  old viola had not stirred and the motionless capataz dropped his long soft eyelashes which gave to the upper part of his fierce blackwhiskered face a touch of feminine ingenuousness the silence had lasted for a long time  god rest her soul he murmured gloomily    chapter ten  the next day was quiet in the morning except for the faint sound of firing to the northward in the direction of los hatos captain mitchell had listened to it from his balcony anxiously the phrase in my delicate position as the only consular agent then in the port everything sir everything was a just cause for anxiety had its place in the more or less stereotyped relation of the historical events which for the next few years was at the service of distinguished strangers visiting sulaco the mention of the dignity and neutrality of the flag so difficult to preserve in his position right in the thick of these events between the lawlessness of that piratical villain sotillo and the more regularly established but scarcely less atrocious tyranny of his excellency don pedro montero came next in order captain mitchell was not the man to enlarge upon mere dangers much but he insisted that it was a memorable day on that day towards dusk he had seen that poor fellow of minenostromo the sailor whom i discovered and i may say made sir the man of the famous ride to cayta sir an historical event sir  regarded by the o s n company as an old and faithful servant captain mitchell was allowed to attain the term of his usefulness in ease and dignity at the head of the enormously extended service the augmentation of the establishment with its crowds of clerks an office in town the old office in the harbour the division into departmentspassenger cargo lighterage and so onsecured a greater leisure for his last years in the regenerated sulaco the capital of the occidental republic liked by the natives for his good nature and the formality of his manner selfimportant and simple known for years as a friend of our country he felt himself a personality of mark in the town getting up early for a turn in the marketplace while the gigantic shadow of higuerota was still lying upon the fruit and flower stalls piled up with masses of gorgeous colouring attending easily to current affairs welcomed in houses greeted by ladies on the alameda with his entry into all the clubs and a footing in the casa gould he led his privileged old bachelor manabouttown existence with great comfort and solemnity but on mailboat days he was down at the harbour office at an early hour with his own gig manned by a smart crew in white and blue ready to dash off and board the ship directly she showed her bows between the harbour heads  it would be into the harbour office that he would lead some privileged passenger he had brought off in his own boat and invite him to take a seat for a moment while he signed a few papers and captain mitchell seating himself at his desk would keep on talking hospitably  there isnt much time if you are to see everything in a day we shall be off in a moment well have lunch at the amarilla clubthough i belong also to the angloamericanmining engineers and business men dont you knowand to the mirliflores as well a new clubenglish french italians all sortslively young fellows mostly who wanted to pay a compliment to an old resident sir but well lunch at the amarilla interest you i fancy real thing of the country men of the first families the president of the occidental republic himself belongs to it sir fine old bishop with a broken nose in the patio remarkable piece of statuary i believe cavaliere parrochettiyou know parrochetti the famous italian sculptorwas working here for two yearsthought very highly of our old bishop    there i am very much at your service now  proud of his experience penetrated by the sense of historical importance of men events and buildings he talked pompously in jerky periods with slight sweeps of his short thick arm letting nothing escape the attention of his privileged captive  lot of building going on as you observe before the separation it was a plain of burnt grass smothered in clouds of dust with an oxcart track to our jetty nothing more this is the harbour gate picturesque is it not formerly the town stopped short there we enter now the calle de la constitucion observe the old spanish houses great dignity eh i suppose its just as it was in the time of the viceroys except for the pavement wood blocks now sulaco national bank there with the sentry boxes each side of the gate casa avellanos this side with all the groundfloor windows shuttered a wonderful woman lives theremiss avellanosthe beautiful antonia a character sir a historical woman oppositecasa gould noble gateway yes the goulds of the original gould concession that all the world knows of now i hold seventeen of the thousanddollar shares in the consolidated san tome mines all the poor savings of my lifetime sir and it will be enough to keep me in comfort to the end of my days at home when i retire i got in on the groundfloor you see don carlos great friend of mine seventeen sharesquite a little fortune to leave behind one too i have a niecemarried a parsonmost worthy man incumbent of a small parish in sussex no end of children i was never married myself a sailor should exercise selfdenial standing under that very gateway sir with some young engineerfellows ready to defend that house where we had received so much kindness and hospitality i saw the first and last charge of pedritos horsemen upon barrioss troops who had just taken the harbour gate they could not stand the new rifles brought out by that poor decoud it was a murderous fire in a moment the street became blocked with a mass of dead men and horses they never came on again  and all day captain mitchell would talk like this to his more or less willing victim  the plaza i call it magnificent twice the area of trafalgar square  from the very centre in the blazing sunshine he pointed out the buildings  the intendencia now presidents palacecabildo where the lower chamber of parliament sits you notice the new houses on that side of the plaza compania anzani a great general store like those cooperative things at home old anzani was murdered by the national guards in front of his safe it was even for that specific crime that the deputy gamacho commanding the nationals a bloodthirsty and savage brute was executed publicly by garrotte upon the sentence of a courtmartial ordered by barrios anzanis nephews converted the business into a company all that side of the plaza had been burnt used to be colonnaded before a terrible fire by the light of which i saw the last of the fighting the llaneros flying the nationals throwing their arms down and the miners of san tome all indians from the sierra rolling by like a torrent to the sound of pipes and cymbals green flags flying a wild mass of men in white ponchos and green hats on foot on mules on donkeys such a sight sir will never be seen again the miners sir had marched upon the town don pepe leading on his black horse and their very wives in the rear on burros screaming encouragement sir and beating tambourines i remember one of these women had a green parrot seated on her shoulder as calm as a bird of stone they had just saved their senor administrador for barrios though he ordered the assault at once at night too would have been too late pedrito montero had don carlos led out to be shotlike his uncle many years agoand then as barrios said afterwards sulaco would not have been worth fighting for sulaco without the concession was nothing and there were tons and tons of dynamite distributed all over the mountain with detonators arranged and an old priest father roman standing by to annihilate the san tome mine at the first news of failure don carlos had made up his mind not to leave it behind and he had the right men to see to it too  thus captain mitchell would talk in the middle of the plaza holding over his head a white umbrella with a green lining but inside the cathedral in the dim light with a faint scent of incense floating in the cool atmosphere and here and there a kneeling female figure black or all white with a veiled head his lowered voice became solemn and impressive  here he would say pointing to a niche in the wall of the dusky aisle you see the bust of don jose avellanos patriot and statesman as the inscription says minister to courts of england and spain etc etc died in the woods of los hatos worn out with his lifelong struggle for right and justice at the dawn of the new era a fair likeness parrochettis work from some old photographs and a pencil sketch by mrs gould i was well acquainted with that distinguished spanishamerican of the old school a true hidalgo beloved by everybody who knew him the marble medallion in the wall in the antique style representing a veiled woman seated with her hands clasped loosely over her knees commemorates that unfortunate young gentleman who sailed out with nostromo on that fatal night sir see to the memory of martin decoud his betrothed antonia avellanos frank simple noble there you have that lady sir as she is an exceptional woman those who thought she would give way to despair were mistaken sir she has been blamed in many quarters for not having taken the veil it was expected of her but dona antonia is not the stuff they make nuns of bishop corbelan her uncle lives with her in the corbelan town house he is a fierce sort of priest everlastingly worrying the government about the old church lands and convents i believe they think a lot of him in rome now let us go to the amarilla club just across the plaza to get some lunch  directly outside the cathedral on the very top of the noble flight of steps his voice rose pompously his arm found again its sweeping gesture  porvenir over there on that first floor above those french plateglass shopfronts our biggest daily conservative or rather i should say parliamentary we have the parliamentary party here of which the actual chief of the state don juste lopez is the head a very sagacious man i think a firstrate intellect sir the democratic party in opposition rests mostly i am sorry to say on these socialistic italians sir with their secret societies camorras and suchlike there are lots of italians settled here on the railway lands dismissed navvies mechanics and so on all along the trunk line there are whole villages of italians on the campo and the natives too are being drawn into these ways    american bar yes and over there you can see another new yorkers mostly frequent that onehere we are at the amarilla observe the bishop at the foot of the stairs to the right as we go in  and the lunch would begin and terminate its lavish and leisurely course at a little table in the gallery captain mitchell nodding bowing getting up to speak for a moment to different officials in black clothes merchants in jackets officers in uniform middleaged caballeros from the camposallow little nervous men and fat placid swarthy men and europeans or north americans of superior standing whose faces looked very white amongst the majority of dark complexions and black glistening eyes  captain mitchell would lie back in the chair casting around looks of satisfaction and tender over the table a case full of thick cigars  try a weed with your coffee local tobacco the black coffee you get at the amarilla sir you dont meet anywhere in the world we get the bean from a famous cafeteria in the foothills whose owner sends three sacks every year as a present to his fellow members in remembrance of the fight against gamachos nationals carried on from these very windows by the caballeros he was in town at the time and took part sir to the bitter end it arrives on three mulesnot in the common way by rail no fearright into the patio escorted by mounted peons in charge of the mayoral of his estate who walks upstairs booted and spurred and delivers it to our committee formally with the words for the sake of those fallen on the third of may we call it tres de mayo coffee taste it  captain mitchell with an expression as though making ready to hear a sermon in a church would lift the tiny cup to his lips and the nectar would be sipped to the bottom during a restful silence in a cloud of cigar smoke  look at this man in black just going out he would begin leaning forward hastily this is the famous hernandez minister of war the times special correspondent who wrote that striking series of letters calling the occidental republic the treasure house of the world gave a whole article to him and the force he has organizedthe renowned carabineers of the campo  captain mitchells guest staring curiously would see a figure in a longtailed black coat walking gravely with downcast eyelids in a long composed face a brow furrowed horizontally a pointed head whose grey hair thin at the top combed down carefully on all sides and rolled at the ends fell low on the neck and shoulders this then was the famous bandit of whom europe had heard with interest he put on a highcrowned sombrero with a wide flat brim a rosary of wooden beads was twisted about his right wrist and captain mitchell would proceed  the protector of the sulaco refugees from the rage of pedrito as general of cavalry with barrios he distinguished himself at the storming of tonoro where senor fuentes was killed with the last remnant of the monterists he is the friend and humble servant of bishop corbelan hears three masses every day i bet you he will step into the cathedral to say a prayer or two on his way home to his siesta  he took several puffs at his cigar in silence then in his most important manner pronounced  the spanish race sir is prolific of remarkable characters in every rank of life    i propose we go now into the billiardroom which is cool for a quiet chat theres never anybody there till after five i could tell you episodes of the separationist revolution that would astonish you when the great heats over well take a turn on the alameda  the programme went on relentless like a law of nature the turn on the alameda was taken with slow steps and stately remarks  all the great world of sulaco here sir captain mitchell bowed right and left with no end of formality then with animation dona emilia mrs goulds carriage look always white mules the kindest most gracious woman the sun ever shone upon a great position sir a great position first lady in sulacofar before the presidents wife and worthy of it he took off his hat then with a studied change of tone added negligently that the man in black by her side with a high white collar and a scarred snarly face was dr monygham inspector of state hospitals chief medical officer of the consolidated san tome mines a familiar of the house everlastingly there no wonder the goulds made him very clever man and all that but i never liked him nobody does i can recollect him limping about the streets in a check shirt and native sandals with a watermelon under his armall he would get to eat for the day a bigwig now sir and as nasty as ever however    theres no doubt he played his part fairly well at the time he saved us all from the deadly incubus of sotillo where a more particular man might have failed  his arm went up  the equestrian statue that used to stand on the pedestal over there has been removed it was an anachronism captain mitchell commented obscurely there is some talk of replacing it by a marble shaft commemorative of separation with angels of peace at the four corners and bronze justice holding an even balance all gilt on the top cavaliere parrochetti was asked to make a design which you can see framed under glass in the municipal sala names are to be engraved all round the base well they could do no better than begin with the name of nostromo he has done for separation as much as anybody else and added captain mitchell has got less than many others by itwhen it comes to that he dropped on to a stone seat under a tree and tapped invitingly at the place by his side he carried to barrios the letters from sulaco which decided the general to abandon cayta for a time and come back to our help here by sea the transports were still in harbour fortunately sir i did not even know that my capataz de cargadores was alive i had no idea it was dr monygham who came upon him by chance in the custom house evacuated an hour or two before by the wretched sotillo i was never told never given a hint nothingas if i were unworthy of confidence monygham arranged it all he went to the railway yards and got admission to the engineerinchief who for the sake of the goulds as much as for anything else consented to let an engine make a dash down the line one hundred and eighty miles with nostromo aboard it was the only way to get him off in the construction camp at the railhead he obtained a horse arms some clothing and started alone on that marvellous ridefour hundred miles in six days through a disturbed country ending by the feat of passing through the monterist lines outside cayta the history of that ride sir would make a most exciting book he carried all our lives in his pocket devotion courage fidelity intelligence were not enough of course he was perfectly fearless and incorruptible but a man was wanted that would know how to succeed he was that man sir on the fifth of may being practically a prisoner in the harbour office of my company i suddenly heard the whistle of an engine in the railway yards a quarter of a mile away i could not believe my ears i made one jump on to the balcony and beheld a locomotive under a great head of steam run out of the yard gates screeching like mad enveloped in a white cloud and then just abreast of old violas inn check almost to a standstill i made out sir a mani couldnt tell whodash out of the albergo dltalia una climb into the cab and then sir that engine seemed positively to leap clear of the house and was gone in the twinkling of an eye as you blow a candle out sir there was a firstrate driver on the footplate sir i can tell you they were fired heavily upon by the national guards in rincon and one other place fortunately the line had not been torn up in four hours they reached the construction camp nostromo had his start    the rest you know youve got only to look round you there are people on this alameda that ride in their carriages or even are alive at all today because years ago i engaged a runaway italian sailor for a foreman of our wharf simply on the strength of his looks and thats a fact you cant get over it sir on the seventeenth of may just twelve days after i saw the man from the casa viola get on the engine and wondered what it meant barrioss transports were entering this harbour and the treasure house of the world as the times man calls sulaco in his book was saved intact for civilizationfor a great future sir pedrito with hernandez on the west and the san tome miners pressing on the land gate was not able to oppose the landing he had been sending messages to sotillo for a week to join him had sotillo done so there would have been massacres and proscription that would have left no man or woman of position alive but thats where dr monygham comes in sotillo blind and deaf to everything stuck on board his steamer watching the dragging for silver which he believed to be sunk at the bottom of the harbour they say that for the last three days he was out of his mind raving and foaming with disappointment at getting nothing flying about the deck and yelling curses at the boats with the drags ordering them in and then suddenly stamping his foot and crying out and yet it is there i see it i feel it  he was preparing to hang dr monygham whom he had on board at the end of the afterderrick when the first of barrioss transports one of our own ships at that steamed right in and ranging close alongside opened a smallarm fire without as much preliminaries as a hail it was the completest surprise in the world sir they were too astounded at first to bolt below men were falling right and left like ninepins its a miracle that monygham standing on the afterhatch with the rope already round his neck escaped being riddled through and through like a sieve he told me since that he had given himself up for lost and kept on yelling with all the strength of his lungs hoist a white flag hoist a white flag suddenly an old major of the esmeralda regiment standing by unsheathed his sword with a shriek die perjured traitor and ran sotillo clean through the body just before he fell himself shot through the head  captain mitchell stopped for a while  begad sir i could spin you a yarn for hours but its time we started off to rincon it would not do for you to pass through sulaco and not see the lights of the san tome mine a whole mountain ablaze like a lighted palace above the dark campo its a fashionable drive    but let me tell you one little anecdote sir just to show you a fortnight or more later when barrios declared generalissimo was gone in pursuit of pedrito away south when the provisional junta with don juste lopez at its head had promulgated the new constitution and our don carlos gould was packing up his trunks bound on a mission to san francisco and washington the united states sir were the first great power to recognize the occidental republica fortnight later i say when we were beginning to feel that our heads were safe on our shoulders if i may express myself so a prominent man a large shipper by our line came to see me on business and says he the first thing i say captain mitchell is that fellow meaning nostromo still the capataz of your cargadores or not whats the matter says i because if he is then i dont mind i send and receive a good lot of cargo by your ships but i have observed him several days loafing about the wharf and just now he stopped me as cool as you please with a request for a cigar now you know my cigars are rather special and i cant get them so easily as all that i hope you stretched a point i said very gently why yes but its a confounded nuisance the fellows everlastingly cadging for smokes sir i turned my eyes away and then asked werent you one of the prisoners in the cabildo you know very well i was and in chains too says he and under a fine of fifteen thousand dollars he coloured sir because it got about that he fainted from fright when they came to arrest him and then behaved before fuentes in a manner to make the very policianos who had dragged him there by the hair of his head smile at his cringing yes he says in a sort of shy way why oh nothing you stood to lose a tidy bit says i even if you saved your life    but what can i do for you he never even saw the point not he and thats how the world wags sir  he rose a little stiffly and the drive to rincon would be taken with only one philosophical remark uttered by the merciless cicerone with his eyes fixed upon the lights of san tome that seemed suspended in the dark night between earth and heaven  a great power this for good and evil sir a great power  and the dinner of the mirliflores would be eaten excellent as to cooking and leaving upon the travellers mind an impression that there were in sulaco many pleasant able young men with salaries apparently too large for their discretion and amongst them a few mostly anglosaxon skilled in the art of as the saying is taking a rise out of his kind host  with a rapid jingling drive to the harbour in a twowheeled machine which captain mitchell called a curricle behind a fleet and scraggy mule beaten all the time by an obviously neapolitan driver the cycle would be nearly closed before the lightedup offices of the o s n company remaining open so late because of the steamer nearlybut not quite  ten oclock your ship wont be ready to leave till halfpast twelve if by then come in for a brandyandsoda and one more cigar  and in the superintendents private room the privileged passenger by the ceres or juno or pallas stunned and as it were annihilated mentally by a sudden surfeit of sights sounds names facts and complicated information imperfectly apprehended would listen like a tired child to a fairy tale would hear a voice familiar and surprising in its pompousness tell him as if from another world how there was in this very harbour an international naval demonstration which put an end to the costaguanasulaco war how the united states cruiser powhattan was the first to salute the occidental flagwhite with a wreath of green laurel in the middle encircling a yellow amarilla flower would hear how general montero in less than a month after proclaiming himself emperor of costaguana was shot dead during a solemn and public distribution of orders and crosses by a young artillery officer the brother of his then mistress  the abominable pedrito sir fled the country the voice would say and it would continue a captain of one of our ships told me lately that he recognized pedrito the guerrillero arrayed in purple slippers and a velvet smokingcap with a gold tassel keeping a disorderly house in one of the southern ports  abominable pedrito who the devil was he would wonder the distinguished bird of passage hovering on the confines of waking and sleep with resolutely open eyes and a faint but amiable curl upon his lips from between which stuck out the eighteenth or twentieth cigar of that memorable day  he appeared to me in this very room like a haunting ghost sircaptain mitchell was talking of his nostromo with true warmth of feeling and a touch of wistful pride you may imagine sir what an effect it produced on me he had come round by sea with barrios of course and the first thing he told me after i became fit to hear him was that he had picked up the lighters boat floating in the gulf he seemed quite overcome by the circumstance and a remarkable enough circumstance it was when you remember that it was then sixteen days since the sinking of the silver at once i could see he was another man he stared at the wall sir as if there had been a spider or something running about there the loss of the silver preyed on his mind the first thing he asked me about was whether dona antonia had heard yet of decouds death his voice trembled i had to tell him that dona antonia as a matter of fact was not back in town yet poor girl and just as i was making ready to ask him a thousand questions with a sudden pardon me senor he cleared out of the office altogether i did not see him again for three days i was terribly busy you know it seems that he wandered about in and out of the town and on two nights turned up to sleep in the baracoons of the railway people he seemed absolutely indifferent to what went on i asked him on the wharf when are you going to take hold again nostromo there will be plenty of work for the cargadores presently  senor says he looking at me in a slow inquisitive manner would it surprise you to hear that i am too tired to work just yet and what work could i do now how can i look my cargadores in the face after losing a lighter  i begged him not to think any more about the silver and he smiled a smile that went to my heart sir it was no mistake i told him it was a fatality a thing that could not be helped si si he said and turned away i thought it best to leave him alone for a bit to get over it sir it took him years really to get over it i was present at his interview with don carlos i must say that gould is rather a cold man he had to keep a tight hand on his feelings dealing with thieves and rascals in constant danger of ruin for himself and wife for so many years that it had become a second nature they looked at each other for a long time don carlos asked what he could do for him in his quiet reserved way  my name is known from one end of sulaco to the other he said as quiet as the other what more can you do for me that was all that passed on that occasion later however there was a very fine coasting schooner for sale and mrs gould and i put our heads together to get her bought and presented to him it was done but he paid all the price back within the next three years business was booming all along this seaboard sir moreover that man always succeeded in everything except in saving the silver poor dona antonia fresh from her terrible experiences in the woods of los hatos had an interview with him too wanted to hear about decoud what they said what they did what they thought up to the last on that fatal night mrs gould told me his manner was perfect for quietness and sympathy miss avellanos burst into tears only when he told her how decoud had happened to say that his plan would be a glorious success    and theres no doubt sir that it is it is a success  the cycle was about to close at last and while the privileged passenger shivering with the pleasant anticipations of his berth forgot to ask himself what on earth decouds plan could be captain mitchell was saying sorry we must part so soon your intelligent interest made this a pleasant day to me i shall see you now on board you had a glimpse of the treasure house of the world a very good name that and the coxswains voice at the door announcing that the gig was ready closed the cycle  nostromo had indeed found the lighters boat which he had left on the great isabel with decoud floating empty far out in the gulf he was then on the bridge of the first of barrioss transports and within an hours steaming from sulaco barrios always delighted with a feat of daring and a good judge of courage had taken a great liking to the capataz during the passage round the coast the general kept nostromo near his person addressing him frequently in that abrupt and boisterous manner which was the sign of his high favour  nostromos eyes were the first to catch broad on the bow the tiny elusive dark speck which alone with the forms of the three isabels right ahead appeared on the flat shimmering emptiness of the gulf there are times when no fact should be neglected as insignificant a small boat so far from the land might have had some meaning worth finding out at a nod of consent from barrios the transport swept out of her course passing near enough to ascertain that no one manned the little cockleshell it was merely a common small boat gone adrift with her oars in her but nostromo to whose mind decoud had been insistently present for days had long before recognized with excitement the dinghy of the lighter  there could be no question of stopping to pick up that thing every minute of time was momentous with the lives and futures of a whole town the head of the leading ship with the general on board fell off to her course behind her the fleet of transports scattered haphazard over a mile or so in the offing like the finish of an ocean race pressed on all black and smoking on the western sky  mi general nostromos voice rang out loud but quiet from behind a group of officers i should like to save that little boat por dios i know her she belongs to my company  and por dios guffawed barrios in a noisy goodhumoured voice you belong to me i am going to make you a captain of cavalry directly we get within sight of a horse again  i can swim far better than i can ride mi general cried nostromo pushing through to the rail with a set stare in his eyes let me  let you what a conceited fellow that is bantered the general jovially without even looking at him let him go ha ha ha he wants me to admit that we cannot take sulaco without him ha ha ha would you like to swim off to her my son  a tremendous shout from one end of the ship to the other stopped his guffaw nostromo had leaped overboard and his black head bobbed up far away already from the ship the general muttered an appalled cielo sinner that i am in a thunderstruck tone one anxious glance was enough to show him that nostromo was swimming with perfect ease and then he thundered terribly no no we shall not stop to pick up this impertinent fellow let him drownthat mad capataz  nothing short of main force would have kept nostromo from leaping overboard that empty boat coming out to meet him mysteriously as if rowed by an invisible spectre exercised the fascination of some sign of some warning seemed to answer in a startling and enigmatic way the persistent thought of a treasure and of a mans fate he would have leaped if there had been death in that halfmile of water it was as smooth as a pond and for some reason sharks are unknown in the placid gulf though on the other side of the punta mala the coastline swarms with them  the capataz seized hold of the stern and blew with force a queer faint feeling had come over him while he swam he had got rid of his boots and coat in the water he hung on for a time regaining his breath in the distance the transports more in a bunch now held on straight for sulaco with their air of friendly contest of nautical sport of a regatta and the united smoke of their funnels drove like a thin sulphurous fogbank right over his head it was his daring his courage his act that had set these ships in motion upon the sea hurrying on to save the lives and fortunes of the blancos the taskmasters of the people to save the san tome mine to save the children  with a vigorous and skilful effort he clambered over the stern the very boat no doubt of it no doubt whatever it was the dinghy of the lighter no 3the dinghy left with martin decoud on the great isabel so that he should have some means to help himself if nothing could be done for him from the shore and here she had come out to meet him empty and inexplicable what had become of decoud the capataz made a minute examination he looked for some scratch for some mark for some sign all he discovered was a brown stain on the gunwale abreast of the thwart he bent his face over it and rubbed hard with his finger then he sat down in the stern sheets passive with his knees close together and legs aslant  streaming from head to foot with his hair and whiskers hanging lank and dripping and a lustreless stare fixed upon the bottom boards the capataz of the sulaco cargadores resembled a drowned corpse come up from the bottom to idle away the sunset hour in a small boat the excitement of his adventurous ride the excitement of the return in time of achievement of success all this excitement centred round the associated ideas of the great treasure and of the only other man who knew of its existence had departed from him to the very last moment he had been cudgelling his brains as to how he could manage to visit the great isabel without loss of time and undetected for the idea of secrecy had come to be connected with the treasure so closely that even to barrios himself he had refrained from mentioning the existence of decoud and of the silver on the island the letters he carried to the general however made brief mention of the loss of the lighter as having its bearing upon the situation in sulaco in the circumstances the oneeyed tigerslayer scenting battle from afar had not wasted his time in making inquiries from the messenger in fact barrios talking with nostromo assumed that both don martin decoud and the ingots of san tome were lost together and nostromo not questioned directly had kept silent under the influence of some indefinable form of resentment and distrust let don martin speak of everything with his own lipswas what he told himself mentally  and now with the means of gaining the great isabel thrown thus in his way at the earliest possible moment his excitement had departed as when the soul takes flight leaving the body inert upon an earth it knows no more nostromo did not seem to know the gulf for a long time even his eyelids did not flutter once upon the glazed emptiness of his stare then slowly without a limb having stirred without a twitch of muscle or quiver of an eyelash an expression a living expression came upon the still features deep thought crept into the empty stareas if an outcast soul a quiet brooding soul finding that untenanted body in its way had come in stealthily to take possession  the capataz frowned and in the immense stillness of sea islands and coast of cloud forms on the sky and trails of light upon the water the knitting of that brow had the emphasis of a powerful gesture nothing else budged for a long time then the capataz shook his head and again surrendered himself to the universal repose of all visible things suddenly he seized the oars and with one movement made the dinghy spin round headon to the great isabel but before he began to pull he bent once more over the brown stain on the gunwale  i know that thing he muttered to himself with a sagacious jerk of the head thats blood  his stroke was long vigorous and steady now and then he looked over his shoulder at the great isabel presenting its low cliff to his anxious gaze like an impenetrable face at last the stem touched the strand he flung rather than dragged the boat up the little beach at once turning his back upon the sunset he plunged with long strides into the ravine making the water of the stream spurt and fly upwards at every step as if spurning its shallow clear murmuring spirit with his feet he wanted to save every moment of daylight  a mass of earth grass and smashed bushes had fallen down very naturally from above upon the cavity under the leaning tree decoud had attended to the concealment of the silver as instructed using the spade with some intelligence but nostromos halfsmile of approval changed into a scornful curl of the lip by the sight of the spade itself flung there in full view as if in utter carelessness or sudden panic giving away the whole thing ah they were all alike in their folly these hombres finos that invented laws and governments and barren tasks for the people  the capataz picked up the spade and with the feel of the handle in his palm the desire of having a look at the horsehide boxes of treasure came upon him suddenly in a very few strokes he uncovered the edges and corners of several then clearing away more earth became aware that one of them had been slashed with a knife  he exclaimed at that discovery in a stifled voice and dropped on his knees with a look of irrational apprehension over one shoulder then over the other the stiff hide had closed and he hesitated before he pushed his hand through the long slit and felt the ingots inside there they were one two three yes four gone taken away four ingots but who decoud nobody else and why for what purpose for what cursed fancy let him explain four ingots carried off in a boat andblood  in the face of the open gulf the sun clear unclouded unaltered plunged into the waters in a grave and untroubled mystery of selfimmolation consummated far from all mortal eyes with an infinite majesty of silence and peace four ingots shortand blood  the capataz got up slowly  he might simply have cut his hand he muttered but then  he sat down on the soft earth unresisting as if he had been chained to the treasure his drawnup legs clasped in his hands with an air of hopeless submission like a slave set on guard once only he lifted his head smartly the rattle of hot musketry fire had reached his ears like pouring from on high a stream of dry peas upon a drum after listening for a while he said half aloud  he will never come back to explain  and he lowered his head again  impossible he muttered gloomily  the sounds of firing died out the loom of a great conflagration in sulaco flashed up red above the coast played on the clouds at the head of the gulf seemed to touch with a ruddy and sinister reflection the forms of the three isabels he never saw it though he raised his head  but then i cannot know he pronounced distinctly and remained silent and staring for hours  he could not know nobody was to know as might have been supposed the end of don martin decoud never became a subject of speculation for any one except nostromo had the truth of the facts been known there would always have remained the question why whereas the version of his death at the sinking of the lighter had no uncertainty of motive the young apostle of separation had died striving for his idea by an everlamented accident but the truth was that he died from solitude the enemy known but to few on this earth and whom only the simplest of us are fit to withstand the brilliant costaguanero of the boulevards had died from solitude and want of faith in himself and others  for some good and valid reasons beyond mere human comprehension the seabirds of the gulf shun the isabels the rocky head of azuera is their haunt whose stony levels and chasms resound with their wild and tumultuous clamour as if they were for ever quarrelling over the legendary treasure  at the end of his first day on the great isabel decoud turning in his lair of coarse grass under the shade of a tree said to himself  i have not seen as much as one single bird all day  and he had not heard a sound either all day but that one now of his own muttering voice it had been a day of absolute silencethe first he had known in his life and he had not slept a wink not for all these wakeful nights and the days of fighting planning talking not for all that last night of danger and hard physical toil upon the gulf had he been able to close his eyes for a moment and yet from sunrise to sunset he had been lying prone on the ground either on his back or on his face  he stretched himself and with slow steps descended into the gully to spend the night by the side of the silver if nostromo returnedas he might have done at any momentit was there that he would look first and night would of course be the proper time for an attempt to communicate he remembered with profound indifference that he had not eaten anything yet since he had been left alone on the island  he spent the night openeyed and when the day broke he ate something with the same indifference the brilliant son decoud the spoiled darling of the family the lover of antonia and journalist of sulaco was not fit to grapple with himself singlehanded solitude from mere outward condition of existence becomes very swiftly a state of soul in which the affectations of irony and scepticism have no place it takes possession of the mind and drives forth the thought into the exile of utter unbelief after three days of waiting for the sight of some human face decoud caught himself entertaining a doubt of his own individuality it had merged into the world of cloud and water of natural forces and forms of nature in our activity alone do we find the sustaining illusion of an independent existence as against the whole scheme of things of which we form a helpless part decoud lost all belief in the reality of his action past and to come on the fifth day an immense melancholy descended upon him palpably he resolved not to give himself up to these people in sulaco who had beset him unreal and terrible like jibbering and obscene spectres he saw himself struggling feebly in their midst and antonia gigantic and lovely like an allegorical statue looking on with scornful eyes at his weakness  not a living being not a speck of distant sail appeared within the range of his vision and as if to escape from this solitude he absorbed himself in his melancholy the vague consciousness of a misdirected life given up to impulses whose memory left a bitter taste in his mouth was the first moral sentiment of his manhood but at the same time he felt no remorse what should he regret he had recognized no other virtue than intelligence and had erected passions into duties both his intelligence and his passion were swallowed up easily in this great unbroken solitude of waiting without faith sleeplessness had robbed his will of all energy for he had not slept seven hours in the seven days his sadness was the sadness of a sceptical mind he beheld the universe as a succession of incomprehensible images nostromo was dead everything had failed ignominiously he no longer dared to think of antonia she had not survived but if she survived he could not face her and all exertion seemed senseless  on the tenth day after a night spent without even dozing off once it had occurred to him that antonia could not possibly have ever loved a being so impalpable as himself the solitude appeared like a great void and the silence of the gulf like a tense thin cord to which he hung suspended by both hands without fear without surprise without any sort of emotion whatever only towards the evening in the comparative relief of coolness he began to wish that this cord would snap he imagined it snapping with a report as of a pistola sharp full crack and that would be the end of him he contemplated that eventuality with pleasure because he dreaded the sleepless nights in which the silence remaining unbroken in the shape of a cord to which he hung with both hands vibrated with senseless phrases always the same but utterly incomprehensible about nostromo antonia barrios and proclamations mingled into an ironical and senseless buzzing in the daytime he could look at the silence like a still cord stretched to breakingpoint with his life his vain life suspended to it like a weight  i wonder whether i would hear it snap before i fell he asked himself  the sun was two hours above the horizon when he got up gaunt dirty whitefaced and looked at it with his redrimmed eyes his limbs obeyed him slowly as if full of lead yet without tremor and the effect of that physical condition gave to his movements an unhesitating deliberate dignity he acted as if accomplishing some sort of rite he descended into the gully for the fascination of all that silver with its potential power survived alone outside of himself he picked up the belt with the revolver that was lying there and buckled it round his waist the cord of silence could never snap on the island it must let him fall and sink into the sea he thought and sink he was looking at the loose earth covering the treasure in the sea his aspect was that of a somnambulist he lowered himself down on his knees slowly and went on grubbing with his fingers with industrious patience till he uncovered one of the boxes without a pause as if doing some work done many times before he slit it open and took four ingots which he put in his pockets he covered up the exposed box again and step by step came out of the gully the bushes closed after him with a swish  it was on the third day of his solitude that he had dragged the dinghy near the water with an idea of rowing away somewhere but had desisted partly at the whisper of lingering hope that nostromo would return partly from conviction of utter uselessness of all effort now she wanted only a slight shove to be set afloat he had eaten a little every day after the first and had some muscular strength left yet taking up the oars slowly he pulled away from the cliff of the great isabel that stood behind him warm with sunshine as if with the heat of life bathed in a rich light from head to foot as if in a radiance of hope and joy he pulled straight towards the setting sun when the gulf had grown dark he ceased rowing and flung the sculls in the hollow clatter they made in falling was the loudest noise he had ever heard in his life it was a revelation it seemed to recall him from far away actually the thought perhaps i may sleep tonight passed through his mind but he did not believe it he believed in nothing and he remained sitting on the thwart  the dawn from behind the mountains put a gleam into his unwinking eyes after a clear daybreak the sun appeared splendidly above the peaks of the range the great gulf burst into a glitter all around the boat and in this glory of merciless solitude the silence appeared again before him stretched taut like a dark thin string  his eyes looked at it while without haste he shifted his seat from the thwart to the gunwale they looked at it fixedly while his hand feeling about his waist unbuttoned the flap of the leather case drew the revolver cocked it brought it forward pointing at his breast pulled the trigger and with convulsive force sent the stillsmoking weapon hurtling through the air his eyes looked at it while he fell forward and hung with his breast on the gunwale and the fingers of his right hand hooked under the thwart they looked  it is done he stammered out in a sudden flow of blood his last thought was i wonder how that capataz died the stiffness of the fingers relaxed and the lover of antonia avellanos rolled overboard without having heard the cord of silence snap in the solitude of the placid gulf whose glittering surface remained untroubled by the fall of his body  a victim of the disillusioned weariness which is the retribution meted out to intellectual audacity the brilliant don martin decoud weighted by the bars of san tome silver disappeared without a trace swallowed up in the immense indifference of things his sleepless crouching figure was gone from the side of the san tome silver and for a time the spirits of good and evil that hover near every concealed treasure of the earth might have thought that this one had been forgotten by all mankind then after a few days another form appeared striding away from the setting sun to sit motionless and awake in the narrow black gully all through the night in nearly the same pose in the same place in which had sat that other sleepless man who had gone away for ever so quietly in a small boat about the time of sunset and the spirits of good and evil that hover about a forbidden treasure understood well that the silver of san tome was provided now with a faithful and lifelong slave  the magnificent capataz de cargadores victim of the disenchanted vanity which is the reward of audacious action sat in the weary pose of a hunted outcast through a night of sleeplessness as tormenting as any known to decoud his companion in the most desperate affair of his life and he wondered how decoud had died but he knew the part he had played himself first a woman then a man abandoned both in their last extremity for the sake of this accursed treasure it was paid for by a soul lost and by a vanished life the blank stillness of awe was succeeded by a gust of immense pride there was no one in the world but gian battista fidanza capataz de cargadores the incorruptible and faithful nostromo to pay such a price  he had made up his mind that nothing should be allowed now to rob him of his bargain nothing decoud had died but how that he was dead he had not a shadow of a doubt but four ingots    what for did he mean to come for moresome other time  the treasure was putting forth its latent power it troubled the clear mind of the man who had paid the price he was sure that decoud was dead the island seemed full of that whisper dead gone and he caught himself listening for the swish of bushes and the splash of the footfalls in the bed of the brook dead the talker the novio of dona antonia  ha he murmured with his head on his knees under the livid clouded dawn breaking over the liberated sulaco and upon the gulf as gray as ashes it is to her that he will fly to her that he will fly  and four ingots did he take them in revenge to cast a spell like the angry woman who had prophesied remorse and failure and yet had laid upon him the task of saving the children well he had saved the children he had defeated the spell of poverty and starvation he had done it all aloneor perhaps helped by the devil who cared he had done it betrayed as he was and saving by the same stroke the san tome mine which appeared to him hateful and immense lording it by its vast wealth over the valour the toil the fidelity of the poor over war and peace over the labours of the town the sea and the campo  the sun lit up the sky behind the peaks of the cordillera the capataz looked down for a time upon the fall of loose earth stones and smashed bushes concealing the hidingplace of the silver  i must grow rich very slowly he meditated aloud    chapter eleven  sulaco outstripped nostromos prudence growing rich swiftly on the hidden treasures of the earth hovered over by the anxious spirits of good and evil torn out by the labouring hands of the people it was like a second youth like a new life full of promise of unrest of toil scattering lavishly its wealth to the four corners of an excited world material changes swept along in the train of material interests and other changes more subtle outwardly unmarked affected the minds and hearts of the workers captain mitchell had gone home to live on his savings invested in the san tome mine and dr monygham had grown older with his head steelgrey and the unchanged expression of his face living on the inexhaustible treasure of his devotion drawn upon in the secret of his heart like a store of unlawful wealth  the inspectorgeneral of state hospitals whose maintenance is a charge upon the gould concession official adviser on sanitation to the municipality chief medical officer of the san tome consolidated mines whose territory containing gold silver copper lead cobalt extends for miles along the foothills of the cordillera had felt povertystricken miserable and starved during the prolonged second visit the goulds paid to europe and the united states of america intimate of the casa proved friend a bachelor without ties and without establishment except of the professional sort he had been asked to take up his quarters in the gould house in the eleven months of their absence the familiar rooms recalling at every glance the woman to whom he had given all his loyalty had grown intolerable as the day approached for the arrival of the mail boat hermes the latest addition to the o s n cos splendid fleet the doctor hobbled about more vivaciously snapped more sardonically at simple and gentle out of sheer nervousness  he packed up his modest trunk with speed with fury with enthusiasm and saw it carried out past the old porter at the gate of the casa gould with delight with intoxication then as the hour approached sitting alone in the great landau behind the white mules a little sideways his drawnin face positively venomous with the effort of selfcontrol and holding a pair of new gloves in his left hand he drove to the harbour  his heart dilated within him so when he saw the goulds on the deck of the hermes that his greetings were reduced to a casual mutter driving back to town all three were silent and in the patio the doctor in a more natural manner said  ill leave you now to yourselves ill call tomorrow if i may  come to lunch dear dr monygham and come early said mrs gould in her travelling dress and her veil down turning to look at him at the foot of the stairs while at the top of the flight the madonna in blue robes and the child on her arm seemed to welcome her with an aspect of pitying tenderness  dont expect to find me at home charles gould warned him ill be off early to the mine  after lunch dona emilia and the senor doctor came slowly through the inner gateway of the patio the large gardens of the casa gould surrounded by high walls and the redtile slopes of neighbouring roofs lay open before them with masses of shade under the trees and level surfaces of sunlight upon the lawns a triple row of old orange trees surrounded the whole barefooted brown gardeners in snowy white shirts and wide calzoneras dotted the grounds squatting over flowerbeds passing between the trees dragging slender indiarubber tubes across the gravel of the paths and the fine jets of water crossed each other in graceful curves sparkling in the sunshine with a slight pattering noise upon the bushes and an effect of showered diamonds upon the grass  dona emilia holding up the train of a clear dress walked by the side of dr monygham in a longish black coat and severe black bow on an immaculate shirtfront under a shady clump of trees where stood scattered little tables and wicker easychairs mrs gould sat down in a low and ample seat  dont go yet she said to dr monygham who was unable to tear himself away from the spot his chin nestling within the points of his collar he devoured her stealthily with his eyes which luckily were round and hard like clouded marbles and incapable of disclosing his sentiments his pitying emotion at the marks of time upon the face of that woman the air of frailty and weary fatigue that had settled upon the eyes and temples of the nevertired senora as don pepe years ago used to call her with admiration touched him almost to tears dont go yet today is all my own mrs gould urged gently we are not back yet officially no one will come its only tomorrow that the windows of the casa gould are to be lit up for a reception  the doctor dropped into a chair  giving a tertulia he said with a detached air  a simple greeting for all the kind friends who care to come  and only tomorrow  yes charles would be tired out after a day at the mine and so iit would be good to have him to myself for one evening on our return to this house i love it has seen all my life  ah yes snarled the doctor suddenly women count time from the marriage feast didnt you live a little before  yes but what is there to remember there were no cares  mrs gould sighed and as two friends after a long separation will revert to the most agitated period of their lives they began to talk of the sulaco revolution it seemed strange to mrs gould that people who had taken part in it seemed to forget its memory and its lesson  and yet struck in the doctor we who played our part in it had our reward don pepe though superannuated still can sit a horse barrios is drinking himself to death in jovial company away somewhere on his fundacion beyond the bolson de tonoro and the heroic father romani imagine the old padre blowing up systematically the san tome mine uttering a pious exclamation at every bang and taking handfuls of snuff between the explosionsthe heroic padre roman says that he is not afraid of the harm holroyds missionaries can do to his flock as long as he is alive  mrs gould shuddered a little at the allusion to the destruction that had come so near to the san tome mine  ah but you dear friend  i did the work i was fit for  you faced the most cruel dangers of all something more than death  no mrs gould only deathby hanging and i am rewarded beyond my deserts  noticing mrs goulds gaze fixed upon him he dropped his eyes  ive made my careeras you see said the inspectorgeneral of state hospitals taking up lightly the lapels of his superfine black coat the doctors selfrespect marked inwardly by the almost complete disappearance from his dreams of father beron appeared visibly in what by contrast with former carelessness seemed an immoderate cult of personal appearance carried out within severe limits of form and colour and in perpetual freshness this change of apparel gave to dr monygham an air at the same time professional and festive while his gait and the unchanged crabbed character of his face acquired from it a startling force of incongruity  yes he went on we all had our rewardsthe engineerinchief captain mitchell  we saw him interrupted mrs gould in her charming voice the poor dear man came up from the country on purpose to call on us in our hotel in london he comported himself with great dignity but i fancy he regrets sulaco he rambled feebly about historical events till i felt i could have a cry  hm grunted the doctor getting old i suppose even nostromo is getting olderthough he is not changed and speaking of that fellow i wanted to tell you something  for some time the house had been full of murmurs of agitation suddenly the two gardeners busy with rose trees at the side of the garden arch fell upon their knees with bowed heads on the passage of antonia avellanos who appeared walking beside her uncle  invested with the red hat after a short visit to rome where he had been invited by the propaganda father corbelan missionary to the wild indians conspirator friend and patron of hernandez the robber advanced with big slow strides gaunt and leaning forward with his powerful hands clasped behind his back the first cardinalarchbishop of sulaco had preserved his fanatical and morose air the aspect of a chaplain of bandits it was believed that his unexpected elevation to the purple was a countermove to the protestant invasion of sulaco organized by the holroyd missionary fund antonia the beauty of her face as if a little blurred her figure slightly fuller advanced with her light walk and her high serenity smiling from a distance at mrs gould she had brought her uncle over to see dear emilia without ceremony just for a moment before the siesta  when all were seated again dr monygham who had come to dislike heartily everybody who approached mrs gould with any intimacy kept aside pretending to be lost in profound meditation a louder phrase of antonia made him lift his head  how can we abandon groaning under oppression those who have been our countrymen only a few years ago who are our countrymen now miss avellanos was saying how can we remain blind and deaf without pity to the cruel wrongs suffered by our brothers there is a remedy  annex the rest of costaguana to the order and prosperity of sulaco snapped the doctor there is no other remedy  i am convinced senor doctor antonia said with the earnest calm of invincible resolution that this was from the first poor martins intention  yes but the material interests will not let you jeopardize their development for a mere idea of pity and justice the doctor muttered grumpily and it is just as well perhaps  the cardinalarchbishop straightened up his gaunt bony frame  we have worked for them we have made them these material interests of the foreigners the last of the corbelans uttered in a deep denunciatory tone  and without them you are nothing cried the doctor from the distance they will not let you  let them beware then lest the people prevented from their aspirations should rise and claim their share of the wealth and their share of the power the popular cardinalarchbishop of sulaco declared significantly menacingly  a silence ensued during which his eminence stared frowning at the ground and antonia graceful and rigid in her chair breathed calmly in the strength of her convictions then the conversation took a social turn touching on the visit of the goulds to europe the cardinalarchbishop when in rome had suffered from neuralgia in the head all the time it was the climatethe bad air  when uncle and niece had gone away with the servants again falling on their knees and the old porter who had known henry gould almost totally blind and impotent now creeping up to kiss his eminences extended hand dr monygham looking after them pronounced the one word  incorrigible  mrs gould with a look upwards dropped wearily on her lap her white hands flashing with the gold and stones of many rings  conspiring yes said the doctor the last of the avellanos and the last of the corbelans are conspiring with the refugees from sta marta that flock here after every revolution the cafe lambroso at the corner of the plaza is full of them you can hear their chatter across the street like the noise of a parrothouse they are conspiring for the invasion of costaguana and do you know where they go for strength for the necessary force to the secret societies amongst immigrants and natives where nostromoi should say captain fidanzais the great man what gives him that position who can say genius he has genius he is greater with the populace than ever he was before it is as if he had some secret power some mysterious means to keep up his influence he holds conferences with the archbishop as in those old days which you and i remember barrios is useless but for a military head they have the pious hernandez and they may raise the country with the new cry of the wealth for the people  will there be never any peace will there be no rest mrs gould whispered i thought that we  no interrupted the doctor there is no peace and no rest in the development of material interests they have their law and their justice but it is founded on expediency and is inhuman it is without rectitude without the continuity and the force that can be found only in a moral principle mrs gould the time approaches when all that the gould concession stands for shall weigh as heavily upon the people as the barbarism cruelty and misrule of a few years back  how can you say that dr monygham she cried out as if hurt in the most sensitive place of her soul  i can say what is true the doctor insisted obstinately itll weigh as heavily and provoke resentment bloodshed and vengeance because the men have grown different do you think that now the mine would march upon the town to save their senor administrador do you think that  she pressed the backs of her entwined hands on her eyes and murmured hopelessly  is it this we have worked for then  the doctor lowered his head he could follow her silent thought was it for this that her life had been robbed of all the intimate felicities of daily affection which her tenderness needed as the human body needs air to breathe and the doctor indignant with charles goulds blindness hastened to change the conversation  it is about nostromo that i wanted to talk to you ah that fellow has some continuity and force nothing will put an end to him but never mind that theres something inexplicable going onor perhaps only too easy to explain you know linda is practically the lighthouse keeper of the great isabel light the garibaldino is too old now his part is to clean the lamps and to cook in the house but he cant get up the stairs any longer the blackeyed linda sleeps all day and watches the light all night not all day though she is up towards five in the afternoon when our nostromo whenever he is in harbour with his schooner comes out on his courting visit pulling in a small boat  arent they married yet mrs gould asked the mother wished it as far as i can understand while linda was yet quite a child when i had the girls with me for a year or so during the war of separation that extraordinary linda used to declare quite simply that she was going to be gian battistas wife  they are not married yet said the doctor curtly i have looked after them a little  thank you dear dr monygham said mrs gould and under the shade of the big trees her little even teeth gleamed in a youthful smile of gentle malice people dont know how really good you are you will not let them know as if on purpose to annoy me who have put my faith in your good heart long ago  the doctor with a lifting up of his upper lip as though he were longing to bite bowed stiffly in his chair with the utter absorption of a man to whom love comes late not as the most splendid of illusions but like an enlightening and priceless misfortune the sight of that woman of whom he had been deprived for nearly a year suggested ideas of adoration of kissing the hem of her robe and this excess of feeling translated itself naturally into an augmented grimness of speech  i am afraid of being overwhelmed by too much gratitude however these people interest me i went out several times to the great isabel light to look after old giorgio  he did not tell mrs gould that it was because he found there in her absence the relief of an atmosphere of congenial sentiment in old giorgios austere admiration for the english signorathe benefactress in blackeyed lindas voluble torrential passionate affection for our dona emiliathat angel in the whitethroated fair giselles adoring upward turn of the eyes which then glided towards him with a sidelong halfarch halfcandid glance which made the doctor exclaim to himself mentally if i werent what i am old and ugly i would think the minx is making eyes at me and perhaps she is i dare say she would make eyes at anybody dr monygham said nothing of this to mrs gould the providence of the viola family but reverted to what he called our great nostromo  what i wanted to tell you is this our great nostromo did not take much notice of the old man and the children for some years its true too that he was away on his coasting voyages certainly ten months out of the twelve he was making his fortune as he told captain mitchell once he seems to have done uncommonly well it was only to be expected he is a man full of resource full of confidence in himself ready to take chances and risks of every sort i remember being in mitchells office one day when he came in with that calm grave air he always carries everywhere he had been away trading in the gulf of california he said looking straight past us at the wall as his manner is and was glad to see on his return that a lighthouse was being built on the cliff of the great isabel very glad he repeated mitchell explained that it was the o s n co who was building it for the convenience of the mail service on his own advice captain fidanza was good enough to say that it was excellent advice i remember him twisting up his moustaches and looking all round the cornice of the room before he proposed that old giorgio should be made the keeper of that light  i heard of this i was consulted at the time mrs gould said i doubted whether it would be good for these girls to be shut up on that island as if in a prison  the proposal fell in with the old garibaldinos humour as to linda any place was lovely and delightful enough for her as long as it was nostromos suggestion she could wait for her gian battistas good pleasure there as well as anywhere else my opinion is that she was always in love with that incorruptible capataz moreover both father and sister were anxious to get giselle away from the attentions of a certain ramirez  ah said mrs gould interested ramirez what sort of man is that  just a mozo of the town his father was a cargador as a lanky boy he ran about the wharf in rags till nostromo took him up and made a man of him when he got a little older he put him into a lighter and very soon gave him charge of the no 3 boatthe boat which took the silver away mrs gould nostromo selected that lighter for the work because she was the best sailing and the strongest boat of all the companys fleet young ramirez was one of the five cargadores entrusted with the removal of the treasure from the custom house on that famous night as the boat he had charge of was sunk nostromo on leaving the companys service recommended him to captain mitchell for his successor he had trained him in the routine of work perfectly and thus mr ramirez from a starving waif becomes a man and the capataz of the sulaco cargadores  thanks to nostromo said mrs gould with warm approval  thanks to nostromo repeated dr monygham upon my word the fellows power frightens me when i think of it that our poor old mitchell was only too glad to appoint somebody trained to the work who saved him trouble is not surprising what is wonderful is the fact that the sulaco cargadores accepted ramirez for their chief simply because such was nostromos good pleasure of course he is not a second nostromo as he fondly imagined he would be but still the position was brilliant enough it emboldened him to make up to giselle viola who you know is the recognized beauty of the town the old garibaldino however took a violent dislike to him i dont know why perhaps because he was not a model of perfection like his gian battista the incarnation of the courage the fidelity the honour of the people signor viola does not think much of sulaco natives both of them the old spartan and that whitefaced linda with her red mouth and coalblack eyes were looking rather fiercely after the fair one ramirez was warned off father viola i am told threatened him with his gun once  but what of giselle herself asked mrs gould  shes a bit of a flirt i believe said the doctor i dont think she cared much one way or another of course she likes mens attentions ramirez was not the only one let me tell you mrs gould there was one engineer at least on the railway staff who got warned off with a gun too old viola does not allow any trifling with his honour he has grown uneasy and suspicious since his wife died he was very pleased to remove his youngest girl away from the town but look what happens mrs gould ramirez the honest lovelorn swain is forbidden the island very well he respects the prohibition but naturally turns his eyes frequently towards the great isabel it seems as though he had been in the habit of gazing late at night upon the light and during these sentimental vigils he discovers that nostromo captain fidanza that is returns very late from his visits to the violas as late as midnight at times  the doctor paused and stared meaningly at mrs gould  yes but i dont understand she began looking puzzled  now comes the strange part went on dr monygham viola who is king on his island will allow no visitor on it after dark even captain fidanza has got to leave after sunset when linda has gone up to tend the light and nostromo goes away obediently but what happens afterwards what does he do in the gulf between halfpast six and midnight he has been seen more than once at that late hour pulling quietly into the harbour ramirez is devoured by jealousy he dared not approach old viola but he plucked up courage to rail at linda about it on sunday morning as she came on the mainland to hear mass and visit her mothers grave there was a scene on the wharf which as a matter of fact i witnessed it was early morning he must have been waiting for her on purpose i was there by the merest chance having been called to an urgent consultation by the doctor of the german gunboat in the harbour she poured wrath scorn and flame upon ramirez who seemed out of his mind it was a strange sight mrs gould the long jetty with this raving cargador in his crimson sash and the girl all in black at the end the early sunday morning quiet of the harbour in the shade of the mountains nothing but a canoe or two moving between the ships at anchor and the german gunboats gig coming to take me off linda passed me within a foot i noticed her wild eyes i called out to her she never heard me she never saw me but i looked at her face it was awful in its anger and wretchedness  mrs gould sat up opening her eyes very wide  what do you mean dr monygham do you mean to say that you suspect the younger sister  quien sabe who can tell said the doctor shrugging his shoulders like a born costaguanero ramirez came up to me on the wharf he reeledhe looked insane he took his head into his hands he had to talk to someonesimply had to of course for all his mad state he recognized me people know me well here i have lived too long amongst them to be anything else but the evileyed doctor who can cure all the ills of the flesh and bring bad luck by a glance he came up to me he tried to be calm he tried to make it out that he wanted merely to warn me against nostromo it seems that captain fidanza at some secret meeting or other had mentioned me as the worst despiser of all the poorof the people its very possible he honours me with his undying dislike and a word from the great fidanza may be quite enough to send some fools knife into my back the sanitary commission i preside over is not in favour with the populace beware of him senor doctor destroy him senor doctor ramirez hissed right into my face and then he broke out that man he spluttered has cast a spell upon both these girls as to himself he had said too much he must run away nowrun away and hide somewhere he moaned tenderly about giselle and then called her names that cannot be repeated if he thought she could be made to love him by any means he would carry her off from the island off into the woods but it was no good    he strode away flourishing his arms above his head then i noticed an old negro who had been sitting behind a pile of cases fishing from the wharf he wound up his lines and slunk away at once but he must have heard something and must have talked too because some of the old garibaldinos railway friends i suppose warned him against ramirez at any rate the father has been warned but ramirez has disappeared from the town  i feel i have a duty towards these girls said mrs gould uneasily is nostromo in sulaco now  he is since last sunday  he ought to be spoken toat once  who will dare speak to him even the lovemad ramirez runs away from the mere shadow of captain fidanza  i can i will mrs gould declared a word will be enough for a man like nostromo  the doctor smiled sourly  he must end this situation which lends itself toi cant believe it of that child pursued mrs gould  hes very attractive muttered the doctor gloomily  hell see it i am sure he must put an end to all this by marrying linda at once pronounced the first lady of sulaco with immense decision  through the garden gate emerged basilio grown fat and sleek with an elderly hairless face wrinkles at the corners of his eyes and his jetblack coarse hair plastered down smoothly stooping carefully behind an ornamental clump of bushes he put down with precaution a small child he had been carrying on his shoulderhis own and leonardas last born the pouting spoiled camerista and the head mozo of the casa gould had been married for some years now  he remained squatting on his heels for a time gazing fondly at his offspring which returned his stare with imperturbable gravity then solemn and respectable walked down the path  what is it basilio asked mrs gould  a telephone came through from the office of the mine the master remains to sleep at the mountain tonight  dr monygham had got up and stood looking away a profound silence reigned for a time under the shade of the biggest trees in the lovely gardens of the casa gould  very well basilio said mrs gould she watched him walk away along the path step aside behind the flowering bush and reappear with the child seated on his shoulder he passed through the gateway between the garden and the patio with measured steps careful of his light burden  the doctor with his back to mrs gould contemplated a flowerbed away in the sunshine people believed him scornful and soured the truth of his nature consisted in his capacity for passion and in the sensitiveness of his temperament what he lacked was the polished callousness of men of the world the callousness from which springs an easy tolerance for oneself and others the tolerance wide as poles asunder from true sympathy and human compassion this want of callousness accounted for his sardonic turn of mind and his biting speeches  in profound silence and glaring viciously at the brilliant flowerbed dr monygham poured mental imprecations on charles goulds head behind him the immobility of mrs gould added to the grace of her seated figure the charm of art of an attitude caught and interpreted for ever turning abruptly the doctor took his leave  mrs gould leaned back in the shade of the big trees planted in a circle she leaned back with her eyes closed and her white hands lying idle on the arms of her seat the halflight under the thick mass of leaves brought out the youthful prettiness of her face made the clear light fabrics and white lace of her dress appear luminous small and dainty as if radiating a light of her own in the deep shade of the interlaced boughs she resembled a good fairy weary with a long career of welldoing touched by the withering suspicion of the uselessness of her labours the powerlessness of her magic  had anybody asked her of what she was thinking alone in the garden of the casa with her husband at the mine and the house closed to the street like an empty dwelling her frankness would have had to evade the question it had come into her mind that for life to be large and full it must contain the care of the past and of the future in every passing moment of the present our daily work must be done to the glory of the dead and for the good of those who come after she thought that and sighed without opening her eyeswithout moving at all mrs goulds face became set and rigid for a second as if to receive without flinching a great wave of loneliness that swept over her head and it came into her mind too that no one would ever ask her with solicitude what she was thinking of no one no one but perhaps the man who had just gone away no no one who could be answered with careless sincerity in the ideal perfection of confidence  the word incorrigiblea word lately pronounced by dr monyghamfloated into her still and sad immobility incorrigible in his devotion to the great silver mine was the senor administrador incorrigible in his hard determined service of the material interests to which he had pinned his faith in the triumph of order and justice poor boy she had a clear vision of the grey hairs on his temples he was perfectperfect what more could she have expected it was a colossal and lasting success and love was only a short moment of forgetfulness a short intoxication whose delight one remembered with a sense of sadness as if it had been a deep grief lived through there was something inherent in the necessities of successful action which carried with it the moral degradation of the idea she saw the san tome mountain hanging over the campo over the whole land feared hated wealthy more soulless than any tyrant more pitiless and autocratic than the worst government ready to crush innumerable lives in the expansion of its greatness he did not see it he could not see it it was not his fault he was perfect perfect but she would never have him to herself never not for one short hour altogether to herself in this old spanish house she loved so well incorrigible the last of the corbelans the last of the avellanos the doctor had said but she saw clearly the san tome mine possessing consuming burning up the life of the last of the costaguana goulds mastering the energetic spirit of the son as it had mastered the lamentable weakness of the father a terrible success for the last of the goulds the last she had hoped for a long long time that perhapsbut no there were to be no more an immense desolation the dread of her own continued life descended upon the first lady of sulaco with a prophetic vision she saw herself surviving alone the degradation of her young ideal of life of love of workall alone in the treasure house of the world the profound blind suffering expression of a painful dream settled on her face with its closed eyes in the indistinct voice of an unlucky sleeper lying passive in the grip of a merciless nightmare she stammered out aimlessly the words  material interest    chapter twelve  nostromo had been growing rich very slowly it was an effect of his prudence he could command himself even when thrown off his balance and to become the slave of a treasure with full selfknowledge is an occurrence rare and mentally disturbing but it was also in a great part because of the difficulty of converting it into a form in which it could become available the mere act of getting it away from the island piecemeal little by little was surrounded by difficulties by the dangers of imminent detection he had to visit the great isabel in secret between his voyages along the coast which were the ostensible source of his fortune the crew of his own schooner were to be feared as if they had been spies upon their dreaded captain he did not dare stay too long in port when his coaster was unloaded he hurried away on another trip for he feared arousing suspicion even by a days delay sometimes during a weeks stay or more he could only manage one visit to the treasure and that was all a couple of ingots he suffered through his fears as much as through his prudence to do things by stealth humiliated him and he suffered most from the concentration of his thought upon the treasure  a transgression a crime entering a mans existence eats it up like a malignant growth consumes it like a fever nostromo had lost his peace the genuineness of all his qualities was destroyed he felt it himself and often cursed the silver of san tome his courage his magnificence his leisure his work everything was as before only everything was a sham but the treasure was real he clung to it with a more tenacious mental grip but he hated the feel of the ingots sometimes after putting away a couple of them in his cabinthe fruit of a secret night expedition to the great isabelhe would look fixedly at his fingers as if surprised they had left no stain on his skin  he had found means of disposing of the silver bars in distant ports the necessity to go far afield made his coasting voyages long and caused his visits to the viola household to be rare and far between he was fated to have his wife from there he had said so once to giorgio himself but the garibaldino had put the subject aside with a majestic wave of his hand clutching a smouldering black briarroot pipe there was plenty of time he was not the man to force his girls upon anybody  as time went on nostromo discovered his preference for the younger of the two they had some profound similarities of nature which must exist for complete confidence and understanding no matter what outward differences of temperament there may be to exercise their own fascination of contrast his wife would have to know his secret or else life would be impossible he was attracted by giselle with her candid gaze and white throat pliable silent fond of excitement under her quiet indolence whereas linda with her intense passionately pale face energetic all fire and words touched with gloom and scorn a chip of the old block true daughter of the austere republican but with teresas voice inspired him with a deepseated mistrust moreover the poor girl could not conceal her love for gian battista he could see it would be violent exacting suspicious uncompromisinglike her soul giselle by her fair but warm beauty by the surface placidity of her nature holding a promise of submissiveness by the charm of her girlish mysteriousness excited his passion and allayed his fears as to the future  his absences from sulaco were long on returning from the longest of them he made out lighters loaded with blocks of stone lying under the cliff of the great isabel cranes and scaffolding above workmens figures moving about and a small lighthouse already rising from its foundations on the edge of the cliff  at this unexpected undreamtof startling sight he thought himself lost irretrievably what could save him from detection now nothing he was struck with amazed dread at this turn of chance that would kindle a farreaching light upon the only secret spot of his life that life whose very essence value reality consisted in its reflection from the admiring eyes of men all of it but that thing which was beyond common comprehension which stood between him and the power that hears and gives effect to the evil intention of curses it was dark not every man had such a darkness and they were going to put a light there a light he saw it shining upon disgrace poverty contempt somebody was sure to    perhaps somebody had already     the incomparable nostromo the capataz the respected and feared captain fidanza the unquestioned patron of secret societies a republican like old giorgio and a revolutionist at heart but in another manner was on the point of jumping overboard from the deck of his own schooner that man subjective almost to insanity looked suicide deliberately in the face but he never lost his head he was checked by the thought that this was no escape he imagined himself dead and the disgrace the shame going on or rather properly speaking he could not imagine himself dead he was possessed too strongly by the sense of his own existence a thing of infinite duration in its changes to grasp the notion of finality the earth goes on for ever  and he was courageous it was a corrupt courage but it was as good for his purposes as the other kind he sailed close to the cliff of the great isabel throwing a penetrating glance from the deck at the mouth of the ravine tangled in an undisturbed growth of bushes he sailed close enough to exchange hails with the workmen shading their eyes on the edge of the sheer drop of the cliff overhung by the jibhead of a powerful crane he perceived that none of them had any occasion even to approach the ravine where the silver lay hidden let alone to enter it in the harbour he learned that no one slept on the island the labouring gangs returned to port every evening singing chorus songs in the empty lighters towed by a harbour tug for the moment he had nothing to fear  but afterwards he asked himself later when a keeper came to live in the cottage that was being built some hundred and fifty yards back from the low lighttower and four hundred or so from the dark shaded jungly ravine containing the secret of his safety of his influence of his magnificence of his power over the future of his defiance of illluck of every possible betrayal from rich and poor alikewhat then he could never shake off the treasure his audacity greater than that of other men had welded that vein of silver into his life and the feeling of fearful and ardent subjection the feeling of his slaveryso irremediable and profound that often in his thoughts he compared himself to the legendary gringos neither dead nor alive bound down to their conquest of unlawful wealth on azueraweighed heavily on the independent captain fidanza owner and master of a coasting schooner whose smart appearance and fabulous goodluck in trading were so well known along the western seaboard of a vast continent  fiercely whiskered and grave a shade less supple in his walk the vigour and symmetry of his powerful limbs lost in the vulgarity of a brown tweed suit made by jews in the slums of london and sold by the clothing department of the compania anzani captain fidanza was seen in the streets of sulaco attending to his business as usual that trip and as usual he allowed it to get about that he had made a great profit on his cargo it was a cargo of salt fish and lent was approaching he was seen in tramcars going to and fro between the town and the harbour he talked with people in a cafe or two in his measured steady voice captain fidanza was seen the generation that would know nothing of the famous ride to cayta was not born yet  nostromo the miscalled capataz de cargadores had made for himself under his rightful name another public existence but modified by the new conditions less picturesque more difficult to keep up in the increased size and varied population of sulaco the progressive capital of the occidental republic  captain fidanza unpicturesque but always a little mysterious was recognized quite sufficiently under the lofty glass and iron roof of the sulaco railway station he took a local train and got out in rincon where he visited the widow of the cargador who had died of his wounds at the dawn of the new era like don jose avellanos in the patio of the casa gould he consented to sit down and drink a glass of cool lemonade in the hut while the woman standing up poured a perfect torrent of words to which he did not listen he left some money with her as usual the orphaned children growing up and well schooled calling him uncle clamoured for his blessing he gave that too and in the doorway paused for a moment to look at the flat face of the san tome mountain with a faint frown this slight contraction of his bronzed brow casting a marked tinge of severity upon his usual unbending expression was observed at the lodge which he attendedbut went away before the banquet he wore it at the meeting of some good comrades italians and occidentals assembled in his honour under the presidency of an indigent sickly somewhat hunchbacked little photographer with a white face and a magnanimous soul dyed crimson by a bloodthirsty hate of all capitalists oppressors of the two hemispheres the heroic giorgio viola old revolutionist would have understood nothing of his opening speech and captain fidanza lavishly generous as usual to some poor comrades made no speech at all he had listened frowning with his mind far away and walked off unapproachable silent like a man full of cares  his frown deepened as in the early morning he watched the stonemasons go off to the great isabel in lighters loaded with squared blocks of stone enough to add another course to the squat lighttower that was the rate of the work one course per day  and captain fidanza meditated the presence of strangers on the island would cut him completely off the treasure it had been difficult and dangerous enough before he was afraid and he was angry he thought with the resolution of a master and the cunning of a cowed slave then he went ashore  he was a man of resource and ingenuity and as usual the expedient he found at a critical moment was effective enough to alter the situation radically he had the gift of evolving safety out of the very danger this incomparable nostromo this fellow in a thousand with giorgio established on the great isabel there would be no need for concealment he would be able to go openly in daylight to see his daughtersone of his daughtersand stay late talking to the old garibaldino then in the dark    night after night    he would dare to grow rich quicker now he yearned to clasp embrace absorb subjugate in unquestioned possession this treasure whose tyranny had weighed upon his mind his actions his very sleep  he went to see his friend captain mitchelland the thing was done as dr monygham had related to mrs gould when the project was mooted to the garibaldino something like the faint reflection the dim ghost of a very ancient smile stole under the white and enormous moustaches of the old hater of kings and ministers his daughters were the object of his anxious care the younger especially linda with her mothers voice had taken more her mothers place her deep vibrating eh padre seemed but for the change of the word the very echo of the impassioned remonstrating eh giorgio of poor signora teresa it was his fixed opinion that the town was no proper place for his girls the infatuated but guileless ramirez was the object of his profound aversion as resuming the sins of the country whose people were blind vile esclavos  on his return from his next voyage captain fidanza found the violas settled in the lightkeepers cottage his knowledge of giorgios idiosyncrasies had not played him false the garibaldino had refused to entertain the idea of any companion whatever except his girls and captain mitchell anxious to please his poor nostromo with that felicity of inspiration which only true affection can give had formally appointed linda viola as underkeeper of the isabels light  the light is private property he used to explain it belongs to my company ive the power to nominate whom i like and viola it shall be its about the only thing nostromoa man worth his weight in gold mind youhas ever asked me to do for him  directly his schooner was anchored opposite the new custom house with its sham air of a greek temple flatroofed with a colonnade captain fidanza went pulling his small boat out of the harbour bound for the great isabel openly in the light of a declining day before all mens eyes with a sense of having mastered the fates he must establish a regular position he would ask him for his daughter now he thought of giselle as he pulled linda loved him perhaps but the old man would be glad to keep the elder who had his wifes voice  he did not pull for the narrow strand where he had landed with decoud and afterwards alone on his first visit to the treasure he made for the beach at the other end and walked up the regular and gentle slope of the wedgeshaped island giorgio viola whom he saw from afar sitting on a bench under the front wall of the cottage lifted his arm slightly to his loud hail he walked up neither of the girls appeared  it is good here said the old man in his austere faraway manner  nostromo nodded then after a short silence  you saw my schooner pass in not two hours ago do you know why i am here before so to speak my anchor has fairly bitten into the ground of this port of sulaco  you are welcome like a son the old man declared quietly staring away upon the sea  ah thy son i know i am what thy son would have been it is well viejo it is a very good welcome listen i have come to ask you for  a sudden dread came upon the fearless and incorruptible nostromo he dared not utter the name in his mind the slight pause only imparted a marked weight and solemnity to the changed end of the phrase  for my wife    his heart was beating fast it is time you  the garibaldino arrested him with an extended arm that was left for you to judge  he got up slowly his beard unclipped since teresas death thick snowwhite covered his powerful chest he turned his head to the door and called out in his strong voice  linda  her answer came sharp and faint from within and the appalled nostromo stood up too but remained mute gazing at the door he was afraid he was not afraid of being refused the girl he lovedno mere refusal could stand between him and a woman he desiredbut the shining spectre of the treasure rose before him claiming his allegiance in a silence that could not be gainsaid he was afraid because neither dead nor alive like the gringos on azuera he belonged body and soul to the unlawfulness of his audacity he was afraid of being forbidden the island he was afraid and said nothing  seeing the two men standing up side by side to await her linda stopped in the doorway nothing could alter the passionate dead whiteness of her face but her black eyes seemed to catch and concentrate all the light of the low sun in a flaming spark within the black depths covered at once by the slow descent of heavy eyelids  behold thy husband master and benefactor old violas voice resounded with a force that seemed to fill the whole gulf  she stepped forward with her eyes nearly closed like a sleepwalker in a beatific dream  nostromo made a superhuman effort it is time linda we two were betrothed he said steadily in his level careless unbending tone  she put her hand into his offered palm lowering her head dark with bronze glints upon which her fathers hand rested for a moment  and so the soul of the dead is satisfied  this came from giorgio viola who went on talking for a while of his dead wife while the two sitting side by side never looked at each other then the old man ceased and linda motionless began to speak  ever since i felt i lived in the world i have lived for you alone gian battista and that you knew you knew it    battistino  she pronounced the name exactly with her mothers intonation a gloom as of the grave covered nostromos heart  yes i knew he said  the heroic garibaldino sat on the same bench bowing his hoary head his old soul dwelling alone with its memories tender and violent terrible and drearysolitary on the earth full of men  and linda his bestloved daughter was saying i was yours ever since i can remember i had only to think of you for the earth to become empty to my eyes when you were there i could see no one else i was yours nothing is changed the world belongs to you and you let me live in it    she dropped her low vibrating voice to a still lower note and found other things to saytorturing for the man at her side her murmur ran on ardent and voluble she did not seem to see her sister who came out with an altarcloth she was embroidering in her hands and passed in front of them silent fresh fair with a quick glance and a faint smile to sit a little away on the other side of nostromo  the evening was still the sun sank almost to the edge of a purple ocean and the white lighthouse livid against the background of clouds filling the head of the gulf bore the lantern red and glowing like a live ember kindled by the fire of the sky giselle indolent and demure raised the altarcloth from time to time to hide nervous yawns as of a young panther  suddenly linda rushed at her sister and seizing her head covered her face with kisses nostromos brain reeled when she left her as if stunned by the violent caresses with her hands lying in her lap the slave of the treasure felt as if he could shoot that woman old giorgio lifted his leonine head  where are you going linda  to the light padre mio  si sito your duty  he got up too looked after his eldest daughter then in a tone whose festive note seemed the echo of a mood lost in the night of ages  i am going in to cook something aha son the old man knows where to find a bottle of wine too  he turned to giselle with a change to austere tenderness  and you little one pray not to the god of priests and slaves but to the god of orphans of the oppressed of the poor of little children to give thee a man like this one for a husband  his hand rested heavily for a moment on nostromos shoulder then he went in the hopeless slave of the san tome silver felt at these words the venomous fangs of jealousy biting deep into his heart he was appalled by the novelty of the experience by its force by its physical intimacy a husband a husband for her and yet it was natural that giselle should have a husband at some time or other he had never realized that before in discovering that her beauty could belong to another he felt as though he could kill this one of old giorgios daughters also he muttered moodily  they say you love ramirez  she shook her head without looking at him coppery glints rippled to and fro on the wealth of her gold hair her smooth forehead had the soft pure sheen of a priceless pearl in the splendour of the sunset mingling the gloom of starry spaces the purple of the sea and the crimson of the sky in a magnificent stillness  no she said slowly i never loved him i think i never    he loves meperhaps  the seduction of her slow voice died out of the air and her raised eyes remained fixed on nothing as if indifferent and without thought  ramirez told you he loved you asked nostromo restraining himself  ah onceone evening     the miserable    ha  he had jumped up as if stung by a gadfly and stood before her mute with anger  misericordia divina you too gian battista poor wretch that i am she lamented in ingenuous tones i told linda and she scoldedshe scolded am i to live blind dumb and deaf in this world and she told father who took down his gun and cleaned it poor ramirez then you came and she told you  he looked at her he fastened his eyes upon the hollow of her white throat which had the invincible charm of things young palpitating delicate and alive was this the child he had known was it possible it dawned upon him that in these last years he had really seen very littlenothingof her nothing she had come into the world like a thing unknown she had come upon him unawares she was a danger a frightful danger the instinctive mood of fierce determination that had never failed him before the perils of this life added its steady force to the violence of his passion she in a voice that recalled to him the song of running water the tinkling of a silver bell continued  and between you three you have brought me here into this captivity to the sky and water nothing else sky and water oh sanctissima madre my hair shall turn grey on this tedious island i could hate you gian battista  he laughed loudly her voice enveloped him like a caress she bemoaned her fate spreading unconsciously like a flower its perfume in the coolness of the evening the indefinable seduction of her person was it her fault that nobody ever had admired linda even when they were little going out with their mother to mass she remembered that people took no notice of linda who was fearless and chose instead to frighten her who was timid with their attention it was her hair like gold she supposed  he broke out  your hair like gold and your eyes like violets and your lips like the rose your round arms your white throat     imperturbable in the indolence of her pose she blushed deeply all over to the roots of her hair she was not conceited she was no more selfconscious than a flower but she was pleased and perhaps even a flower loves to hear itself praised he glanced down and added impetuously  your little feet  leaning back against the rough stone wall of the cottage she seemed to bask languidly in the warmth of the rosy flush only her lowered eyes glanced at her little feet  and so you are going at last to marry our linda she is terrible ah now she will understand better since you have told her you love her she will not be so fierce  chica said nostromo i have not told her anything  then make haste come tomorrow come and tell her so that i may have some peace from her scolding andperhapswho knows     be allowed to listen to your ramirez eh is that it you     mercy of god how violent you are giovanni she said unmoved who is ramirez    ramirez    who is he she repeated dreamily in the dusk and gloom of the clouded gulf with a low red streak in the west like a hot bar of glowing iron laid across the entrance of a world sombre as a cavern where the magnificent capataz de cargadores had hidden his conquests of love and wealth  listen giselle he said in measured tones i will tell no word of love to your sister do you want to know why  alas i could not understand perhaps giovanni father says you are not like other men that no one had ever understood you properly that the rich will be surprised yet    oh saints in heaven i am weary  she raised her embroidery to conceal the lower part of her face then let it fall on her lap the lantern was shaded on the land side but slanting away from the dark column of the lighthouse they could see the long shaft of light kindled by linda go out to strike the expiring glow in a horizon of purple and red  giselle viola with her head resting against the wall of the house her eyes half closed and her little feet in white stockings and black slippers crossed over each other seemed to surrender herself tranquil and fatal to the gathering dusk the charm of her body the promising mysteriousness of her indolence went out into the night of the placid gulf like a fresh and intoxicating fragrance spreading out in the shadows impregnating the air the incorruptible nostromo breathed her ambient seduction in the tumultuous heaving of his breast before leaving the harbour he had thrown off the store clothing of captain fidanza for greater ease in the long pull out to the islands he stood before her in the red sash and check shirt as he used to appear on the companys wharfa mediterranean sailor come ashore to try his luck in costaguana the dusk of purple and red enveloped him tooclose soft profound as no more than fifty yards from that spot it had gathered evening after evening about the selfdestructive passion of don martin decouds utter scepticism flaming up to death in solitude  you have got to hear he began at last with perfect selfcontrol i shall say no word of love to your sister to whom i am betrothed from this evening because it is you that i love it is you     the dusk let him see yet the tender and voluptuous smile that came instinctively upon her lips shaped for love and kisses freeze hard in the drawn haggard lines of terror he could not restrain himself any longer while she shrank from his approach her arms went out to him abandoned and regal in the dignity of her languid surrender he held her head in his two hands and showered rapid kisses upon the upturned face that gleamed in the purple dusk masterful and tender he was entering slowly upon the fulness of his possession and he perceived that she was crying then the incomparable capataz the man of careless loves became gentle and caressing like a woman to the grief of a child he murmured to her fondly he sat down by her and nursed her fair head on his breast he called her his star and his little flower  it had grown dark from the livingroom of the lightkeepers cottage where giorgio one of the immortal thousand was bending his leonine and heroic head over a charcoal fire there came the sound of sizzling and the aroma of an artistic frittura  in the obscure disarray of that thing happening like a cataclysm it was in her feminine head that some gleam of reason survived he was lost to the world in their embraced stillness but she said whispering into his ear  god of mercy what will become of meherenowbetween this sky and this water i hate linda lindai see her    she tried to get out of his arms suddenly relaxed at the sound of that name but there was no one approaching their black shapes enlaced and struggling on the white background of the wall linda poor linda i tremble i shall die of fear before my poor sister linda betrothed today to giovannimy lover giovanni you must have been mad i cannot understand you you are not like other men i will not give you upneveronly to god himself but why have you done this blind mad cruel frightful thing  released she hung her head let fall her hands the altarcloth as if tossed by a great wind lay far away from them gleaming white on the black ground  from fear of losing my hope of you said nostromo  you knew that you had my soul you know everything it was made for you but what could stand between you and me what tell me she repeated without impatience in superb assurance  your dead mother he said very low  ah    poor mother she has always    she is a saint in heaven now and i cannot give you up to her no giovanni only to god alone you were madbut it is done oh what have you done giovanni my beloved my life my master do not leave me here in this grave of clouds you cannot leave me now you must take me awayat oncethis instantin the little boat giovanni carry me off tonight from my fear of lindas eyes before i have to look at her again  she nestled close to him the slave of the san tome silver felt the weight as of chains upon his limbs a pressure as of a cold hand upon his lips he struggled against the spell  i cannot he said not yet there is something that stands between us two and the freedom of the world  she pressed her form closer to his side with a subtle and naive instinct of seduction  you rave giovannimy lover she whispered engagingly what can there be carry me offin thy very handsto dona emiliaaway from here i am not very heavy  it seemed as though she expected him to lift her up at once in his two palms she had lost the notion of all impossibility anything could happen on this night of wonder as he made no movement she almost cried aloud  i tell you i am afraid of linda and still he did not move she became quiet and wily what can there be she asked coaxingly  he felt her warm breathing alive quivering in the hollow of his arm in the exulting consciousness of his strength and the triumphant excitement of his mind he struck out for his freedom  a treasure he said all was still she did not understand a treasure a treasure of silver to buy a gold crown for thy brow  a treasure she repeated in a faint voice as if from the depths of a dream what is it you say  she disengaged herself gently he got up and looked down at her aware of her face of her hair her lips the dimples on her cheeksseeing the fascination of her person in the night of the gulf as if in the blaze of noonday her nonchalant and seductive voice trembled with the excitement of admiring awe and ungovernable curiosity  a treasure of silver she stammered out then pressed on faster what where how did you get it giovanni  he wrestled with the spell of captivity it was as if striking a heroic blow that he burst out  like a thief  the densest blackness of the placid gulf seemed to fall upon his head he could not see her now she had vanished into a long obscure abysmal silence whence her voice came back to him after a time with a faint glimmer which was her face  i love you i love you  these words gave him an unwonted sense of freedom they cast a spell stronger than the accursed spell of the treasure they changed his weary subjection to that dead thing into an exulting conviction of his power he would cherish her he said in a splendour as great as dona emilias the rich lived on wealth stolen from the people but he had taken from the rich nothingnothing that was not lost to them already by their folly and their betrayal for he had been betrayedhe saiddeceived tempted she believed him    he had kept the treasure for purposes of revenge but now he cared nothing for it he cared only for her he would put her beauty in a palace on a hill crowned with olive treesa white palace above a blue sea he would keep her there like a jewel in a casket he would get land for herher own land fertile with vines and cornto set her little feet upon he kissed them    he had already paid for it all with the soul of a woman and the life of a man    the capataz de cargadores tasted the supreme intoxication of his generosity he flung the mastered treasure superbly at her feet in the impenetrable darkness of the gulf in the darkness defyingas men saidthe knowledge of god and the wit of the devil but she must let him grow rich firsthe warned her  she listened as if in a trance her fingers stirred in his hair he got up from his knees reeling weak empty as though he had flung his soul away  make haste then she said make haste giovanni my lover my master for i will give thee up to no one but god and i am afraid of linda  he guessed at her shudder and swore to do his best he trusted the courage of her love she promised to be brave in order to be loved alwaysfar away in a white palace upon a hill above a blue sea then with a timid tentative eagerness she murmured  where is it where tell me that giovanni  he opened his mouth and remained silentthunderstruck  not that not that he gasped out appalled at the spell of secrecy that had kept him dumb before so many people falling upon his lips again with unimpaired force not even to her not even to her it was too dangerous i forbid thee to ask he cried at her deadening cautiously the anger of his voice  he had not regained his freedom the spectre of the unlawful treasure arose standing by her side like a figure of silver pitiless and secret with a finger on its pale lips his soul died within him at the vision of himself creeping in presently along the ravine with the smell of earth of damp foliage in his nostrilscreeping in determined in a purpose that numbed his breast and creeping out again loaded with silver with his ears alert to every sound it must be done on this very nightthat work of a craven slave  he stooped low pressed the hem of her skirt to his lips with a muttered command  tell him i would not stay and was gone suddenly from her silent without as much as a footfall in the dark night  she sat still her head resting indolently against the wall and her little feet in white stockings and black slippers crossed over each other old giorgio coming out did not seem to be surprised at the intelligence as much as she had vaguely feared for she was full of inexplicable fear nowfear of everything and everybody except of her giovanni and his treasure but that was incredible  the heroic garibaldino accepted nostromos abrupt departure with a sagacious indulgence he remembered his own feelings and exhibited a masculine penetration of the true state of the case  va bene let him go ha ha no matter how fair the woman it galls a little liberty liberty theres more than one kind he has said the great word and son gian battista is not tame he seemed to be instructing the motionless and scared giselle    a man should not be tame he added dogmatically out of the doorway her stillness and silence seemed to displease him do not give way to the enviousness of your sisters lot he admonished her very grave in his deep voice  presently he had to come to the door again to call in his younger daughter it was late he shouted her name three times before she even moved her head left alone she had become the helpless prey of astonishment she walked into the bedroom she shared with linda like a person profoundly asleep that aspect was so marked that even old giorgio spectacled raising his eyes from the bible shook his head as she shut the door behind her  she walked right across the room without looking at anything and sat down at once by the open window linda stealing down from the tower in the exuberance of her happiness found her with a lighted candle at her back facing the black night full of sighing gusts of wind and the sound of distant showersa true night of the gulf too dense for the eye of god and the wiles of the devil she did not turn her head at the opening of the door  there was something in that immobility which reached linda in the depths of her paradise the elder sister guessed angrily the child is thinking of that wretched ramirez linda longed to talk she said in her arbitrary voice giselle and was not answered by the slightest movement  the girl that was going to live in a palace and walk on ground of her own was ready to die with terror not for anything in the world would she have turned her head to face her sister her heart was beating madly she said with subdued haste  do not speak to me i am praying  linda disappointed went out quietly and giselle sat on unbelieving lost dazed patient as if waiting for the confirmation of the incredible the hopeless blackness of the clouds seemed part of a dream too she waited  she did not wait in vain the man whose soul was dead within him creeping out of the ravine weighted with silver had seen the gleam of the lighted window and could not help retracing his steps from the beach  on that impenetrable background obliterating the lofty mountains by the seaboard she saw the slave of the san tome silver as if by an extraordinary power of a miracle she accepted his return as if henceforth the world could hold no surprise for all eternity  she rose compelled and rigid and began to speak long before the light from within fell upon the face of the approaching man  you have come back to carry me off it is well open thy arms giovanni my lover i am coming  his prudent footsteps stopped and with his eyes glistening wildly he spoke in a harsh voice  not yet i must grow rich slowly    a threatening note came into his tone do not forget that you have a thief for your lover  yes yes she whispered hastily come nearer listen do not give me up giovanni never never    i will be patient     her form drooped consolingly over the low casement towards the slave of the unlawful treasure the light in the room went out and weighted with silver the magnificent capataz clasped her round her white neck in the darkness of the gulf as a drowning man clutches at a straw    chapter thirteen  on the day mrs gould was going in dr monyghams words to give a tertulia captain fidanza went down the side of his schooner lying in sulaco harbour calm unbending deliberate in the way he sat down in his dinghy and took up his sculls he was later than usual the afternoon was well advanced before he landed on the beach of the great isabel and with a steady pace climbed the slope of the island  from a distance he made out giselle sitting in a chair tilted back against the end of the house under the window of the girls room she had her embroidery in her hands and held it well up to her eyes the tranquillity of that girlish figure exasperated the feeling of perpetual struggle and strife he carried in his breast he became angry it seemed to him that she ought to hear the clanking of his fettershis silver fetters from afar and while ashore that day he had met the doctor with the evil eye who had looked at him very hard  the raising of her eyes mollified him they smiled in their flowerlike freshness straight upon his heart then she frowned it was a warning to be cautious he stopped some distance away and in a loud indifferent tone said  good day giselle is linda up yet  yes she is in the big room with father  he approached then and looking through the window into the bedroom for fear of being detected by linda returning there for some reason he said moving only his lips  you love me  more than my life she went on with her embroidery under his contemplating gaze and continued to speak looking at her work or i could not live i could not giovanni for this life is like death oh giovanni i shall perish if you do not take me away  he smiled carelessly i will come to the window when its dark he said  no dont giovanni nottonight linda and father have been talking together for a long time today  what about  ramirez i fancy i heard i do not know i am afraid i am always afraid it is like dying a thousand times a day your love is to me like your treasure to you it is there but i can never get enough of it  he looked at her very still she was beautiful his desire had grown within him he had two masters now but she was incapable of sustained emotion she was sincere in what she said but she slept placidly at night when she saw him she flamed up always then only an increased taciturnity marked the change in her she was afraid of betraying herself she was afraid of pain of bodily harm of sharp words of facing anger and witnessing violence for her soul was light and tender with a pagan sincerity in its impulses she murmured  give up the palazzo giovanni and the vineyard on the hills for which we are starving our love  she ceased seeing linda standing silent at the corner of the house  nostromo turned to his affianced wife with a greeting and was amazed at her sunken eyes at her hollow cheeks at the air of illness and anguish in her face  have you been ill he asked trying to put some concern into this question  her black eyes blazed at him am i thinner she asked  yesperhapsa little  and older  every day countsfor all of us  i shall go grey i fear before the ring is on my finger she said slowly keeping her gaze fastened upon him  she waited for what he would say rolling down her turnedup sleeves  no fear of that he said absently  she turned away as if it had been something final and busied herself with household cares while nostromo talked with her father conversation with the old garibaldino was not easy age had left his faculties unimpaired only they seemed to have withdrawn somewhere deep within him his answers were slow in coming with an effect of august gravity but that day he was more animated quicker there seemed to be more life in the old lion he was uneasy for the integrity of his honour he believed sidonis warning as to ramirezs designs upon his younger daughter and he did not trust her she was flighty he said nothing of his cares to son gian battista it was a touch of senile vanity he wanted to show that he was equal yet to the task of guarding alone the honour of his house  nostromo went away early as soon as he had disappeared walking towards the beach linda stepped over the threshold and with a haggard smile sat down by the side of her father  ever since that sunday when the infatuated and desperate ramirez had waited for her on the wharf she had no doubts whatever the jealous ravings of that man were no revelation they had only fixed with precision as with a nail driven into her heart that sense of unreality and deception which instead of bliss and security she had found in her intercourse with her promised husband she had passed on pouring indignation and scorn upon ramirez but that sunday she nearly died of wretchedness and shame lying on the carved and lettered stone of teresas grave subscribed for by the enginedrivers and the fitters of the railway workshops in sign of their respect for the hero of italian unity old viola had not been able to carry out his desire of burying his wife in the sea and linda wept upon the stone  the gratuitous outrage appalled her if he wished to break her heartwell and good everything was permitted to gian battista but why trample upon the pieces why seek to humiliate her spirit aha he could not break that she dried her tears and giselle giselle the little one that ever since she could toddle had always clung to her skirt for protection what duplicity but she could not help it probably when there was a man in the case the poor featherheaded wretch could not help herself  linda had a good share of the viola stoicism she resolved to say nothing but womanlike she put passion into her stoicism giselles short answers prompted by fearful caution drove her beside herself by their curtness that resembled disdain one day she flung herself upon the chair in which her indolent sister was lying and impressed the mark of her teeth at the base of the whitest neck in sulaco giselle cried out but she had her share of the viola heroism ready to faint with terror she only said in a lazy voice madre de dios are you going to eat me alive linda and this outburst passed off leaving no trace upon the situation she knows nothing she cannot know any thing reflected giselle perhaps it is not true it cannot be true linda tried to persuade herself  but when she saw captain fidanza for the first time after her meeting with the distracted ramirez the certitude of her misfortune returned she watched him from the doorway go away to his boat asking herself stoically will they meet tonight she made up her mind not to leave the tower for a second when he had disappeared she came out and sat down by her father  the venerable garibaldino felt in his own words a young man yet in one way or another a good deal of talk about ramirez had reached him of late and his contempt and dislike of that man who obviously was not what his son would have been had made him restless he slept very little now but for several nights past instead of readingor only sitting with mrs goulds silver spectacles on his nose before the open bible he had been prowling actively all about the island with his old gun on watch over his honour  linda laying her thin brown hand on his knee tried to soothe his excitement ramirez was not in sulaco nobody knew where he was he was gone his talk of what he would do meant nothing  no the old man interrupted but son gian battista told mequite of himselfthat the cowardly esclavo was drinking and gambling with the rascals of zapiga over there on the north side of the gulf he may get some of the worst scoundrels of that scoundrelly town of negroes to help him in his attempt upon the little one    but i am not so old no  she argued earnestly against the probability of any attempt being made and at last the old man fell silent chewing his white moustache women had their obstinate notions which must be humouredhis poor wife was like that and linda resembled her mother it was not seemly for a man to argue may be may be he mumbled  she was by no means easy in her mind she loved nostromo she turned her eyes upon giselle sitting at a distance with something of maternal tenderness and the jealous anguish of a rival outraged in her defeat then she rose and walked over to her  listenyou she said roughly  the invincible candour of the gaze raised up all violet and dew excited her rage and admiration she had beautiful eyesthe chicathis vile thing of white flesh and black deception she did not know whether she wanted to tear them out with shouts of vengeance or cover up their mysterious and shameless innocence with kisses of pity and love and suddenly they became empty gazing blankly at her except for a little fear not quite buried deep enough with all the other emotions in giselles heart  linda said ramirez is boasting in town that he will carry you off from the island  what folly answered the other and in a perversity born of long restraint she added he is not the man in a jesting tone with a trembling audacity  no said linda through her clenched teeth is he not well then look to it because father has been walking about with a loaded gun at night  it is not good for him you must tell him not to linda he will not listen to me  i shall say nothingnever any moreto anybody cried linda passionately  this could not last thought giselle giovanni must take her away soonthe very next time he came she would not suffer these terrors for ever so much silver to speak with her sister made her ill but she was not uneasy at her fathers watchfulness she had begged nostromo not to come to the window that night he had promised to keep away for this once and she did not know could not guess or imagine that he had another reason for coming on the island  linda had gone straight to the tower it was time to light up she unlocked the little door and went heavily up the spiral staircase carrying her love for the magnificent capataz de cargadores like an everincreasing load of shameful fetters no she could not throw it off no let heaven dispose of these two and moving about the lantern filled with twilight and the sheen of the moon with careful movements she lighted the lamp then her arms fell along her body  and with our mother looking on she murmured my own sisterthe chica  the whole refracting apparatus with its brass fittings and rings of prisms glittered and sparkled like a domeshaped shrine of diamonds containing not a lamp but some sacred flame dominating the sea and linda the keeper in black with a pale face drooped low in a wooden chair alone with her jealousy far above the shames and passions of the earth a strange dragging pain as if somebody were pulling her about brutally by her dark hair with bronze glints made her put her hands up to her temples they would meet they would meet and she knew where too at the window the sweat of torture fell in drops on her cheeks while the moonlight in the offing closed as if with a colossal bar of silver the entrance of the placid gulfthe sombre cavern of clouds and stillness in the surffretted seaboard  linda viola stood up suddenly with a finger on her lip he loved neither her nor her sister the whole thing seemed so objectless as to frighten her and also give her some hope why did he not carry her off what prevented him he was incomprehensible what were they waiting for for what end were these two lying and deceiving not for the ends of their love there was no such thing the hope of regaining him for herself made her break her vow of not leaving the tower that night she must talk at once to her father who was wise and would understand she ran down the spiral stairs at the moment of opening the door at the bottom she heard the sound of the first shot ever fired on the great isabel  she felt a shock as though the bullet had struck her breast she ran on without pausing the cottage was dark she cried at the door giselle giselle then dashed round the corner and screamed her sisters name at the open window without getting an answer but as she was rushing distracted round the house giselle came out of the door and darted past her running silently her hair loose and her eyes staring straight ahead she seemed to skim along the grass as if on tiptoe and vanished  linda walked on slowly with her arms stretched out before her all was still on the island she did not know where she was going the tree under which martin decoud spent his last days beholding life like a succession of senseless images threw a large blotch of black shade upon the grass suddenly she saw her father standing quietly all alone in the moonlight  the garibaldinobig erect with his snowwhite hair and beardhad a monumental repose in his immobility leaning upon a rifle she put her hand upon his arm lightly he never stirred  what have you done she asked in her ordinary voice  i have shot ramirezinfame he answered with his eyes directed to where the shade was blackest like a thief he came and like a thief he fell the child had to be protected  he did not offer to move an inch to advance a single step he stood there rugged and unstirring like a statue of an old man guarding the honour of his house linda removed her trembling hand from his arm firm and steady like an arm of stone and without a word entered the blackness of the shade she saw a stir of formless shapes on the ground and stopped short a murmur of despair and tears grew louder to her strained hearing  i entreated you not to come tonight oh my giovanni and you promised oh whywhy did you come giovanni  it was her sisters voice it broke on a heartrending sob and the voice of the resourceful capataz de cargadores master and slave of the san tome treasure who had been caught unawares by old giorgio while stealing across the open towards the ravine to get some more silver answered careless and cool but sounding startlingly weak from the ground  it seemed as though i could not live through the night without seeing thee once moremy star my little flower        the brilliant tertulia was just over the last guests had departed and the senor administrador had gone to his room already when dr monygham who had been expected in the evening but had not turned up arrived driving along the woodblock pavement under the electriclamps of the deserted calle de la constitucion and found the great gateway of the casa still open  he limped in stumped up the stairs and found the fat and sleek basilio on the point of turning off the lights in the sala the prosperous majordomo remained openmouthed at this late invasion  dont put out the lights commanded the doctor i want to see the senora  the senora is in the senor adminstradors cancillaria said basilio in an unctuous voice the senor administrador starts for the mountain in an hour there is some trouble with the workmen to be feared it appears a shameless people without reason and decency and idle senor idle  you are shamelessly lazy and imbecile yourself said the doctor with that faculty for exasperation which made him so generally beloved dont put the lights out  basilio retired with dignity dr monygham waiting in the brilliantly lighted sala heard presently a door close at the further end of the house a jingle of spurs died out the senor administrador was off to the mountain  with a measured swish of her long train flashing with jewels and the shimmer of silk her delicate head bowed as if under the weight of a mass of fair hair in which the silver threads were lost the first lady of sulaco as captain mitchell used to describe her moved along the lighted corredor wealthy beyond great dreams of wealth considered loved respected honoured and as solitary as any human being had ever been perhaps on this earth  the doctors mrs gould one minute stopped her with a start at the door of the lighted and empty sala from the similarity of mood and circumstance the sight of the doctor standing there all alone amongst the groups of furniture recalled to her emotional memory her unexpected meeting with martin decoud she seemed to hear in the silence the voice of that man dead miserably so many years ago pronounce the words antonia left her fan here but it was the doctors voice that spoke a little altered by his excitement she remarked his shining eyes  mrs gould you are wanted do you know what has happened you remember what i told you yesterday about nostromo well it seems that a lancha a decked boat coming from zapiga with four negroes in her passing close to the great isabel was hailed from the cliff by a womans voicelindas as a matter of factcommanding them its a moonlight night to go round to the beach and take up a wounded man to the town the patron from whom ive heard all this of course did so at once he told me that when they got round to the low side of the great isabel they found linda viola waiting for them they followed her she led them under a tree not far from the cottage there they found nostromo lying on the ground with his head in the younger girls lap and father viola standing some distance off leaning on his gun under lindas direction they got a table out of the cottage for a stretcher after breaking off the legs they are here mrs gould i mean nostromo andand giselle the negroes brought him in to the firstaid hospital near the harbour he made the attendant send for me but it was not me he wanted to seeit was you mrs gould it was you  me whispered mrs gould shrinking a little  yes you the doctor burst out he begged mehis enemy as he thinksto bring you to him at once it seems he has something to say to you alone  impossible murmured mrs gould  he said to me remind her that i have done something to keep a roof over her head    mrs gould the doctor pursued in the greatest excitement do you remember the silver the silver in the lighterthat was lost  mrs gould remembered but she did not say she hated the mere mention of that silver frankness personified she remembered with an exaggerated horror that for the first and last time of her life she had concealed the truth from her husband about that very silver she had been corrupted by her fears at that time and she had never forgiven herself moreover that silver which would never have come down if her husband had been made acquainted with the news brought by decoud had been in a roundabout way nearly the cause of dr monyghams death and these things appeared to her very dreadful  was it lost though the doctor exclaimed ive always felt that there was a mystery about our nostromo ever since i do believe he wants now at the point of death  the point of death repeated mrs gould  yes yes    he wants perhaps to tell you something concerning that silver which  oh no no exclaimed mrs gould in a low voice isnt it lost and done with isnt there enough treasure without it to make everybody in the world miserable  the doctor remained still in a submissive disappointed silence at last he ventured very low  and there is that viola girl giselle what are we to do it looks as though father and sister had  mrs gould admitted that she felt in duty bound to do her best for these girls  i have a volante here the doctor said if you dont mind getting into that  he waited all impatience till mrs gould reappeared having thrown over her dress a grey cloak with a deep hood  it was thus that cloaked and monastically hooded over her evening costume this woman full of endurance and compassion stood by the side of the bed on which the splendid capataz de cargadores lay stretched out motionless on his back the whiteness of sheets and pillows gave a sombre and energetic relief to his bronzed face to the dark nervous hands so good on a tiller upon a bridle and on a trigger lying open and idle upon a white coverlet  she is innocent the capataz was saying in a deep and level voice as though afraid that a louder word would break the slender hold his spirit still kept upon his body she is innocent it is i alone but no matter for these things i would answer to no man or woman alive  he paused mrs goulds face very white within the shadow of the hood bent over him with an invincible and dreary sadness and the low sobs of giselle viola kneeling at the end of the bed her gold hair with coppery gleams loose and scattered over the capatazs feet hardly troubled the silence of the room  ha old giorgiothe guardian of thine honour fancy the vecchio coming upon me so light of foot so steady of aim i myself could have done no better but the price of a charge of powder might have been saved the honour was safe    senora she would have followed to the end of the world nostromo the thief    i have said the word the spell is broken  a low moan from the girl made him cast his eyes down  i cannot see her    no matter he went on with the shadow of the old magnificent carelessness in his voice one kiss is enough if there is no time for more an airy soul senora bright and warm like sunshinesoon clouded and soon serene they would crush it there between them senora cast on her the eye of your compassion as famed from one end of the land to the other as the courage and daring of the man who speaks to you she will console herself in time and even ramirez is not a bad fellow i am not angry no it is not ramirez who overcame the capataz of the sulaco cargadores he paused made an effort and in louder voice a little wildly declared  i die betrayedbetrayed by  but he did not say by whom or by what he was dying betrayed  she would not have betrayed me he began again opening his eyes very wide she was faithful we were going very farvery soon i could have torn myself away from that accursed treasure for her for that child i would have left boxes and boxes of itfull and decoud took four four ingots why picardia to betray me how could i give back the treasure with four ingots missing they would have said i had purloined them the doctor would have said that alas it holds me yet  mrs gould bent low fascinatedcold with apprehension  what became of don martin on that night nostromo  who knows i wondered what would become of me now i know death was to come upon me unawares he went away he betrayed me and you think i have killed him you are all alike you fine people the silver has killed me it has held me it holds me yet nobody knows where it is but you are the wife of don carlos who put it into my hands and said save it on your life and when i returned and you all thought it was lost what do i hear it was nothing of importance let it go up nostromo the faithful and ride away to save us for dear life  nostromo mrs gould whispered bending very low i too have hated the idea of that silver from the bottom of my heart  marvellousthat one of you should hate the wealth that you know so well how to take from the hands of the poor the world rests upon the poor as old giorgio says you have been always good to the poor but there is something accursed in wealth senora shall i tell you where the treasure is to you alone    shining incorruptible  a pained involuntary reluctance lingered in his tone in his eyes plain to the woman with the genius of sympathetic intuition she averted her glance from the miserable subjection of the dying man appalled wishing to hear no more of the silver  no capataz she said no one misses it now let it be lost for ever  after hearing these words nostromo closed his eyes uttered no word made no movement outside the door of the sickroom dr monygham excited to the highest pitch his eyes shining with eagerness came up to the two women  now mrs gould he said almost brutally in his impatience tell me was i right there is a mystery you have got the word of it have you not he told you  he told me nothing said mrs gould steadily  the light of his temperamental enmity to nostromo went out of dr monyghams eyes he stepped back submissively he did not believe mrs gould but her word was law he accepted her denial like an inexplicable fatality affirming the victory of nostromos genius over his own even before that woman whom he loved with secret devotion he had been defeated by the magnificent capataz de cargadores the man who had lived his own life on the assumption of unbroken fidelity rectitude and courage  pray send at once somebody for my carriage spoke mrs gould from within her hood then turning to giselle viola come nearer me child come closer we will wait here  giselle viola heartbroken and childlike her face veiled in her falling hair crept up to her side mrs gould slipped her hand through the arm of the unworthy daughter of old viola the immaculate republican the hero without a stain slowly gradually as a withered flower droops the head of the girl who would have followed a thief to the end of the world rested on the shoulder of dona emilia the first lady of sulaco the wife of the senor administrador of the san tome mine and mrs gould feeling her suppressed sobbing nervous and excited had the first and only moment of bitterness in her life it was worthy of dr monygham himself  console yourself child very soon he would have forgotten you for his treasure  senora he loved me he loved me giselle whispered despairingly he loved me as no one had ever been loved before  i have been loved too mrs gould said in a severe tone  giselle clung to her convulsively oh senora but you shall live adored to the end of your life she sobbed out  mrs gould kept an unbroken silence till the carriage arrived she helped in the halffainting girl after the doctor had shut the door of the landau she leaned over to him  you can do nothing she whispered  no mrs gould moreover he wont let us touch him it does not matter i just had one look    useless  but he promised to see old viola and the other girl that very night he could get the policeboat to take him off to the island he remained in the street looking after the landau rolling away slowly behind the white mules  the rumour of some accidentan accident to captain fidanzahad been spreading along the new quays with their rows of lamps and the dark shapes of towering cranes a knot of night prowlersthe poorest of the poorhung about the door of the firstaid hospital whispering in the moonlight of the empty street  there was no one with the wounded man but the pale photographer small frail bloodthirsty the hater of capitalists perched on a high stool near the head of the bed with his knees up and his chin in his hands he had been fetched by a comrade who working late on the wharf had heard from a negro belonging to a lancha that captain fidanza had been brought ashore mortally wounded  have you any dispositions to make comrade he asked anxiously do not forget that we want money for our work the rich must be fought with their own weapons  nostromo made no answer the other did not insist remaining huddled up on the stool shockheaded wildly hairy like a hunchbacked monkey then after a long silence  comrade fidanza he began solemnly you have refused all aid from that doctor is he really a dangerous enemy of the people  in the dimly lit room nostromo rolled his head slowly on the pillow and opened his eyes directing at the weird figure perched by his bedside a glance of enigmatic and profound inquiry then his head rolled back his eyelids fell and the capataz de cargadores died without a word or moan after an hour of immobility broken by short shudders testifying to the most atrocious sufferings  dr monygham going out in the policegalley to the islands beheld the glitter of the moon upon the gulf and the high black shape of the great isabel sending a shaft of light afar from under the canopy of clouds  pull easy he said wondering what he would find there he tried to imagine linda and her father and discovered a strange reluctance within himself pull easy he repeated         from the moment he fired at the thief of his honour giorgio viola had not stirred from the spot he stood his old gun grounded his hand grasping the barrel near the muzzle after the lancha carrying off nostromo for ever from her had left the shore linda coming up stopped before him he did not seem to be aware of her presence but when losing her forced calmness she cried out  do you know whom you have killed he answered  ramirez the vagabond  white and staring insanely at her father linda laughed in his face after a time he joined her faintly in a deeptoned and distant echo of her peals then she stopped and the old man spoke as if startled  he cried out in son gian battistas voice  the gun fell from his opened hand but the arm remained extended for a moment as if still supported linda seized it roughly  you are too old to understand come into the house  he let her lead him on the threshold he stumbled heavily nearly coming to the ground together with his daughter his excitement his activity of the last few days had been like the flare of a dying lamp he caught at the back of his chair  in son gian battistas voice he repeated in a severe tone i heard himramirezthe miserable  linda helped him into the chair and bending low hissed into his ear  you have killed gian battista  the old man smiled under his thick moustache women had strange fancies  where is the child he asked surprised at the penetrating chilliness of the air and the unwonted dimness of the lamp by which he used to sit up half the night with the open bible before him  linda hesitated a moment then averted her eyes  she is asleep she said we shall talk of her tomorrow  she could not bear to look at him he filled her with terror and with an almost unbearable feeling of pity she had observed the change that came over him he would never understand what he had done and even to her the whole thing remained incomprehensible he said with difficulty  give me the book  linda laid on the table the closed volume in its worn leather cover the bible given him ages ago by an englishman in palermo  the child had to be protected he said in a strange mournful voice  behind his chair linda wrung her hands crying without noise suddenly she started for the door he heard her move  where are you going he asked  to the light she answered turning round to look at him balefully  the light siduty  very upright whitehaired leonine heroic in his absorbed quietness he felt in the pocket of his red shirt for the spectacles given him by dona emilia he put them on after a long period of immobility he opened the book and from on high looked through the glasses at the small print in double columns a rigid stern expression settled upon his features with a slight frown as if in response to some gloomy thought or unpleasant sensation but he never detached his eyes from the book while he swayed forward gently gradually till his snowwhite head rested upon the open pages a wooden clock ticked methodically on the whitewashed wall and growing slowly cold the garibaldino lay alone rugged undecayed like an old oak uprooted by a treacherous gust of wind  the light of the great isabel burned unfailing above the lost treasure of the san tome mine into the bluish sheen of a night without stars the lantern sent out a yellow beam towards the far horizon like a black speck upon the shining panes linda crouching in the outer gallery rested her head on the rail the moon drooping in the western board looked at her radiantly  below at the foot of the cliff the regular splash of oars from a passing boat ceased and dr monygham stood up in the stern sheets  linda he shouted throwing back his head linda  linda stood up she had recognized the voice  is he dead she cried bending over  yes my poor girl i am coming round the doctor answered from below pull to the beach he said to the rowers  lindas black figure detached itself upright on the light of the lantern with her arms raised above her head as though she were going to throw herself over  it is i who loved you she whispered with a face as set and white as marble in the moonlight i only i she will forget thee killed miserably for her pretty face i cannot understand i cannot understand but i shall never forget thee never  she stood silent and still collecting her strength to throw all her fidelity her pain bewilderment and despair into one great cry  never gian battista  dr monygham pulling round in the policegalley heard the name pass over his head it was another of nostromos triumphs the greatest the most enviable the most sinister of all in that true cry of undying passion that seemed to ring aloud from punta mala to azuera and away to the bright line of the horizon overhung by a big white cloud shining like a mass of solid silver the genius of the magnificent capataz de cargadores dominated the dark gulf containing his conquests of treasure and love
