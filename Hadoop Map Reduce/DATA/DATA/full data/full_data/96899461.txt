96899461	memoir of fleeming jenkin     preface to the american edition    on the death of fleeming jenkin his family and friends determined  to publish a selection of his various papers by way of  introduction the following pages were drawn up and the whole  forming two considerable volumes has been issued in england  in  the states it has not been thought advisable to reproduce the  whole and the memoir appearing alone shorn of that other matter  which was at once its occasion and its justification so large an  account of a man so little known may seem to a stranger out of all  proportion  but jenkin was a man much more remarkable than the  mere bulk or merit of his work approves him  it was in the world  in the commerce of friendship by his brave attitude towards life  by his high moral value and unwearied intellectual effort that he  struck the minds of his contemporaries  his was an individual  figure such as authors delight to draw and all men to read of in  the pages of a novel  his was a face worth painting for its own  sake  if the sitter shall not seem to have justified the portrait  if jenkin after his death shall not continue to make new friends  the fault will be altogether mine  r l s  saranac oct 1887    chapter i    the jenkins of stowting  fleemings grandfather  mrs buckners  fortune  fleemings father goes to sea at st helena meets king  tom service in the west indies end of his career  the campbell jacksons  fleemings mother  fleemings uncle john   in the reign of henry viii a family of the name of jenkin  claiming to come from york and bearing the arms of jenkin ap  philip of st melans are found reputably settled in the county of  kent  persons of strong genealogical pinion pass from william  jenkin mayor of folkestone in 1555 to his contemporary john  jenkin of the citie of york receiver general of the county and  thence by way of jenkin ap philip to the proper summit of any  cambrian pedigree  a prince guaith voeth lord of cardigan the  name and style of him  it may suffice however for the present  that these kentish jenkins must have undoubtedly derived from  wales and being a stock of some efficiency they struck root and  grew to wealth and consequence in their new home  of their consequence we have proof enough in the fact that not only  was william jenkin as already mentioned mayor of folkestone in  1555 but no less than twentythree times in the succeeding century  and a half a jenkin william thomas henry or robert sat in the  same place of humble honour  of their wealth we know that in the  reign of charles i thomas jenkin of eythorne was more than once  in the market buying land and notably in 1633 acquired the manor  of stowting court  this was an estate of some 320 acres six miles  from hythe in the bailiwick and hundred of stowting and the lathe  of shipway held of the crown in capite by the service of six men  and a constable to defend the passage of the sea at sandgate  it  had a chequered history before it fell into the hands of thomas of  eythorne having been sold and given from one to another  to the  archbishop to heringods to the burghershes to pavelys trivets  cliffords wenlocks beauchamps nevilles kempes and clarkes  a  piece of kentish ground condemned to see new faces and to be no  mans home  but from 1633 onward it became the anchor of the  jenkin family in kent and though passed on from brother to  brother held in shares between uncle and nephew burthened by  debts and jointures and at least once sold and bought in again it  remains to this day in the hands of the direct line  it is not my  design nor have i the necessary knowledge to give a history of  this obscure family  but this is an age when genealogy has taken a  new lease of life and become for the first time a human science  so that we no longer study it in quest of the guaith voeths but to  trace out some of the secrets of descent and destiny and as we  study we think less of sir bernard burke and more of mr galton   not only do our character and talents lie upon the anvil and  receive their temper during generations but the very plot of our  lifes story unfolds itself on a scale of centuries and the  biography of the man is only an episode in the epic of the family   from this point of view i ask the readers leave to begin this  notice of a remarkable man who was my friend with the accession of  his greatgrandfather john jenkin  this john jenkin a grandson of damaris kingsley of the family of  westward ho was born in 1727 and married elizabeth daughter of  thomas frewen of church house northiam  the jenkins had now been  long enough intermarrying with their kentish neighbours to be  kentish folk themselves in all but name and with the frewens in  particular their connection is singularly involved  john and his  wife were each descended in the third degree from another thomas  frewen vicar of northiam and brother to accepted frewen  archbishop of york  johns mother had married a frewen for a  second husband  and the last complication was to be added by the  bishop of chichesters brother charles buckner viceadmiral of  the white who was twice married first to a paternal cousin of  squire john and second to anne only sister of the squires wife  and already the widow of another frewen  the reader must bear mrs  buckner in mind it was by means of that lady that fleeming jenkin  began life as a poor man  meanwhile the relationship of any  frewen to any jenkin at the end of these evolutions presents a  problem almost insoluble and we need not wonder if mrs john thus  exercised in her immediate circle was in her old age a great  genealogist of all sussex families and much consulted  the names  frewen and jenkin may almost seem to have been interchangeable at  will and yet fate proceeds with such particularity that it was  perhaps on the point of name that the family was ruined  the john jenkins had a family of one daughter and five extravagant  and unpractical sons  the eldest stephen entered the church and  held the living of salehurst where he offered we may hope an  extreme example of the clergy of the age  he was a handsome figure  of a man jovial and jocular fond of his garden which produced  under his care the finest fruits of the neighbourhood and like all  the family very choice in horses  he drove tandem like jehu  furiously  his saddle horse captain for the names of horses are  piously preserved in the family chronicle which i follow was  trained to break into a gallop as soon as the vicars foot was  thrown across its back nor would the rein be drawn in the nine  miles between northiam and the vicarage door  debt was the mans  proper element he used to skulk from arrest in the chancel of his  church and the speed of captain may have come sometimes handy  at  an early age this unconventional parson married his cook and by  her he had two daughters and one son  one of the daughters died  unmarried the other imitated her father and married  imprudently  the son still more gallantly continuing the  tradition entered the army loaded himself with debt was forced  to sell out took refuge in the marines and was lost on the dogger  bank in the warship minotaur  if he did not marry below him like  his father his sister and a certain greatuncle william it was  perhaps because he never married at all  the second brother thomas who was employed in the general post office followed in all material points the example of stephen  married not very creditably and spent all the money he could lay  his hands on  he died without issue as did the fourth brother  john who was of weak intellect and feeble health and the fifth  brother william whose brief career as one of mrs buckners  satellites will fall to be considered later on  so soon then as  the minotaur had struck upon the dogger bank stowting and the line  of the jenkin family fell on the shoulders of the third brother  charles  facility and selfindulgence are the family marks facility to  judge by these imprudent marriages being at once their quality and  their defect but in the case of charles a man of exceptional  beauty and sweetness both of face and disposition the family fault  had quite grown to be a virtue and we find him in consequence the  drudge and milkcow of his relatives  born in 1766 charles served  at sea in his youth and smelt both salt water and powder  the  jenkins had inclined hitherto as far as i can make out to the  land service  stephens son had been a soldier william fourth of  stowting had been an officer of the unhappy braddocks in america  where by the way he owned and afterwards sold an estate on the  james river called after the parental seat of which i should  like well to hear if it still bears the name  it was probably by  the influence of captain buckner already connected with the family  by his first marriage that charles jenkin turned his mind in the  direction of the navy and it was in buckners own ship the  prothee 64 that the lad made his only campaign  it was in the  days of rodneys war when the prothee we read captured two large  privateers to windward of barbadoes and was materially and  distinguishedly engaged in both the actions with de grasse  while  at sea charles kept a journal and made strange archaic pilotbook  sketches part plan part elevation some of which survive for the  amusement of posterity  he did a good deal of surveying so that  here we may perhaps lay our finger on the beginning of fleemings  education as an engineer  what is still more strange among the  relics of the handsome midshipman and his stay in the gunroom of  the prothee i find a code of signals graphically represented for  all the world as it would have been done by his grandson  on the declaration of peace charles because he had suffered from  scurvy received his mothers orders to retire and he was not the  man to refuse a request far less to disobey a command  thereupon  he turned farmer a trade he was to practice on a large scale and  we find him married to a miss schirr a woman of some fortune the  daughter of a london merchant  stephen the not very reverend was  still alive galloping about the country or skulking in his  chancel  it does not appear whether he let or sold the paternal  manor to charles one or other it must have been and the sailor farmer settled at stowting with his wife his mother his  unmarried sister and his sick brother john  out of the six people  of whom his nearest family consisted three were in his own house  and two others the horseleeches stephen and thomas he appears  to have continued to assist with more amiability than wisdom  he  hunted belonged to the yeomanry owned famous horses maggie and  lucy the latter coveted by royalty itself  lord rokeby his  neighbour called him kinsman writes my artless chronicler and  altogether life was very cheery  at stowting his three sons  john charles and thomas frewen and his younger daughter anna  were all born to him and the reader should here be told that it is  through the report of this second charles born 1801 that he has  been looking on at these confused passages of family history  in the year 1805 the ruin of the jenkins was begun  it was the  work of a fallacious lady already mentioned aunt anne frewen a  sister of mrs john  twice married first to her cousin charles  frewen clerk to the court of chancery brunswick herald and usher  of the black rod and secondly to admiral buckner she was denied  issue in both beds and being very rich  she died worth about  60000l mostly in land  she was in perpetual quest of an heir   the mirage of this fortune hung before successive members of the  jenkin family until her death in 1825 when it dissolved and left  the latest alnaschar face to face with bankruptcy  the grandniece  stephens daughter the one who had not married imprudently  appears to have been the first for she was taken abroad by the  golden aunt and died in her care at ghent in 1792  next she  adopted william the youngest of the five nephews took him abroad  with her  it seems as if that were in the formula was shut up  with him in paris by the revolution brought him back to windsor  and got him a place in the kings bodyguard where he attracted  the notice of george iii by his proficiency in german  in 1797  being on guard at st jamess palace william took a cold which  carried him off and aunt anne was once more left heirless   lastly in 1805 perhaps moved by the admiral who had a kindness  for his old midshipman perhaps pleased by the good looks and the  good nature of the man himself mrs buckner turned her eyes upon  charles jenkin  he was not only to be the heir however he was to  be the chief hand in a somewhat wild scheme of family farming   mrs jenkin the mother contributed 164 acres of land mrs  buckner 570 some at northiam some farther off charles let one half of stowting to a tenant and threw the other and various  scattered parcels into the common enterprise so that the whole  farm amounted to near upon a thousand acres and was scattered over  thirty miles of country  the exseaman of thirtynine on whose  wisdom and ubiquity the scheme depended was to live in the  meanwhile without care or fear  he was to check himself in  nothing his two extravagances valuable horses and worthless  brothers were to be indulged in comfort and whether the year  quite paid itself or not whether successive years left accumulated  savings or only a growing deficit the fortune of the golden aunt  should in the end repair all  on this understanding charles jenkin transported his family to  church house northiam  charles the second then a child of three  among the number  through the eyes of the boy we have glimpses of  the life that followed  of admiral and mrs buckner driving up  from windsor in a coach and six two posthorses and their own  four of the house full of visitors the great roasts at the fire  the tables in the servants hall laid for thirty or forty for a  month together of the daily press of neighbours many of whom  frewens lords bishops batchellors and dynes were also  kinsfolk and the parties under the great spreading chestnuts of  the old fore court where the young people danced and made merry  to the music of the village band  or perhaps in the depth of  winter the father would bid young charles saddle his pony they  would ride the thirty miles from northiam to stowting with the  snow to the ponys saddle girths and be received by the tenants  like princes  this life of delights with the continual visible comings and  goings of the golden aunt was well qualified to relax the fibre of  the lads  john the heir a yeoman and a foxhunter loud and  notorious with his whip and spurs settled down into a kind of  tony lumpkin waiting for the shoes of his father and his aunt   thomas frewen the youngest is briefly dismissed as a handsome  beau but he had the merit or the good fortune to become a doctor  of medicine so that when the crash came he was not emptyhanded  for the war of life  charles at the dayschool of northiam grew  so well acquainted with the rod that his floggings became matter  of pleasantry and reached the ears of admiral buckner  hereupon  that tall roughvoiced formidable uncle entered with the lad into  a covenant  every time that charles was thrashed he was to pay the  admiral a penny everyday that he escaped the process was to be  reversed  i recollect writes charles going crying to my  mother to be taken to the admiral to pay my debt  it would seem  by these terms the speculation was a losing one yet it is probable  it paid indirectly by bringing the boy under remark  the admiral  was no enemy to dunces he loved courage and charles while yet  little more than a baby would ride the great horse into the pond   presently it was decided that here was the stuff of a fine sailor  and at an early period the name of charles jenkin was entered on a  ships books  from northiam he was sent to another school at boonshill near rye  where the master took infinite delight in strapping him  it  keeps me warm and makes you grow he used to say  and the stripes  were not altogether wasted for the dunce though still very raw  made progress with his studies  it was known moreover that he  was going to sea always a ground of preeminence with schoolboys  and in his case the glory was not altogether future it wore a  present form when he came driving to rye behind four horses in the  same carriage with an admiral  i was not a little proud you may  believe says he  in 1814 when he was thirteen years of age he was carried by his  father to chichester to the bishops palace  the bishop had heard  from his brother the admiral that charles was likely to do well  and had an order from lord melville for the lads admission to the  royal naval college at portsmouth  both the bishop and the admiral  patted him on the head and said charles will restore the old  family by which i gather with some surprise that even in these  days of open house at northiam and golden hope of my aunts  fortune the family was supposed to stand in need of restoration   but the past is apt to look brighter than nature above all to  those enamoured of their genealogy and the ravages of stephen and  thomas must have always given matter of alarm  what with the flattery of bishops and admirals the fine company in  which he found himself at portsmouth his visits home with their  gaiety and greatness of life his visits to mrs buckner soon a  widow at windsor where he had a pony kept for him and visited at  lord melvilles and lord harcourts and the levesongowers he  began to have bumptious notions and his head was somewhat  turned with fine people as to some extent it remained throughout  his innocent and honourable life  in this frame of mind the boy was appointed to the conqueror  captain davie humorously known as gentle johnnie  the captain had  earned this name by his style of discipline which would have  figured well in the pages of marryat  put the prisoners head in  a bag and give him another dozen survives as a specimen of his  commands and the men were often punished twice or thrice in a  week  on board the ship of this disciplinarian charles and his  father were carried in a billyboat from sheerness in december  1816  charles with an outfit suitable to his pretensions a  twentyguinea sextant and 120 dollars in silver which were ordered  into the care of the gunner  the old clerks and mates he  writes used to laugh and jeer me for joining the ship in a billy boat and when they found i was from kent vowed i was an old  kentish smuggler  this to my pride you will believe was not a  little offensive  the conqueror carried the flag of viceadmiral plampin commanding  at the cape and st helena and at that allimportant islet in  july 1817 she relieved the flagship of sir pulteney malcolm   thus it befel that charles jenkin coming too late for the epic of  the french wars played a small part in the dreary and disgraceful  afterpiece of st helena  life on the guardship was onerous and  irksome  the anchor was never lifted sail never made the great  guns were silent none was allowed on shore except on duty all day  the movements of the imperial captive were signalled to and fro  all night the boats rowed guard around the accessible portions of  the coast  this prolonged stagnation and petty watchfulness in  what napoleon himself called that unchristian climate told  cruelly on the health of the ships company  in eighteen months  according to omeara the conqueror had lost one hundred and ten  men and invalided home one hundred and seven being more than a  third of her complement  it does not seem that our young  midshipman so much as once set eyes on bonaparte and yet in other  ways jenkin was more fortunate than some of his comrades  he drew  in watercolour not so badly as his father yet ill enough and  this art was so rare aboard the conqueror that even his humble  proficiency marked him out and procured him some alleviations   admiral plampin had succeeded napoleon at the briars and here he  had young jenkin staying with him to make sketches of the historic  house  one of these is before me as i write and gives a strange  notion of the arts in our old english navy  yet it was again as an  artist that the lad was taken for a run to rio and apparently for  a second outing in a tengun brig  these and a cruise of six  weeks to windward of the island undertaken by the conqueror herself  in quest of health were the only breaks in three years of  murderous inaction and at the end of that period jenkin was  invalided home having lost his health entirely  as he left the deck of the guardship the historic part of his  career came to an end  for fortytwo years he continued to serve  his country obscurely on the seas sometimes thanked for  inconspicuous and honourable services but denied any opportunity  of serious distinction  he was first two years in the larne  captain tait hunting pirates and keeping a watch on the turkish  and greek squadrons in the archipelago  captain tait was a  favourite with sir thomas maitland high commissioner of the ionian  islands  king tom as he was called  who frequently took passage  in the larne  king tom knew every inch of the mediterranean and  was a terror to the officers of the watch  he would come on deck  at night and with his broad scotch accent well sir he would  say what depth of water have ye  well now sound and yell just  find so or so many fathoms as the case might be and the  obnoxious passenger was generally right  on one occasion as the  ship was going into corfu sir thomas came up the hatchway and cast  his eyes towards the gallows  bangham  charles jenkin heard him  say to his aidedecamp lord bangham  where the devil is that  other chap  i left four fellows hanging there now i can only see  three  mind there is another there tomorrow  and sure enough  there was another greek dangling the next day  captain hamilton  of the cambrian kept the greeks in order afloat writes my  author and king tom ashore  from 1823 onward the chief scene of charles jenkins activities  was in the west indies where he was engaged off and on till 1844  now as a subaltern now in a vessel of his own hunting out  pirates then very notorious in the leeward islands cruising  after slavers or carrying dollars and provisions for the  government  while yet a midshipman he accompanied mr cockburn to  caraccas and had a sight of bolivar  in the brigantine griffon  which he commanded in his last years in the west indies he carried  aid to guadeloupe after the earthquake and twice earned the thanks  of government  once for an expedition to nicaragua to extort  under threat of a blockade proper apologies and a sum of money due  to certain british merchants and once during an insurrection in  san domingo for the rescue of certain others from a perilous  imprisonment and the recovery of a chest of money of which they  had been robbed  once on the other hand he earned his share of  public censure  this was in 1837 when he commanded the romney  lying in the inner harbour of havannah  the romney was in no  proper sense a manofwar she was a slavehulk the bonded  warehouse of the mixed slave commission where negroes captured  out of slavers under spanish colours were detained provisionally  till the commission should decide upon their case and either set  them free or bind them to apprenticeship  to this ship already an  eyesore to the authorities a cuban slave made his escape  the  position was invidious on one side were the tradition of the  british flag and the state of public sentiment at home on the  other the certainty that if the slave were kept the romney would  be ordered at once out of the harbour and the object of the mixed  commission compromised  without consultation with any other  officer captain jenkin then lieutenant returned the man to shore  and took the captaingenerals receipt  lord palmerston approved  his course but the zealots of the antislave trade movement never  to be named without respect were much dissatisfied and thirty nine years later the matter was again canvassed in parliament and  lord palmerston and captain jenkin defended by admiral erskine in a  letter to the times march 13 1876  in 1845 while still lieutenant charles jenkin acted as admiral  pigots flag captain in the cove of cork where there were some  thirty pennants and about the same time closed his career by an  act of personal bravery  he had proceeded with his boats to the  help of a merchant vessel whose cargo of combustibles had taken  fire and was smouldering under hatches his sailors were in the  hold where the fumes were already heavy and jenkin was on deck  directing operations when he found his orders were no longer  answered from below  he jumped down without hesitation and slung  up several insensible men with his own hand  for this act he  received a letter from the lords of the admiralty expressing a  sense of his gallantry and pretty soon after was promoted  commander superseded and could never again obtain employment  in 1828 or 1829 charles jenkin was in the same watch with another  midshipman robert colin campbell jackson who introduced him to  his family in jamaica  the father the honourable robert jackson  custos rotulorum of kingston came of a yorkshire family said to  be originally scotch and on the mothers side counted kinship  with some of the forbeses  the mother was susan campbell one of  the campbells of auchenbreck  her father colin a merchant in  greenock is said to have been the heir to both the estate and the  baronetcy he claimed neither which casts a doubt upon the fact  but he had pride enough himself and taught enough pride to his  family for any station or descent in christendom  he had four  daughters  one married an edinburgh writer as i have it on a  first account  a minister according to another  a man at least  of reasonable station but not good enough for the campbells of  auchenbreck and the erring one was instantly discarded  another  married an actor of the name of adcock whom as i receive the  tale she had seen acting in a barn but the phrase should perhaps  be regarded rather as a measure of the family annoyance than a  mirror of the facts  the marriage was not in itself unhappy  adcock was a gentleman by birth and made a good husband the family  reasonably prospered and one of the daughters married no less a  man than clarkson stanfield  but by the father and the two  remaining miss campbells people of fierce passions and a truly  highland pride the derogation was bitterly resented  for long the  sisters lived estranged then mrs jackson and mrs adcock were  reconciled for a moment only to quarrel the more fiercely the  name of mrs adcock was proscribed nor did it again pass her  sisters lips until the morning when she announced  mary adcock  is dead i saw her in her shroud last night  second sight was  hereditary in the house and sure enough as i have it reported on  that very night mrs adcock had passed away  thus of the four  daughters two had according to the idiotic notions of their  friends disgraced themselves in marriage the others supported the  honour of the family with a better grace and married west indian  magnates of whom i believe the world has never heard and would  not care to hear  so strange a thing is this hereditary pride  of  mr jackson beyond the fact that he was fleemings grandfather i  know naught  his wife as i have said was a woman of fierce  passions she would tie her house slaves to the bed and lash them  with her own hand and her conduct to her wild and downgoing sons  was a mixture of almost insane selfsacrifice and wholly insane  violence of temper  she had three sons and one daughter  two of  the sons went utterly to ruin and reduced their mother to poverty   the third went to india a slim delicate lad and passed so wholly  from the knowledge of his relatives that he was thought to be long  dead  years later when his sister was living in genoa a red bearded man of great strength and stature tanned by years in  india and his hands covered with barbaric gems entered the room  unannounced as she was playing the piano lifted her from her  seat and kissed her  it was her brother suddenly returned out of  a past that was never very clearly understood with the rank of  general many strange gems many cloudy stories of adventure and  next his heart the daguerreotype of an indian prince with whom he  had mixed blood  the last of this wild family the daughter henrietta camilla  became the wife of the midshipman charles and the mother of the  subject of this notice fleeming jenkin  she was a woman of parts  and courage  not beautiful she had a far higher gift the art of  seeming so played the part of a belle in society while far  lovelier women were left unattended and up to old age had much of  both the exigency and the charm that mark that character  she drew  naturally for she had no training with unusual skill and it was  from her and not from the two naval artists that fleeming  inherited his eye and hand  she played on the harp and sang with  something beyond the talent of an amateur  at the age of  seventeen she heard pasta in paris flew up in a fire of youthful  enthusiasm and the next morning all alone and without  introduction found her way into the presence of the prima donna  and begged for lessons  pasta made her sing kissed her when she  had done and though she refused to be her mistress placed her in  the hands of a friend  nor was this all for when pasta returned  to paris she sent for the girl once at least to test her  progress  but mrs jenkins talents were not so remarkable as her  fortitude and strength of will and it was in an art for which she  had no natural taste the art of literature that she appeared  before the public  her novels though they attained and merited a  certain popularity both in france and england are a measure only  of her courage  they were a task not a beloved task they were  written for money in days of poverty and they served their end   in the least thing as well as in the greatest in every province of  life as well as in her novels she displayed the same capacity of  taking infinite pains which descended to her son  when she was  about forty as near as her age was known she lost her voice set  herself at once to learn the piano working eight hours a day and  attained to such proficiency that her collaboration in chamber  music was courted by professionals  and more than twenty years  later the old lady might have been seen dauntlessly beginning the  study of hebrew  this is the more ethereal part of courage nor  was she wanting in the more material  once when a neighbouring  groom a married man had seduced her maid mrs jenkin mounted her  horse rode over to the stable entrance and horsewhipped the man  with her own hand  how a match came about between this talented and spirited girl and  the young midshipman is not very i easy to conceive  charles  jenkin was one of the finest creatures breathing loyalty  devotion simple natural piety boyish cheerfulness tender and  manly sentiment in the old sailor fashion were in him inherent and  inextinguishable either by age suffering or injustice  he  looked as he was every inch a gentleman he must have been  everywhere notable even among handsome men both for his face and  his gallant bearing not so much that of a sailor you would have  said as like one of those gentle and graceful soldiers that to  this day are the most pleasant of englishmen to see  but though  he was in these ways noble the dunce scholar of northiam was to  the end no genius  upon all points that a man must understand to  be a gentleman to be upright gallant affectionate and dead to  self captain jenkin was more knowing than one among a thousand  outside of that his mind was very largely blank  he had indeed a  simplicity that came near to vacancy and in the first forty years  of his married life this want grew more accentuated  in both  families imprudent marriages had been the rule but neither jenkin  nor campbell had ever entered into a more unequal union  it was  the captains good looks we may suppose that gained for him this  elevation and in some ways and for many years of his life he had  to pay the penalty  his wife impatient of his incapacity and  surrounded by brilliant friends used him with a certain contempt   she was the managing partner the life was hers not his after his  retirement they lived much abroad where the poor captain who  could never learn any language but his own sat in the corner  mumchance and even his son carried away by his bright mother did  not recognise for long the treasures of simple chivalry that lay  buried in the heart of his father  yet it would be an error to  regard this marriage as unfortunate  it not only lasted long  enough to justify itself in a beautiful and touching epilogue but  it gave to the world the scientific work and what while time was  were of far greater value the delightful qualities of fleeming  jenkin  the kentishwelsh family facile extravagant generous to  a fault and far from brilliant had given the father an extreme  example of its humble virtues  on the other side the wild cruel  proud and somewhat blackguard stock of the scotch campbell jacksons had put forth in the person of the mother all its force  and courage  the marriage fell in evil days  in 1823 the bubble of the golden  aunts inheritance had burst  she died holding the hand of the  nephew she had so wantonly deceived at the last she drew him down  and seemed to bless him surely with some remorseful feeling for  when the will was opened there was not found so much as the  mention of his name  he was deeply in debt in debt even to the  estate of his deceiver so that he had to sell a piece of land to  clear himself  my dear boy he said to charles there will be  nothing left for you  i am a ruined man  and here follows for me  the strangest part of this story  from the death of the  treacherous aunt charles jenkin senior had still some nine years  to live it was perhaps too late for him to turn to saving and  perhaps his affairs were past restoration  but his family at least  had all this while to prepare they were still young men and knew  what they had to look for at their fathers death and yet when  that happened in september 1831 the heir was still apathetically  waiting  poor john the days of his whips and spurs and yeomanry  dinners were quite over and with that incredible softness of the  jenkin nature he settled down for the rest of a long life into  something not far removed above a peasant  the mill farm at  stowting had been saved out of the wreck and here he built himself  a house on the mexican model and made the two ends meet with  rustic thrift gathering dung with his own hands upon the road and  not at all abashed at his employment  in dress voice and manner  he fell into mere country plainness lived without the least care  for appearances the least regret for the past or discontentment  with the present and when he came to die died with stoic  cheerfulness announcing that he had had a comfortable time and was  yet well pleased to go  one would think there was little active  virtue to be inherited from such a race and yet in this same  voluntary peasant the special gift of fleeming jenkin was already  half developed  the old man to the end was perpetually inventing  his strange illspelled unpunctuated correspondence is full when  he does not drop into cookery receipts of pumps road engines  steamdiggers steamploughs and steamthreshing machines and i  have it on fleemings word that what he did was full of ingenuity   only as if by some cross destiny useless  these disappointments  he not only took with imperturbable good humour but rejoiced with  a particular relish over his nephews success in the same field   i glory in the professor he wrote to his brother and to  fleeming himself with a touch of simple drollery i was much  pleased with your lecture but why did you hit me so hard with  conisures connoisseurs quasi amateurs engineering  oh  what presumption  either of you or myself  a quaint pathetic  figure this of uncle john with his dung cart and his inventions  and the romantic fancy of his mexican house and his craze about  the lost tribes which seemed to the worthy man the key of all  perplexities and his quiet conscience looking back on a life not  altogether vain for he was a good son to his father while his  father lived and when evil days approached he had proved himself  a cheerful stoic  it followed from johns inertia that the duty of winding up the  estate fell into the hands of charles  he managed it with no more  skill than might be expected of a sailor ashore saved a bare  livelihood for john and nothing for the rest  eight months later  he married miss jackson and with her money bought in some two thirds of stowting  in the beginning of the little family history  which i have been following to so great an extent the captain  mentions with a delightful pride  a court baron and court leet  are regularly held by the lady of the manor mrs henrietta camilla  jenkin and indeed the pleasure of so describing his wife was the  most solid benefit of the investment for the purchase was heavily  encumbered and paid them nothing till some years before their  death  in the meanwhile the jackson family also what with wild  sons an indulgent mother and the impending emancipation of the  slaves was moving nearer and nearer to beggary and thus of two  doomed and declining houses the subject of this memoir was born  heir to an estate and to no money yet with inherited qualities  that were to make him known and loved    chapter ii  18331851    birth and childhood  edinburgh  frankfortonthemain  paris   the revolution of 1848  the insurrection  flight to italy    sympathy with italy  the insurrection in genoa  a student in  genoa  the lad and his mother   henry charles fleeming jenkin fleeming pronounced flemming to  his friends and family was born in a government building on the  coast of kent near dungeness where his father was serving at the  time in the coastguard on march 25 1833 and named after admiral  fleeming one of his fathers protectors in the navy  his childhood was vagrant like his life  once he was left in the  care of his grandmother jackson while mrs jenkin sailed in her  husbands ship and stayed a year at the havannah  the tragic woman  was besides from time to time a member of the family she was in  distress of mind and reduced in fortune by the misconduct of her  sons her destitution and solitude made it a recurring duty to  receive her her violence continually enforced fresh separations   in her passion of a disappointed mother she was a fit object of  pity but her grandson who heard her load his own mother with  cruel insults and reproaches conceived for her an indignant and  impatient hatred for which he blamed himself in later life  it is  strange from this point of view to see his childish letters to mrs  jackson and to think that a man distinguished above all by  stubborn truthfulness should have been brought up to such  dissimulation  but this is of course unavoidable in life it did  no harm to jenkin and whether he got harm or benefit from a so  early acquaintance with violent and hateful scenes is more than i  can guess  the experience at least was formative and in judging  his character it should not be forgotten  but mrs jackson was not  the only stranger in their gates the captains sister aunt anna  jenkin lived with them until her death she had all the jenkin  beauty of countenance though she was unhappily deformed in body  and of frail health and she even excelled her gentle and  ineffectual family in all amiable qualities  so that each of the  two races from which fleeming sprang had an outpost by his very  cradle the one he instinctively loved the other hated and the  lifelong war in his members had begun thus early by a victory for  what was best  we can trace the family from one country place to another in the  south of scotland where the child learned his taste for sport by  riding home the pony from the moors  before he was nine he could  write such a passage as this about a halloween observance  i  pulled a middlingsized cabbagerunt with a pretty sum of gold  about it  no witches would run after me when i was sowing my  hempseed this year my nuts blazed away together very comfortably  to the end of their lives and when mamma put hers in which were  meant for herself and papa they blazed away in the like manner   before he was ten he could write with a really irritating  precocity that he had been making some pictures from a book  called les francais peints par euxmemes     it is full of  pictures of all classes with a description of each in french  the  pictures are a little caricatured but not much  doubtless this  was only an echo from his mother but it shows the atmosphere in  which he breathed  it must have been a good change for this art  critic to be the playmate of mary macdonald their gardeners  daughter at barjarg and to sup with her family on potatoes and  milk and fleeming himself attached some value to this early and  friendly experience of another class  his education in the formal sense began at jedburgh  thence he  went to the edinburgh academy where he was the classmate of tait  and clerk maxwell bore away many prizes and was once unjustly  flogged by rector williams  he used to insist that all his bad  schoolfellows had died early a belief amusingly characteristic of  the mans consistent optimism  in 1846 the mother and son  proceeded to frankfortonthemain where they were soon joined by  the father now reduced to inaction and to play something like  third fiddle in his narrow household  the emancipation of the  slaves had deprived them of their last resource beyond the halfpay  of a captain and life abroad was not only desirable for the sake  of fleemings education it was almost enforced by reasons of  economy  but it was no doubt somewhat hard upon the captain   certainly that perennial boy found a companion in his son they  were both active and eager both willing to be amused both young  if not in years then in character  they went out together on  excursions and sketched old castles sitting side by side they had  an angry rivalry in walking doubtless equally sincere upon both  sides and indeed we may say that fleeming was exceptionally  favoured and that no boy had ever a companion more innocent  engaging gay and airy  but although in this case it would be  easy to exaggerate its import yet in the jenkin family also the  tragedy of the generations was proceeding and the child was  growing out of his fathers knowledge  his artistic aptitude was  of a different order  already he had his quick sight of many sides  of life he already overflowed with distinctions and  generalisations contrasting the dramatic art and national  character of england germany italy and france  if he were dull  he would write stories and poems  i have written he says at  thirteen a very long story in heroic measure 300 lines and  another scotch story and innumerable bits of poetry and at the  same age he had not only a keen feeling for scenery but could do  something with his pen to call it up  i feel i do always less than  justice to the delightful memory of captain jenkin but with a lad  of this character cutting the teeth of his intelligence he was  sure to fall into the background  the family removed in 1847 to paris where fleeming was put to  school under one deluc  there he learned french and if the  captain is right first began to show a taste for mathematics  but  a far more important teacher than deluc was at hand the year 1848  so momentous for europe was momentous also for fleemings  character  the family politics were liberal mrs jenkin generous  before all things was sure to be upon the side of exiles and in  the house of a paris friend of hers mrs turner  already known to  fame as shelleys cornelia de boinville  fleeming saw and heard  such men as manin gioberti and the ruffinis  he was thus  prepared to sympathise with revolution and when the hour came and  he found himself in the midst of stirring and influential events  the lads whole character was moved  he corresponded at that time  with a young edinburgh friend one frank scott and i am here going  to draw somewhat largely on this boyish correspondence  it gives  us at once a picture of the revolution and a portrait of jenkin at  fifteen not so different his friends will think from the jenkin  of the end  boyish simple opinionated delighting in action  delighting before all things in any generous sentiment   february 23 1848  when at 7 oclock today i went out i met a large band going  round the streets calling on the inhabitants to illuminate their  houses and bearing torches  this was all very good fun and  everybody was delighted but as they stopped rather long and were  rather turbulent in the place de la madeleine near where we live  in the rue caumartin a squadron of dragoons came up formed and  charged at a handgallop  this was a very pretty sight the crowd  was not too thick so they easily got away and the dragoons only  gave blows with the back of the sword which hurt but did not  wound  i was as close to them as i am now to the other side of the  table it was rather impressive however  at the second charge  they rode on the pavement and knocked the torches out of the  fellows hands rather a shame too  wouldnt be stood in england      at ten minutes to ten    i went a long way along the  boulevards passing by the office of foreign affairs where guizot  lives and where tonight there were about a thousand troops  protecting him from the fury of the populace  after this was  passed the number of the people thickened till about half a mile  further on i met a troop of vagabonds the wildest vagabonds in  the world  paris vagabonds well armed having probably broken  into gunsmiths shops and taken the guns and swords  they were  about a hundred  these were followed by about a thousand i am  rather diminishing than exaggerating numbers all through  indifferently armed with rusty sabres sticks etc  an uncountable  troop of gentlemen workmen shopkeepers wives paris women dare  anything ladies maids common women  in fact a crowd of all  classes though by far the greater number were of the better  dressed class  followed  indeed it was a splendid sight  the  mob in front chanting the marseillaise the national war hymn  grave and powerful sweetened by the night air  though night in  these splendid streets was turned into day every window was filled  with lamps dim torches were tossing in the crowd    for guizot  has late this night given in his resignation and this was an  improvised illumination  i and my father had turned with the crowd and were close behind  the second troop of vagabonds  joy was on every face  i remarked  to papa that i would not have missed the scene for anything i  might never see such a splendid one when plong went one shot   every face went pale  rrrrr went the whole detachment and  the whole crowd of gentlemen and ladies turned and cut  such a  scene  ladies gentlemen and vagabonds went sprawling in the  mud not shot but tripped up and those that went down could not  rise they were trampled over    i ran a short time straight on  and did not fall then turned down a side street ran fifty yards  and felt tolerably safe looked for papa did not see him so  walked on quickly giving the news as i went  it appears from  another letter the boy was the first to carry word of the firing  to the rue st honore and that his news wherever he brought it was  received with hurrahs  it was an odd entrance upon life for a  little english lad thus to play the part of rumour in such a  crisis of the history of france  but now a new fear came over me  i had little doubt but my papa  was safe but my fear was that he should arrive at home before me  and tell the story in that case i knew my mamma would go half mad  with fright so on i went as quick as possible  i heard no more  discharges  when i got half way home i found my way blocked up by  troops  that way or the boulevards i must pass  in the boulevards  they were fighting and i was afraid all other passages might be  blocked up    and i should have to sleep in a hotel in that  case and then my mamma  however after a long detour i found a  passage and ran home and in our street joined papa     ill tell you tomorrow the other facts gathered from  newspapers and papa    tonight i have given you what i have  seen with my own eyes an hour ago and began trembling with  excitement and fear  if i have been too long on this one subject  it is because it is yet before my eyes   monday 24   it was that fire raised the people  there was fighting all  through the night in the rue notre dame de lorette on the  boulevards where they had been shot at and at the porte st denis   at ten oclock they resigned the house of the minister of foreign  affairs where the disastrous volley was fired to the people who  immediately took possession of it  i went to school but was  hardly there when the row in that quarter commenced  barricades  began to be fixed  everyone was very grave now the externes went  away but no one came to fetch me so i had to stay  no lessons  could go on  a troop of armed men took possession of the  barricades so it was supposed i should have to sleep there  the  revolters came and asked for arms but deluc headmaster is a  national guard and he said he had only his own and he wanted them  but he said he would not fire on them  then they asked for wine  which he gave them  they took good care not to get drunk knowing  they would not be able to fight  they were very polite and behaved  extremely well  about 12 oclock a servant came for a boy who lived near me and  deluc thought it best to send me with him  we heard a good deal of  firing near but did not come across any of the parties  as we  approached the railway the barricades were no longer formed of  palings planks or stones but they had got all the omnibuses as  they passed sent the horses and passengers about their business  and turned them over  a double row of overturned coaches made a  capital barricade with a few paving stones  when i got home i found to my astonishment that in our fighting  quarter it was much quieter  mamma had just been out seeing the  troops in the place de la concorde when suddenly the municipal  guard now fairly exasperated prevented the national guard from  proceeding and fired at them the national guard had come with  their muskets not loaded but at length returned the fire  mamma  saw the national guard fire  the municipal guard were round the  corner  she was delighted for she saw no person killed though  many of the municipals were      i immediately went out with my papa mamma had just come back with  him and went to the place de la concorde  there was an enormous  quantity of troops in the place  suddenly the gates of the gardens  of the tuileries opened  we rushed forward out gallopped an  enormous number of cuirassiers in the middle of which were a  couple of low carriages said first to contain the count de paris  and the duchess of orleans but afterwards they said it was the  king and queen and then i heard he had abdicated  i returned and  gave the news  went out again up the boulevards  the house of the minister of  foreign affairs was filled with people and hotel du peuple  written on it the boulevards were barricaded with fine old trees  that were cut down and stretched all across the road  we went  through a great many little streets all strongly barricaded and  sentinels of the people at the principal of them  the streets were  very unquiet filled with armed men and women for the troops had  followed the exking to neuilly and left paris in the power of the  people  we met the captain of the third legion of the national  guard who had principally protected the people badly wounded by  a municipal guard stretched on a litter  he was in possession of  his senses  he was surrounded by a troop of men crying our brave  captain  we have him yet  hes not dead  vive la reforme  this  cry was responded to by all and every one saluted him as he  passed  i do not know if he was mortally wounded  that third  legion has behaved splendidly  i then returned and shortly afterwards went out again to the  garden of the tuileries  they were given up to the people and the  palace was being sacked  the people were firing blank cartridges  to testify their joy and they had a cannon on the top of the  palace  it was a sight to see a palace sacked and armed vagabonds  firing out of the windows and throwing shirts papers and dresses  of all kinds out of the windows  they are not rogues these  french they are not stealing burning or doing much harm  in the  tuileries they have dressed up some of the statues broken some  and stolen nothing but queer dresses  i say frank you must not  hate the french hate the germans if you like  the french laugh at  us a little and call out goddam in the streets but today in  civil war when they might have put a bullet through our heads i  never was insulted once  at present we have a provisional government consisting of odion  sic barrot lamartine marast and some others among them a  common workman but very intelligent  this is a triumph of liberty   rather  now then frank what do you think of it  i in a revolution and  out all day  just think what fun  so it was at first till i was  fired at yesterday but today i was not frightened but it turned  me sick at heart i dont know why  there has been no great  bloodshed though i certainly have seen mens blood several  times  but theres something shocking to see a whole armed  populace though not furious for not one single shop has been  broken open except the gunsmiths shops and most of the arms will  probably be taken back again  for the french have no cupidity in  their nature they dont like to steal  it is not in their nature   i shall send this letter in a day or two when i am sure the post  will go again  i know i have been a long time writing but i hope  you will find the matter of this letter interesting as coming from  a person resident on the spot though probably you dont take much  interest in the french but i can think write and speak on no  other subject   feb 25   there is no more fighting the people have conquered but the  barricades are still kept up and the people are in arms more than  ever fearing some new act of treachery on the part of the exking   the fight where i was was the principal cause of the revolution  i  was in little danger from the shot for there was an immense crowd  in front of me though quite within gunshot  by another letter a  hundred yards from the troops  i wished i had stopped there  the paris streets are filled with the most extraordinary crowds of  men women and children ladies and gentlemen  every person  joyful  the bands of armed men are perfectly polite  mamma and  aunt today walked through armed crowds alone that were firing  blank cartridges in all directions  every person made way with the  greatest politeness and one common man with a blouse coming by  accident against her immediately stopped to beg her pardon in the  politest manner  there are few drunken men  the tuileries is  still being run over by the people they only broke two things a  bust of louis philippe and one of marshal bugeaud who fired on the  people      i have been out all day again today and precious tired i am   the republican party seem the strongest and are going about with  red ribbons in their buttonholes      the title of mister is abandoned they say nothing but  citizen and the people are shaking hands amazingly  they have  got to the top of the public monuments and mingling with bronze  or stone statues five or six make a sort of tableau vivant the  top man holding up the red flag of the republic and right well  they do it and very picturesque they look  i think i shall put  this letter in the post tomorrow as we got a letter tonight   on envelope   m lamartine has now by his eloquence conquered the whole armed  crowd of citizens threatening to kill him if he did not immediately  proclaim the republic and red flag  he said he could not yield to  the citizens of paris alone that the whole country must be  consulted that he chose the tricolour for it had followed and  accompanied the triumphs of france all over the world and that the  red flag had only been dipped in the blood of the citizens  for  sixty hours he has been quieting the people  he is at the head of  everything  dont be prejudiced frank by what you see in the  papers  the french have acted nobly splendidly there has been no  brutality plundering or stealing     i did not like the  french before but in this respect they are the finest people in  the world  i am so glad to have been here   and there one could wish to stop with this apotheosis of liberty  and order read with the generous enthusiasm of a boy but as the  reader knows it was but the first act of the piece  the letters  vivid as they are written as they were by a hand trembling with  fear and excitement yet do injustice in their boyishness of tone  to the profound effect produced  at the sound of these songs and  shot of cannon the boys mind awoke  he dated his own  appreciation of the art of acting from the day when he saw and  heard rachel recite the marseillaise at the francais the  tricolour in her arms  what is still more strange he had been up  to then invincibly indifferent to music insomuch that he could not  distinguish god save the queen from bonnie dundee and now to  the chanting of the mob he amazed his family by learning and  singing mourir pour la patrie  but the letters though they  prepare the mind for no such revolution in the boys tastes and  feelings are yet full of entertaining traits  let the reader note  fleemings eagerness to influence his friend frank an incipient  tory no less as further history displayed his unconscious  indifference to his father and devotion to his mother betrayed in  so many significant expressions and omissions the sense of dignity  of this diminutive person resident on the spot who was so happy  as to escape insult and the strange picture of the household   father mother son and even poor aunt anna  all day in the  streets in the thick of this rough business and the boy packed off  alone to school in a distant quarter on the very morrow of the  massacre  they had all the gift of enjoying lifes texture as it comes they  were all born optimists  the name of liberty was honoured in that  family its spirit also but within stringent limits and some of  the foreign friends of mrs jenkin were as i have said men  distinguished on the liberal side  like wordsworth they beheld   france standing on the top of golden hours and human nature seeming born again   at once by temper and belief they were formed to find their  element in such a decent and whiggish convulsion spectacular in  its course moderate in its purpose  for them   bliss was it in that dawn to be alive but to be young was very heaven   and i cannot but smile when i think that again like wordsworth  they should have so specially disliked the consequence  it came upon them by surprise  liberal friends of the precise  right shade of colour had assured them in mrs turners drawing room that all was for the best and they rose on january 23  without fear  about the middle of the day they heard the sound of  musketry and the next morning they were wakened by the cannonade   the french who had behaved so splendidly pausing at the voice  of lamartine just where judicious liberals could have desired   the french who had no cupidity in their nature were now about  to play a variation on the theme rebellion  the jenkins took  refuge in the house of mrs turner the house of the false  prophets anna going with mrs turner that she might be prevented  speaking english fleeming miss h and i it is the mother who  writes walking together  as we reached the rue de clichy the  report of the cannon sounded close to our ears and made our hearts  sick i assure you  the fighting was at the barrier rochechouart  a few streets off  all saturday and sunday we were a prey to great  alarm there came so many reports that the insurgents were getting  the upper hand  one could tell the state of affairs from the  extreme quiet or the sudden hum in the street  when the news was  bad all the houses closed and the people disappeared when better  the doors half opened and you heard the sound of men again  from  the upper windows we could see each discharge from the bastille  i  mean the smoke rising  and also the flames and smoke from the  boulevard la chapelle  we were four ladies and only fleeming by  way of a man and difficulty enough we had to keep him from joining  the national guards  his pride and spirit were both fired  you  cannot picture to yourself the multitudes of soldiers guards and  armed men of all sorts we watched  not close to the window  however for such havoc had been made among them by the firing from  the windows that as the battalions marched by they cried fermez  vos fenetres and it was very painful to watch their looks of  anxiety and suspicion as they marched by  the revolution writes fleeming to frank scott was quite  delightful  getting popped at and run at by horses and giving  sous for the wounded into little boxes guarded by the raggedest  picturesquest delightfullest sentinels but the insurrection  ugh i shudder to think at sic it  he found it not a bit of  fun sitting boxed up in the house four days almost   i was the  only gentleman to four ladies and didnt they keep me in order  i  did not dare to show my face at a window for fear of catching a  stray ball or being forced to enter the national guard for they  would have it i was a man fullgrown french and every way fit to  fight  and my mamma was as bad as any of them she that told me i  was a coward last time if i stayed in the house a quarter of an  hour  but i drew examined the pistols of which i found lots with  caps powder and ball while sometimes murderous intentions of  killing a dozen insurgents and dying violently overpowered by  numbers      we may drop this sentence here  under the  conduct of its boyish writer it was to reach no legitimate end  four days of such a discipline had cured the family of paris the  same year fleeming was to write in answer apparently to a question  of frank scotts i could find no national game in france but  revolutions and the witticism was justified in their experience   on the first possible day they applied for passports and were  advised to take the road to geneva  it appears it was scarce safe  to leave paris for england  charles reade with keen dramatic  gusto had just smuggled himself out of that city in the bottom of  a cab  english gold had been found on the insurgents the name of  england was in evil odour and it was thus  for strategic reasons  so to speak  that fleeming found himself on the way to that italy  where he was to complete his education and for which he cherished  to the end a special kindness  it was in genoa they settled partly for the sake of the captain  who might there find naval comrades partly because of the  ruffinis who had been friends of mrs jenkin in their time of  exile and were now considerable men at home partly in fine with  hopes that fleeming might attend the university in preparation for  which he was put at once to school  it was the year of novara  mazzini was in rome the dry bones of italy were moving and for  people of alert and liberal sympathies the time was inspiriting   what with exiles turned ministers of state universities thrown  open to protestants fleeming himself the first protestant student  in genoa and thus as his mother writes a living instance of the  progress of liberal ideas  it was little wonder if the  enthusiastic young woman and the clever boy were heart and soul  upon the side of italy  it should not be forgotten that they were  both on their first visit to that country the mother still child  enough to be delighted when she saw real monks and both mother  and son thrilling with the first sight of snowy alps the blue  mediterranean and the crowded port and the palaces of genoa  nor  was their zeal without knowledge  ruffini deputy for genoa and  soon to be head of the university was at their side and by means  of him the family appear to have had access to much italian  society  to the end fleeming professed his admiration of the  piedmontese and his unalterable confidence in the future of italy  under their conduct for victor emanuel cavour the first la  marmora and garibaldi he had varying degrees of sympathy and  praise  perhaps highest for the king whose good sense and temper  filled him with respect  perhaps least for garibaldi whom he  loved but yet mistrusted  but this is to look forward  these were the days not of victor  emanuel but of charles albert and it was on charles albert that  mother and son had now fixed their eyes as on the swordbearer of  italy  on fleemings sixteenth birthday they were the mother  writes in great anxiety for news from the army  you can have no  idea what it is to live in a country where such a struggle is going  on  the interest is one that absorbs all others  we eat drink  and sleep to the noise of drums and musketry  you would enjoy and  almost admire fleemings enthusiasm and earnestness  and courage  i may say  for we are among the small minority of english who side  with the italians  the other day at dinner at the consuls boy  as he is and in spite of my admonitions fleeming defended the  italian cause and so well that he tripped up the heels of his  adversary simply from being wellinformed on the subject and  honest  he is as true as steel and for no one will he bend right  or left      do not fancy him a bobadil she adds he is  only a very true candid boy  i am so glad he remains in all  respects but information a great child  if this letter is correctly dated the cause was already lost and  the king had already abdicated when these lines were written  no  sooner did the news reach genoa than there began tumultuous  movements and the jenkins received hints it would be wise to  leave the city  but they had friends and interests even the  captain had english officers to keep him company for lord  hardwickes ship the vengeance lay in port and supposing the  danger to be real i cannot but suspect the whole family of a  divided purpose prudence being possibly weaker than curiosity   stay at least they did and thus rounded their experience of the  revolutionary year  on sunday april 1 fleeming and the captain  went for a ramble beyond the walls leaving aunt anna and mrs  jenkin to walk on the bastions with some friends  on the way back  this party turned aside to rest in the church of the madonna delle  grazie  we had remarked writes mrs jenkin the entire absence  of sentinels on the ramparts and how the cannons were left in  solitary state and i had just remarked how quiet everything is  when suddenly we heard the drums begin to beat and distant shouts   accustomed as we are to revolutions we never thought of being  frightened  for all that they resumed their return home  on the  way they saw men running and vociferating but nothing to indicate  a general disturbance until near the dukes palace they came  upon and passed a shouting mob dragging along with it three cannon   it had scarcely passed before they heard a rushing sound one of  the gentlemen thrust back the party of ladies under a shed and the  mob passed again  a finelooking young man was in their hands and  mrs jenkin saw him with his mouth open as if he sought to speak  saw him tossed from one to another like a ball and then saw him no  more  he was dead a few instants after but the crowd hid that  terror from us  my knees shook under me and my sight left me   with this street tragedy the curtain rose upon their second  revolution  the attack on spirito santo and the capitulation and departure of  the troops speedily followed  genoa was in the hands of the  republicans and now came a time when the english residents were in  a position to pay some return for hospitality received  nor were  they backward  our consul the same who had the benefit of  correction from fleeming carried the intendente on board the  vengeance escorting him through the streets getting along with  him on board a shore boat and when the insurgents levelled their  muskets standing up and naming himself console inglese  a  friend of the jenkins captain glynne had a more painful if a  less dramatic part  one colonel nosozzo had been killed i read  while trying to prevent his own artillery from firing on the mob  but in that hells cauldron of a distracted city there were no  distinctions made and the colonels widow was hunted for her life   in her grief and peril the glynnes received and hid her captain  glynne sought and found her husbands body among the slain saved  it for two days brought the widow a lock of the dead mans hair  but at last the mob still strictly searching seems to have  abandoned the body and conveyed his guest on board the vengeance   the jenkins also had their refugees the family of an employe  threatened by a decree  you should have seen me making a union  jack to nail over our door writes mrs jenkin  i never worked  so fast in my life  monday and tuesday she continues were  tolerably quiet our hearts beating fast in the hope of la  marmoras approach the streets barricaded and none but foreigners  and women allowed to leave the city  on wednesday la marmora  came indeed but in the ugly form of a bombardment and that  evening the jenkins sat without lights about their drawingroom  window watching the huge red flashes of the cannon from the  brigato and la specula forts and hearkening not without some  awful pleasure to the thunder of the cannonade  lord hardwicke intervened between the rebels and la marmora and  there followed a troubled armistice filled with the voice of  panic  now the vengeance was known to be cleared for action now  it was rumoured that the galley slaves were to be let loose upon  the town and now that the troops would enter it by storm  crowds  trusting in the union jack over the jenkins door came to beg them  to receive their linen and other valuables nor could their  instances be refused and in the midst of all this bustle and  alarm piles of goods must be examined and long inventories made   at last the captain decided things had gone too far  he himself  apparently remained to watch over the linen but at five oclock on  the sunday morning aunt anna fleeming and his mother were rowed  in a pour of rain on board an english merchantman to suffer nine  mortal hours of agonising suspense  with the end of that time  peace was restored  on tuesday morning officers with white flags  appeared on the bastions then regiment by regiment the troops  marched in two hundred men sleeping on the ground floor of the  jenkins house thirty thousand in all entering the city but  without disturbance old la marmora being a commander of a roman  sternness  with the return of quiet and the reopening of the universities we  behold a new character signor flaminio  the professors it  appears made no attempt upon the jenkin and thus readily  italianised the fleeming  he came well recommended for their  friend ruffini was then or soon after raised to be the head of  the university and the professors were very kind and attentive  possibly to ruffinis protege perhaps also to the first protestant  student  it was no joke for signor flaminio at first certificates  had to be got from paris and from rector williams the classics  must be furbished up at home that he might follow latin lectures  examinations bristled in the path the entrance examination with  latin and english essay and oral trials much softened for the  foreigner in horace tacitus and cicero and the first university  examination only three months later in italian eloquence no less  and other wider subjects  on one point the first protestant  student was moved to thank his stars  that there was no greek  required for the degree  little did he think as he set down his  gratitude how much in later life and among cribs and  dictionaries he was to lament this circumstance nor how much of  that later life he was to spend acquiring with infinite toil a  shadow of what he might then have got with ease and fully  but if  his genoese education was in this particular imperfect he was  fortunate in the branches that more immediately touched on his  career  the physical laboratory was the best mounted in italy   bancalari the professor of natural philosophy was famous in his  day by what seems even an odd coincidence he went deeply into  electromagnetism and it was principally in that subject that  signor flaminio questioned in latin and answering in italian  passed his master of arts degree with firstclass honours  that he  had secured the notice of his teachers one circumstance  sufficiently proves  a philosophical society was started under the  presidency of mamiani one of the examiners and one of the leaders  of the moderate party and out of five promising students brought  forward by the professors to attend the sittings and present  essays signor flaminio was one  i cannot find that he ever read  an essay and indeed i think his hands were otherwise too full  he  found his fellowstudents not such a bad set of chaps and  preferred the piedmontese before the genoese but i suspect he  mixed not very freely with either  not only were his days filled  with university work but his spare hours were fully dedicated to  the arts under the eye of a beloved taskmistress  he worked hard  and well in the art school where he obtained a silver medal for a  couple of legs the size of life drawn from one of raphaels  cartoons  his holidays were spent in sketching his evenings  when they were free at the theatre  here at the opera he  discovered besides a taste for a new art the art of music and it  was he wrote as if he had found out a heaven on earth  i am  so anxious that whatever he professes to know he should really  perfectly possess his mother wrote that i spare no pains  neither to him nor to myself she might have added  and so when he  begged to be allowed to learn the piano she started him with  characteristic barbarity on the scales and heard in consequence  heartrending groans and saw anguished claspings of hands as he  lost his way among their arid intricacies  in this picture of the lad at the piano there is something for  the period girlish  he was indeed his mothers boy and it was  fortunate his mother was not altogether feminine  she gave her son  a womanly delicacy in morals to a mans taste  to his own taste  in later life  too finely spun and perhaps more elegant than  healthful  she encouraged him besides in drawingroom interests   but in other points her influence was manlike  filled with the  spirit of thoroughness she taught him to make of the least of  these accomplishments a virile task and the teaching lasted him  through life  immersed as she was in the days movements and  buzzed about by leading liberals she handed on to him her creed in  politics  an enduring kindness for italy and a loyalty like that  of many clever women to the liberal party with but small regard to  men or measures  this attitude of mind used often to disappoint me  in a man so fond of logic but i see now how it was learned from  the bright eyes of his mother and to the sound of the cannonades of  1848  to some of her defects besides she made him heir  kind as  was the bond that united her to her son kind and even pretty she  was scarce a woman to adorn a home loving as she did to shine  careless as she was of domestic studious of public graces  she  probably rejoiced to see the boy grow up in somewhat of the image  of herself generous excessive enthusiastic external catching  at ideas brandishing them when caught fiery for the right but  always fiery ready at fifteen to correct a consul ready at fifty  to explain to any artist his own art  the defects and advantages of such a training were obvious in  fleeming throughout life  his thoroughness was not that of the  patient scholar but of an untrained woman with fits of passionate  study he had learned too much from dogma given indeed by  cherished lips and precocious as he was in the use of the tools of  the mind he was truly backward in knowledge of life and of  himself  such as it was at least his home and school training was  now complete and you are to conceive the lad as being formed in a  household of meagre revenue among foreign surroundings and under  the influence of an imperious drawingroom queen from whom he  learned a great refinement of morals a strong sense of duty much  forwardness of bearing all manner of studious and artistic  interests and many readymade opinions which he embraced with a  sons and a disciples loyalty    chapter iii  18511858    return to england  fleeming at fairbairns  experience in a  strike  dr bell and greek architecture  the gaskells  fleeming  at greenwich  the austins  fleeming and the austins  his  engagement  fleeming and sir w thomson   in 1851 the year of aunt annas death the family left genoa and  came to manchester where fleeming was entered in fairbairns works  as an apprentice  from the palaces and alps the mole the blue  mediterranean the humming lanes and the bright theatres of genoa  he fell  and he was sharply conscious of the fall  to the dim  skies and the foul ways of manchester  england he found on his  return a horrid place and there is no doubt the family found it  a dear one  the story of the jenkin finances is not easy to  follow  the family i am told did not practice frugality only  lamented that it should be needful and mrs jenkin who was always  complaining of those dreadful bills was always a good deal  dressed  but at this time of the return to england things must  have gone further  a holiday tour of a fortnight fleeming feared  would be beyond what he could afford and he only projected it to  have a castle in the air  and there were actual pinches  fresh  from a warmer sun he was obliged to go without a greatcoat and  learned on railway journeys to supply the place of one with  wrappings of old newspaper  from halfpast eight till six he must file and chip vigorously in  a moleskin suit and infernally dirty  the work was not new to  him for he had already passed some time in a genoese shop and to  fleeming no work was without interest  whatever a man can do or  know he longed to know and do also  i never learned anything  he wrote not even standing on my head but i found a use for it   in the spare hours of his first telegraph voyage to give an  instance of his greed of knowledge he meant to learn the whole  art of navigation every rope in the ship and how to handle her on  any occasion and once when he was shown a young ladys holiday  collection of seaweeds he must cry out it showed me my eyes had  been idle  nor was his the case of the mere literary smatterer  content if he but learn the names of things  in him to do and to  do well was even a dearer ambition than to know  anything done  well any craft despatch or finish delighted and inspired him   i remember him with a twopenny japanese box of three drawers so  exactly fitted that when one was driven home the others started  from their places the whole spirit of japan he told me was  pictured in that box that plain piece of carpentry was as much  inspired by the spirit of perfection as the happiest drawing or the  finest bronze and he who could not enjoy it in the one was not  fully able to enjoy it in the others  thus too he found in  leonardos engineering and anatomical drawings a perpetual feast  and of the former he spoke even with emotion  nothing indeed  annoyed fleeming more than the attempt to separate the fine arts  from the arts of handicraft any definition or theory that failed  to bring these two together according to him had missed the  point and the essence of the pleasure received lay in seeing  things well done  other qualities must be added he was the last  to deny that but this of perfect craft was at the bottom of all   and on the other hand a nail illdriven a joint illfitted a  tracing clumsily done anything to which a man had set his hand and  not set it aptly moved him to shame and anger  with such a  character he would feel but little drudgery at fairbairns  there  would be something daily to be done slovenliness to be avoided  and a higher mark of skill to be attained he would chip and file  as he had practiced scales impatient of his own imperfection but  resolute to learn  and there was another spring of delight  for he was now moving  daily among those strange creations of mans brain to some so  abhorrent to him of an interest so inexhaustible  in which iron  water and fire are made to serve as slaves now with a tread more  powerful than an elephants and now with a touch more precise and  dainty than a pianists  the taste for machinery was one that i  could never share with him and he had a certain bitter pity for my  weakness  once when i had proved for the hundredth time the  depth of this defect he looked at me askance  and the best of  the joke said he is that he thinks himself quite a poet  for  to him the struggle of the engineer against brute forces and with  inert allies was nobly poetic  habit never dulled in him the  sense of the greatness of the aims and obstacles of his profession   habit only sharpened his inventors gusto in contrivance in  triumphant artifice in the odyssean subtleties by which wires are  taught to speak and iron hands to weave and the slender ship to  brave and to outstrip the tempest  to the ignorant the great  results alone are admirable to the knowing and to fleeming in  particular rather the infinite device and sleight of hand that  made them possible  a notion was current at the time that in such a shop as  fairbairns a pupil would never be popular unless he drank with  the workmen and imitated them in speech and manner  fleeming who  would do none of these things they accepted as a friend and  companion and this was the subject of remark in manchester where  some memory of it lingers till today  he thought it one of the  advantages of his profession to be brought into a close relation  with the working classes and for the skilled artisan he had a  great esteem liking his company his virtues and his taste in  some of the arts  but he knew the classes too well to regard them  like a platform speaker in a lump  he drew on the other hand  broad distinctions and it was his profound sense of the difference  between one working man and another that led him to devote so much  time in later days to the furtherance of technical education  in  1852 he had occasion to see both men and masters at their worst in  the excitement of a strike and very foolishly after their custom  both would seem to have behaved  beginning with a fair show of  justice on either side the masters stultified their cause by  obstinate impolicy and the men disgraced their order by acts of  outrage  on wednesday last writes fleeming about three  thousand banded round fairbairns door at 6 oclock  men women  and children factory boys and girls the lowest of the low in a  very low place  orders came that no one was to leave the works  but the men inside knobsticks as they are called were precious  hungry and thought they would venture  two of my companions and  myself went out with the very first and had the full benefit of  every possible groan and bad language  but the police cleared a  lane through the crowd the pupils were suffered to escape unhurt  and only the knobsticks followed home and kicked with clogs so  that fleeming enjoyed as we may say for nothing that fine thrill  of expectant valour with which he had sallied forth into the mob   i never before felt myself so decidedly somebody instead of  nobody he wrote  outside as inside the works he was pretty merry and well to do  zealous in study welcome to many friends unwearied in loving kindness to his mother  for some time he spent three nights a week  with dr bell working away at certain geometrical methods of  getting the greek architectural proportions  a business after  fleemings heart for he was never so pleased as when he could  marry his two devotions art and science  this was besides in all  likelihood the beginning of that love and intimate appreciation of  things greek from the least to the greatest from the agamemmon  perhaps his favourite tragedy down to the details of grecian  tailoring which he used to express in his familiar phrase  the  greeks were the boys  dr bell  the son of george joseph the  nephew of sir charles and though he made less use of it than some  a sharer in the distinguished talents of his race  had hit upon  the singular fact that certain geometrical intersections gave the  proportions of the doric order  fleeming under dr bells  direction applied the same method to the other orders and again  found the proportions accurately given  numbers of diagrams were  prepared but the discovery was never given to the world perhaps  because of the dissensions that arose between the authors  for dr  bell believed that these intersections were in some way connected  with or symbolical of the antagonistic forces at work but his  pupil and helper with characteristic trenchancy brushed aside  this mysticism and interpreted the discovery as a geometrical  method of dividing the spaces or as might be said of setting out  the work purely empirical and in no way connected with any laws of  either force or beauty  many a hard and pleasant fight we had  over it wrote jenkin in later years and impertinent as it may  seem the pupil is still unconvinced by the arguments of the  master  i do not know about the antagonistic forces in the doric  order in fleeming they were plain enough and the bobadil of these  affairs with dr bell was still like the corrector of italian  consuls a great child in everything but information  at the  house of colonel cleather he might be seen with a family of  children and with these there was no word of the greek orders  with these fleeming was only an uproarious boy and an entertaining  draughtsman so that his coming was the signal for the young people  to troop into the playroom where sometimes the roof rang with  romping and sometimes they gathered quietly about him as he amused  them with his pencil  in another manchester family whose name will be familiar to my  readers  that of the gaskells fleeming was a frequent visitor   to mrs gaskell he would often bring his new ideas a process that  many of his later friends will understand and in their own cases  remember  with the girls he had constant fierce wrangles  forcing them to reason out their thoughts and to explain their  prepossessions and i hear from miss gaskell that they used to  wonder how he could throw all the ardour of his character into the  smallest matters and to admire his unselfish devotion to his  parents  of one of these wrangles i have found a record most  characteristic of the man  fleeming had been laying down his  doctrine that the end justifies the means and that it is quite  right to boast of your six menservants to a burglar or to steal a  knife to prevent a murder and the miss gaskells with girlish  loyalty to what is current had rejected the heresy with  indignation  from such passagesatarms many retire mortified and  ruffled but fleeming had no sooner left the house than he fell  into delighted admiration of the spirit of his adversaries  from  that it was but a step to ask himself what truth was sticking in  their heads for even the falsest form of words in fleemings  lifelong opinion reposed upon some truth just as he could not  even allow that people admire ugly things they admire what is  pretty in the ugly thing  and before he sat down to write his  letter he thought he had hit upon the explanation  i fancy the  true idea he wrote is that you must never do yourself or anyone  else a moral injury  make any man a thief or a liar  for any  end quite a different thing as he would have loved to point out  from never stealing or lying  but this perfervid disputant was not  always out of key with his audience  one whom he met in the same  house announced that she would never again be happy  what does  that signify cried fleeming  we are not here to be happy but  to be good  and the words as his hearer writes to me became to  her a sort of motto during life  from fairbairns and manchester fleeming passed to a railway  survey in switzerland and thence again to mr penns at greenwich  where he was engaged as draughtsman  there in 1856 we find him in  a terribly busy state finishing up engines for innumerable gun boats and steam frigates for the ensuing campaign  from halfpast  eight in the morning till nine or ten at night he worked in a  crowded office among uncongenial comrades saluted by chaff  generally low personal and not witty pelted with oranges and  apples regaled with dirty stories and seeking to suit himself  with his surroundings or as he writes it trying to be as little  like himself as possible  his lodgings were hard by across a  dirty green and through some halfbuilt streets of twostoried  houses he had carlyle and the poets engineering and mathematics  to study by himself in such spare time as remained to him and  there were several ladies young and not so young with whom he  liked to correspond  but not all of these could compensate for the  absence of that mother who had made herself so large a figure in  his life for sorry surroundings unsuitable society and work that  leaned to the mechanical  sunday says he i generally visit  some friends in town and seem to swim in clearer water but the  dirty green seems all the dirtier when i get back  luckily i am  fond of my profession or i could not stand this life  it is a  question in my mind if he could have long continued to stand it  without loss  we are not here to be happy but to be good quoth  the young philosopher but no man had a keener appetite for  happiness than fleeming jenkin  there is a time of life besides  when apart from circumstances few men are agreeable to their  neighbours and still fewer to themselves and it was at this stage  that fleeming had arrived later than common and even worse  provided  the letter from which i have quoted is the last of his  correspondence with frank scott and his last confidential letter  to one of his own sex  if you consider it rightly he wrote long  after you will find the want of correspondence no such strange  want in mens friendships  there is believe me something noble  in the metal which does not rust though not burnished by daily  use  it is well said but the last letter to frank scott is  scarcely of a noble metal  it is plain the writer has outgrown his  old self yet not made acquaintance with the new  this letter from  a busy youth of three and twenty breathes of seventeen  the  sickening alternations of conceit and shame the expense of hope in  vacuo the lack of friends the longing after love the whole world  of egoism under which youth stands groaning a voluntary atlas  with fleeming this disease was never seemingly severe  the very  day before this to me distasteful letter he had written to miss  bell of manchester in a sweeter strain i do not quote the one i  quote the other fair things are the best  i keep my own little  lodgings he writes but come up every night to see mamma who  was then on a visit to london if not kept too late at the works  and have singing lessons once more and sing donne lamore e  scaltro pargoletto and think and talk about you and listen to  mammas projects de stowting  everything turns to gold at her  touch shes a fairy and no mistake  we go on talking till i have  a picture in my head and can hardly believe at the end that the  original is stowting  even you dont know half how good mamma is  in other things too which i must not mention  she teaches me how  it is not necessary to be very rich to do much good  i begin to  understand that mamma would find useful occupation and create  beauty at the bottom of a volcano  she has little weaknesses but  is a real generoushearted woman which i suppose is the finest  thing in the world  though neither mother nor son could be called  beautiful they make a pretty picture the ugly generous ardent  woman weaving rainbow illusions the ugly clearsighted loving  son sitting at her side in one of his rare hours of pleasure half beguiled halfamused wholly admiring as he listens  but as he  goes home and the fancy pictures fade and stowting is once more  burthened with debt and the noisy companions and the long hours of  drudgery once more approach no wonder if the dirty green seems all  the dirtier or if atlas must resume his load  but in healthy natures this time of moral teething passes quickly  of itself and is easily alleviated by fresh interests and  already in the letter to frank scott there are two words of hope   his friends in london his love for his profession  the last might  have saved him for he was ere long to pass into a new sphere  where all his faculties were to be tried and exercised and his  life to be filled with interest and effort  but it was not left to  engineering  another and more influential aim was to be set before  him  he must in any case have fallen in love in any case his  love would have ruled his life and the question of choice was for  the descendant of two such families a thing of paramount  importance  innocent of the world fiery generous devoted as he  was the son of the wild jacksons and the facile jenkins might have  been led far astray  by one of those partialities that fill men at  once with gratitude and wonder his choosing was directed well  or  are we to say that by a mans choice in marriage as by a crucial  merit he deserves his fortune  one thing at least reason may  discern  that a man but partly chooses he also partly forms his  helpmate and he must in part deserve her or the treasure is but  won for a moment to be lost  fleeming chanced if you will and  indeed all these opportunities are as random as blind mans buff  upon a wife who was worthy of him but he had the wit to know it  the courage to wait and labour for his prize and the tenderness  and chivalry that are required to keep such prizes precious  upon  this point he has himself written well as usual with fervent  optimism but as usual in his own phrase with a truth sticking in  his head  love he wrote is not an intuition of the person most suitable  to us most required by us of the person with whom life flowers  and bears fruit  if this were so the chances of our meeting that  person would be small indeed our intuition would often fail the  blindness of love would then be fatal as it is proverbial  no  love works differently and in its blindness lies its strength   man and woman each strongly desires to be loved each opens to the  other that heart of ideal aspirations which they have often hid  till then each thus knowing the ideal of the other tries to  fulfil that ideal each partially succeeds  the greater the love  the greater the success the nobler the idea of each the more  durable the more beautiful the effect  meanwhile the blindness of  each to the others defects enables the transformation to proceed  unobserved so that when the veil is withdrawn if it ever is  and this i do not know neither knows that any change has occurred  in the person whom they loved  do not fear therefore  i do not  tell you that your friend will not change but as i am sure that  her choice cannot be that of a man with a base ideal so i am sure  the change will be a safe and a good one  do not fear that  anything you love will vanish he must love it too  among other introductions in london fleeming had presented a  letter from mrs gaskell to the alfred austins  this was a family  certain to interest a thoughtful young man  alfred the youngest  and least known of the austins had been a beautiful goldenhaired  child petted and kept out of the way of both sport and study by a  partial mother  bred an attorney he had like both his brothers  changed his way of life and was called to the bar when past  thirty  a commission of enquiry into the state of the poor in  dorsetshire gave him an opportunity of proving his true talents  and he was appointed a poor law inspector first at worcester next  at manchester where he had to deal with the potato famine and the  irish immigration of the forties and finally in london where he  again distinguished himself during an epidemic of cholera  he was  then advanced to the permanent secretaryship of her majestys  office of works and public buildings a position which he filled  with perfect competence but with an extreme of modesty and on his  retirement in 1868 he was made a companion of the bath  while  apprentice to a norwich attorney alfred austin was a frequent  visitor in the house of mr barron a rallying place in those days  of intellectual society  edward barron the son of a rich saddler  or leather merchant in the borough was a man typical of the time   when he was a child he had once been patted on the head in his  fathers shop by no less a man than samuel johnson as the doctor  went round the borough canvassing for mr thrale and the child was  true to this early consecration  a life of lettered ease spent in  provincial retirement it is thus that the biographer of that  remarkable man william taylor announces his subject and the  phrase is equally descriptive of the life of edward barron  the  pair were close friends w t and a pipe render everything  agreeable writes barron in his diary in 1823 and in 1833 after  barron had moved to london and taylor had tasted the first public  failure of his powers the latter wrote  to my ever dearest mr  barron say if you please that i miss him more than i regret him   that i acquiesce in his retirement from norwich because i could  ill brook his observation of my increasing debility of mind  this  chosen companion of william taylor must himself have been no  ordinary man and he was the friend besides of borrow whom i find  him helping in his latin  but he had no desire for popular  distinction lived privately married a daughter of dr enfield of  enfields speaker and devoted his time to the education of his  family in a deliberate and scholarly fashion and with certain  traits of stoicism that would surprise a modern  from these  children we must single out his youngest daughter eliza who  learned under his care to be a sound latin an elegant grecian and  to suppress emotion without outward sign after the manner of the  godwin school  this was the more notable as the girl really  derived from the enfields whose highflown romantic temper i wish  i could find space to illustrate  she was but seven years old  when alfred austin remarked and fell in love with her and the  union thus early prepared was singularly full  where the husband  and wife differed and they did so on momentous subjects they  differed with perfect temper and content and in the conduct of  life and in depth and durability of love they were at one  each  full of high spirits each practised something of the same  repression  no sharp word was uttered in their house  the same  point of honour ruled them a guest was sacred and stood within the  pale from criticism  it was a house besides of unusual  intellectual tension  mrs austin remembered in the early days of  the marriage the three brothers john charles and alfred  marching to and fro each with his hands behind his back and  reasoning high till morning and how like dr johnson they  would cheer their speculations with as many as fifteen cups of tea   and though before the date of fleemings visit the brothers were  separated charles long ago retired from the world at brandeston  and john already near his end in the rambling old house at  weybridge alfred austin and his wife were still a centre of much  intellectual society and still as indeed they remained until the  last youthfully alert in mind  there was but one child of the  marriage anne and she was herself something new for the eyes of  the young visitor brought up as she had been like her mother  before her to the standard of a mans acquirements  only one art  had she been denied she must not learn the violin  the thought  was too monstrous even for the austins and indeed it would seem as  if that tide of reform which we may date from the days of mary  wollstonecraft had in some degree even receded for though miss  austin was suffered to learn greek the accomplishment was kept  secret like a piece of guilt  but whether this stealth was caused  by a backward movement in public thought since the time of edward  barron or by the change from enlightened norwich to barbarian  london i have no means of judging  when fleeming presented his letter he fell in love at first sight  with mrs austin and the life and atmosphere of the house  there  was in the society of the austins outward stoical conformers to  the world something gravely suggestive of essential eccentricity  something unpretentiously breathing of intellectual effort that  could not fail to hit the fancy of this hotbrained boy  the  unbroken enamel of courtesy the selfrestraint the dignified  kindness of these married folk had besides a particular attraction  for their visitor  he could not but compare what he saw with what  he knew of his mother and himself  whatever virtues fleeming  possessed he could never count on being civil whatever brave  truehearted qualities he was able to admire in mrs jenkin  mildness of demeanour was not one of them  and here he found per  sons who were the equals of his mother and himself in intellect and  width of interest and the equals of his father in mild urbanity of  disposition  show fleeming an active virtue and he always loved  it  he went away from that house struck through with admiration  and vowing to himself that his own married life should be upon that  pattern his wife whoever she might be like eliza barron himself  such another husband as alfred austin  what is more strange he  not only brought away but left behind him golden opinions  he  must have been  he was i am told  a trying lad but there shone  out of him such a light of innocent candour enthusiasm  intelligence and appreciation that to persons already some way  forward in years and thus able to enjoy indulgently the perennial  comedy of youth the sight of him was delightful  by a pleasant  coincidence there was one person in the house whom he did not  appreciate and who did not appreciate him  anne austin his future  wife  his boyish vanity ruffled her his appearance never  impressive was then by reason of obtrusive boyishness still less  so she found occasion to put him in the wrong by correcting a  false quantity and when mr austin after doing his visitor the  almost unheardof honour of accompanying him to the door announced  that was what young men were like in my time  she could only  reply looking on her handsome father i thought they had been  better looking  this first visit to the austins took place in 1855 and it seems it  was some time before fleeming began to know his mind and yet  longer ere he ventured to show it  the corrected quantity to  those who knew him well will seem to have played its part he was  the man always to reflect over a correction and to admire the  castigator  and fall in love he did not hurriedly but step by  step not blindly but with critical discrimination not in the  fashion of romeo but before he was done with all romeos ardour  and more than romeos faith  the high favour to which he presently  rose in the esteem of alfred austin and his wife might well give  him ambitious notions but the poverty of the present and the  obscurity of the future were there to give him pause and when his  aspirations began to settle round miss austin he tasted perhaps  for the only time in his life the pangs of diffidence  there was  indeed opening before him a wide door of hope  he had changed into  the service of messrs liddell  gordon these gentlemen had begun  to dabble in the new field of marine telegraphy and fleeming was  already face to face with his lifes work  that impotent sense of  his own value as of a ship aground which makes one of the agonies  of youth began to fall from him  new problems which he was  endowed to solve vistas of new enquiry which he was fitted to  explore opened before him continually  his gifts had found their  avenue and goal  and with this pleasure of effective exercise  there must have sprung up at once the hope of what is called by the  world success  but from these low beginnings it was a far look  upward to miss austin  the favour of the loved one seems always  more than problematical to any lover the consent of parents must  be always more than doubtful to a young man with a small salary and  no capital except capacity and hope  but fleeming was not the lad  to lose any good thing for the lack of trial and at length in the  autumn of 1857 this boyishsized boyishmannered and  superlatively illdressed young engineer entered the house of the  austins with such sinkings as we may fancy and asked leave to pay  his addresses to the daughter  mrs austin already loved him like  a son she was but too glad to give him her consent mr austin  reserved the right to inquire into his character from neither was  there a word about his prospects by neither was his income  mentioned  are these people he wrote struck with wonder at  this dignified disinterestedness are these people the same as  other people  it was not till he was armed with this permission  that miss austin even suspected the nature of his hopes  so  strong in this unmannerly boy was the principle of true courtesy  so powerful in this impetuous nature the springs of self repression  and yet a boy he was a boy in heart and mind and it  was with a boys chivalry and frankness that he won his wife  his  conduct was a model of honour hardly of tact to conceal love from  the loved one to court her parents to be silent and discreet till  these are won and then without preparation to approach the lady   these are not arts that i would recommend for imitation  they lead  to final refusal  nothing saved fleeming from that fate but one  circumstance that cannot be counted upon  the hearty favour of the  mother and one gift that is inimitable and that never failed him  throughout life the gift of a nature essentially noble and  outspoken  a happy and highminded anger flashed through his  despair  it won for him his wife  nearly two years passed before it was possible to marry  two years  of activity now in london now at birkenhead fitting out ships  inventing new machinery for new purposes and dipping into  electrical experiment now in the elba on his first telegraph  cruise between sardinia and algiers  a busy and delightful period  of bounding ardour incessant toil growing hope and fresh  interests with behind and through all the image of his beloved   a few extracts from his correspondence with his betrothed will give  the note of these truly joyous years  my profession gives me all  the excitement and interest i ever hope for but the sorry jade is  obviously jealous of you  poor fleeming in spite of wet  cold and wind clambering over moist tarry slips wandering among  pools of slush in waste places inhabited by wandering locomotives  grows visibly stronger has dismissed his office cough and cured  his toothache  the whole of the paying out and lifting  machinery must be designed and ordered in two or three days and i  am half crazy with work  i like it though  its like a good ball  the excitement carries you through  i was running to and from  the ships and warehouse through fierce gusts of rain and wind till  near eleven and you cannot think what a pleasure it was to be  blown about and think of you in your pretty dress  i am at the  works till ten and sometimes till eleven  but i have a nice office  to sit in with a fire to myself and bright brass scientific  instruments all round me and books to read and experiments to  make and enjoy myself amazingly  i find the study of electricity  so entertaining that i am apt to neglect my other work  and for a  last taste yesterday i had some charming electrical experiments   what shall i compare them to  a new song a greek play  it was at this time besides that he made the acquaintance of  professor now sir william thomson  to describe the part played  by these two in each others lives would lie out of my way  they  worked together on the committee on electrical standards they  served together at the laying down or the repair of many deepsea  cables and sir william was regarded by fleeming not only with the  worship the word is his own due to great scientific gifts but  with an ardour of personal friendship not frequently excelled  to  their association fleeming brought the valuable element of a  practical understanding but he never thought or spoke of himself  where sir william was in question and i recall quite in his last  days a singular instance of this modest loyalty to one whom he  admired and loved  he drew up a paper in a quite personal  interest of his own services yet even here he must step out of  his way he must add where it had no claim to be added his  opinion that in their joint work the contributions of sir william  had been always greatly the most valuable  again i shall not  readily forget with what emotion he once told me an incident of  their associated travels  on one of the mountain ledges of  madeira fleemings pony bolted between sir william and the  precipice above by strange good fortune and thanks to the  steadiness of sir williams horse no harm was done but for the  moment fleeming saw his friend hurled into the sea and almost by  his own act  it was a memory that haunted him    chapter iv  18591868    fleemings marriage  his married life  professional difficulties   life at claygate  illness of mrs f jenkin and of fleeming   appointment to the chair at edinburgh   on saturday feb 26 1859 profiting by a holiday of four days  fleeming was married to miss austin at northiam  a place connected  not only with his own family but with that of his bride as well   by tuesday morning he was at work again fitting out cableships at  birkenhead  of the walk from his lodgings to the works i find a  graphic sketch in one of his letters  out over the railway  bridge along a wide road raised to the level of a ground floor  above the land which not being built upon harbours puddles  ponds pigs and irish hovels  so to the dock warehouses four  huge piles of building with no windows surrounded by a wall about  twelve feet high  in through the large gates round which hang  twenty or thirty rusty irish playing pitch and toss and waiting  for employment  on along the railway which came in at the same  gates and which branches down between each vast block  past a  pilotengine butting refractory trucks into their places  on to  the last block and down the branch sniffing the guanoscented  air and detecting the old bones  the hartshorn flavour of the  guano becomes very strong as i near the docks where across the  elbas decks a huge vessel is discharging her cargo of the brown  dust and where huge vessels have been discharging that same cargo  for the last five months  this was the walk he took his young  wife on the morrow of his return  she had been used to the society  of lawyers and civil servants moving in that circle which seems to  itself the pivot of the nation and is in truth only a clique like  another and fleeming was to her the nameless assistant of a  nameless firm of engineers doing his inglorious business as she  now saw for herself among unsavoury surroundings  but when their  walk brought them within view of the river she beheld a sight to  her of the most novel beauty  four great seagoing ships dressed  out with flags  how lovely she cried  what is it for  for  you said fleeming  her surprise was only equalled by her  pleasure  but perhaps for what we may call private fame there is  no life like that of the engineer who is a great man in outof theway places by the dockside or on the desert island or in  populous ships and remains quite unheard of in the coteries of  london  and fleeming had already made his mark among the few who  had an opportunity of knowing him  his marriage was the one decisive incident of his career from that  moment until the day of his death he had one thought to which all  the rest were tributary the thought of his wife  no one could  know him even slightly and not remark the absorbing greatness of  that sentiment nor can any picture of the man be drawn that does  not in proportion dwell upon it  this is a delicate task but if  we are to leave behind us as we wish some presentment of the  friend we have lost it is a task that must be undertaken  for all his play of mind and fancy for all his indulgence  and  as time went on he grew indulgent  fleeming had views of duty  that were even stern  he was too shrewd a student of his fellow men to remain long content with rigid formulae of conduct  iron bound impersonal ethics the procrustean bed of rules he soon saw  at their true value as the deification of averages  as to miss i  declare i forget her name being bad i find him writing people  only mean that she has broken the decalogue  which is not at all  the same thing  people who have kept in the highroad of life  really have less opportunity for taking a comprehensive view of it  than those who have leaped over the hedges and strayed up the  hills not but what the hedges are very necessary and our stray  travellers often have a weary time of it  so you may say have  those in the dusty roads  yet he was himself a very stern  respecter of the hedgerows sought safety and found dignity in the  obvious path of conduct and would palter with no simple and  recognised duty of his epoch  of marriage in particular of the  bond so formed of the obligations incurred of the debt men owe to  their children he conceived in a truly antique spirit  not to  blame others but to constrain himself  it was not to blame i  repeat that he held these views for others he could make a large  allowance and yet he tacitly expected of his friends and his wife  a high standard of behaviour  nor was it always easy to wear the  armour of that ideal  acting upon these beliefs conceiving that he had indeed given  himself in the full meaning of these words for better for  worse painfully alive to his defects of temper and deficiency in  charm resolute to make up for these thinking last of himself   fleeming was in some ways the very man to have made a noble uphill  fight of an unfortunate marriage  in other ways it is true he was  one of the most unfit for such a trial  and it was his beautiful  destiny to remain to the last hour the same absolute and romantic  lover who had shown to his new bride the flagdraped vessels in  the mersey  no fate is altogether easy but trials are our  touchstone trials overcome our reward and it was given to  fleeming to conquer  it was given to him to live for another not  as a task but till the end as an enchanting pleasure  people may  write novels he wrote in 1869 and other people may write poems  but not a man or woman among them can write to say how happy a man  may be who is desperately in love with his wife after ten years of  marriage  and again in 1885 after more than twentysix years of  marriage and within but five weeks of his death  your first  letter from bournemouth he wrote gives me heavenly pleasure   for which i thank heaven and you too  who are my heaven on earth   the mind hesitates whether to say that such a man has been more  good or more fortunate  any woman it is the defect of her sex comes sooner to the stable  mind of maturity than any man and jenkin was to the end of a most  deliberate growth  in the next chapter when i come to deal with  his telegraphic voyages and give some taste of his correspondence  the reader will still find him at twentyfive an arrant schoolboy   his wife besides was more thoroughly educated than he  in many  ways she was able to teach him and he proud to be taught in many  ways she outshone him and he delighted to be outshone  all these  superiorities and others that after the manner of lovers he no  doubt forged for himself added as time went on to the humility of  his original love  only once in all i know of his career did he  show a touch of smallness  he could not learn to sing correctly  his wife told him so and desisted from her lessons and the  mortification was so sharply felt that for years he could not be  induced to go to a concert instanced himself as a typical man  without an ear and never sang again  i tell it for the fact that  this stood singular in his behaviour and really amazed all who  knew him is the happiest way i can imagine to commend the tenor of  his simplicity and because it illustrates his feeling for his  wife  others were always welcome to laugh at him if it amused  them or if it amused him he would proceed undisturbed with his  occupation his vanity invulnerable  with his wife it was  different  his wife had laughed at his singing and for twenty  years the fibre ached  nothing again was more notable than the  formal chivalry of this unmannered man to the person on earth with  whom he was the most familiar  he was conscious of his own innate  and often rasping vivacity and roughness and he was never forgetful  of his first visit to the austins and the vow he had registered on  his return  there was thus an artificial element in his punctilio  that at times might almost raise a smile  but it stood on noble  grounds for this was how he sought to shelter from his own  petulance the woman who was to him the symbol of the household and  to the end the beloved of his youth  i wish in this chapter to chronicle small beer taking a hasty  glance at some ten years of married life and of professional  struggle and reserving till the next all the more interesting  matter of his cruises  of his achievements and their worth it is  not for me to speak  his friend and partner sir william thomson  has contributed a note on the subject which will be found in the  appendix and to which i must refer the reader  he is to conceive  in the meanwhile for himself fleemings manifold engagements  his  service on the committee on electrical standards his lectures on  electricity at chatham his chair at the london university his  partnership with sir william thomson and mr varley in many  ingenious patents his growing credit with engineers and men of  science and he is to bear in mind that of all this activity and  acquist of reputation the immediate profit was scanty  soon after  his marriage fleeming had left the service of messrs liddell   gordon  and entered into a general engineering partnership with  mr forde a gentleman in a good way of business  it was a  fortunate partnership in this that the parties retained their  mutual respect unlessened and separated with regret but mens  affairs like men have their times of sickness and by one of  these unaccountable variations for hard upon ten years the  business was disappointing and the profits meagre  inditing  drafts of german railways which will never get made  it is thus i  find fleeming not without a touch of bitterness describe his  occupation  even the patents hung fire at first  there was no  salary to rely on children were coming and growing up the  prospect was often anxious  in the days of his courtship fleeming  had written to miss austin a dissuasive picture of the trials of  poverty assuring her these were no figments but truly bitter to  support he told her this he wrote beforehand so that when the  pinch came and she suffered she should not be disappointed in  herself nor tempted to doubt her own magnanimity  a letter of  admirable wisdom and solicitude  but now that the trouble came he  bore it very lightly  it was his principle as he once prettily  expressed it to enjoy each days happiness as it arises like  birds or children  his optimism if driven out at the door would  come in again by the window if it found nothing but blackness in  the present would hit upon some ground of consolation in the  future or the past  and his courage and energy were indefatigable   in the year 1863 soon after the birth of their first son they  moved into a cottage at claygate near esher and about this time  under manifold troubles both of money and health i find him  writing from abroad  the country will give us please god health  and strength  i will love and cherish you more than ever you  shall go where you wish you shall receive whom you wish  and as  for money you shall have that too  i cannot be mistaken  i have  now measured myself with many men  i do not feel weak i do not  feel that i shall fail  in many things i have succeeded and i  will in this  and meanwhile the time of waiting which please  heaven shall not be long shall also not be so bitter  well  well i promise much and do not know at this moment how you and  the dear child are  if he is but better courage my girl for i  see light  this cottage at claygate stood just without the village well  surrounded with trees and commanding a pleasant view  a piece of  the garden was turfed over to form a croquet green and fleeming  became i need scarce say a very ardent player  he grew ardent  too in gardening  this he took up at first to please his wife  having no natural inclination but he had no sooner set his hand to  it than like everything else he touched it became with him a  passion  he budded roses he potted cuttings in the coachhouse  if there came a change of weather at night he would rise out of  bed to protect his favourites when he was thrown with a dull  companion it was enough for him to discover in the man a fellow  gardener on his travels he would go out of his way to visit  nurseries and gather hints and to the end of his life after other  occupations prevented him putting his own hand to the spade he  drew up a yearly programme for his gardener in which all details  were regulated  he had begun by this time to write  his paper on  darwin which had the merit of convincing on one point the  philosopher himself had indeed been written before this in london  lodgings but his pen was not idle at claygate and it was here he  wrote among other things that review of fecundity fertility  sterility and allied topics which dr matthews duncan prefixed  by way of introduction to the second edition of the work  the mere  act of writing seems to cheer the vanity of the most incompetent  but a correction accepted by darwin and a whole review borrowed  and reprinted by matthews duncan are compliments of a rare strain  and to a man still unsuccessful must have been precious indeed   there was yet a third of the same kind in store for him and when  munro himself owned that he had found instruction in the paper on  lucretius we may say that fleeming had been crowned in the capitol  of reviewing  croquet charades christmas magic lanterns for the village  children an amateur concert or a review article in the evening  plenty of hard work by day regular visits to meetings of the  british association from one of which i find him  characteristically writing  i cannot say that i have had any  amusement yet but i am enjoying the dulness and dry bustle of the  whole thing occasional visits abroad on business when he would  find the time to glean as i have said gardening hints for  himself and old folksongs or new fashions of dress for his wife  and the continual study and care of his children  these were the  chief elements of his life  nor were friends wanting  captain and  mrs jenkin mr and mrs austin clerk maxwell miss bell of  manchester and others came to them on visits  mr hertslet of the  foreign office his wife and his daughter were neighbours and  proved kind friends in 1867 the howitts came to claygate and  sought the society of the two bright clever young people and in  a house close by mr frederick ricketts came to live with his  family  mr ricketts was a valued friend during his short life  and when he was lost with every circumstance of heroism in the la  plata fleeming mourned him sincerely  i think i shall give the best idea of fleeming in this time of his  early married life by a few sustained extracts from his letters to  his wife while she was absent on a visit in 1864  nov 11  sunday was too wet to walk to isleworth for which i  was sorry so i staid and went to church and thought of you at  ardwick all through the commandments and heard dr  expound in a  remarkable way a prophecy of st pauls about roman catholics  which mutatis mutandis would do very well for protestants in some  parts  then i made a little nursery of borecole and enfield market  cabbage grubbing in wet earth with leggings and gray coat on   then i tidied up the coachhouse to my own and christines  admiration  then encouraged by boutsrimes i wrote you a copy of  verses high time i think i shall just save my tenth year of  knowing my ladylove without inditing poetry or rhymes to her  then i rummaged over the box with my fathers letters and found  interesting notes from myself  one i should say my first letter  which little austin i should say would rejoice to see and shall see   with a drawing of a cottage and a spirited cob  what was more  to the purpose i found with it a pastecutter which mary begged  humbly for christine and i generously gave this morning  then i read some of congreve  there are admirable scenes in the  manner of sheridan all wit and no character or rather one  character in a great variety of situations and scenes  i could  show you some scenes but others are too coarse even for my stomach  hardened by a course of french novels  all things look so happy for the rain  nov 16  verbenas looking well    i am but a poor creature  without you i have naturally no spirit or fun or enterprise in me   only a kind of mechanical capacity for ascertaining whether two  really is half four etc but when you are near me i can fancy  that i too shine and vainly suppose it to be my proper light  whereas by my extreme darkness when you are not by it clearly can  only be by a reflected brilliance that i seem aught but dull  then  for the moral part of me  if it were not for you and little odden  i should feel by no means sure that i had any affection power in  me    even the muscular me suffers a sad deterioration in your  absence  i dont get up when i ought to i have snoozed in my  chair after dinner i do not go in at the garden with my wonted  vigour and feel ten times as tired as usual with a walk in your  absence so you see when you are not by i am a person without  ability affections or vigour but droop dull selfish and  spiritless can you wonder that i love you  nov 17     i am very glad we married young  i would not  have missed these five years no not for any hopes they are my  own  nov 30  i got through my chatham lecture very fairly though  almost all my apparatus went astray  i dined at the mess and got  home to isleworth the same evening your father very kindly sitting  up for me  dec 1  back at dear claygate  many cuttings flourish  especially those which do honour to your hand  your californian  annuals are up and about  badger is fat the grass green     dec 3  odden will not talk of you while you are away having  inherited as i suspect his fathers way of declining to consider  a subject which is painful as your absence is    i certainly  should like to learn greek and i think it would be a capital  pastime for the long winter evenings    how things are  misrated  i declare croquet is a noble occupation compared to the  pursuits of business men  as for socalled idleness  that is one  form of it  i vow it is the noblest aim of man  when idle one  can love one can be good feel kindly to all devote oneself to  others be thankful for existence educate ones mind ones heart  ones body  when busy as i am busy now or have been busy today  one feels just as you sometimes felt when you were too busy owing  to want of servants  dec 5  on sunday i was at isleworth chiefly engaged in playing  with odden  we had the most enchanting walk together through the  brickfields  it was very muddy and as he remarked not fit for  nanna but fit for us men  the dreary waste of bared earth  thatched sheds and standing water was a paradise to him and when  we walked up planks to deserted mixing and crushing mills and  actually saw where the clay was stirred with long iron prongs and  chalk or lime ground with a tind of a mill his expression of  contentment and triumphant heroism knew no limit to its beauty  of  course on returning i found mrs austin looking out at the door in  an anxious manner and thinking we had been out quite long enough     i am reading don quixote chiefly and am his fervent admirer  but i am so sorry he did not place his affections on a dulcinea of  somewhat worthier stamp  in fact i think there must be a mistake  about it  don quixote might and would serve his lady in most  preposterous fashion but i am sure he would have chosen a lady of  merit  he imagined her to be such no doubt and drew a charming  picture of her occupations by the banks of the river but in his  other imaginations there was some kind of peg on which to hang the  false costumes he created windmills are big and wave their arms  like giants sheep in the distance are somewhat like an army a  little boat on the riverside must look much the same whether  enchanted or belonging to millers but except that dulcinea is a  woman she bears no resemblance at all to the damsel of his  imagination  at the time of these letters the oldest son only was born to them   in september of the next year with the birth of the second  charles frewen there befell fleeming a terrible alarm and what  proved to be a lifelong misfortune  mrs jenkin was taken suddenly  and alarmingly ill fleeming ran a matter of two miles to fetch the  doctor and drenched with sweat as he was returned with him at  once in an open gig  on their arrival at the house mrs jenkin  half unconsciously took and kept hold of her husbands hand  by  the doctors orders windows and doors were set open to create a  thorough draught and the patient was on no account to be  disturbed  thus then did fleeming pass the whole of that night  crouching on the floor in the draught and not daring to move lest  he should wake the sleeper  he had never been strong energy had  stood him instead of vigour and the result of that nights  exposure was flying rheumatism varied by settled sciatica   sometimes it quite disabled him sometimes it was less acute but  he was rarely free from it until his death  i knew him for many  years for more than ten we were closely intimate i have lived  with him for weeks and during all this time he only once referred  to his infirmity and then perforce as an excuse for some trouble he  put me to and so slightly worded that i paid no heed  this is a  good measure of his courage under sufferings of which none but the  untried will think lightly  and i think it worth noting how this  optimist was acquainted with pain  it will seem strange only to  the superficial  the disease of pessimism springs never from real  troubles which it braces men to bear which it delights men to  bear well  nor does it readily spring at all in minds that have  conceived of life as a field of ordered duties not as a chase in  which to hunt for gratifications  we are not here to be happy  but to be good i wish he had mended the phrase  we are not here  to be happy but to try to be good comes nearer the modesty of  truth  with such oldfashioned morality it is possible to get  through life and see the worst of it and feel some of the worst  of it and still acquiesce piously and even gladly in mans fate   feel some of the worst of it i say for some of the rest of the  worst is by this simple faith excluded  it was in the year 1868 that the clouds finally rose  the  business in partnership with mr forde began suddenly to pay well  about the same time the patents showed themselves a valuable  property and but a little after fleeming was appointed to the new  chair of engineering in the university of edinburgh  thus almost  at once pecuniary embarrassments passed for ever out of his life   here is his own epilogue to the time at claygate and his  anticipations of the future in edinburgh       the dear old house at claygate is not let and the pretty  garden a mass of weeds  i feel rather as if we had behaved  unkindly to them  we were very happy there but now that it is  over i am conscious of the weight of anxiety as to money which i  bore all the time  with you in the garden with austin in the  coachhouse with pretty songs in the little low white room with  the moonlight in the dear room upstairs ah it was perfect but  the long walk wondering pondering fearing scheming and the  dusty jolting railway and the horrid fusty office with its endless  disappointments they are well gone  it is well enough to fight  and scheme and bustle about in the eager crowd here in london for  a while now and then but not for a lifetime  what i have now is  just perfect  study for winter action for summer lovely country  for recreation a pleasant town for talk       chapter v  notes of telegraph voyages 1858 to 1873    but it is now time to see jenkin at his lifes work  i have before  me certain imperfect series of letters written as he says at  hazard for one does not know at the time what is important and  what is not  the earlier addressed to miss austin after the  betrothal the later to mrs jenkin the young wife  i should  premise that i have allowed myself certain editorial freedoms  leaving out and splicing together much as he himself did with the  bona cable  thus edited the letters speak for themselves and will  fail to interest none who love adventure or activity  addressed as  they were to her whom he called his dear engineering pupil they  give a picture of his work so clear that a child may understand  and so attractive that i am half afraid their publication may prove  harmful and still further crowd the ranks of a profession already  overcrowded  but their most engaging quality is the picture of the  writer with his indomitable selfconfidence and courage his  readiness in every pinch of circumstance or change of plan and his  ever fresh enjoyment of the whole web of human experience nature  adventure science toil and rest society and solitude  it should  be borne in mind that the writer of these buoyant pages was even  while he wrote harassed by responsibility stinted in sleep and  often struggling with the prostration of seasickness  to this  last enemy which he never overcame i have omitted in my search  after condensation a good many references if they were all left  such was the mans temper they would not represent one hundredth  part of what he suffered for he was never given to complaint  but  indeed he had met this ugly trifle as he met every thwart  circumstance of life with a certain pleasure of pugnacity and  suffered it not to check him whether in the exercise of his  profession or the pursuit of amusement   i   birkenhead  april 18 1858  well you should know mr  having a contract to lay down a  submarine telegraph from sardinia to africa failed three times in  the attempt  the distance from land to land is about 140 miles   on the first occasion after proceeding some 70 miles he had to  cut the cable  the cause i forget he tried again same result  then picked up about 20 miles of the lost cable spliced on a new  piece and very nearly got across that time but ran short of  cable and when but a few miles off galita in very deep water had  to telegraph to london for more cable to be manufactured and sent  out whilst he tried to stick to the end  for five days i think  he lay there sending and receiving messages but heavy weather  coming on the cable parted and mr  went home in despair  at  least i should think so  he then applied to those eminent engineers r s newall  co  who made and laid down a cable for him last autumn  fleeming  jenkin at the time in considerable mental agitation having the  honour of fitting out the elba for that purpose  on this  occasion the elba has no cable to lay but is going out in the  beginning of may to endeavour to fish up the cables mr  lost   there are two ends at or near the shore  the third will probably  not be found within 20 miles from land  one of these ends will be  passed over a very big pulley or sheave at the bows passed six  times round a big barrel or drum which will be turned round by a  steam engine on deck and thus wind up the cable while the elba  slowly steams ahead  the cable is not wound round and round the  drum as your silk is wound on its reel but on the contrary never  goes round more than six times going off at one side as it comes  on at the other and going down into the hold of the elba to be  coiled along in a big coil or skein  i went down to gateshead to discuss with mr newall the form which  this tolerably simple idea should take and have been busy since i  came here drawing ordering and putting up the machinery   uninterfered with thank goodness by any one  i own i like  responsibility it flatters one and then your father might say i  have more to gain than to lose  moreover i do like this bloodless  painless combat with wood and iron forcing the stubborn rascals to  do my will licking the clumsy cubs into an active shape seeing  the child of todays thought working tomorrow in full vigour at  his appointed task  may 12  by dint of bribing bullying cajoling and going day by day to  see the state of things ordered all my work is very nearly ready  now but those who have neglected these precautions are of course  disappointed  five hundred fathoms of chain were ordered by   some three weeks since to be ready by the 10th without fail he  sends for it today  150 fathoms all they can let us have by the  15th  and how the rest is to be got who knows  he ordered a boat  a month since and yesterday we could see nothing of her but the  keel and about two planks  i could multiply instances without end   at first one goes nearly mad with vexation at these things but one  finds so soon that they are the rule that then it becomes  necessary to feign a rage one does not feel  i look upon it as the  natural order of things that if i order a thing it will not be  done  if by accident it gets done it will certainly be done  wrong  the only remedy being to watch the performance at every  stage  today was a grand fieldday  i had steam up and tried the engine  against pressure or resistance  one part of the machinery is  driven by a belt or strap of leather  i always had my doubts this  might slip and so it did wildly  i had made provision for  doubling it putting on two belts instead of one  no use  off  they went slipping round and off the pulleys instead of driving  the machinery  tighten them  no use  more strength there  down  with the lever  smash something tear the belts but get them  tight  now then stand clear on with the steam  and the belts  slip away as if nothing held them  men begin to look queer the  circle of quidnuncs make sage remarks  once more  no use  i  begin to know i ought to feel sheepish and beat but somehow i feel  cocky instead  i laugh and say well i am bound to break  something down  and suddenly see  oho theres the place get  weight on there and the belt wont slip  with much labour on go  the belts again  now then a spar thro there and six mens  weight on mind youre not carried away  ay ay sir  but  evidently no one believes in the plan  hurrah round she goes   stick to your spar  all right shut off steam  and the  difficulty is vanquished  this or such as this not always quite so bad occurs hour after  hour while five hundred tons of coal are rattling down into the  holds and bunkers riveters are making their infernal row all  round and riggers bend the sails and fit the rigging a sort of  pandemonium it appeared to young mrs newall who was here on  monday and halfchoked with guano but it suits the likes o me  s s elba river mersey  may 17  we are delayed in the river by some of the ships papers not being  ready  such a scene at the dock gates  not a sailor will join  till the last moment and then just as the ship forges ahead  through the narrow pass beds and baggage fly on board the men  half tipsy clutch at the rigging the captain swears the women  scream and sob the crowd cheer and laugh while one or two pretty  little girls stand still and cry outright regardless of all eyes  these two days of comparative peace have quite set me on my legs  again  i was getting worn and weary with anxiety and work  as  usual i have been delighted with my shipwrights  i gave them some  beer on saturday making a short oration  today when they went  ashore and i came on board they gave three cheers whether for me  or the ship i hardly know but i had just bid them goodbye and  the ship was out of hail but i was startled and hardly liked to  claim the compliment by acknowledging it  s s elba  may 25  my first intentions of a long journal have been fairly frustrated  by seasickness  on tuesday last about noon we started from the  mersey in very dirty weather and were hardly out of the river when  we met a gale from the southwest and a heavy sea both right in  our teeth and the poor elba had a sad shaking  had i not been  very seasick the sight would have been exciting enough as i sat  wrapped in my oilskins on the bridge but in spite of all my  efforts to talk to eat and to grin i soon collapsed into  imbecility and i was heartily thankful towards evening to find  myself in bed  next morning i fancied it grew quieter and as i listened heard  let go the anchor whereon i concluded we had run into holyhead  harbour as was indeed the case  all that day we lay in holyhead  but i could neither read nor write nor draw  the captain of  another steamer which had put in came on board and we all went for  a walk on the hill and in the evening there was an exchange of  presents  we gave some tobacco i think and received a cat two  pounds of fresh butter a cumberland ham westward ho and  thackerays english humourists  i was astonished at receiving two  such fair books from the captain of a little coasting screw  our  captain said he the captain of the screw had plenty of money  five or six hundred a year at least  what in the world makes him  go rolling about in such a craft then  why i fancy hes  reckless hes desperate in love with that girl i mentioned and  she wont look at him  our honest fat old captain says this  very grimly in his thick broad voice  my head wont stand much writing yet so i will run up and take a  look at the blue night sky off the coast of portugal  may 26  a nice lad of some two and twenty a by name goes out in a  nondescript capacity as part purser part telegraph clerk part  generally useful person  a was a great comfort during the  miseries of the gale for when with a dead head wind and a heavy  sea plates books papers stomachs were being rolled about in sad  confusion we generally managed to lie on our backs and grin and  try discordant staves of the flowers of the forest and the low backed car  we could sing and laugh when we could do nothing  else though a was ready to swear after each fit was past that  that was the first time he had felt anything and at this moment  would declare in broad scotch that hed never been sick at all  qualifying the oath with except for a minute now and then  he  brought a cornetapiston to practice on having had three weeks  instructions on that melodious instrument and if you could hear  the horrid sounds that come especially at heavy rolls  when i  hint he is not improving there comes a confession  i dont feel  quite right yet you see  but he blows away manfully and in  selfdefence i try to roar the tune louder  1130 pm  long past cape st vincent now  we went within about 400 yards of  the cliffs and lighthouse in a calm moonlight with porpoises  springing from the sea the men crooning long ballads as they lay  idle on the forecastle and the sails flapping uncertain on the  yards  as we passed there came a sudden breeze from land hot and  heavy scented and now as i write its warm rich flavour contrasts  strongly with the salt air we have been breathing  i paced the deck with h the second mate and in the quiet night  drew a confession that he was engaged to be married and gave him a  world of good advice  he is a very nice active little fellow  with a broad scotch tongue and dirty little rascal appearance   he had a sad disappointment at starting  having been second mate  on the last voyage when the first mate was discharged he took  charge of the elba all the time she was in port and of course  looked forward to being chief mate this trip  liddell promised him  the post  he had not authority to do this and when newall heard  of it he appointed another man  fancy poor hhaving told all the  men and most of all his sweetheart  but more remains behind for  when it came to signing articles it turned out that o the new  first mate had not a certificate which allowed him to have a  second mate  then came rather an affecting scene  for h proposed  to sign as chief he having the necessary higher certificate but  to act as second for the lower wages  at first o would not give  in but offered to go as second  but our brave little h said no   the owners wished mr o to be chief mate and chief mate he  should be  so he carried the day signed as chief and acts as  second  shakespeare and byron are his favourite books  i walked  into byron a little but can well understand his stirring up a  rough young sailors romance  i lent him westward ho from the  cabin but to my astonishment he did not care much for it he said  it smelt of the shilling railway library perhaps i had praised it  too highly  scott is his standard for novels  i am very happy to  find good taste by no means confined to gentlemen h having no  pretensions to that title  he is a man after my own heart  then i came down to the cabin and heard young as schemes for the  future  his highest picture is a commission in the prince of  vizianagrams irregular horse  his eldest brother is tutor to his  highnesss children and grand vizier and magistrate and on his  highnesss household staff and seems to be one of those scotch  adventurers one meets with and hears of in queer berths  raising  cavalry building palaces and using some petty eastern kings long  purse with their long scotch heads  off bona june 4  i read your letter carefully leaning back in a maltese boat to  present the smallest surface of my body to a grilling sun and  sailing from the elba to cape hamrah about three miles distant   how we fried and sighed  at last we reached land under fort  genova and i was carried ashore pickaback and plucked the first  flower i saw for annie  it was a strange scene far more novel  than i had imagined  the high steep banks covered with rich  spicy vegetation of which i hardly knew one plant  the dwarf palm  with fanlike leaves growing about two feet high formed the  staple of the verdure  as we brushed through them the gummy  leaves of a cistus stuck to the clothes and with its small white  flower and yellow heart stood for our english dogrose  in place  of heather we had myrtle and lentisque with leaves somewhat  similar  that large bulb with long flat leaves  do not touch it  if your hands are cut the arabs use it as blisters for their  horses  is that the same sort  no take that one up it is the  bulb of a dwarf palm each layer of the onion peels off brown and  netted like the outside of a cocoanut  it is a clever plant  that from the leaves we get a vegetable horsehair  and eat the  bottom of the centre spike  all the leaves you pull have the same  aromatic scent  but here a little patch of cleared ground shows  old friends who seem to cling by abused civilisationfine hardy  thistles one of them bright yellow though  honest scotch looking large daisies or gowans  potatoes here and there  looking but sickly and dark sturdy figtrees looking cool and at  their ease in the burning sun  here we are at fort genova crowning the little point a small old  building due to my old genoese acquaintance who fought and traded  bravely once upon a time  a broken cannon of theirs forms the  threshold and through a dark low arch we enter upon broad  terraces sloping to the centre from which rain water may collect  and run into that well  largebreeched french troopers lounge  about and are most civil and the whole party sit down to breakfast  in a little whitewashed room from the door of which the long  mountain coastline and the sparkling sea show of an impossible blue  through the openings of a whitewashed rampart  i try a seaegg  one of those prickly fellows  seaurchins they are called  sometimes the shell is of a lovely purple and when opened there  are rays of yellow adhering to the inside these i eat but they  are very fishy  we are silent and shy of one another and soon go out to watch  while turbaned bluebreeched barelegged arabs dig holes for the  land telegraph posts on the following principle  one man takes a  pick and bangs lazily at the hard earth when a little is loosened  his mate with a small spade lifts it on one side and da capo   they have regular features and look quite in place among the palms   our english workmen screw the earthenware insulators on the posts  strain the wire and order arabs about by the generic term of  johnny  i find w has nothing for me to do and that in fact no  one has anything to do  some instruments for testing have stuck at  lyons some at cagliari and nothing can be done  or at any rate  is done  i wander about thinking of you and staring at big green  grasshoppers  locusts some people call them  and smelling the  rich brushwood  there was nothing for a pencil to sketch and i  soon got tired of this work though i have paid willingly much  money for far less strange and lovely sights  off cape spartivento  june 8  at two this morning we left cagliari at five cast anchor here   i got up and began preparing for the final trial and shortly  afterwards everyone else of note on board went ashore to make  experiments on the state of the cable leaving me with the prospect  of beginning to lift at 12 oclock  i was not ready by that time  but the experiments were not concluded and moreover the cable was  found to be imbedded some four or five feet in sand so that the  boat could not bring off the end  at three messrs liddell c  came on board in good spirits having found two wires good or in  such a state as permitted messages to be transmitted freely  the  boat now went to grapple for the cable some way from shore while  the elba towed a small lateen craft which was to take back the  consul to cagliari some distance on its way  on our return we  found the boat had been unsuccessful she was allowed to drop  astern while we grappled for the cable in the elba without more  success  the coast is a low mountain range covered with brushwood  or heather  pools of water and a sandy beach at their feet  i  have not yet been ashore my hands having been very full all day  june 9  grappling for the cable outside the bank had been voted too  uncertain and the day was spent in efforts to pull the cable off  through the sand which has accumulated over it  by getting the  cable tight on to the boat and letting the swell pitch her about  till it got slack and then tightening again with blocks and  pulleys we managed to get out from the beach towards the ship at  the rate of about twenty yards an hour  when they had got about  100 yards from shore we ran round in the elba to try and help  them letting go the anchor in the shallowest possible water this  was about sunset  suddenly someone calls out he sees the cable at  the bottom  there it was sure enough apparently wriggling about  as the waves rippled  great excitement still greater when we find  our own anchor is foul of it and has been the means of bringing it  to light  we let go a grapnel get the cable clear of the anchor  on to the grapnel  the captain in an agony lest we should drift  ashore meanwhile  hand the grappling line into the big boat steam  out far enough and anchor again  a little more work and one end  of the cable is up over the bows round my drum  i go to my engine  and we start hauling in  all goes pretty well but it is quite  dark  lamps are got at last and men arranged  we go on for a  quarter of a mile or so from shore and then stop at about halfpast  nine with orders to be up at three  grand work at last  a number  of the saturday review here it reads so hot and feverish so  tomblike and unhealthy in the midst of dear natures hills and  sea with good wholesome work to do  pray that all go well to morrow  june 10  thank heaven for a most fortunate day  at three oclock this  morning in a damp chill mist all hands were roused to work  with  a small delay for one or two improvements i had seen to be  necessary last night the engine started and since that time i do  not think there has been half an hours stoppage  a rope to  splice a block to change a wheel to oil an old rusted anchor to  disengage from the cable which brought it up these have been our  only obstructions  sixty seventy eighty a hundred a hundred  and twenty revolutions at last my little engine tears away  the  even black rope comes straight out of the blue heaving water   passes slowly round an openhearted goodtempered looking pulley  five feet diameter aft past a vicious nipper to bring all up  should anything go wrong through a gentle guide on to a huge  bluff drum who wraps him round his body and says come you must  as plain as drum can speak  the chattering pauls say ive got  him ive got him he cant get back whilst black cable much  slacker and easier in mind and body is taken by a slim vpulley  and passed down into the huge hold where half a dozen men put him  comfortably to bed after his exertion in rising from his long bath   in good sooth it is one of the strangest sights i know to see that  black fellow rising up so steadily in the midst of the blue sea   we are more than half way to the place where we expect the fault  and already the one wire supposed previously to be quite bad near  the african coast can be spoken through  i am very glad i am  here for my machines are my own children and i look on their  little failings with a parents eye and lead them into the path of  duty with gentleness and firmness  i am naturally in good spirits  but keep very quiet for misfortunes may arise at any instant  moreover tomorrow my payingout apparatus will be wanted should  all go well and that will be another nervous operation  fifteen  miles are safely in but no one knows better than i do that nothing  is done till all is done  june 11  9 am  we have reached the splice supposed to be faulty and no  fault has been found  the two men learned in electricity l and  w squabble where the fault is  evening  a weary day in a hot broiling sun no air  after the  experiments l said the fault might be ten miles ahead  by that  time we should be according to a chart in about a thousand fathoms  of water  rather more than a mile  it was most difficult to  decide whether to go on or not  i made preparations for a heavy  pull set small things to rights and went to sleep  about four in  the afternoon mr liddell decided to proceed and we are now at  seven grinding it in at the rate of a mile and threequarters per  hour which appears a grand speed to us  if the payingout only  works well  i have just thought of a great improvement in it i  cant apply it this time however  the sea is of an oily calm  and a perfect fleet of brigs and ships surrounds us their sails  hardly filling in the lazy breeze  the sun sets behind the dim  coast of the isola san pietro the coast of sardinia high and  rugged becomes softer and softer in the distance while to the  westward still the isolated rock of toro springs from the horizon   it would amuse you to see how cool in head and jolly everybody  is  a testy word now and then shows the wires are strained a  little but everyone laughs and makes his little jokes as if it  were all in fun  yet we are all as much in earnest as the most  earnest of the earnest bastard german school or demonstrative of  frenchmen  i enjoy it very much  june 12  530 am  out of sight of land  about thirty nautical miles in  the hold the wind rising a little experiments being made for a  fault while the engine slowly revolves to keep us hanging at the  same spot  depth supposed about a mile  the machinery has behaved  admirably  oh that the payingout were over  the new machinery  there is but rough meant for an experiment in shallow water and  here we are in a mile of water  630  i have made my calculations and find the new payingout  gear cannot possibly answer at this depth some portion would give  way  luckily i have brought the old things with me and am getting  them rigged up as fast as may be  bad news from the cable  number  four has given in some portion of the last ten miles  the fault in  number three is still at the bottom of the sea  number two is now  the only good wire and the hold is getting in such a mess through  keeping bad bits out and cutting for splicing and testing that  there will be great risk in paying out  the cable is somewhat  strained in its ascent from one mile below us what it will be when  we get to two miles is a problem we may have to determine  9 pm  a most provoking unsatisfactory day  we have done  nothing  the wind and sea have both risen  too little notice has  been given to the telegraphists who accompany this expedition they  had to leave all their instruments at lyons in order to arrive at  bona in time our tests are therefore of the roughest and no one  really knows where the faults are  mr l in the morning lost much  time then he told us after we had been inactive for about eight  hours that the fault in number three was within six miles and at  six oclock in the evening when all was ready for a start to pick  up these six miles he comes and says there must be a fault about  thirty miles from bona  by this time it was too late to begin  paying out today and we must lie here moored in a thousand fathoms  till light tomorrow morning  the ship pitches a good deal but  the wind is going down  june 13 sunday  the wind has not gone down however  it now at 1030 blows a  pretty stiff gale the sea has also risen and the elbas bows rise  and fall about 9 feet  we make twelve pitches to the minute and  the poor cable must feel very seasick by this time  we are quite  unable to do anything and continue riding at anchor in one  thousand fathoms the engines going constantly so as to keep the  ships bows up to the cable which by this means hangs nearly  vertical and sustains no strain but that caused by its own weight  and the pitching of the vessel  we were all up at four but the  weather entirely forbade work for today so some went to bed and  most lay down making up our leeway as we nautically term our loss  of sleep  i must say liddell is a fine fellow and keeps his  patience and temper wonderfully and yet how he does fret and fume  about trifles at home  this wind has blown now for 36 hours and  yet we have telegrams from bona to say the sea there is as calm as  a mirror  it makes one laugh to remember one is still tied to the  shore  click click click the pecker is at work  i wonder what  herr p says to herr l  tests tests tests nothing more  this  will be a very anxious day  june 14  another day of fatal inaction  june 15  930  the wind has gone down a deal but even now there are  doubts whether we shall start today  when shall i get back to  you  9 pm  four miles from land  our run has been successful and  eventless  now the work is nearly over i feel a little out of  spirits  why i should be puzzled to say  mere wantonness or  reaction perhaps after suspense  june 16  up this morning at three coupled my selfacting gear to the brake  and had the satisfaction of seeing it pay out the last four miles  in very good style  with one or two little improvements i hope to  make it a capital thing  the end has just gone ashore in two  boats three out of four wires good  thus ends our first  expedition  by some odd chance a times of june the 7th has found  its way on board through the agency of a wretched old peasant who  watches the end of the line here  a long account of breakages in  the atlantic trial trip  tonight we grapple for the heavy cable  eight tons to the mile  i long to have a tug at him he may puzzle  me and though misfortunes or rather difficulties are a bore at the  time life when working with cables is tame without them  2 pm  hurrah he is hooked the big fellow almost at the first  cast  he hangs under our bows looking so huge and imposing that i  could find it in my heart to be afraid of him  june 17  we went to a little bay called chia where a freshwater stream  falls into the sea and took in water  this is rather a long  operation so i went a walk up the valley with mr liddell  the  coast here consists of rocky mountains 800 to 1000 feet high  covered with shrubs of a brilliant green  on landing our first  amusement was watching the hundreds of large fish who lazily swam  in shoals about the river the big canes on the further side hold  numberless tortoises we are told but see none for just now they  prefer taking a siesta  a little further on and what is this with  large pink flowers in such abundance  the oleander in full  flower  at first i fear to pluck them thinking they must be  cultivated and valuable but soon the banks show a long line of  thick tall shrubs one mass of glorious pink and green  set these  in a little valley framed by mountains whose rocks gleam out blue  and purple colours such as preraphaelites only dare attempt  shining out hard and weirdlike amongst the clumps of castoroil  plants oistus arbor vitae and many other evergreens whose names  alas i know not the cistus is brown now the rest all deep or  brilliant green  large herds of cattle browse on the baked deposit  at the foot of these large crags  one or two halfsavage herdsmen  in sheepskin kilts c ask for cigars partridges whirr up on  either side of us pigeons coo and nightingales sing amongst the  blooming oleander  we get six sheep and many fowls too from the  priest of the small village and then run back to spartivento and  make preparations for the morning  june 18  the big cable is stubborn and will not behave like his smaller  brother  the gear employed to take him off the drum is not strong  enough he gets slack on the drum and plays the mischief  luckily  for my own conscience the gear i had wanted was negatived by mr  newall  mr liddell does not exactly blame me but he says we  might have had a silver pulley cheaper than the cost of this delay   he has telegraphed for more men to cagliari to try to pull the  cable off the drum into the hold by hand  i look as comfortable  as i can but feel as if people were blaming me  i am trying my  best to get something rigged which may help us i wanted a little  difficulty and feel much better  the short length we have picked  up was covered at places with beautiful sprays of coral twisted  and twined with shells of those small fairy animals we saw in the  aquarium at home poor little things they died at once with their  little bells and delicate bright tints  12 oclock  hurrah victory for the present anyhow  whilst in  our first dejection i thought i saw a place where a flat roller  would remedy the whole misfortune but a flat roller at cape  spartivento hard easily unshipped running freely  there was a  grooved pulley used for the payingout machinery with a spindle  wheel which might suit me  i filled him up with tarry spunyarn  nailed sheet copper round him bent some parts in the fire and we  are payingin without more trouble now  you would think some one  would praise me no no more praise than blame before perhaps now  they think better of me though  10 pm  we have gone on very comfortably for nearly six miles   an hour and a half was spent washing down for along with many  coloured polypi from corals shells and insects the big cable  brings up much mud and rust and makes a fishy smell by no means  pleasant  the bottom seems to teem with life  but now we are  startled by a most unpleasant grinding noise which appeared at  first to come from the large low pulley but when the engines  stopped the noise continued and we now imagine it is something  slipping down the cable and the pulley but acts as soundingboard  to the big fiddle  whether it is only an anchor or one of the two  other cables we know not  we hope it is not the cable just laid  down  june 19  10 am  all our alarm groundless it would appear  the odd  noise ceased after a time and there was no mark sufficiently  strong on the large cable to warrant the suspicion that we had cut  another line through  i stopped up on the lookout till three in  the morning which made 23 hours between sleep and sleep  one goes  dozing about though most of the day for it is only when  something goes wrong that one has to look alive  hour after hour  i stand on the forecastlehead picking off little specimens of  polypi and coral or lie on the saloon deck reading back numbers of  the times  till something hitches and then all is hurlyburly  once more  there are awnings all along the ship and a most  ancient fishlike smell beneath  1 oclock  suddenly a great strain in only 95 fathoms of water   belts surging and general dismay grapnels being thrown out in the  hope of finding what holds the cable  should it prove the young  cable  we are apparently crossing its path  not the working one  but the lost child mr liddell would start the big one first  though it was laid first  he wanted to see the job done and meant  to leave us to the small one unaided by his presence  330  grapnel caught something lost it again it left its marks  on the prongs  started lifting gear again and after hauling in  some 50 fathoms  grunt grunt grunt  we hear the other cable  slipping down our big one playing the selfsame tune we heard last  night  louder however  10 pm  the pull on the deck engines became harder and harder   i got steam up in a boiler on deck and another little engine  starts hauling at the grapnel  i wonder if there ever was such a  scene of confusion  mr liddell and w and the captain all giving  orders contradictory c on the forecastle d the foreman of  our men the mates c following the example of our superiors  the ships engine and boilers below a 50horse engine on deck a  boiler 14 feet long on deck beside it a little steam winch tearing  round a dozen italians 20 have come to relieve our hands the men  we telegraphed for to cagliari hauling at the rope wiremen  sailors in the crevices left by ropes and machinery everything  that could swear swearing  i found myself swearing like a trooper  at last  we got the unknown difficulty within ten fathoms of the  surface but then the forecastle got frightened that if it was the  small cable which we had got hold of we should certainly break it  by continuing the tremendous and increasing strain  so at last mr  liddell decided to stop cut the big cable buoying its end go  back to our pleasant wateringplace at chia take more water and  start lifting the small cable  the end of the large one has even  now regained its sandy bed and three buoys  one to grapnel foul  of the supposed small cable two to the big cable  are dipping  about on the surface  one more  a flagbuoy  will soon follow  and then straight for shore  june 20  it is an illwind c  i have an unexpected opportunity of  forwarding this engineering letter for the craft which brought out  our italian sailors must return to cagliari tonight as the little  cable will take us nearly to galita and the italian skipper could  hardly find his way from thence  today  sunday  not much rest   mr liddell is at spartivento telegraphing  we are at chia and  shall shortly go to help our boats crew in getting the small cable  on board  we dropped them some time since in order that they might  dig it out of the sand as far as possible  june 21  yesterday  sunday as it was  all hands were kept at work all  day coaling watering and making a futile attempt to pull the  cable from the shore on board through the sand  this attempt was  rather silly after the experience we had gained at cape  spartivento  this morning we grappled hooked the cable at once  and have made an excellent start  though i have called this the  small cable it is much larger than the bona one  here comes a  break down and a bad one  june 22  we got over it however but it is a warning to me that my future  difficulties will arise from parts wearing out  yesterday the  cable was often a lovely sight coming out of the water one large  incrustation of delicate netlike corals and long white curling  shells  no portion of the dirty black wires was visible instead  we had a garland of soft pink with little scarlet sprays and white  enamel intermixed  all was fragile however and could hardly be  secured in safety and inexorable iron crushed the tender leaves to  atoms  this morning at the end of my watch about 4 oclock we  came to the buoys proving our anticipations right concerning the  crossing of the cables  i went to bed for four hours and on  getting up found a sad mess  a tangle of the sixwire cable hung  to the grapnel which had been left buoyed and the small cable had  parted and is lost for the present  our hauling of the other day  must have done the mischief  june 23  we contrived to get the two ends of the large cable and to pick  the short end up  the long end leading us seaward was next put  round the drum and a mile of it picked up but then fearing  another tangle the end was cut and buoyed and we returned to  grapple for the threewire cable  all this is very tiresome for  me  the buoying and dredging are managed entirely by w who has  had much experience in this sort of thing so i have not enough to  do and get very homesick  at noon the wind freshened and the sea  rose so high that we had to run for land and are once more this  evening anchored at chia  june 24  the whole day spent in dredging without success  this operation  consists in allowing the ship to drift slowly across the line where  you expect the cable to be while at the end of a long rope fast  either to the bow or stern a grapnel drags along the ground  this  grapnel is a small anchor made like four pothooks tied back to  back  when the rope gets taut the ship is stopped and the grapnel  hauled up to the surface in the hopes of finding the cable on its  prongs  i am much discontented with myself for idly lounging  about and reading westward ho for the second time instead of  taking to electricity or picking up nautical information  i am  uncommonly idle  the sea is not quite so rough but the weather is  squally and the rain comes in frequent gusts  june 25  today about 1 oclock we hooked the threewire cable buoyed the  long sea end and picked up the short or shore end  now it is  dark and we must wait for morning before lifting the buoy we  lowered today and proceeding seawards  the depth of water here  is about 600 feet the height of a respectable english hill our  fishing line was about a quarter of a mile long  it blows pretty  fresh and there is a great deal of sea  26th  this morning it came on to blow so heavily that it was impossible  to take up our buoy  the elba recommenced rolling in true baltic  style and towards noon we ran for land  27th sunday  this morning was a beautiful calm  we reached the buoys at about  430 and commenced picking up at 630  shortly a new cause of  anxiety arose  kinks came up in great quantities about thirty in  the hour  to have a true conception of a kink you must see one   it is a loop drawn tight all the wires get twisted and the gutta percha inside pushed out  these much diminish the value of the  cable as they must all be cut out the guttapercha made good and  the cable spliced  they arise from the cable having been badly  laid down so that it forms folds and tails at the bottom of the  sea  these kinks have another disadvantage  they weaken the cable  very much  at about six oclock pm we had some twelve miles  lifted when i went to the bows the kinks were exceedingly tight  and were giving way in a most alarming manner  i got a cage rigged  up to prevent the end if it broke from hurting anyone and sat  down on the bowsprit thinking i should describe kinks to annie  suddenly i saw a great many coils and kinks altogether at the  surface  i jumped to the guttapercha pipe by blowing through  which the signal is given to stop the engine  i blow but the  engine does not stop again  no answer  the coils and kinks jam  in the bows and i rush aft shouting stop  too late  the cable had  parted and must lie in peace at the bottom  someone had pulled the  guttapercha tube across a bare part of the steam pipe and melted  it  it had been used hundreds of times in the last few days and  gave no symptoms of failing  i believe the cable must have gone at  any rate however since it went in my watch and since i might have  secured the tubing more strongly i feel rather sad     june 28  since i could not go to annie i took down shakespeare and by the  time i had finished antony and cleopatra read the second half of  troilus and got some way in coriolanus i felt it was childish to  regret the accident had happened in my watch and moreover i felt  myself not much to blame in the tubing matter  it had been torn  down it had not fallen down so i went to bed and slept without  fretting and woke this morning in the same good mood  for which  thank you and our friend shakespeare  i am happy to say mr  liddell said the loss of the cable did not much matter though this  would have been no consolation had i felt myself to blame  this  morning we have grappled for and found another length of small  cable which mr  dropped in 100 fathoms of water  if this also  gets full of kinks we shall probably have to cut it after 10 miles  or so or more probably still it will part of its own free will or  weight  10 pm  this second length of threewire cable soon got into the  same condition as its fellow  ie came up twenty kinks an hour   and after seven miles were in parted on the pulley over the bows  at one of the said kinks during my watch again but this time no  earthly power could have saved it  i had taken all manner of  precautions to prevent the end doing any damage when the smash  came for come i knew it must  we now return to the sixwire  cable  as i sat watching the cable tonight large phosphorescent  globes kept rolling from it and fading in the black water  29th  today we returned to the buoy we had left at the end of the six wire cable and after much trouble from a series of tangles got a  fair start at noon  you will easily believe a tangle of iron rope  inch and a half diameter is not easy to unravel especially with a  ton or so hanging to the ends  it is now eight oclock and we have  about six and a half miles safe  it becomes very exciting  however for the kinks are coming fast and furious  july 2  twentyeight miles safe in the hold  the ship is now so deep  that the men are to be turned out of their aft hold and the  remainder coiled there so the good elbas nose need not burrow too  far into the waves  there can only be about 10 or 12 miles more  but these weigh 80 or 100 tons  july 5  our first mate was much hurt in securing a buoy on the evening of  the 2nd  as interpreter with the italians i am useful in all  these cases but for no fortune would i be a doctor to witness  these scenes continually  pain is a terrible thing  our work is  done  the whole of the sixwire cable has been recovered only a  small part of the threewire but that wire was bad and owing to  its twisted state the value small  we may therefore be said to  have been very successful   ii   i have given this cruise nearly in full  from the notes unhappily  imperfect of two others i will take only specimens for in all  there are features of similarity and it is possible to have too  much even of submarine telegraphy and the romance of engineering   and first from the cruise of 1859 in the greek islands and to  alexandria take a few traits incidents and pictures  may 10 1859  we had a fair wind and we did very well seeing a little bit of  cerig or cythera and lots of turtledoves wandering about over the  sea and perching tired and timid in the rigging of our little  craft  then falconera antimilo and milo topped with huge white  clouds barren deserted rising bold and mysterious from the blue  chafing sea  argentiera siphano scapho paros antiparos and  late at night syra itself  adam bede in one hand a sketchbook in  the other lying on rugs under an awning i enjoyed a very pleasant  day  may 14  syra is semieastern  the pavement huge shapeless blocks sloping  to a central gutter from this bare twostoried houses sometimes  plaster many coloured sometimes roughhewn marble rise dirty and  illfinished to straight plain flat roofs shops guiltless of  windows with signs in greek letters dogs greeks in blue baggy  zouave breeches and a fez a few narghilehs and a sprinkling of the  ordinary continental shopboys  in the evening i tried one more  walk in syra with a but in vain endeavoured to amuse myself or to  spend money the first effort resulting in singing doodah to a  passing greek or two the second in spending no in making a  spend threepence on coffee for three  may 16  on coming on deck i found we were at anchor in canea bay and saw  one of the most lovely sights man could witness  far on either  hand stretch bold mountain capes spada and maleka tender in  colour bold in outline rich sunny levels lie beneath them framed  by the azure sea  right in front a dark brown fortress girdles  white mosques and minarets  rich and green our mountain capes  here join to form a setting for the town in whose dark walls   still darker  open a dozen higharched caves in which the huge  venetian galleys used to lie in wait  high above all higher and  higher yet up into the firmament range after range of blue and  snowcapped mountains  i was bewildered and amazed having heard  nothing of this great beauty  the town when entered is quite  eastern  the streets are formed of open stalls under the first  story in which squat tailors cooks sherbet vendors and the like  busy at their work or smoking narghilehs  cloths stretched from  house to house keep out the sun  mules rattle through the crowd  curs yelp between your legs negroes are as hideous and bright  clothed as usual grave turks with long chibouques continue to  march solemnly without breaking them a little arab in one dirty  rag pokes fun at two splendid little turks with brilliant fezzes  wiry mountaineers in dirty full white kilts shouldering long  guns and one hand on their pistols stalk untamed past a dozen  turkish soldiers who look sheepish and brutal in worn cloth jacket  and cotton trousers  a headless wingless lion of st mark still  stands upon a gate and has left the mark of his strong clutch  of  ancient times when crete was crete not a trace remains save  perhaps in the full wellcut nostril and firm tread of that  mountaineer and i suspect that even his sires were albanians mere  outer barbarians  may 17  i spent the day at the little station where the cable was landed  which has apparently been first a venetian monastery and then a  turkish mosque  at any rate the big dome is very cool and the  little ones hold our electric batteries capitally  a handsome  young bashibazouk guards it and a still handsomer mountaineer is  the servant so i draw them and the monastery and the hill till  im black in the face with heat and come on board to hear the canea  cable is still bad  may 23  we arrived in the morning at the east end of candia and had a  glorious scramble over the mountains which seem built of adamant   time has worn away the softer portions of the rock only leaving  sharp jagged edges of steel  sea eagles soaring above our heads  old tanks ruins and desolation at our feet  the ancient arsinoe  stood here a few blocks of marble with the cross attest the  presence of venetian christians but now  the desolation of  desolations  mr liddell and i separated from the rest and when  we had found a sure bay for the cable had a tremendous lively  scramble back to the boat  these are the bits of our life which i  enjoy which have some poetry some grandeur in them  may 29   yesterday we ran round to the new harbour of alexandria landed  the shore end of the cable close to cleopatras bath and made a  very satisfactory start about one in the afternoon  we had  scarcely gone 200 yards when i noticed that the cable ceased to run  out and i wondered why the ship had stopped  people ran aft to  tell me not to put such a strain on the cable i answered  indignantly that there was no strain and suddenly it broke on  every one in the ship at once that we were aground  here was a  nice mess  a violent scirocco blew from the land making ones  skin feel as if it belonged to some one else and didnt fit making  the horizon dim and yellow with fine sand oppressing every sense  and raising the thermometer 20 degrees in an hour but making calm  water round us which enabled the ship to lie for the time in  safety  the wind might change at any moment since the scirocco  was only accidental and at the first wave from seaward bump would  go the poor ship and there would might be an end of our voyage   the captain without waiting to sound began to make an effort to  put the ship over what was supposed to be a sandbank but by the  time soundings were made this was found to be impossible and he  had only been jamming the poor elba faster on a rock  now every  effort was made to get her astern an anchor taken out a rope  brought to a winch i had for the cable and the engines backed but  all in vain  a small turkish government steamer which is to be  our consort came to our assistance but of course very slowly and  much time was occupied before we could get a hawser to her  i  could do no good after having made a chart of the soundings round  the ship and went at last on to the bridge to sketch the scene   but at that moment the strain from the winch and a jerk from the  turkish steamer got off the boat after we had been some hours  aground  the carpenter reported that she had made only two inches  of water in one compartment the cable was still uninjured astern  and our spirits rose when will you believe it after going a  short distance astern the pilot ran us once more fast aground on  what seemed to me nearly the same spot  the very same scene was  gone through as on the first occasion and dark came on whilst the  wind shifted and we were still aground  dinner was served up but  poor mr liddell could eat very little and bump bump grind  grind went the ship fifteen or sixteen times as we sat at dinner   the slight sea however did enable us to bump off  this morning  we appear not to have suffered in any way but a sea is rolling in  which a few hours ago would have settled the poor old elba  june   the alexandria cable has again failed after paying out twothirds  of the distance successfully an unlucky touch in deep water  snapped the line  luckily the accident occurred in mr liddells  watch  though personally it may not really concern me the  accident weighs like a personal misfortune  still i am glad i was  present  a failure is probably more instructive than a success  and this experience may enable us to avoid misfortune in still  greater undertakings  june   we left syra the morning after our arrival on saturday the 4th   this we did first because we were in a hurry to do something and  second because coming from alexandria we had four days  quarantine to perform  we were all mustered along the side while  the doctor counted us the letters were popped into a little tin  box and taken away to be smoked the guardians put on board to see  that we held no communication with the shore  without them we  should still have had four more days quarantine and with twelve  greek sailors besides we started merrily enough picking up the  canea cable    to our utter dismay the yarn covering began to  come up quite decayed and the cable which when laid should have  borne half a ton was now in danger of snapping with a tenth part  of that strain  we went as slow as possible in fear of a break at  every instant  my watch was from eight to twelve in the morning  and during that time we had barely secured three miles of cable   once it broke inside the ship but i seized hold of it in time   the weight being hardly anything  and the line for the nonce was  saved  regular nooses were then planted inboard with men to draw  them taut should the cable break inboard  a who should have  relieved me was unwell so i had to continue my lookout and  about one oclock the line again parted but was again caught in  the last noose with about four inches to spare  five minutes  afterwards it again parted and was yet once more caught  mr  liddell whom i had called could stand this no longer so we  buoyed the line and ran into a bay in siphano waiting for calm  weather though i was by no means of opinion that the slight sea  and wind had been the cause of our failures  all next day  monday we lay off siphano amusing ourselves on shore with  fowling pieces and navy revolvers  i need not say we killed  nothing and luckily we did not wound any of ourselves  a  guardiano accompanied us his functions being limited to preventing  actual contact with the natives for they might come as near and  talk as much as they pleased  these isles of greece are sad  interesting places  they are not really barren all over but they  are quite destitute of verdure and tufts of thyme wild mastic or  mint though they sound well are not nearly so pretty as grass   many little churches glittering white dot the islands most of  them i believe abandoned during the whole year with the exception  of one day sacred to their patron saint  the villages are mean  but the inhabitants do not look wretched and the men are good  sailors  there is something in this greek race yet they will  become a powerful levantine nation in the course of time  what a  lovely moonlight evening that was the barren island cutting the  clear sky with fantastic outline marble cliffs on either hand  fairly gleaming over the calm sea  next day the wind still  continuing i proposed a boating excursion and decoyed a l and  s into accompanying me  we took the little gig and sailed away  merrily enough round a point to a beautiful white bay flanked with  two glistening little churches fronted by beautiful distant  islands when suddenly to my horror i discovered the elba  steaming full speed out from the island  of course we steered  after her but the wind that instant ceased and we were left in a  dead calm  there was nothing for it but to unship the mast get  out the oars and pull  the ship was nearly certain to stop at the  buoy and i wanted to learn how to take an oar so here was a  chance with a vengeance  l steered and we three pulled  a  broiling pull it was about half way across to palikandro  still we  did come in pulling an uncommon good stroke and i had learned to  hang on my oar  l had pressed me to let him take my place but  though i was very tired at the end of the first quarter of an hour  and then every successive half hour i would not give in  i nearly  paid dear for my obstinacy however for in the evening i had  alternate fits of shivering and burning   iii   the next extracts and i am sorry to say the last are from  fleemings letters of 1860 when he was back at bona and  spartivento and for the first time at the head of an expedition   unhappily these letters are not only the last but the series is  quite imperfect and this is the more to be lamented as he had now  begun to use a pen more skilfully and in the following notes there  is at times a touch of real distinction in the manner  cagliari  october 5 1860  all tuesday i spent examining what was on board the elba and  trying to start the repairs of the spartivento land line which has  been entirely neglected and no wonder for no one has been paid  for three months no not even the poor guards who have to keep  themselves their horses and their families on their pay   wednesday morning i started for spartivento and got there in time  to try a good many experiments  spartivento looks more wild and  savage than ever but is not without a strange deadly beauty  the  hills covered with bushes of a metallic green with coppery patches  of soil in between the valleys filled with dry salt mud and a  little stagnant water where that very morning the deer had drunk  where herons curlews and other fowl abound and where alas  malaria is breeding with this rain no fear for those who do not  sleep on shore  a little iron hut had been placed there since  1858 but the windows had been carried off the door broken down  the roof pierced all over  in it we sat to make experiments and  how it recalled birkenhead  there was thomson there was my  testing board the strings of guttapercha harry p even  battering with the batteries but where was my darling annie   whilst i sat feet in sand with harry alone inside the hut mats  coats and wood to darken the window  the others visited the  murderous old friar who is of the order of scaloppi and for whom  i brought a letter from his superior ordering him to pay us  attention but he was away from home gone to cagliari in a boat  with the produce of the farm belonging to his convent  then they  visited the tower of chia but could not get in because the door is  thirty feet off the ground so they came back and pitched a  magnificent tent which i brought from the bahiana a long time ago   and where they will live if i mistake not in preference to the  friars or the owl and bathaunted tower  mm t and s will be  left there  t an intelligent hardworking frenchman with whom  i am well pleased he can speak english and italian well and has  been two years at genoa  s is a french german with a face like an  ancient gaul who has been sergeantmajor in the french line and  who is i see a great big muscular faineant  we left the tent  pitched and some stores in charge of a guide and ran back to  cagliari  certainly being at the head of things is pleasanter than being  subordinate  we all agree very well and i have made the testing  office into a kind of private room where i can come and write to  you undisturbed surrounded by my dear bright brass things which  all of them remind me of our nights at birkenhead  then i can work  here too and try lots of experiments you know how i like that  and now and then i read  shakespeare principally  thank you so  much for making me bring him  i think i must get a pocket edition  of hamlet and henry the fifth so as never to be without them  cagliari  october 7  the town was full    of redshirted english garibaldini  a  very fine looking set of fellows they are too  the officers  rather raffish but with medals crimean and indian the men a very  sturdy set with many lads of good birth i should say  they still  wait their consort the emperor and will i fear be too late to do  anything  i meant to have called on them but they are all gone  into barracks some way from the town and i have been much too busy  to go far  the view from the ramparts was very strange and beautiful   cagliari rises on a very steep rock at the mouth of a wide plain  circled by large hills and threequarters filled with lagoons it  looks therefore like an old island citadel  large heaps of salt  mark the border between the sea and the lagoons thousands of  flamingoes whiten the centre of the huge shallow marsh hawks hover  and scream among the trees under the high mouldering battlements   a little lower down the band played  men and ladies bowed and  pranced the costumes posed church bells tinkled processions  processed the sun set behind thick clouds capping the hills i  pondered on you and enjoyed it all  decidedly i prefer being master to being man  boats at all hours  stewards flying for marmalade captain enquiring when ship is to  sail clerks to copy my writing the boat to steer when we go out   i have run her nose on several times decidedly i begin to feel  quite a little king  confound the cable though  i shall never be  able to repair it  bona  october 14  we left cagliari at 430 on the 9th and soon got to spartivento   i repeated some of my experiments but found thomson who was to  have been my grand standby would not work on that day in the  wretched little hut  even if the windows and door had been put in  the wind which was very high made the lamp flicker about and blew  it out so i sent on board and got old sails and fairly wrapped  the hut up in them and then we were as snug as could be and i  left the hut in glorious condition with a nice little stove in it   the tent which should have been forthcoming from the cures for the  guards had gone to cagliari but i found another a green  turkish tent in the elba and soon had him up  the square tent  left on the last occasion was standing all right and tight in spite  of wind and rain  we landed provisions two beds plates knives  forks candles cooking utensils and were ready for a start at 6  pm but the wind meanwhile had come on to blow at such a rate  that i thought better of it and we stopped  t and s slept  ashore however to see how they liked it at least they tried to  sleep for s the ancient sergeantmajor had a toothache and t  thought the tent was coming down every minute  next morning they  could only complain of sand and a leaky coffeepot so i leave them  with a good conscience  the little encampment looked quite  picturesque  the green round tent the square white tent and the  hut all wrapped up in sails on a sand hill looking on the sea and  masking those confounded marshes at the back  one would have  thought the cagliaritans were in a conspiracy to frighten the two  poor fellows who i believe will be safe enough if they do not go  into the marshes after nightfall  s brought a little dog to amuse  them such a jolly ugly little cur without a tail but full of  fun he will be better than quinine  the wind drove a barque which had anchored near us for shelter  out to sea  we started however at 2 pm and had a quick  passage but a very rough one getting to bona by daylight on the  11th  such a place as this is for getting anything done  the  health boat went away from us at 730 with w on board and we  heard nothing of them till 930 when w came back with two fat  frenchmen who are to look on on the part of the government  they  are exactly alike  only one has four bands and the other three  round his cap and so i know them  then i sent a boat round to  fort genois fort genova of 1858 where the cable is landed with  all sorts of things and directions whilst i went ashore to see  about coals and a room at the fort  we hunted people in the little  square in their shops and offices but only found them in cafes   one amiable gentleman wasnt up at 930 was out at 10 and as soon  as he came back the servant said he would go to bed and not get up  till 3  he came however to find us at a cafe and said that on  the contrary two days in the week he did not do so  then my two  fat friends must have their breakfast after their something at a  cafe and all the shops shut from 10 to 2 and the post does not  open till 12 and there was a road to fort genois only a bridge  had been carried away c  at last i got off and we rowed round  to fort genois where my men had put up a capital gipsy tent with  sails and there was my big board and thomsons number 5 in great  glory  i soon came to the conclusion there was a break  two of my  faithful cagliaritans slept all night in the little tent to guard  it and my precious instruments and the sea which was rather  rough silenced my frenchmen  next day i went on with my experiments whilst a boat grappled for  the cable a little way from shore and buoyed it where the elba  could get hold  i brought all back to the elba tried my machinery  and was all ready for a start next morning  but the wretched coal  had not come yet government permission from algiers to be got  lighters men baskets and i know not what forms to be got or got  through  and everybody asleep  coals or no coals i was  determined to start next morning and start we did at four in the  morning picked up the buoy with our deck engine popped the cable  across a boat tested the wires to make sure the fault was not  behind us and started picking up at 11 everything worked  admirably and about 2 pm in came the fault  there is no doubt  the cable was broken by coral fishers twice they have had it up to  their own knowledge  many men have been ashore today and have come back tipsy and the  whole ship is in a state of quarrel from top to bottom and they  will gossip just within my hearing  and we have had moreover  three french gentlemen and a french lady to dinner and i had to  act host and try to manage the mixtures to their taste  the good natured little frenchwoman was most amusing when i asked her if  she would have some apple tart  mon dieu with heroic  resignation je veux bien or a little plombodding  mais ce que  vous voudrez monsieur  s s elba somewhere not far from bona  oct 19  yesterday after three previous days of useless grappling was  destined to be very eventful  we began dredging at daybreak and  hooked at once every time in rocks but by capital luck just as we  were deciding it was no use to continue in that place we hooked  the cable  up it came was tested and lo another complete break  a quarter of a mile off  i was amazed at my own tranquillity under  these disappointments but i was not really half so fussy as about  getting a cab  well there was nothing for it but grappling again  and as you may imagine we were getting about six miles from  shore  but the water did not deepen rapidly we seemed to be on  the crest of a kind of submarine mountain in prolongation of cape  de gonde and pretty havoc we must have made with the crags  what  rocks we did hook  no sooner was the grapnel down than the ship  was anchored and then came such a business  ships engines going  deck engine thundering belt slipping fear of breaking ropes   actually breaking grapnels  it was always an hour or more before  we could get the grapnel down again  at last we had to give up the  place though we knew we were close to the cable and go further to  sea in much deeper water to my great fear as i knew the cable was  much eaten away and would stand but little strain  well we hooked  the cable first dredge this time and pulled it slowly and gently  to the top with much trepidation  was it the cable was there any  weight on it was evidently too small  imagine my dismay when the  cable did come up but hanging loosely thus  picture  instead of taut thus  picture  showing certain signs of a break close by  for a moment i felt  provoked as i thought here we are in deep water and the cable  will not stand lifting  i tested at once and by the very first  wire found it had broken towards shore and was good towards sea   this was of course very pleasant but from that time to this  though the wires test very well not a signal has come from  spartivento  i got the cable into a boat and a guttapercha line  from the ship to the boat and we signalled away at a great rate   but no signs of life  the tests however make me pretty sure one  wire at least is good so i determined to lay down cable from where  we were to the shore and go to spartivento to see what had  happened there  i fear my men are ill  the night was lovely  perfectly calm so we lay close to the boat and signals were  continually sent but with no result  this morning i laid the  cable down to fort genois in style and now we are picking up odds  and ends of cable between the different breaks and getting our  buoys on board c  tomorrow i expect to leave for spartivento   iv   and now i am quite at an end of journal keeping diaries and diary  letters being things of youth which fleeming had at length  outgrown  but one or two more fragments from his correspondence  may be taken and first this brief sketch of the laying of the  norderney cable mainly interesting as showing under what defects  of strength and in what extremities of pain this cheerful man must  at times continue to go about his work  i slept on board 29th september having arranged everything to  start by daybreak from where we lay in the roads  but at daybreak  a heavy mist hung over us so that nothing of land or water could be  seen  at midday it lifted suddenly and away we went with perfect  weather but could not find the buoys forde left that evening  i  saw the captain was not strong in navigation and took matters next  day much more into my own hands and before nine oclock found the  buoys the weather had been so fine we had anchored in the open  sea near texel  it took us till the evening to reach the buoys  get the cable on board test the first half speak to lowestoft  make the splice and start  h had not finished his work at  norderney so i was alone on board for reuter  moreover the buoys  to guide us in our course were not placed and the captain had very  vague ideas about keeping his course so i had to do a good deal  and only lay down as i was for two hours in the night  i managed  to run the course perfectly  everything went well and we found  norderney just where we wanted it next afternoon and if the shore  end had been laid could have finished there and then october 1st   but when we got to norderney we found the caroline with shore end  lying apparently aground and could not understand her signals so  we had to anchor suddenly and i went off in a small boat with the  captain to the caroline  it was cold by this time and my arm was  rather stiff and i was tired i hauled myself up on board the  caroline by a rope and found h and two men on board  all the rest  were trying to get the shore end on shore but had failed and  apparently had stuck on shore and the waves were getting up  we  had anchored in the right place and next morning we hoped the shore  end would be laid so we had only to go back  it was of course  still colder and quite night  i went to bed and hoped to sleep  but alas the rheumatism got into the joints and caused me  terrible pain so that i could not sleep  i bore it as long as i  could in order to disturb no one for all were tired but at last i  could bear it no longer and managed to wake the steward and got a  mustard poultice which took the pain from the shoulder but then  the elbow got very bad and i had to call the second steward and  get a second poultice and then it was daylight and i felt very  ill and feverish  the sea was now rather rough  too rough rather  for small boats but luckily a sort of thing called a scoot came  out and we got on board her with some trouble and got on shore  after a good tossing about which made us all seasick  the cable  sent from the caroline was just 60 yards too short and did not  reach the shore so although the caroline did make the splice late  that night we could neither test nor speak  reuter was at  norderney and i had to do the best i could which was not much  and went to bed early i thought i should never sleep again but in  sheer desperation got up in the middle of the night and gulped a  lot of raw whiskey and slept at last  but not long  a mr f  washed my face and hands and dressed me  and we hauled the cable  out of the sea and got it joined to the telegraph station and on  october 3rd telegraphed to lowestoft first and then to london   miss clara volkman a niece of mr reuters sent the first message  to mrs reuter who was waiting varley used miss claras hand as a  kind of key and i sent one of the first messages to odden  i  thought a message addressed to him would not frighten you and that  he would enjoy a message through papas cable  i hope he did   they were all very merry but i had been so lowered by pain that i  could not enjoy myself in spite of the success   v   of the 1869 cruise in the great eastern i give what i am able  only sorry it is no more for the sake of the ship itself already  almost a legend even to the generation that saw it launched  june 17 1869  here are the names of our staff in whom i expect  you to be interested as future great eastern stories may be full  of them  theophilus smith a man of latimer clarks leslie c  hill my prizeman at university college lord sackville cecil  king one of the thomsonian kings laws goes for willoughby smith  who will also be on board varley clark and sir james anderson  make up the sum of all you know anything of  a captain halpin  commands the big ship  there are four smaller vessels  the wm  cory which laid the norderney cable has already gone to st  pierre to lay the shore ends  the hawk and chiltern have gone to  brest to lay shore ends  the hawk and scanderia go with us across  the atlantic and we shall at st pierre be transhipped into one or  the other  june 18  somewhere in london  the shore end is laid as you may  have seen and we are all under pressing orders to march so we  start from london tonight at 510  june 20  off ushant  i am getting quite fond of the big ship   yesterday morning in the quiet sunlight she turned so slowly and  lazily in the great harbour at portland and bye and bye slipped  out past the long pier with so little stir that i could hardly  believe we were really off  no men drunk no women crying no  singing or swearing no confusion or bustle on deck  nobody  apparently aware that they had anything to do  the look of the  thing was that the ship had been spoken to civilly and had kindly  undertaken to do everything that was necessary without any further  interference  i have a nice cabin with plenty of room for my legs  in my berth and have slept two nights like a top  then we have the  ladies cabin set apart as an engineers office and i think this  decidedly the nicest place in the ship  35 ft x 20 ft broad   four tables three great mirrors plenty of air and no heat from  the funnels which spoil the great diningroom  i saw a whole  library of books on the walls when here last and this made me less  anxious to provide light literature but alas today i find that  they are every one bibles or prayerbooks  now one cannot read  many hundred bibles    as for the motion of the ship it is not  very much but twill suffice  thomson shook hands and wished me  well  i do like thomson    tell austin that the great eastern  has six masts and four funnels  when i get back i will make a  little model of her for all the chicks and pay out cotton reels     here we are at 420 at brest  we leave probably tomorrow  morning  july 12  great eastern  here as i write we run our last course  for the buoy at the st pierre shore end  it blows and lightens  and our good ship rolls and buoys are hard to find but we must  soon now finish our work and then this letter will start for home     yesterday we were mournfully groping our way through the wet  grey fog not at all sure where we were with one consort lost and  the other faintly answering the roar of our great whistle through  the mist  as to the ship which was to meet us and pioneer us up  the deep channel we did not know if we should come within twenty  miles of her when suddenly up went the fog out came the sun and  there straight ahead was the wm cory our pioneer and a little  dancing boat the gulnare sending signals of welcome with many coloured flags  since then we have been steaming in a grand  procession but now at 2 am the fog has fallen and the great  roaring whistle calls up the distant answering notes all around us   shall we or shall we not find the buoy  july 13  all yesterday we lay in the damp dripping fog with  whistles all round and guns firing so that we might not bump up  against one another  this little delay has let us get our reports  into tolerable order  we are now at 7 oclock getting the cable  end again with the main cable buoy close to us  a telegram of july 20  i have received your four welcome letters   the americans are charming people   vi   and here to make an end are a few random bits about the cruise to  pernambuco  plymouth june 21 1873  i have been down to the seashore and  smelt the salt sea and like it and i have seen the hooper pointing  her great bow seaward while light smoke rises from her funnels  telling that the fires are being lighted and sorry as i am to be  without you something inside me answers to the call to be off and  doing  lalla rookh  plymouth june 22  we have been a little cruise in  the yacht over to the eddystone lighthouse and my sealegs seem  very well on  strange how alike all these starts are  first on  shore steaming hot days with a smell of bonedust and tar and salt  water then the little puffing panting steamlaunch that bustles  out across a port with green woody sides little yachts sliding  about menofwar trainingships and then a great big black hulk  of a thing with a mass of smaller vessels sticking to it like  parasites and that is ones home being coaled  then comes the  champagne lunch where everyone says all that is polite to everyone  else and then the uncertainty when to start  so far as we know  now we are to start tomorrow morning at daybreak letters that  come later are to be sent to pernambuco by first mail    my  father has sent me the heartiest sort of jack tars cheer  s s hooper  off funchal june 29  here we are off madeira at  seven oclock in the morning  thomson has been sounding with his  special toy ever since halfpast three 1087 fathoms of water  i  have been watching the day break and long jagged islands start  into being out of the dull night  we are still some miles from  land but the sea is calmer than loch eil often was and the big  hooper rests very contentedly after a pleasant voyage and  favourable breezes  i have not been able to do any real work  except the testing of the cable for though not seasick i get a  little giddy when i try to think on board    the ducks have  just had their daily souse and are quacking and gabbling in a  mighty way outside the door of the captains deck cabin where i  write  the cocks are crowing and newlaid eggs are said to be  found in the coops  four mild oxen have been untethered and  allowed to walk along the broad iron decks  a whole drove of sheep  seem quite content while licking big lumps of bay salt  two  exceedingly impertinent goats lead the cook a perfect life of  misery  they steal round the galley and will nibble the carrots or  turnips if his back is turned for one minute and then he throws  something at them and misses them and they scuttle off laughing  impudently and flick one ear at him from a safe distance  this is  the most impudent gesture i ever saw  winking is nothing to it   the ear normally hangs down behind the goat turns sideways to her  enemy  by a little knowing cock of the head flicks one ear over  one eye and squints from behind it for half a minute  tosses her  head back skips a pace or two further off and repeats the  manoeuvre  the cook is very fat and cannot run after that goat  much  pernambuco aug 1  we landed here yesterday all well and cable  sound after a good passage    i am on familiar terms with  cocoanuts mangoes and breadfruit trees but i think i like the  negresses best of anything i have seen  in turbans and loose sea green robes with beautiful blackbrown complexions and a stately  carriage they really are a satisfaction to my eye  the weather  has been windy and rainy the hooper has to lie about a mile from  the town in an open roadstead with the whole swell of the  atlantic driving straight on shore  the little steam launch gives  all who go in her a good ducking as she bobs about on the big  rollers and my old gymnastic practice stands me in good stead on  boarding and leaving her  we clamber down a rope ladder hanging  from the high stern and then taking a rope in one hand swing into  the launch at the moment when she can contrive to steam up under us   bobbing about like an apple thrown into a tub all the while  the  president of the province and his suite tried to come off to a  state luncheon on board on sunday but the launch being rather  heavily laden behaved worse than usual and some green seas stove  in the presidents hat and made him wetter than he had probably  ever been in his life so after one or two rollers he turned back  and indeed he was wise to do so for i dont see how he could have  got on board    being fully convinced that the world will not  continue to go round unless i pay it personal attention i must run  away to my work    chapter vi  18691885    edinburgh  colleagues  farrago vitae  i the family circle   fleeming and his sons

fleemings life pleasures  honours fresh interests new friends are not such as will bear to  be told at any length or in the temporal order  and it is now time  to lay narration by and to look at the man he was and the life he  lived more largely  edinburgh which was thenceforth to be his home is a metropolitan  small town where college professors and the lawyers of the  parliament house give the tone and persons of leisure attracted  by educational advantages make up much of the bulk of society   not therefore an unlettered place yet not pedantic edinburgh  will compare favourably with much larger cities  a hard and  disputatious element has been commented on by strangers  it would  not touch fleeming who was himself regarded even in this  metropolis of disputation as a thorny tablemate  to golf  unhappily he did not take and golf is a cardinal virtue in the  city of the winds  nor did he become an archer of the queens  bodyguard which is the chiltern hundreds of the distasted golfer   he did not even frequent the evening club where his colleague tait  in my day was so punctual and so genial  so that in some ways he  stood outside of the lighter and kindlier life of his new home  i  should not like to say that he was generally popular but there as  elsewhere those who knew him well enough to love him loved him  well  and he upon his side liked a place where a dinner party  was not of necessity unintellectual and where men stood up to him  in argument  the presence of his old classmate tait was one of his early  attractions to the chair and now that fleeming is gone again tait  still remains ruling and really teaching his great classes  sir  robert christison was an old friend of his mothers sir alexander  grant kelland and sellar were new acquaintances and highly  valued and these too all but the last have been taken from their  friends and labours  death has been busy in the senatus  i will  speak elsewhere of fleemings demeanour to his students and it  will be enough to add here that his relations with his colleagues  in general were pleasant to himself  edinburgh then with its society its university work its  delightful scenery and its skating in the winter was thenceforth  his base of operations  but he shot meanwhile erratic in many  directions  twice to america as we have seen on telegraph  voyages continually to london on business often to paris year  after year to the highlands to shoot to fish to learn reels and  gaelic to make the acquaintance and fall in love with the  character of highlanders and once to styria to hunt chamois and  dance with peasant maidens  all the while he was pursuing the  course of his electrical studies making fresh inventions taking  up the phonograph filled with theories of graphic representation  reading writing publishing founding sanitary associations  interested in technical education investigating the laws of metre  drawing acting directing private theatricals going a long way to  see an actor  a long way to see a picture in the very bubble of  the tideway of contemporary interests  and all the while he was  busied about his father and mother his wife and in particular his  sons anxiously watching anxiously guiding these and plunging  with his whole fund of youthfulness into their sports and  interests  and all the while he was himself maturing  not in  character or body for these remained young  but in the stocked  mind in the tolerant knowledge of life and man in pious  acceptance of the universe  here is a farrago for a chapter  here  is a world of interests and activities human artistic social  scientific at each of which he sprang with impetuous pleasure on  each of which he squandered energy the arrow drawn to the head  the whole intensity of his spirit bent for the moment on the  momentary purpose  it was this that lent such unusual interest to  his society so that no friend of his can forget that figure of  fleeming coming charged with some new discovery  it is this that  makes his character so difficult to represent  our fathers upon  some difficult theme would invoke the muse i can but appeal to  the imagination of the reader  when i dwell upon some one thing  he must bear in mind it was only one of a score that the  unweariable brain was teeming at the very time with other thoughts  that the good heart had left no kind duty forgotten   i   in edinburgh for a considerable time fleemings family to three  generations was united  mr and mrs austin at hailes captain  and mrs jenkin in the suburb of merchiston fleeming himself in  the city  it is not every family that could risk with safety such  close interdomestic dealings but in this also fleeming was  particularly favoured  even the two extremes mr austin and the  captain drew together  it is pleasant to find that each of the  old gentlemen set a high value on the good looks of the other  doubtless also on his own and a fine picture they made as they  walked the green terrace at hailes conversing by the hour  what  they talked of is still a mystery to those who knew them but mr  austin always declared that on these occasions he learned much  to  both of these families of elders due service was paid of  attention to both fleemings easy circumstances had brought joy  and the eyes of all were on the grandchildren  in fleemings  scheme of duties those of the family stood first a man was first  of all a child nor did he cease to be so but only took on added  obligations when he became in turn a father  the care of his  parents was always a first thought with him and their  gratification his delight  and the care of his sons as it was  always a grave subject of study with him and an affair never  neglected so it brought him a thousand satisfactions  hard work  they are as he once wrote but what fit work  and again  o  its a cold house where a dog is the only representative of a  child  not that dogs were despised we shall drop across the name  of jack the harumscarum irish terrier ere we have done his own  dog plato went up with him daily to his lectures and still like  other friends feels the loss and looks visibly for the  reappearance of his master and martin the cat fleeming has  himself immortalised to the delight of mr swinburne in the  columns of the spectator  indeed there was nothing in which men  take interest in which he took not some and yet always most in  the strong human bonds ancient as the race and woven of delights  and duties  he was even an anxious father perhaps that is the part where  optimism is hardest tested  he was eager for his sons eager for  their health whether of mind or body eager for their education  in that i should have thought too eager  but he kept a pleasant  face upon all things believed in play loved it himself shared  boyishly in theirs and knew how to put a face of entertainment  upon business and a spirit of education into entertainment  if he  was to test the progress of the three boys this advertisement  would appear in their little manuscript paper notice  the  professor of engineering in the university of edinburgh intends at  the close of the scholastic year to hold examinations in the  following subjects  1  for boys in the fourth class of the  academy  geometry and algebra 2  for boys at mr hendersons  school  dictation and recitation 3  for boys taught exclusively  by their mothers  arithmetic and reading  prizes were given but  what prize would be so conciliatory as this boyish little joke  it  may read thin here it would smack racily in the playroom   whenever his sons started a new fad as one of them writes to me  they had only to tell him about it and he was at once interested  and keen to help  he would discourage them in nothing unless it  was hopelessly too hard for them only if there was any principle  of science involved they must understand the principle and  whatever was attempted that was to be done thoroughly  if it was  but play if it was but a puppetshow they were to build he set  them the example of being no sluggard in play  when frewen the  second son embarked on the ambitious design to make an engine for  a toy steamboat fleeming made him begin with a proper drawing   doubtless to the disgust of the young engineer but once that  foundation laid helped in the work with unflagging gusto  tinkering away for hours and assisted at the final trial in  the big bath with no less excitement than the boy  he would take  any amount of trouble to help us writes my correspondent  we  never felt an affair was complete till we had called him to see  and he would come at any time in the middle of any work  there  was indeed one recognised playhour immediately after the despatch  of the days letters and the boys were to be seen waiting on the  stairs until the mail should be ready and the fun could begin  but  at no other time did this busy man suffer his work to interfere  with that first duty to his children and there is a pleasant tale  of the inventive master frewen engaged at the time upon a toy  crane bringing to the study where his father sat at work a half wound reel that formed some part of his design and observing  papa you might finiss windin this for me i am so very busy to day  i put together here a few brief extracts from fleemings letters  none very important in itself but all together building up a  pleasant picture of the father with his sons  jan 15th 1875  frewen contemplates suspending soap bubbles by  silk threads for experimental purposes  i dont think he will  manage that  bernard the youngest volunteered to blow the  bubbles with enthusiasm  jan 17th  i am learning a great deal of electrostatics in  consequence of the perpetual crossexamination to which i am  subjected  i long for you on many grounds but one is that i may  not be obliged to deliver a running lecture on abstract points of  science subject to cross examination by two acute students   bernie does not crossexamine much but if anyone gets discomfited  he laughs a sort of little silverwhistle giggle which is trying  to the unhappy blunderer  may 9th  frewen is deep in parachutes  i beg him not to drop  from the top landing in one of his own making  june 6th 1876  frewens crank axle is a failure just at present   but he bears up  june 14th  the boys enjoy their riding  it gets them whole  funds of adventures  one of their caps falling off is matter for  delightful reminiscences and when a horse breaks his step the  occurrence becomes a rear a shy or a plunge as they talk it over   austin with quiet confidence speaks of the greater pleasure in  riding a spirited horse even if he does give a little trouble  it  is the stolid brute that he dislikes  nb you can still see six  inches between him and the saddle when his pony trots  i listen  and sympathise and throw out no hint that their achievements are  not really great  june 18th  bernard is much impressed by the fact that i can be  useful to frewen about the steamboat  which the latter  irrepressible inventor was making  he says quite with awe he  would not have got on nearly so well if you had not helped him  june 27th  i do not see what i could do without austin  he  talks so pleasantly and is so truly good all through  june 27th  my chief difficulty with austin is to get him  measured for a pair of trousers  hitherto i have failed but i  keep a stout heart and mean to succeed  frewen the observer in  describing the paces of two horses says polly takes twentyseven  steps to get round the school  i couldnt count sophy but she  takes more than a hundred  feb 18th 1877  we all feel very lonely without you  frewen  had to come up and sit in my room for company last night and i  actually kissed him a thing that has not occurred for years   jack poor fellow bears it as well as he can and has taken the  opportunity of having a fester on his foot so he is lame and has  it bathed and this occupies his thoughts a good deal  feb 19th  as to mill austin has not got the list yet  i think  it will prejudice him very much against mill  but that is not my  affair  education of that kind    i would as soon cram my boys  with food and boast of the pounds they had eaten as cram them with  literature  but if fleeming was an anxious father he did not suffer his  anxiety to prevent the boys from any manly or even dangerous  pursuit  whatever it might occur to them to try he would  carefully show them how to do it explain the risks and then  either share the danger himself or if that were not possible  stand aside and wait the event with that unhappy courage of the  lookeron  he was a good swimmer and taught them to swim  he  thoroughly loved all manly exercises and during their holidays  and principally in the highlands helped and encouraged them to  excel in as many as possible  to shoot to fish to walk to pull  an oar to hand reef and steer and to run a steam launch  in all  of these and in all parts of highland life he shared delightedly   he was well onto forty when he took once more to shooting he was  fortythree when he killed his first salmon but no boy could have  more singlemindedly rejoiced in these pursuits  his growing love  for the highland character perhaps also a sense of the difficulty  of the task led him to take up at fortyone the study of gaelic  in which he made some shadow of progress but not much  the  fastnesses of that elusive speech retaining to the last their  independence  at the house of his friend mrs blackburn who plays  the part of a highland lady as to the manner born he learned the  delightful custom of kitchen dances which became the rule at his  own house and brought him into yet nearer contact with his  neighbours  and thus at fortytwo he began to learn the reel a  study to which he brought his usual smiling earnestness and the  steps diagrammatically represented by his own hand are before me  as i write  it was in 1879 that a new feature was added to the highland life   a steam launch called the purgle the styrian corruption of  walpurga after a friend to be hereafter mentioned  the steam  launch goes fleeming wrote  i wish you had been present to  describe two scenes of which she has been the occasion already   one during which the population of ullapool to a baby was  harnessed to her hurrahing  and the other in which the same  population sat with its legs over a little pier watching frewen  and bernie getting up steam for the first time  the purgle was  got with educational intent and it served its purpose so well and  the boys knew their business so practically that when the summer  was at an end fleeming mrs jenkin frewen the engineer bernard  the stoker and kenneth robertson a highland seaman set forth in  her to make the passage south  the first morning they got from  loch broom into gruinard bay where they lunched upon an island  but the wind blowing up in the afternoon with sheets of rain it  was found impossible to beat to sea and very much in the situation  of castaways upon an unknown coast the party landed at the mouth  of gruinard river  a shooting lodge was spied among the trees  there fleeming went and though the master mr murray was from  home though the two jenkin boys were of course as black as  colliers and all the castaways so wetted through that as they  stood in the passage pools formed about their feet and ran before  them into the house yet mrs murray kindly entertained them for  the night  on the morrow however visitors were to arrive there  would be no room and in so outoftheway a spot most probably no  food for the crew of the purgle and on the morrow about noon with  the bay white with spindrift and the wind so strong that one could  scarcely stand against it they got up steam and skulked under the  land as far as sanda bay  here they crept into a seaside cave and  cooked some food but the weather now freshening to a gale it was  plain they must moor the launch where she was and find their way  overland to some place of shelter  even to get their baggage from  on board was no light business for the dingy was blown so far to  leeward every trip that they must carry her back by hand along the  beach  but this once managed and a cart procured in the  neighbourhood they were able to spend the night in a pothouse on  ault bea  next day the sea was unapproachable but the next they  had a pleasant passage to poolewe hugging the cliffs the falling  swell bursting close by them in the gullies and the black scarts  that sat like ornaments on the top of every stack and pinnacle  looking down into the purgle as she passed  the climate of  scotland had not done with them yet  for three days they lay  stormstayed in poolewe and when they put to sea on the morning of  the fourth the sailors prayed them for gods sake not to attempt  the passage  their setting out was indeed merely tentative but  presently they had gone too far to return and found themselves  committed to double rhu reay with a foul wind and a cross sea   from halfpast eleven in the morning until halfpast five at night  they were in immediate and unceasing danger  upon the least  mishap the purgle must either have been swamped by the seas or  bulged upon the cliffs of that rude headland  fleeming and  robertson took turns baling and steering mrs jenkin so violent  was the commotion of the boat held on with both hands frewen by  robertsons direction ran the engine slacking and pressing her to  meet the seas and bernard only twelve years old deadly seasick  and continually thrown against the boiler so that he was found  next day to be covered with burns yet kept an even fire  it was a  very thankful party that sat down that evening to meat in the hotel  at gairloch  and perhaps although the thing was new in the  family no one was much surprised when fleeming said grace over  that meal  thenceforward he continued to observe the form so that  there was kept alive in his house a grateful memory of peril and  deliverance  but there was nothing of the muff in fleeming he  thought it a good thing to escape death but a becoming and a  healthful thing to run the risk of it and what is rarer that  which he thought for himself he thought for his family also  in  spite of the terrors of rhu reay the cruise was persevered in and  brought to an end under happier conditions  one year instead of the highlands alt aussee in the steiermark  was chosen for the holidays and the place the people and the  life delighted fleeming  he worked hard at german which he had  much forgotten since he was a boy and what is highly  characteristic equally hard at the patois in which he learned to  excel  he won a prize at a schutzenfest and though he hunted  chamois without much success brought down more interesting game in  the shape of the styrian peasants and in particular of his gillie  joseph  this joseph was much of a character and his appreciations  of fleeming have a fine note of their own  the bringing up of the  boys he deigned to approve of  fast so gut wie ein bauer was  his trenchant criticism  the attention and courtly respect with  which fleeming surrounded his wife was something of a puzzle to  the philosophic gillie he announced in the village that mrs  jenkin  die silberne frau as the folk had prettily named her from  some silver ornaments  was a geborene grafin who had married  beneath her and when fleeming explained what he called the english  theory though indeed it was quite his own of married relations  joseph admiring but unconvinced avowed it was gar schon   josephs cousin walpurga moser to an orchestra of clarionet and  zither taught the family the country dances the steierisch and  the landler and gained their hearts during the lessons  her  sister loys too who was up at the alp with the cattle came down  to church on sundays made acquaintance with the jenkins and must  have them up to see the sunrise from her house upon the loser  where they had supper and all slept in the loft among the hay  the  mosers were not lost sight of walpurga still corresponds with mrs  jenkin and it was a late pleasure of fleemings to choose and  despatch a wedding present for his little mountain friend  this  visit was brought to an end by a ball in the big inn parlour the  refreshments chosen the list of guests drawn up by joseph the  best music of the place in attendance and hosts and guests in  their best clothes  the ball was opened by mrs jenkin dancing  steierisch with a lordly bauer in gray and silver and with a  plumed hat and fleeming followed with walpurga moser  there ran a principle through all these holiday pleasures  in  styria as in the highlands the same course was followed  fleeming  threw himself as fully as he could into the life and occupations of  the native people studying everywhere their dances and their  language and conforming always with pleasure to their rustic  etiquette  just as the ball at alt aussee was designed for the  taste of joseph the parting feast at attadale was ordered in every  particular to the taste of murdoch the keeper  fleeming was not  one of the common socalled gentlemen who take the tricks of  their own coterie to be eternal principles of taste  he was aware  on the other hand that rustic people dwelling in their own places  follow ancient rules with fastidious precision and are easily  shocked and embarrassed by what if they used the word they would  have to call the vulgarity of visitors from town  and he who was  so cavalier with men of his own class was sedulous to shield the  more tender feelings of the peasant he who could be so trying in  a drawingroom was even punctilious in the cottage  it was in all  respects a happy virtue  it renewed his life during these  holidays in all particulars  it often entertained him with the  discovery of strange survivals as when by the orders of murdoch  mrs jenkin must publicly taste of every dish before it was set  before her guests  and thus to throw himself into a fresh life and  a new school of manners was a grateful exercise of fleemings  mimetic instinct and to the pleasures of the open air of  hardships supported of dexterities improved and displayed and of  plain and elegant society added a spice of drama   ii   fleeming was all his life a lover of the play and all that belonged  to it  dramatic literature he knew fully  he was one of the not  very numerous people who can read a play  a knack the fruit of  much knowledge and some imagination comparable to that of reading  score  few men better understood the artificial principles on  which a play is good or bad few more unaffectedly enjoyed a piece  of any merit of construction  his own play was conceived with a  double design for he had long been filled with his theory of the  true story of griselda used to gird at father chaucer for his  misconception and was perhaps first of all moved by the desire  to do justice to the marquis of saluces and perhaps only in the  second place by the wish to treat a story as he phrased it like  a sum in arithmetic  i do not think he quite succeeded but i must  own myself no fit judge  fleeming and i were teacher and taught as  to the principles disputatious rivals in the practice of dramatic  writing  acting had always ever since rachel and the marseillaise a  particular power on him  if i do not cry at the play he used to  say i want to have my money back  even from a poor play with  poor actors he could draw pleasure  giacomettis elisabetta i  find him writing fetched the house vastly  poor queen elizabeth   and yet it was a little good  and again after a night of  salvini  i do not suppose any one with feelings could sit out  othello if iago and desdemona were acted  salvini was in his  view the greatest actor he had seen  we were all indeed moved and  bettered by the visit of that wonderful man  i declare i feel as  if i could pray cried one of us on the return from hamlet   that is prayer said fleeming  w b hole and i in a fine  enthusiasm of gratitude determined to draw up an address to  salvini did so and carried it to fleeming and i shall never  forget with what coldness he heard and deleted the eloquence of our  draft nor with what spirit our vanities once properly mortified  he threw himself into the business of collecting signatures  it  was his part on the ground of his italian to see and arrange with  the actor it was mine to write in the academy a notice of the  first performance of macbeth  fleeming opened the paper read so  far and flung it on the floor  no he cried that wont do   you were thinking of yourself not of salvini  the criticism was  shrewd as usual but it was unfair through ignorance it was not of  myself that i was thinking but of the difficulties of my trade  which i had not well mastered  another unalloyed dramatic pleasure  which fleeming and i shared the year of the paris exposition was  the marquis de villemer that blameless play performed by  madeleine brohan delaunay worms and broisat  an actress in  such parts at least to whom i have never seen full justice  rendered  he had his fill of weeping on that occasion and when  the piece was at an end in front of a cafe in the mild midnight  air we had our fill of talk about the art of acting  but what gave the stage so strong a hold on fleeming was an  inheritance from norwich from edward barron and from enfield of  the speaker  the theatre was one of edward barrons elegant  hobbies he read plays as became enfields soninlaw with a good  discretion he wrote plays for his family in which eliza barron  used to shine in the chief parts and later in life after the  norwich home was broken up his little granddaughter would sit  behind him in a great armchair and be introduced with his stately  elocution to the world of dramatic literature  from this in a  direct line we can deduce the charades at claygate and after  money came in the edinburgh days that private theatre which took  up so much of fleemings energy and thought  the company  mr and  mrs r o carter of colwall w b hole captain charles douglas  mr kunz mr burnett professor lewis campbell mr charles  baxter and many more  made a charming society for themselves and  gave pleasure to their audience  mr carter in sir toby belch it  would be hard to beat  mr hole in broad farce or as the herald  in the trachiniae showed true stage talent  as for mrs jenkin  it was for her the rest of us existed and were forgiven her powers  were an endless spring of pride and pleasure to her husband he  spent hours hearing and schooling her in private and when it came  to the performance though there was perhaps no one in the audience  more critical none was more moved than fleeming  the rest of us  did not aspire so high  there were always five performances and  weeks of busy rehearsal and whether we came to sit and stifle as  the prompter to be the dumb or rather the inarticulate  recipients of carters dog whip in the taming of the shrew or  having earned our spurs to lose one more illusion in a leading  part we were always sure at least of a long and an exciting  holiday in mirthful company  in this laborious annual diversion fleemings part was large  i  never thought him an actor but he was something of a mimic which  stood him in stead  thus he had seen got in poirier and his own  poirier when he came to play it breathed meritoriously of the  model  the last part i saw him play was triplet and at first i  thought it promised well  but alas the boys went for a holiday  missed a train and were not heard of at home till late at night   poor fleeming the man who never hesitated to give his sons a  chisel or a gun or to send them abroad in a canoe or on a horse  toiled all day at his rehearsal growing hourly paler triplet  growing hourly less meritorious  and though the return of the  children none the worse for their little adventure brought the  colour back into his face it could not restore him to his part  i  remember finding him seated on the stairs in some rare moment of  quiet during the subsequent performances  hullo jenkin said i  you look down in the mouth  my dear boy said he havent  you heard me  i have not one decent intonation from beginning to  end  but indeed he never supposed himself an actor took a part when he  took any merely for convenience as one takes a hand at whist and  found his true service and pleasure in the more congenial business  of the manager  augier racine shakespeare aristophanes in  hookham freres translation sophocles and aeschylus in lewis  campbells such were some of the authors whom he introduced to his  public  in putting these upon the stage he found a thousand  exercises for his ingenuity and taste a thousand problems arising  which he delighted to study a thousand opportunities to make these  infinitesimal improvements which are so much in art and for the  artist  our first greek play had been costumed by the professional  costumer with unforgetable results of comicality and indecorum   the second the trachiniae of sophocles he took in hand himself  and a delightful task he made of it  his study was then in  antiquarian books where he found confusion and on statues and  basreliefs where he at last found clearness after an hour or so  at the british museum he was able to master the chiton sleeves  and all and before the time was ripe he had a theory of greek  tailoring at his fingers ends and had all the costumes made under  his eye as a greek tailor would have made them  the greeks made  the best plays and the best statues and were the best architects   of course they were the best tailors too said he and was never  weary when he could find a tolerant listener of dwelling on the  simplicity the economy the elegance both of means and effect  which made their system so delightful  but there is another side to the stagemanagers employment  the  discipline of acting is detestable the failures and triumphs of  that business appeal too directly to the vanity and even in the  course of a careful amateur performance such as ours much of the  smaller side of man will be displayed  fleeming among conflicting  vanities and levities played his part to my admiration  he had  his own view he might be wrong but the performances he would  remind us were after all his and he must decide  he was in this  as in all other things an iron taskmaster sparing not himself nor  others  if you were going to do it at all he would see that it  was done as well as you were able  i have known him to keep two  culprits and one of these his wife repeating the same action and  the same two or three words for a whole weary afternoon  and yet  he gained and retained warm feelings from far the most of those who  fell under his domination and particularly it is pleasant to  remember from the girls  after the slipshod training and the  incomplete accomplishments of a girls school there was something  at first annoying at last exciting and bracing in this high  standard of accomplishment and perseverance   iii   it did not matter why he entered upon any study or employment  whether for amusement like the greek tailoring or the highland  reels whether from a desire to serve the public as with his  sanitary work or in the view of benefiting poorer men as with his  labours for technical education he pitched into it as he would  have said himself with the same headlong zest  i give in the  appendix a letter from colonel fergusson which tells fully the  nature of the sanitary work and of fleemings part and success in  it  it will be enough to say here that it was a scheme of  protection against the blundering of builders and the dishonesty of  plumbers  started with an eye rather to the houses of the rich  fleeming hoped his sanitary associations would soon extend their  sphere of usefulness and improve the dwellings of the poor  in  this hope he was disappointed but in all other ways the scheme  exceedingly prospered associations sprang up and continue to  spring up in many quarters and wherever tried they have been found  of use  here then was a serious employment it has proved highly useful  to mankind and it was begun besides in a mood of bitterness  under the shock of what fleeming would so sensitively feel  the  death of a whole family of children  yet it was gone upon like a  holiday jaunt  i read in colonel fergussons letter that his  schoolmates bantered him when he began to broach his scheme so did  i at first and he took the banter as he always did with enjoyment  until he suddenly posed me with the question  and now do you see  any other jokes to make  well then said he thats all right   i wanted you to have your fun out first now we can be serious   and then with a glowing heat of pleasure he laid his plans before  me revelling in the details revelling in hope  it was as he  wrote about the joy of electrical experiment  what shall i  compare them to  a new song  a greek play  delight attended  the exercise of all his powers delight painted the future  of  these ideal visions some as i have said failed of their  fruition  and the illusion was characteristic  fleeming believed  we had only to make a virtue cheap and easy and then all would  practise it that for an end unquestionably good men would not  grudge a little trouble and a little money though they might  stumble at laborious pains and generous sacrifices  he could not  believe in any resolute badness  i cannot quite say he wrote in  his young manhood that i think there is no sin or misery  this i  can say  i do not remember one single malicious act done to  myself  in fact it is rather awkward when i have to say the lords  prayer  i have nobodys trespasses to forgive  and to the point  i remember one of our discussions  i said it was a dangerous error  not to admit there were bad people he that it was only a  confession of blindness on our part and that we probably called  others bad only so far as we were wrapped in ourselves and lacking  in the transmigratory forces of imagination  i undertook to  describe to him three persons irredeemably bad and whom he should  admit to be so  in the first case he denied my evidence  you  cannot judge a man upon such testimony said he  for the second  he owned it made him sick to hear the tale but then there was no  spark of malice it was mere weakness i had described and he had  never denied nor thought to set a limit to mans weakness  at my  third gentleman he struck his colours  yes said he im  afraid that is a bad man  and then looking at me shrewdly  i  wonder if it isnt a very unfortunate thing for you to have met  him  i showed him radiantly how it was the world we must know  the world as it was not a world expurgated and prettified with  optimistic rainbows  yes yes said he but this badness is  such an easy lazy explanation  wont you be tempted to use it  instead of trying to understand people  in the year 1878 he took a passionate fancy for the phonograph   it was a toy after his heart a toy that touched the skirts of  life art and science a toy prolific of problems and theories   something fell to be done for a university cricket ground bazaar   and the thought struck him mr ewing writes to me to exhibit  edisons phonograph then the very newest scientific marvel  the  instrument itself was not to be purchased  i think no specimen had  then crossed the atlantic  but a copy of the times with an account  of it was at hand and by the help of this we made a phonograph  which to our great joy talked and talked too with the purest  american accent  it was so good that a second instrument was got  ready forthwith  both were shown at the bazaar  one by mrs  jenkin to people willing to pay half a crown for a private view and  the privilege of hearing their own voices while jenkin perfervid  as usual gave halfhourly lectures on the other in an adjoining  room  i as his lieutenant taking turns  the thing was in its  way a little triumph  a few of the visitors were deaf and hugged  the belief that they were the victims of a new kind of fancyfair  swindle  of the others many who came to scoff remained to take  raffle tickets and one of the phonographs was finally disposed of  in this way falling by a happy freak of the ballotbox into the  hands of sir william thomson  the other remained in fleemings  hands and was a source of infinite occupation  once it was sent  to london to bring back on the tinfoil the tones of a lady  distinguished for clear vocalisations at another time sir robert  christison was brought in to contribute his powerful bass and  there scarcely came a visitor about the house but he was made the  subject of experiment  the visitors i am afraid took their parts  lightly  mr hole and i with unscientific laughter commemorating  various shades of scotch accent or proposing to teach the poor  dumb animal to swear  but fleeming and mr ewing when we  butterflies were gone were laboriously ardent  many thoughts that  occupied the later years of my friend were caught from the small  utterance of that toy  thence came his inquiries into the roots of  articulate language and the foundations of literary art his papers  on vowel sounds his papers in the saturday review upon the laws of  verse and many a strange approximation many a just note thrown  out in talk and now forgotten  i pass over dozens of his  interests and dwell on this trifling matter of the phonograph  because it seems to me that it depicts the man  so for fleeming  one thing joined into another the greater with the less  he cared  not where it was he scratched the surface of the ultimate mystery   in the childs toy in the great tragedy in the laws of the  tempest or in the properties of energy or mass  certain that  whatever he touched it was a part of life  and however he touched  it there would flow for his happy constitution interest and  delight  all fables have their morals says thoreau but the  innocent enjoy the story  there is a truth represented for the  imagination in these lines of a noble poem where we are told that  in our highest hours of visionary clearness we can but   see the children sport upon the shore and hear the mighty waters rolling evermore   to this clearness fleeming had attained and although he heard the  voice of the eternal seas and weighed its message he was yet able  until the end of his life to sport upon these shores of death and  mystery with the gaiety and innocence of children   iv   it was as a student that i first knew fleeming as one of that  modest number of young men who sat under his ministrations in a  soulchilling classroom at the top of the university buildings   his presence was against him as a professor  no one least of all  students would have been moved to respect him at first sight   rather short in stature markedly plain boyishly young in manner  cocking his head like a terrier with every mark of the most  engaging vivacity and readiness to be pleased full of words full  of paradox a stranger could scarcely fail to look at him twice a  man thrown with him in a train could scarcely fail to be engaged by  him in talk but a student would never regard him as academical   yet he had that fibre in him that order always existed in his  classroom  i do not remember that he ever addressed me in  language at the least sign of unrest his eye would fall on me and  i was quelled  such a feat is comparatively easy in a small class  but i have misbehaved in smaller classes and under eyes more  olympian than fleeming jenkins  he was simply a man from whose  reproof one shrank in manner the least buckrammed of mankind he  had in serious moments an extreme dignity of goodness  so it was  that he obtained a power over the most insubordinate of students  but a power of which i was myself unconscious  i was inclined to  regard any professor as a joke and fleeming as a particularly good  joke perhaps the broadest in the vast pleasantry of my curriculum   i was not able to follow his lectures i somehow dared not  misconduct myself as was my customary solace and i refrained from  attending  this brought me at the end of the session into a  relation with my contemned professor that completely opened my  eyes  during the year bad student as i was he had shown a  certain leaning to my society i had been to his house he had  asked me to take a humble part in his theatricals i was a master  in the art of extracting a certificate even at the cannons mouth  and i was under no apprehension  but when i approached fleeming i  found myself in another world he would have naught of me  it is  quite useless for you to come to me mr stevenson  there may be  doubtful cases there is no doubt about yours  you have simply not  attended my class  the document was necessary to me for family  considerations and presently i stooped to such pleadings and rose  to such adjurations as made my ears burn to remember  he was  quite unmoved he had no pity for me  you are no fool said he  and you chose your course  i showed him that he had misconceived  his duty that certificates were things of form attendance a  matter of taste  two things he replied had been required for  graduation a certain competency proved in the final trials and a  certain period of genuine training proved by certificate if he did  as i desired not less than if he gave me hints for an examination  he was aiding me to steal a degree  you see mr stevenson these  are the laws and i am here to apply them said he  i could not  say but that this view was tenable though it was new to me i  changed my attack  it was only for my fathers eye that i required  his signature it need never go to the senatus i had already  certificates enough to justify my years attendance  bring them  to me i cannot take your word for that said he  then i will  consider  the next day i came charged with my certificates a  humble assortment  and when he had satisfied himself remember  said he that i can promise nothing but i will try to find a form  of words  he did find one and i am still ashamed when i think of  his shame in giving me that paper  he made no reproach in speech  but his manner was the more eloquent it told me plainly what a  dirty business we were on and i went from his presence with my  certificate indeed in my possession but with no answerable sense  of triumph  that was the bitter beginning of my love for fleeming  i never thought lightly of him afterwards  once and once only after our friendship was truly founded did we  come to a considerable difference  it was by the rules of poor  humanity my fault and his  i had been led to dabble in society  journalism and this coming to his ears he felt it like a disgrace  upon himself  so far he was exactly in the right but he was  scarce happily inspired when he broached the subject at his own  table and before guests who were strangers to me  it was the sort  of error he was always ready to repent but always certain to  repeat and on this occasion he spoke so freely that i soon made an  excuse and left the house with the firm purpose of returning no  more  about a month later i met him at dinner at a common  friends  now said he on the stairs i engage you  like a  lady to dance  for the end of the evening  you have no right to  quarrel with me and not give me a chance  i have often said and  thought that fleeming had no tact he belied the opinion then  i  remember perfectly how so soon as we could get together he began  his attack  you may have grounds of quarrel with me you have  none against mrs jenkin and before i say another word i want you  to promise you will come to her house as usual  an interview thus  begun could have but one ending  if the quarrel were the fault of  both the merit of the reconciliation was entirely fleemings  when our intimacy first began coldly enough accidentally enough  on his part he had still something of the puritan something of  the inhuman narrowness of the good youth  it fell from him slowly  year by year as he continued to ripen and grow milder and  understand more generously the mingled characters of men  in the  early days he once read me a bitter lecture and i remember leaving  his house in a fine spring afternoon with the physical darkness of  despair upon my eyesight  long after he made me a formal  retractation of the sermon and a formal apology for the pain he had  inflicted adding drolly but truly you see at that time i was  so much younger than you  and yet even in those days there was  much to learn from him and above all his fine spirit of piety  bravely and trustfully accepting life and his singular delight in  the heroic  his piety was indeed a thing of chief importance  his views as  they are called upon religious matters varied much and he could  never be induced to think them more or less than views  all dogma  is to me mere form he wrote dogmas are mere blind struggles to  express the inexpressible  i cannot conceive that any single  proposition whatever in religion is true in the scientific sense  and yet all the while i think the religious view of the world is  the most true view  try to separate from the mass of their  statements that which is common to socrates isaiah david st  bernard the jansenists luther mahomet bunyan  yes and george  eliot  of course you do not believe that this something could be  written down in a set of propositions like euclid neither will you  deny that there is something common and this something very  valuable    i shall be sorry if the boys ever give a moments  thought to the question of what community they belong to  i hope  they will belong to the great community  i should observe that as  time went on his conformity to the church in which he was born grew  more complete and his views drew nearer the conventional  the  longer i live my dear louis he wrote but a few months before his  death the more convinced i become of a direct care by god  which  is reasonably impossible  but there it is  and in his last year  he took the communion  but at the time when i fell under his influence he stood more  aloof and this made him the more impressive to a youthful atheist   he had a keen sense of language and its imperial influence on men  language contained all the great and sound metaphysics he was wont  to say and a word once made and generally understood he thought a  real victory of man and reason  but he never dreamed it could be  accurate knowing that words stand symbol for the indefinable  i  came to him once with a problem which had puzzled me out of  measure  what is a cause why out of so many innumerable millions  of conditions all necessary should one be singled out and  ticketed the cause  you do not understand said he  a cause  is the answer to a question  it designates that condition which i  happen to know and you happen not to know  it was thus with  partial exception of the mathematical that he thought of all means  of reasoning  they were in his eyes but means of communication so  to be understood so to be judged and only so far to be credited   the mathematical he made i say exception of  number and measure  he believed in to the extent of their significance but that  significance he was never weary of reminding you was slender to  the verge of nonentity  science was true because it told us  almost nothing  with a few abstractions it could deal and deal  correctly conveying honestly faint truths  apply its means to any  concrete fact of life and this high dialect of the wise became a  childish jargon  thus the atheistic youth was met at every turn by a scepticism more  complete than his own so that the very weapons of the fight were  changed in his grasp to swords of paper  certainly the church is  not right he would argue but certainly not the antichurch  either  men are not such fools as to be wholly in the wrong nor  yet are they so placed as to be ever wholly in the right   somewhere in mid air between the disputants like hovering victory  in some design of a greek battle the truth hangs undiscerned  and  in the meanwhile what matter these uncertainties  right is very  obvious a great consent of the best of mankind a loud voice  within us whether of god or whether by inheritance and in that  case still from god guide and command us in the path of duty  he  saw life very simple he did not love refinements he was a friend  to much conformity in unessentials  for he would argue it is in  this life as it stands about us that we are given our problem the  manners of the day are the colours of our palette they condition  they constrain us and a man must be very sure he is in the right  must in a favourite phrase of his be either very wise or very  vain to break with any general consent in ethics  i remember  taking his advice upon some point of conduct  now he said how  do you suppose christ would have advised you and when i had  answered that he would not have counselled me anything unkind or  cowardly no he said with one of his shrewd strokes at the  weakness of his hearer nor anything amusing  later in life he  made less certain in the field of ethics  the old story of the  knowledge of good and evil is a very true one i find him writing  only he goes on the effect of the original dose is much worn  out leaving adams descendants with the knowledge that there is  such a thing  but uncertain where  his growing sense of this  ambiguity made him less swift to condemn but no less stimulating  in counsel  you grant yourself certain freedoms  very well he  would say i want to see you pay for them some other way  you  positively cannot do this  then there positively must be something  else that you can do and i want to see you find that out and do  it  fleeming would never suffer you to think that you were  living if there were not somewhere in your life some touch of  heroism to do or to endure  this was his rarest quality  far on in middle age when men begin  to lie down with the bestial goddesses comfort and respectability  the strings of his nature still sounded as high a note as a young  mans  he loved the harsh voice of duty like a call to battle  he  loved courage enterprise brave natures a brave word an ugly  virtue everything that lifts us above the table where we eat or  the bed we sleep upon  this with no touch of the motivemonger or  the ascetic  he loved his virtues to be practical his heroes to  be great eaters of beef he loved the jovial heracles loved the  astute odysseus not the robespierres and wesleys  a fine buoyant  sense of life and of mans unequal character ran through all his  thoughts  he could not tolerate the spirit of the pickthank  being what we are he wished us to see others with a generous eye  of admiration not with the smallness of the seeker after faults   if there shone anywhere a virtue no matter how incongruously set  it was upon the virtue we must fix our eyes  i remember having  found much entertainment in voltaires saul and telling him what  seemed to me the drollest touches  he heard me out as usual when  displeased and then opened fire on me with redhot shot  to  belittle a noble story was easy it was not literature it was not  art it was not morality there was no sustenance in such a form of  jesting there was in his favourite phrase no nitrogenous food  in such literature  and then he proceeded to show what a fine  fellow david was and what a hard knot he was in about bathsheba  so that the initial wrong committed honour might well hesitate in  the choice of conduct and what owls those people were who  marvelled because an eastern tyrant had killed uriah instead of  marvelling that he had not killed the prophet also  now if  voltaire had helped me to feel that said he i could have seen  some fun in it  he loved the comedy which shows a hero human and  yet leaves him a hero and the laughter which does not lessen love  it was this taste for what is fine in humankind that ruled his  choice in books  these should all strike a high note whether  brave or tender and smack of the open air  the noble and simple  presentation of things noble and simple that was the nitrogenous  food of which he spoke so much which he sought so eagerly  enjoyed so royally  he wrote to an author the first part of whose  story he had seen with sympathy hoping that it might continue in  the same vein  that this may be so he wrote i long with the  longing of david for the water of bethlehem  but no man need die  for the water a poet can give and all can drink it to the end of  time and their thirst be quenched and the pool never dry  and the  thirst and the water are both blessed  it was in the greeks  particularly that he found this blessed water he loved a fresh  air which he found about the greek things even in translations  he loved their freedom from the mawkish and the rancid  the tale  of david in the bible the odyssey sophocles aeschylus  shakespeare scott old dumas in his chivalrous note dickens  rather than thackeray and the tale of two cities out of dickens   such were some of his preferences  to ariosto and boccaccio he was  always faithful burnt njal was a late favourite and he found at  least a passing entertainment in the arcadia and the grand cyrus   george eliot he outgrew finding her latterly only sawdust in the  mouth but her influence while it lasted was great and must have  gone some way to form his mind  he was easily set on edge  however by didactic writing and held that books should teach no  other lesson but what real life would teach were it as vividly  presented  again it was the thing made that took him the drama  in the book to the book itself to any merit of the making he was  long strangely blind  he would prefer the agamemnon in the prose  of mr buckley ay to keats  but he was his mothers son  learning to the last  he told me one day that literature was not a  trade that it was no craft that the professed author was merely  an amateur with a doorplate  very well said i the first time  you get a proof i will demonstrate that it is as much a trade as  bricklaying and that you do not know it  by the very next post  a proof came  i opened it with fear for he was indeed as the  reader will see by these volumes a formidable amateur always  wrote brightly because he always thought trenchantly and  sometimes wrote brilliantly as the worst of whistlers may  sometimes stumble on a perfect intonation  but it was all for the  best in the interests of his education and i was able over that  proof to give him a quarter of an hour such as fleeming loved both  to give and to receive  his subsequent training passed out of my  hands into those of our common friend w e henley  henley and  i he wrote have fairly good times wigging one another for not  doing better  i wig him because he wont try to write a real play  and he wigs me because i cant try to write english  when i next  saw him he was full of his new acquisitions  and yet i have lost  something too he said regretfully  up to now scott seemed to me  quite perfect he was all i wanted  since i have been learning  this confounded thing i took up one of the novels and a great  deal of it is both careless and clumsy   v   he spoke four languages with freedom not even english with any  marked propriety  what he uttered was not so much well said as  excellently acted  so we may hear every day the inexpressive  language of a poorlywritten drama assume character and colour in  the hands of a good player  no man had more of the vis comica in  private life he played no character on the stage as he could play  himself among his friends  it was one of his special charms now  when the voice is silent and the face still it makes it impossible  to do justice to his power in conversation  he was a delightful  companion to such as can bear bracing weather not to the very  vain not to the owlishly wise who cannot have their dogmas  canvassed not to the painfully refined whose sentiments become  articles of faith  the spirit in which he could write that he was  much revived by having an opportunity of abusing whistler to a  knot of his special admirers is a spirit apt to be misconstrued   he was not a dogmatist even about whistler  the house is full of  pretty things he wrote when on a visit but mrs s taste in  pretty things has one very bad fault  it is not my taste  and  that was the true attitude of his mind but these eternal  differences it was his joy to thresh out and wrangle over by the  hour  it was no wonder if he loved the greeks he was in many ways  a greek himself he should have been a sophist and met socrates he  would have loved socrates and done battle with him staunchly and  manfully owned his defeat and the dialogue arranged by plato  would have shown even in platos gallery  he seemed in talk  aggressive petulant full of a singular energy as vain you would  have said as a peacock until you trod on his toes and then you  saw that he was at least clear of all the sicklier elements of  vanity  soundly rang his laugh at any jest against himself  he  wished to be taken as he took others for what was good in him  without dissimulation of the evil for what was wise in him without  concealment of the childish  he hated a draped virtue and  despised a wit on its own defence  and he drew if i may so  express myself a human and humorous portrait of himself with all  his defects and qualities as he thus enjoyed in talk the robust  sports of the intelligence giving and taking manfully always  without pretence always with paradox always with exuberant  pleasure speaking wisely of what he knew foolishly of what he  knew not a teacher a learner but still combative picking holes  in what was said even to the length of captiousness yet aware of  all that was said rightly jubilant in victory delighted by  defeat  a greek sophist a british schoolboy  among the legends of what was once a very pleasant spot the old  savile club not then divorced from savile row there are many  memories of fleeming  he was not popular at first being known  simply as the man who dines here and goes up to scotland but he  grew at last i think the most generally liked of all the members   to those who truly knew and loved him who had tasted the real  sweetness of his nature fleemings porcupine ways had always been  a matter of keen regret  they introduced him to their own friends  with fear sometimes recalled the step with mortification  it was  not possible to look on with patience while a man so lovable  thwarted love at every step  but the course of time and the  ripening of his nature brought a cure  it was at the savile that  he first remarked a change it soon spread beyond the walls of the  club  presently i find him writing  will you kindly explain what  has happened to me  all my life i have talked a good deal with  the almost unfailing result of making people sick of the sound of  my tongue  it appeared to me that i had various things to say and  i had no malevolent feelings but nevertheless the result was that  expressed above  well lately some change has happened  if i talk  to a person one day they must have me the next  faces light up  when they see me  ah i say come here  come and dine with  me  its the most preposterous thing i ever experienced  it is  curiously pleasant  you have enjoyed it all your life and  therefore cannot conceive how bewildering a burst of it is for the  first time at fortynine  and this late sunshine of popularity  still further softened him  he was a bit of a porcupine to the  last still shedding darts or rather he was to the end a bit of a  schoolboy and must still throw stones but the essential  toleration that underlay his disputatiousness and the kindness  that made of him a tender sicknurse and a generous helper shone  more conspicuously through  a new pleasure had come to him and as  with all sound natures he was bettered by the pleasure  i can best show fleeming in this later stage by quoting from a  vivid and interesting letter of m emile trelats  here admirably  expressed is how he appeared to a friend of another nation whom  he encountered only late in life  m trelat will pardon me if i  correct even before i quote him but what the frenchman supposed  to flow from some particular bitterness against france was only  fleemings usual address  had m trelat been italian italy would  have fared as ill and yet italy was fleemings favourite country   vous savez comment jai connu fleeming jenkin  cetait en mai  1878  nous etions tous deux membres du jury de lexposition  universelle  on navait rien fait qui vaille a la premiere seance  de notre classe qui avait eu lieu le matin  tout le monde avait  parle et reparle pour ne rien dire  cela durait depuis huit  heures il etait midi  je demandai la parole pour une motion  dordre et je proposai que la seance fut levee a la condition que  chaque membre francais emportat a dejeuner un jure etranger   jenkin applaudit  je vous emimene dejeuner lui criaije  je  veux bien    nous partimes en chemin nous vous rencontrions  il vous presente et nous allons dejeuner tous trois aupres du  trocadero  et depuis ce temps nous avons ete de vieux amis  non seulement  nous passions nos journees au jury ou nous etions toujours  ensemble coteacote  mais nos habitudes setaient faites telles  que non contents de dejeuner en face lun de lautre je le  ramenais diner presque tous les jours chez moi  cela dura une  quinzaine  puis il fut rappele en angleterre  mais il revint et  nous fimes encore une bonne etape de vie intellectuelle morale et  philosophique  je crois quil me rendait deja tout ce que  jeprouvais de sympathie et destime et que je ne fus pas pour  rien dans son retour a paris  chose singuliere nous nous etions attaches lun a lautre par les  sousentendus bien plus que par la matiere de nos conversations  a  vrai dire nous etions presque toujours en discussion et il nous  arrivait de nous rire au nez lun et lautre pendant des heures  tant nous nous etonnions reciproquement de la diversite de nos  points de vue  je le trouvais si anglais et il me trouvais si  francais  il etait si franchement revolte de certaines choses  quil voyait chez nous et je comprenais si mal certaines choses  qui se passaient chez vous  rien de plus interessant que ces  contacts qui etaient des contrastes et que ces rencontres didees  qui etaient des choses rien de si attachant que les echappees de  coeur ou desprit auxquelles ces petits conflits donnaient a tout  moment cours  cest dans ces conditions que pendant son sejour a  paris en 1878 je conduisis un peu partout mon nouvel ami  nous  allâmes chez madame edmond adam ou il vit passer beaucoup dhommes  politiques avec lesquels il causa  mais cest chez les ministres  quil fut interesse  le moment etait dailleurs curieux en  france  je me rappelle que lorsque je le presentai au ministre du  commerce il fit cette spirituelle repartie  cest la seconde  fois que je viens en france sous la republique  la premiere fois  cetait en 1848 elle setait coiffee de travers  je suis bien  heureux de saluer aujourdhui votre excellence quand elle a mis  son chapeau droit  une fois je le menai voir couronner la rosiere  de nanterre  il y suivit les ceremonies civiles et religieuses il  y assista au banquet donne par le maire il y vit notre de lesseps  auquel il porta un toast  le soir nous revinmes tard a paris il  faisait chaud nous etions un peu fatigues nous entrâmes dans un  des rares cafes encore ouverts  il devint silencieux  netes vous pas content de votre journee lui disje  o si mais je  reflechis et je me dis que vous etes un peuple gai  tous ces  braves gens etaient gais aujourdhui  cest une vertu la gaiete  et vous lavez en france cette vertu  il me disait cela  melancoliquement et cetait la premiere fois que je lui entendais  faire une louange adressee a la france    mais il ne faut pas  que vous voyiez la une plainte de ma part  je serais un ingrat si  je me plaignais car il me disait souvent  quel bon francais vous  faites  et il maimait a cause de cela quoiquil semblât  nainier pas la france  cetait la un trait de son originalite   il est vrai quil sen tirait en disant que je ne ressemblai pas a  mes compatriotes ce a quoi il ne connaissait rien  tout cela  etait fort curieux car moimeme je laimais quoiquil en eût a  mon pays  en 1879 il amena son fils austin a paris  jattirai celuici  il  dejeunait avec moi deux fois par semaine  je lui montrai ce  quetait lintimite francaise en le tutoyant paternellement  cela  reserra beaucoup nos liens dintimite avec jenkin    je fis  inviter mon ami au congres de lassociation francaise pour  lavancement des sciences qui se tenait a rheims en 1880  il y  vint  jeus le plaisir de lui donner la parole dans la section du  genie civil et militaire que je presidais  ii y fit une tres  interessante communication qui me montrait une fois de plus  loriginalite de ses vaes et la sûrete de sa science  cest a  lissue de ce congres que je passai lui faire visite a rochefort  ou je le trouvai installe en famille et ou je presentai pour la  premiere fois mes hommages a son eminente compagne  je le vis la  sous un jour nouveau et touchant pour moi  madame jenkin quil  entourait si galamment et ses deux jeunes fils donnaient encore  plus de relief a sa personne  jemportai des quelques heures que  je passai a cote de lui dans ce charmant paysage un souvenir emu  jetais alle en angleterre en 1882 sans pouvoir gagner edimbourg   jy retournai en 1883 avec la commission dassainissement de la  ville de paris dont je faisais partie  jenkin me rejoignit  je  le fis entendre par mes collegues car il etait fondateur dune  societe de salubrite  il eut un grand succes parmi nous  mais ce  voyaye me restera toujours en memoire parce que cest la que se  fixa defenitivement notre forte amitie  il minvita un jour a  diner a son club et au moment de me faire asseoir a cote de lui il  me retint et me dit  je voudrais vous demander de maccorder  quelque chose  cest mon sentiment que nos relations ne peuvent  pas se bien continuer si vous ne me donnez pas la permission de  vous tutoyer  voulezvous que nous nous tutoyions  je lui pris  les mains et je lui dis quune pareille proposition venant dun  anglais et dun anglais de sa haute distinction cetait une  victoire dont je serais fier toute ma vie  et nous commencions a  user de cette nouvelle forme dans nos rapports  vous savez avec  quelle finesse il parlait le francais  comme il en connaissait  tous les tours comme il jouait avec ses difficultes et meme avec  ses petites gamineries  je crois quil a ete heureux de pratiquer  avec moi ce tutoiement qui ne sadapte pas a langlais et qui est  si francais  je ne puis vous peindre letendue et la variete de  nos conversations de la soiree  mais ce que je puis vous dire  cest que sous la caresse du tu nos idees se sont elevees  nous  avions toujours beaucoup ri ensemble mais nous navions jamais  laisse des banalites sintroduire dans nos echanges de pensees  ce  soirla notre horizon intellectual sest elargie et nous y avons  pousse des reconnaissances profondes et lointaines  apres avoir  vivement cause a table nous avons longuement cause au salon et  nous nous separions le soir a trafalgar square apres avoir longe  les trotters stationne aux coins des rues et deux fois rebrousse  chemie en nous reconduisant lun lautre  il etait pres dune  heure du matin  mais quelle belle passe dargumentation quels  beaux echanges de sentiments quelles fortes confidences  patriotiques nous avions fournies  jai compris ce soir la que  jenkin ne detestait pas la france et je lui serrai fort les mains  en lembrassant  nous nous quittions aussi amis quon puisse  letre et notre affection setait par lui etendue et comprise dans  un tu francais    chapter vii 18751885    mr jenkins illness  captain jenkin  the golden wedding  death  of uncle john  death of mr and mrs austin  illness and death of  the captain  death of mrs jenkin  effect on fleeming   telpherage  the end  and now i must resume my narrative for that melancholy business  that concludes all human histories  in january of the year 1875  while fleemings sky was still unclouded he was reading smiles   i read my engineers lives steadily he writes but find  biographies depressing  i suspect one reason to be that  misfortunes and trials can be graphically described but happiness  and the causes of happiness either cannot be or are not  a grand  new branch of literature opens to my view  a drama in which people  begin in a poor way and end after getting gradually happier in an  ecstasy of enjoyment  the common novel is not the thing at all   it gives struggle followed by relief  i want each act to close on  a new and triumphant happiness which has been steadily growing all  the while  this is the real antithesis of tragedy where things  get blacker and blacker and end in hopeless woe  smiles has not  grasped my grand idea and only shows a bitter struggle followed by  a little respite before death  some feeble critic might say my new  idea was not true to nature  im sick of this oldfashioned notion  of art  hold a mirror up indeed  lets paint a picture of how  things ought to be and hold that up to nature and perhaps the poor  old woman may repent and mend her ways  the grand idea might be  possible in art not even the ingenuity of nature could so round in  the actual life of any man  and yet it might almost seem to fancy  that she had read the letter and taken the hint for to fleeming  the cruelties of fate were strangely blended with tenderness and  when death came it came harshly to others to him not unkindly  in the autumn of that same year 1875 fleemings father and mother  were walking in the garden of their house at merchiston when the  latter fell to the ground  it was thought at the time to be a  stumble it was in all likelihood a premonitory stroke of palsy   from that day there fell upon her an abiding panic fear that  glib superficial part of us that speaks and reasons could allege  no cause science itself could find no mark of danger a sons  solicitude was laid at rest but the eyes of the body saw the  approach of a blow and the consciousness of the body trembled at  its coming  it came in a moment the brilliant spirited old lady  leapt from her bed raving  for about six months this stage of  her disease continued with many painful and many pathetic  circumstances her husband who tended her her son who was  unwearied in his visits looked for no change in her condition but  the change that comes to all  poor mother i find fleeming  writing i cannot get the tones of her voice out of my head   i  may have to bear this pain for a long time and so i am bearing it  and sparing myself whatever pain seems useless  mercifully i do  sleep i am so weary that i must sleep  and again later  i  could do very well if my mind did not revert to my poor mothers  state whenever i stop attending to matters immediately before me   and the next day  i can never feel a moments pleasure without  having my mothers suffering recalled by the very feeling of  happiness  a pretty young face recalls hers by contrast  a  careworn face recalls it by association  i tell you for i can  speak to no one else but do not suppose that i wilfully let my  mind dwell on sorrow  in the summer of the next year the frenzy left her it left her  stone deaf and almost entirely aphasic but with some remains of  her old sense and courage  stoutly she set to work with  dictionaries to recover her lost tongues and had already made  notable progress when a third stroke scattered her acquisitions   thenceforth for nearly ten years stroke followed upon stroke  each still further jumbling the threads of her intelligence but by  degrees so gradual and with such partiality of loss and of  survival that her precise state was always and to the end a matter  of dispute  she still remembered her friends she still loved to  learn news of them upon the slate she still read and marked the  list of the subscription library she still took an interest in the  choice of a play for the theatricals and could remember and find  parallel passages but alongside of these surviving powers were  lapses as remarkable she misbehaved like a child and a servant  had to sit with her at table  to see her so sitting speaking with  the tones of a deaf mute not always to the purpose and to remember  what she had been was a moving appeal to all who knew her  such  was the pathos of these two old people in their affliction that  even the reserve of cities was melted and the neighbours vied in  sympathy and kindness  where so many were more than usually  helpful it is hard to draw distinctions but i am directed and i  delight to mention in particular the good dr joseph bell mr  thomas and mr archibald constable with both their wives the rev  mr belcombe of whose good heart and taste i do not hear for the  first time  the news had come to me by way of the infirmary and  their nextdoor neighbour unwearied in service miss hannah mayne   nor should i omit to mention that john ruffini continued to write  to mrs jenkin till his own death and the clever lady known to the  world as vernon lee until the end  a touching a becoming  attention to what was only the wreck and survival of their  brilliant friend  but he to whom this affliction brought the greatest change was the  captain himself  what was bitter in his lot he bore with unshaken  courage only once in these ten years of trial has mrs fleeming  jenkin seen him weep for the rest of the time his wife  his  commanding officer now become his trying child  was served not  with patience alone but with a lovely happiness of temper  he had  belonged all his life to the ancient formal speechmaking  complimentpresenting school of courtesy the dictates of this code  partook in his eyes of the nature of a duty and he must now be  courteous for two  partly from a happy illusion partly in a  tender fraud he kept his wife before the world as a still active  partner  when he paid a call he would have her write with love  upon a card or if that at the moment was too much he would go  armed with a bouquet and present it in her name  he even wrote  letters for her to copy and sign  an innocent substitution which  may have caused surprise to ruffini or to vernon lee if they ever  received in the hand of mrs jenkin the very obvious reflections  of her husband  he had always adored this wife whom he now tended  and sought to represent in correspondence  it was now if not  before her turn to repay the compliment mind enough was left her  to perceive his unwearied kindness and as her moral qualities  seemed to survive quite unimpaired a childish love and gratitude  were his reward  she would interrupt a conversation to cross the  room and kiss him  if she grew excited as she did too often it  was his habit to come behind her chair and pat her shoulder and  then she would turn round and clasp his hand in hers and look  from him to her visitor with a face of pride and love and it was  at such moments only that the light of humanity revived in her  eyes  it was hard for any stranger it was impossible for any that  loved them to behold these mute scenes to recall the past and  not to weep  but to the captain i think it was all happiness   after these so long years he had found his wife again perhaps  kinder than ever before perhaps now on a more equal footing  certainly to his eyes still beautiful  and the call made on his  intelligence had not been made in vain  the merchants of aux  cayes who had seen him tried in some counterrevolution in 1845  wrote to the consul of his able and decided measures his cool  steady judgment and discernment with admiration and of himself  as a credit and an ornament to h m naval service  it is plain  he must have sunk in all his powers during the years when he was  only a figure and often a dumb figure in his wifes drawingroom  but with this new term of service he brightened visibly  he  showed tact and even invention in managing his wife guiding or  restraining her by the touch holding family worship so arranged  that she could follow and take part in it  he took to the worlds  surprise to reading  voyages biographies blairs sermons even  for her letters sake a work of vernon lees which proved  however more than he was quite prepared for  he shone more in  his remarkable way in society and twice he had a little holiday  to glenmorven where as may be fancied he was the delight of the  highlanders  one of his last pleasures was to arrange his dining room  many and many a room in their wandering and thriftless  existence had he seen his wife furnish with exquisite taste and  perhaps with considerable luxury  now it was his turn to be the  decorator  on the wall he had an engraving of lord rodneys  action showing the prothee his fathers ship if the reader  recollects on either side of this on brackets his fathers sword  and his fathers telescope a gift from admiral buckner who had  used it himself during the engagement higher yet the head of his  grandsons first stag portraits of his son and his sons wife and  a couple of old windsor jugs from mrs buckners  but his simple  trophy was not yet complete a device had to be worked and framed  and hung below the engraving and for this he applied to his  daughterinlaw  i want you to work me something annie  an  anchor at each side  an anchor  stands for an old sailor you  know  stands for hope you know  an anchor at each side and in  the middle thankful  it is not easy on any system of  punctuation to represent the captains speech  yet i hope there  may shine out of these facts even as there shone through his own  troubled utterance some of the charm of that delightful spirit  in 1881 the time of the golden wedding came round for that sad and  pretty household  it fell on a good friday and its celebration  can scarcely be recalled without both smiles and tears  the  drawingroom was filled with presents and beautiful bouquets  these to fleeming and his family the golden bride and bridegroom  displayed with unspeakable pride she so painfully excited that the  guests feared every moment to see her stricken afresh he guiding  and moderating her with his customary tact and understanding and  doing the honours of the day with more than his usual delight   thence they were brought to the diningroom where the captains  idea of a feast awaited them  tea and champagne fruit and toast  and childish little luxuries set forth pellmell and pressed at  random on the guests  and here he must make a speech for himself  and his wife praising their destiny their marriage their son  their daughterinlaw their grandchildren their manifold causes  of gratitude  surely the most innocent speech the old sharp  contemner of his innocence now watching him with eyes of  admiration  then it was time for the guests to depart and they  went away bathed even to the youngest child in tears of  inseparable sorrow and gladness and leaving the golden bride and  bridegroom to their own society and that of the hired nurse  it was a great thing for fleeming to make even thus late the  acquaintance of his father but the harrowing pathos of such scenes  consumed him  in a life of tense intellectual effort a certain  smoothness of emotional tenor were to be desired or we burn the  candle at both ends  dr bell perceived the evil that was being  done he pressed mrs jenkin to restrain her husband from too  frequent visits but here was one of those clearcut indubitable  duties for which fleeming lived and he could not pardon even the  suggestion of neglect  and now after death had so long visibly but still innocuously  hovered above the family it began at last to strike and its blows  fell thick and heavy  the first to go was uncle john jenkin taken  at last from his mexican dwelling and the lost tribes of israel  and nothing in this remarkable old gentlemans life became him  like the leaving of it  his sterling jovial acquiescence in mans  destiny was a delight to fleeming  my visit to stowting has been  a very strange but not at all a painful one he wrote  in case  you ever wish to make a person die as he ought to die in a novel  he said to me i must tell you all about my old uncle  he was to  see a nearer instance before long for this family of jenkin if  they were not very aptly fitted to live had the art of manly  dying  uncle john was but an outsider after all he had dropped  out of hail of his nephews way of life and station in society and  was more like some shrewd old humble friend who should have kept  a lodge yet he led the procession of becoming deaths and began in  the mind of fleeming that train of tender and grateful thought  which was like a preparation for his own  already i find him  writing in the plural of these impending deaths already i find  him in quest of consolation  there is little pain in store for  these wayfarers he wrote and we have hope  more than hope  trust  on may 19 1884 mr austin was taken  he was seventyeight years  of age suffered sharply with all his old firmness and died happy  in the knowledge that he had left his wife well cared for  this  had always been a bosom concern for the barrons were longlived  and he believed that she would long survive him  but their union  had been so full and quiet that mrs austin languished under the  separation  in their last years they would sit all evening in  their own drawingroom hand in hand  two old people who for all  their fundamental differences had yet grown together and become  all the world in each others eyes and hearts and it was felt to  be a kind release when eight months after on january 14 1885  eliza barron followed alfred austin  i wish i could save you from  all pain wrote fleeming six days later to his sorrowing wife i  would if i could  but my way is not gods way and of this be  assured  gods way is best  in the end of the same month captain jenkin caught cold and was  confined to bed  he was so unchanged in spirit that at first there  seemed no ground of fear but his great age began to tell and  presently it was plain he had a summons  the charm of his sailors  cheerfulness and ancient courtesy as he lay dying is not to be  described  there he lay singing his old sea songs watching the  poultry from the window with a childs delight scribbling on the  slate little messages to his wife who lay bedridden in another  room glad to have psalms read aloud to him if they were of a  pious strain  checking with an i dont think we need read that  my dear any that were gloomy or bloody  fleemings wife coming  to the house and asking one of the nurses for news of mrs jenkin  madam i do not know said the nurse for i am really so carried  away by the captain that i can think of nothing else  one of the  last messages scribbled to his wife and sent her with a glass of  the champagne that had been ordered for himself ran in his most  finished vein of childish madrigal  the captain bows to you my  love across the table  when the end was near and it was thought  best that fleeming should no longer go home but sleep at  merchiston he broke his news to the captain with some trepidation  knowing that it carried sentence of death  charming charming   charming arrangement was the captains only commentary  it was  the proper thing for a dying man of captain jenkins school of  manners to make some expression of his spiritual state nor did he  neglect the observance  with his usual abruptness fleeming  said he i suppose you and i feel about all this as two christian  gentlemen should  a last pleasure was secured for him  he had  been waiting with painful interest for news of gordon and khartoum  and by great good fortune a false report reached him that the city  was relieved and the men of sussex his old neighbours had been  the first to enter  he sat up in bed and gave three cheers for the  sussex regiment  the subsequent correction if it came in time  was prudently withheld from the dying man  an hour before midnight  on the fifth of february he passed away  aged eightyfour  word of his death was kept from mrs jenkin and she survived him  no more than nine and forty hours  on the day before her death  she received a letter from her old friend miss bell of manchester  knew the hand kissed the envelope and laid it on her heart so  that she too died upon a pleasure  half an hour after midnight on  the eighth of february she fell asleep  it is supposed in her  seventyeighth year  thus in the space of less than ten months the four seniors of  this family were taken away but taken with such features of  opportunity in time or pleasant courage in the sufferer that grief  was tempered with a kind of admiration  the effect on fleeming was  profound  his pious optimism increased and became touched with  something mystic and filial  the grave is not good the  approaches to it are terrible he had written in the beginning of  his mothers illness  he thought so no more when he had laid  father and mother side by side at stowting  he had always loved  life in the brief time that now remained to him he seemed to be  half in love with death  grief is no duty he wrote to miss  bell it was all too beautiful for grief he said to me but the  emotion call it by what name we please shook him to his depths  his wife thought he would have broken his heart when he must  demolish the captains trophy in the diningroom and he seemed  thenceforth scarcely the same man  these last years were indeed years of an excessive demand upon his  vitality he was not only worn out with sorrow he was worn out by  hope  the singular invention to which he gave the name of  telpherage had of late consumed his time overtaxed his strength  and overheated his imagination  the words in which he first  mentioned his discovery to me  i am simply alnaschar  were not  only descriptive of his state of mind they were in a sense  prophetic since whatever fortune may await his idea in the future  it was not his to see it bring forth fruit  alnaschar he was  indeed beholding about him a world all changed a world filled  with telpherage wires and seeing not only himself and family but  all his friends enriched  it was his pleasure when the company  was floated to endow those whom he liked with stock one at  least never knew that he was a possible rich man until the grave  had closed over his stealthy benefactor  and however fleeming  chafed among material and business difficulties this rainbow  vision never faded and he like his father and his mother may be  said to have died upon a pleasure  but the strain told and he  knew that it was telling  i am becoming a fossil he had written  five years before as a kind of plea for a holiday visit to his  beloved italy  take care  if i am mr fossil you will be mrs  fossil and jack will be jack fossil and all the boys will be  little fossils and then we shall be a collection  there was no  fear more chimerical for fleeming years brought him no repose he  was as packed with energy as fiery in hope as at the first  weariness to which he began to be no stranger distressed it did  not quiet him  he feared for himself not without ground the fate  which had overtaken his mother others shared the fear  in the  changed life now made for his family the elders dead the sons  going from home upon their education even their tried domestic  mrs alice dunns leaving the house after twentytwo years of  service it was not unnatural that he should return to dreams of  italy  he and his wife were to go as he told me on a real  honeymoon tour  he had not been alone with his wife to speak  of he added since the birth of his children  but now he was to  enjoy the society of her to whom he wrote in these last days that  she was his heaven on earth  now he was to revisit italy and  see all the pictures and the buildings and the scenes that he  admired so warmly and lay aside for a time the irritations of his  strenuous activity  nor was this all  a trifling operation was to  restore his former lightness of foot and it was a renovated youth  that was to set forth upon this reënacted honeymoon  the operation was performed it was of a trifling character it  seemed to go well no fear was entertained and his wife was  reading aloud to him as he lay in bed when she perceived him to  wander in his mind  it is doubtful if he ever recovered a sure  grasp upon the things of life and he was still unconscious when he  passed away june the twelfth 1885 in the fiftythird year of his  age  he passed but something in his gallant vitality had  impressed itself upon his friends and still impresses  not from  one or two only but from many i hear the same tale of how the  imagination refuses to accept our loss and instinctively looks for  his reappearing and how memory retains his voice and image like  things of yesterday  others the wellbeloved too die and are  progressively forgotten two years have passed since fleeming was  laid to rest beside his father his mother and his uncle john and  the thought and the look of our friend still haunt us    appendix    note on the contributions of fleeming jenkin to electrical and  engineering science  by sir william thomson frs ll d etc  etc  in the beginning of the year 1859 my former colleague the first  british university professor of engineering lewis gordon at that  time deeply engaged in the then new work of cable making and cable  laying came to glasgow to see apparatus for testing submarine  cables and signalling through them which i had been preparing for  practical use on the first atlantic cable and which had actually  done service upon it during the six weeks of its successful  working between valencia and newfoundland  as soon as he had seen  something of what i had in hand he said to me i would like to  show this to a young man of remarkable ability at present engaged  in our works at birkenhead  fleeming jenkin was accordingly  telegraphed for and appeared next morning in glasgow  he remained  for a week spending the whole day in my classroom and laboratory  and thus pleasantly began our lifelong acquaintance  i was much  struck not only with his brightness and ability but with his  resolution to understand everything spoken of to see if possible  thoroughly through every difficult question and no if about  this to slur over nothing  i soon found that thoroughness of  honesty was as strongly engrained in the scientific as in the moral  side of his character  in the first week of our acquaintance the electric telegraph and  particularly submarine cables and the methods machines and  instruments for laying testing and using them formed naturally  the chief subject of our conversations and discussions as it was  in fact the practical object of jenkins visit to me in glasgow  but not much of the week had passed before i found him remarkably  interested in science generally and full of intelligent eagerness  on many particular questions of dynamics and physics  when he  returned from glasgow to birkenhead a correspondence commenced  between us which was continued without intermission up to the last  days of his life  it commenced with a wellsustained fire of  letters on each side about the physical qualities of submarine  cables and the practical results attainable in the way of rapid  signalling through them  jenkin used excellently the valuable  opportunities for experiment allowed him by newall and his partner  lewis gordon at their birkenhead factory  thus he began definite  scientific investigation of the copper resistance of the conductor  and the insulating resistance and specific inductive capacity of  its guttapercha coating in the factory in various stages of  manufacture and he was the very first to introduce systematically  into practice the grand system of absolute measurement founded in  germany by gauss and weber  the immense value of this step if  only in respect to the electric telegraph is amply appreciated by  all who remember or who have read something of the history of  submarine telegraphy but it can scarcely be known generally how  much it is due to jenkin  looking to the article telegraph electric in the last volume of  the old edition of the encyclopaedia britannica which was  published about the year 1861 we find on record that jenkins  measurements in absolute units of the specific resistance of pure  guttapercha and of the guttapercha with chattertons compound  constituting the insulation of the red sea cable of 1859 are given  as the only results in the way of absolute measurements of the  electric resistance of an insulating material which had then been  made  these remarks are prefaced in the encyclopaedia article by  the following statement  no telegraphic testing ought in future  to be accepted in any department of telegraphic business which has  not this definite character although it is only within the last  year that convenient instruments for working in absolute measure  have been introduced at all and the whole system of absolute  measure is still almost unknown to practical electricians  a particular result of great importance in respect to testing is  referred to as follows in the encyclopaedia article  the  importance of having results thus stated in absolute measure is  illustrated by the circumstance that the writer has been able at  once to compare them in the manner stated in a preceding  paragraph with his own previous deductions from the testings of  the atlantic cable during its manufacture in 1857 and with webers  measurements of the specific resistance of copper  it has now  become universally adapted  first of all in england twentytwo  years later by germany the country of its birth and by france and  italy and all the other countries of europe and america   practically the whole scientific world  at the electrical congress  in paris in the years 1882 and 1884  an important paper of thirty quarto pages published in the  transactions of the royal society for june 19 1862 under the  title experimental researches on the transmission of electric  signals through submarine cables part i  laws of transmission  through various lengths of one cable by fleeming jenkin esq  communicated by c wheatstone esq frs contains an account  of a large part of jenkins experimental work in the birkenhead  factory during the years 1859 and 1860  this paper is called part  i  part ii alas never appeared but something that it would have  included we can see from the following ominous statement which i  find near the end of part i  from this value the  electrostatical capacity per unit of length and the specific  inductive capacity of the dielectric could be determined  these  points will however be more fully treated of in the second part  of this paper  jenkin had in fact made a determination at  birkenhead of the specific inductive capacity of guttapercha or  of the guttapercha and chattertons compound constituting the  insulation of the cable on which he experimented  this was the  very first true measurement of the specific inductive capacity of a  dielectric which had been made after the discovery by faraday of  the existence of the property and his primitive measurement of it  for the three substances glass shellac and sulphur and at the  time when jenkin made his measurements the existence of specific  inductive capacity was either unknown or ignored or denied by  almost all the scientific authorities of the day  the original determination of the microfarad brought out under the  auspices of the british association committee on electrical  standards is due to experimental work by jenkin described in a  paper experiments on capacity constituting no iv of the  appendix to the report presented by the committee to the dundee  meeting of 1867  no other determination so far as i know of this  important element of electric measurement has hitherto been made  and it is no small thing to be proud of in respect to jenkins fame  as a scientific and practical electrician that the microfarad which  we now all use is his  the british association unit of electrical resistance on which was  founded the first practical approximation to absolute measurement  on the system of gauss and weber was largely due to jenkins zeal  as one of the originators and persevering energy as a working  member of the first electrical standards committee  the  experimental work of first making practical standards founded on  the absolute system which led to the unit now known as the british  association ohm was chiefly performed by clerk maxwell and jenkin   the realisation of the great practical benefit which has resulted  from the experimental and scientific work of the committee is  certainly in a large measure due to jenkins zeal and perseverance  as secretary and as editor of the volume of collected reports of  the work of the committee which extended over eight years from  1861 till 1869  the volume of reports included jenkins cantor  lectures of january 1866 on submarine telegraphy through which  the practical applications of the scientific principles for which  he had worked so devotedly for eight years became part of general  knowledge in the engineering profession  jenkins scientific activity continued without abatement to the  end  for the last two years of his life he was much occupied with  a new mode of electric locomotion a very remarkable invention of  his own to which he gave the name of telpherage  he persevered  with endless ingenuity in carrying out the numerous and difficult  mechanical arrangements essential to the project up to the very  last days of his work in life  he had completed almost every  detail of the realisation of the system which was recently opened  for practical working at glynde in sussex four months after his  death  his book on magnetism and electricity published as one of  longmans elementary series in 1873 marked a new departure in the  exposition of electricity as the first textbook containing a  systematic application of the quantitative methods inaugurated by  the british association committee on electrical standards  in 1883  the seventh edition was published after there had already appeared  two foreign editions one in italian and the other in german  his papers on purely engineering subjects though not numerous are  interesting and valuable  amongst these may be mentioned the  article bridges written by him for the ninth edition of the  encyclopaedia britannica and afterwards republished as a  separate treatise in 1876 and a paper on the practical  application of reciprocal figures to the calculation of strains in  framework read before the royal society of edinburgh and  published in the transactions of that society in 1869  but  perhaps the most important of all is his paper on the application  of graphic methods to the determination of the efficiency of  machinery read before the royal society of edinburgh and  published in the transactions vol xxviii 187678 for which  he was awarded the keith gold medal  this paper was a continuation  of the subject treated in reulauxs mechanism and recognising  the value of that work supplied the elements required to  constitute from reulauxs kinematic system a full machine receiving  energy and doing work    ii    note on the work of fleeming
