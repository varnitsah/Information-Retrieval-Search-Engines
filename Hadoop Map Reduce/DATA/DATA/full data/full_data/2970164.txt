the rim   the first sense of it all to me after the first shock and horror was that of a sudden leap back into life of the violence with which the american civil war broke upon us at the north fiftyfour years ago when i had a consciousness of youth which perhaps equalled in vivacity my present consciousness of age the illusion was complete in its immediate rush everything quite exactly matched in the two cases the tension of the hours after the flag of the union had been fired upon in south carolina living again with a tragic strangeness of recurrence in the interval during which the fate of belgium hung in the scales and the possibilities of that of france looked this country harder in the face one recognised than any possibility even that of the england of the armada even that of the long napoleonic menace could be imagined to have looked her the analogy quickened and deepened with every elapsing hour the drop of the balance under the invasion of belgium reproduced with intensity the agitation of the new england air by mr lincolns call to arms and i went about for a short space as with the queer secret locked in my breast of at least already knowing how such occasions helped and what a big war was going to mean that this was literally a light in the darkness or that it materially helped the prospect to be considered is perhaps more than i can say but it at least added the strangest of savours an inexpressible romantic thrill to the harsh taste of the crisis i found myself literally knowing by experience what immensities what monstrosities what revelations of what immeasurabilities our affair would carry in its bosoma knowledge that flattered me by its hint of immunity from illusion the sudden new tang in the atmosphere the flagrant difference as one noted in the look of everything especially in that of peoples faces the expressions the hushes the clustered groups the detached wanderers and slowpaced public meditators were so many impressions long before received and in which the stretch of more than half a century had still left a sharpness so i took the case in and drew a vague comfort i can scarce say why from recognition so while recognition lasted i found it come home to me that we we of the ancient day had known had tremendously learnt what the awful business is when it is long when it remains for months and months bitter and arid void even of any great honour in consequence of which under the rapid rise of presumptions of difficulty to whatever effect of dismay or of excitement my possession of something like a standard of difficulty and as i might perhaps feel too of success became in its way a private luxury  my point is however that upon this luxury i was allowed after all but ever so scantily to feed i am unable to say when exactly it was that the rich analogy the fine and sharp identity between the faded and the vivid case broke down with the support obscurely derived from them the moment anyhow came soon enough at which experience felt the ground give way and that one swung off into space into history into darkness with every lamp extinguished and every abyss gaping it ceased quite to matter for reassurance that the victory of the north had been so delayed and yet so complete that our struggle had worn upon the world of the time and quite to exasperation as could well be remembered by its length if the present complication should but begin to be as long as it was broad no term of comparison borrowed from the past would so much as begin to fit it i might have found it humiliating in fact however i found it of the most commanding interest whether at certain hours of dire apprehension or at certain others of the finer probability that the biggest like convulsion our generations had known was still but too clearly to be left far behind for exaltations and terrors for effort and result as a general exhibition of the perversity of nations and of the energy of man such at least was the turn the comparison took at a given moment in a remembering mind that had been steeped so far as its restricted contact went but in the northern story i did i confess cling awhile to the fancy that what loomed perhaps for england what already did so much more than loom for crucified belgium what was let loose in a torrent upon indestructible france might correspond more or less with the pressure of the old terrible time as the fighting south had had to know it and with the grim conditions under which she had at last given way for the rest of the matter as i say the difference of aspect produced by the difference of intensity cut short very soon my vision of similitude the intensity swallowed up everything the rate and the scale and the speed the unprecedented engines the vast incalculable connections the immediate presence as it were of france and belgium whom one could hear pant through the summer air in their effort and their alarm these things with the prodigious might of the enemy added made me say dropping into humility in a manner that resembled not a little a drop into still greater depths oh no that surely cant have been a patch on this which conclusion made accordingly for a new experience altogether such as i gratefully embrace here an occasion not to leave unrecorded  it was in the first place after the strangest fashion a sense of the extraordinary way in which the most benign conditions of light and air of sky and sea the most beautiful english summer conceivable mixed themselves with all the violence of action and passion the other so hideous and piteous so heroic and tragic facts and flouted them as with the example of something far superior never were desperate doings so blandly lighted up as by the two unforgettable months that i was to spend so much of in looking over from the old rampart of a little highperched sussex town at the bright blue streak of the channel within a mile or two of us at its nearest point the point to which it had receded after washing our rockbase in its earlier ages and staring at the bright mystery beyond the rim of the farthest opaline reach just on the other side of that finest of horizonlines history was raging at a pitch new under the sun thinly masked by that shameless smile the belgian horror grew the curve of the globe toward these things was of the scantest and yet the hither spaces of the purest the interval representing only charm and calm and ease one grew to feel that the nearer elements those of land and water and sky at their loveliest were making thus day after day a particular prodigious point insisting in their manner on a sense and a wondrous story which it would be the restless watchers fault if he didnt take in not that these were hints or arts against which he was in the least degree proof they penetrated with every hour deeper into the soul and the contemplations i speak of aiding irresistibly worked out an endless volume of references it was all somehow the history of the hour addressing itself to the individual mindor to that in any case of the person at once so appalled and so beguiled of whose response to the whole appeal i attempt this brief account round about him stretched the scene of his fondest frequentation as time had determined the habit but it was as if every reason and every sentiment conducing to the connection had under the shock of events entered into solution with every other so that the only thinkable approach to rest that is to the recovery of an inward order would be in restoring them each or to as many as would serve the purpose some individual dignity and some form  it came indeed largely of itself my main help to the reparatory the reidentifying process came by this very chance that in the splendour of the season there was no mistaking the case or the plea this as you can see better than ever before the elements kept conspiring to say is the rare the sole the exquisite england whose weight now hangs in the balance and your appreciation of whose value much as in the easy years you may have taken it for granted seems exposed to some fresh and strange and strong determinant something that breaks in like a character of high colour in a play nothing could have thrilled me more i recognise than the threat of this irruption or than the dramatic pitch yet a degree of pain attached to the ploughedup state it impliedso that with an elderly dread of a waste of emotion i fear i almost pusillanimously asked myself why a sentiment from so far back recorded as lively should need to become any livelier and in fact should hesitate to beg off from the higher diapason i felt as the quiet dweller in a tenement so often feels when the question of structural improvements is thrust upon him my house of the spirit amid everything about me had become more and more the inhabited adjusted familiar home quite big enough and sound enough for the spirits uses and with any intrinsic inconvenience corrected only since by that principles having cultivated and formed at whatever personal cost since my spirit was essentially a person the right habits and so settled into the right attitude for practical for contented occupation if however such was my vulgar apprehension as i put it the case was taken out of my hands by the fate that so often deals with these accidents and i found myself before long building on additions and upper storys throwing out extensions and protrusions indulging even all recklessly in gables and pinnacles and battlementsthings that had presently transformed the unpretending place into i scarce know what to call it a fortress of the faith a palace of the soul an extravagant bristling flagflying structure which had quite as much to do with the air as with the earth and all this when one came to return upon it in a considering or curious way because to and fro one kept going on the old rampart the town lookout to spend ones aching wonder again and again on the bright skyline that at once held and mocked it just over that line were unutterable things massacre and ravage and anguish all but irresistible assault and cruelty bewilderment and heroism all but overwhelmed from the sense of which one had but to turn ones head to take in something unspeakably different and that yet produced as by some extraordinary paradox a pang almost as sharp  it was of course by the imagination that this latter was quickened to an intensity thus akin to painbut the imagination had doubtless at every turn without exception more to say to ones state of mind and dealt more with the whole unfolding scene than any other contributive force never in all my life probably had i been so glad to have opened betimes an account with this faculty and to be able to feel for the most part something to my credit there so vivid i mean had to be ones prevision of the rate at which drafts on that source would require cashing all of which is a manner of saying that in face of what during those horrible days seemed exactly over the way the old inviolate england as to whom the fact that she was inviolate in every valid sense of the term had become with long acquaintance so common and dull suddenly shone in a light never caught before and which was for the next weeks all the magnificence of august and september to reduce a thousand things to a sort of merciless distinctness it was not so much that they leaped forth these things under the particular recognition as that they multiplied without end and abounded always in some association at least that caught the eye all together overscoring the image as a whole or causing the old accepted synthesis to bristle with accents the image as a whole thus richly made up of themor of the numberless testifying touches to the effect that we were not there on our sea defence as the other the harried countries were behind such bulwarks as they could throw upwas the central fact of consciousness and the one to which every impression and every apprehension more or less promptly related themselves it made of itself the company in which for the time the mind most naturally and yet most importunately lived one walked of course in the shade of the ambiguous contrastambiguous because of the dark question of whether it was the liabilities of belgium and france to say nothing of their awful actualities that made englands state so rare or englands state that showed her tragic sisters for doubly outraged the action of the matter was at least that of ones feeling in ones hand and weighing it there with the last tenderness for fullest value the golden key that unlocked every compartment of the english character  clearly this general mystery or mixture was to be laid open under stress of fortune as never yetthe unprecedentedness was above all what came over us again and again armaments unknown to human experience looming all the while larger and larger but whatever face or succession of faces the genius of the race should most turn up the main mark of them all would be in the difference that taken together couldnt fail to keep them more unlike the peoples off there beyond than any pair even of the most approved of these peoples are unlike each other insularityone had spent no small part of ones past time in mocking or in otherwise fingering the sense out of that word yet here it was in the air wherever one looked and as stuffed with meaning as if nothing had ever worn away from it as if its full force on the contrary amounted to inward congestion what the term essentially signified was in the oddest way a question at once enormous and irrelevant what it might show as signifying what it was in the circumstances actively and most probably going to seemed rather the true consideration indicated with all the weight of the evidence scattered about just the fixed look of england under the august sky what was this but the most vivid exhibition of character conceivable and the face turned up to repeat my expression with a frankness that really left no further inquiry to be made that appearance was of the exempt state the record of the long safe centuries in its happiest form and even if any shade of happiness at such an hour might well seem a sign of profanity or perversity to that there were all sorts of things to say i could at once reflect however wouldnt it be the thing supremely in character that england should look most complacently herself irradiating all her reasons for it at the very crisis of the question of the true toughness in other words the further duration of her identity i might observe as for that matter i repeatedly and unspeakably did while the two months lasted that she was pouring forth this identity as atmosphere and aspect and picture in the very measure and to the very top of her consciousness of how it hung in the balance thus one arrived through the succession of shining days at the finest sense of the casethe interesting truth that her consciously not being as her tragic sisters were in the great particular was virtually just her genius and that the very straightest thing she could do would naturally be not to flinch at the dark hour from any profession of her genius looking myself more askance at the dark hour politically speaking i mean than i after my fashion figured her as doing in her mass i found it of an extreme of quite an endless fascination to trace as many as possible of her felt idiosyncrasies back to her settled seaconfidence and to see this now in turn account for so many other things the smallest as well as the biggest that to give the fewest hints of illustration the mere spread of the great trees the mere gathers in the little blueywhite curtains of the cottage windows the mere curl of the tinted smoke from the old chimneys matching that note became a sort of exquisite evidence  exquisite evidence of a like general class it was true didnt on the other side of the channel prevent the awful liability to the reach of attackits having borne fruit and been corrected or averted again was in fact what half the foreign picture meant but the foreign genius was the other other at almost every point it had always in the past and on the spot one remembered expressed things confessed things with a difference and part of that difference was of course the difference of history the fact of exemption as i have called it the fact that a blest inviolacy was almost exactly what had least flourished france and belgium to refer only to them became dear accordingly in the light i speak of because having suffered and suffered they were suffering yet again while precisely the opposite process worked for the scene directly beneath my eyes england was interesting to put it mildlywhich is but a shy evasion of putting it passionatelybecause she hadnt suffered because there were passages of that sort she had publicly declined and defied at the same time that one wouldnt have the case so simple as to set it down wholly to her luck france and belgium for the past confessed to repeat my term while england so consistently harmonised with all her long unbrokenness thick and rich upon her seemed never to do that nor to need it in order to practise on a certain fine critical not to mention a certain fine prejudiced sensibility it was the season of sensibility now at any rate for just those days and just that poor place of yearning of merely yearning vigil and i may add with all emphasis that never had i had occasion so to learn how far sensibility may go when once well wound up it was saying little to say i did justice easiest at once and promptest to the most advertised proposal of the enemy his rank intention of clapping down the spiked helmet than which no form of headgear by the way had ever struck one as of a more graceless a more telltale platitude upon the priceless genius of france far from new after all was that measure of the final death in him of the saving sense of proportion which only gross dementia can abolish those of my generation who could remember the detected and frustrated purpose of a renewed germanic pounce upon the country which all but bled to death in 1871 had become capable within five years of the most penetrating irony of revival ever recorded were well aware of how in that at once sinister and grotesque connection they had felt notified in time it was the extension of the programme and its still more prodigious publication during the quarter of a century of interval it was the announced application of the extinguisher to the quite other the really so contrasted genius the expression of which surrounded me in the manner i have glanced at it was the extraordinary fact of a declared nonsufferance any longer on germanys part of either of the obnoxious national forms disfiguring her westward horizon and even though by her own allowance they had nothing intellectually or socially in common save that they were objectionable and as an incident crushableit was this i say that gave one furiously to think or rather while one thanked ones stars for the luxury furiously and all but unutterably to feel  the beauty and the interest the now more than ever copious and welcome expression of the aspects nearest me found their value in their being so resistingly just to that very degree of eccentricity with that very density of homegrownness what they were in the same way as the character of the sisterland lately joined in sisterhood showed for exquisite because so ingrained and incorrigible so beautifully all her own and inimitable on other ground if it would have been hard really to give the measure of ones dismay at the awful proposition of a world squeezed together in the huge prussian fist and with the variety and spontaneity of its parts oozing in a steady trickle like the sacred blood of sacrifice between those hideous knuckly fingers so none the less every reason with which our preference for a better condition and a nobler fate could possibly bristle kept battering at my heart kept in fact pushing into it after the fashion of a crowd of the alarmed faithful at the door of a church the effect was literally yes as of the occasion of some great religious service with prostrations and exaltations the light of a thousand candles and the sound of soaring choirsall of which figured ones individual inward state as determined by the menace one could still note at the same time however that this high pitch of private emotion was by itself far from meeting the case as the enemy presented it what i wanted of course to do was to meet it with the last lucidity the fullest support for particular defensive pleas or claimsand this even if what most underlay all such without exception came back to my actual vision that and no more of the general sense of the land the vision was fed and fed to such a tune that in the quest for reasonsthat is for the particulars of ones affection the more detailed the betterthe blades of grass the outlines of leaves the drift of clouds the streaks of mortar between old bricks not to speak of the call of childvoices muffled in the comforting air became as i have noted with a hundred other like touches casually felt extraordinary admonitions and symbols close links of a tangible chain when once the question fairly hung there of the possibility more showily set forth than it had up to then presumed to be of a world without use for the tradition so embodied an order substituting for this by an unmannerly thrust quite another and really it would seem quite a ridiculous a crudely and clumsily improvised story we might all have resembled together a group of children at their nurses knee disconcerted by some tale that it isnt their habit to hear we loved the old tale or at least i did exactly because i knew it which leaves me keen to make the point none the less that my appreciation of the case for worldvariety found the deeply and blessedly familiar perfectly consistent with it this came of what i read into the familiar and of what i did so read of what i kept reading through that uplifted time these remarks were to have attempted a record that has reached its limit sooner than i had hoped  i was not then to the manner born but my apprehension of what it was on the part of others to be so had been confirmed and enriched by the long years and i gave myself up to the general the native image i thus circled around as to the dearest and most precious of all native images that verily became at the crisis an occupation sublime which was not after all so much an earnest study or fond arrangement of the mixed aspects as a positive a fairly sensual bask in their light too kindled and too rich not to pour out by its own force the strength and the copious play of the appearances acting in this collective fashion carried everything before them no dark discrimination no stiff little reserve that one might ever have made stood up in the diffused day for a moment it was in the opposite way the most opposite possible that ones intelligence worked all along the line so that with the warmth of the mere sensation that they were about as good above all when it came to the stress as could well be expected of people there was the acute interest of the successive points at which one recognised why this last the satisfaction of the deepened intelligence turned i may frankly say to a prolonged revelthey being the people about me and every comfort i had ever had of them smiling its individual smile straight at me and conducing to an effect of candour that is beyond any close notation they didnt know how good they were and their candour had a peculiar lovability of unconsciousness one had more imagination at their service in this cause than they had in almost any cause of their own it was wonderful it was beautiful it was inscrutable that they could make one feel this and yet not feel with it that it at all practically diminished them of course if a shade should come on occasion to fall across the picture that shade would perhaps be the question whether the most restless of the faculties mightnt on the whole too much fail them it beautified life i duly remembered it promoted art it inspired faith it crowned conversation but hadnt italways again under stressstill finer applications than these and mightnt it in a word taking the right direction peculiarly conduce to virtue wouldnt it indeed be indispensable to virtue of the highest strain never mind at any rateso my emotion replied with it or without it we seemed to be taking the right direction moreover the next best thing to the imagination people may have if they can is the quantity of it they may set going in others and which imperfectly aware they are just exposed to from such others and must make the best of their advantage becoming simply that it works for the connection all in their favour that of the associated outsider the order of whose feelings for the occasion i have doubtless not given a wholly lucid sketch of cultivated its opportunity week after week at such a rate that technical alien as he was the privilege of the great partaking of shared instincts and ideals of a communion of race and tongue temper and tradition put on before all the blest appearances a splendour to which i hoped that so long as i might yet live my eyes would never grow dim and the great intensity the melting together of the spiritual sources so loosed in a really intoxicating draught was when i shifted my watch from near east to far west and caught the enemy who seemed ubiquitous in the longobserved effort that most fastened on him the insolence of his dream and the depth of his delusion there in the west were those of my own fond fellowship the other the ready and rallying partakers and it was on the treasure of our whole unquenchable association that in the riot of his ignorancethis at least apparently armourproofhe had laid his unholy hands     refugees in chelsea   this is not a report on our so interesting and inspiring chelsea work since november last in aid of the belgians driven thither from their country by a violence of unprovoked invasion and ravage more appalling than has ever before overtaken a peaceful and industrious people it is the simple statement of a neighbour and an observer deeply affected by the most tragic exhibition of national and civil prosperity and felicity suddenly subjected to bewildering outrage that it would have been possible to conceive the case as the generous american communities have shown they well understand has had no analogue in the experience of our modern generations no matter how far back we go it has been recognised in surpassing practical ways as virtually the greatest public horror of our age or of all the preceding and one gratefully feels in presence of so much done in direct mitigation of it that its appeal to the pity and the indignation of the civilised world anticipated and transcended from the first all superfluity of argument we live intothat is we learn to cultivatepossibilities of sympathy and reaches of beneficence very much as the stricken and suffering themselves live into their dreadful history and explore and reveal its extent and this admirable truth it is that unceasingly pleads with the intelligent the fortunate and the exempt not to consent in advance to any dull limitation of the helpful idea the american people have surely a genius of the most eminent kind for withholding any such consent and despising all such limits and there is doubtless no remarked connection in which they have so shown the sympathetic imagination in free and fearless activitythat is in high originalityas under the suggestion of the tragedy of belgium  i have small warrant perhaps to say that atmospheres are communicable but i can testify at least that they are breathable on the spot to whatever effect of depression or of cheer and i should go far i feel were i to attempt to register the full bittersweet taste by our chelsea waterside all these months of the refugee element in our vital medium the sweet as i strain a point perhaps to call it inheres to whatever distinguishability in our hope of having really done something verily done much the bitter ineradicably seasons the consciousness hopes and demonstrations and fond presumptions and all i need go no further none the less than the makeshift provisional gates of crosby hall marvellous monument transplanted a few years since from the bishopsgate quarter of the city to a part of the ancient suburban site of the garden of sir thomas more and now serving with extraordinary beneficence as the most splendid of shelters for the homeless this great private structure though of the grandest civic character dating from the fifteenth century and one of the noblest relics of the past that london could show was held a few years back so to cumber the precious acre or more on which it stood that it was taken to pieces in the candid commercial interest and in order that the site it had so long sanctified should be converted to such uses as would stuff out still further the ideal number of private pockets dismay and disgust were unable to save it the most that could be done was to gather in with tenderness of care its innumerable constituent parts and convey them into safer conditions where a sad defeated piety has been able to reedify them into some semblance of the original majesty strange withal some of the turns of the whirligig of time the priceless structure came down to the sound of lamentation not to say of execration and of the gnashing of teeth and went up again before cold and disbelieving quite despairing eyes in spite of which history appears to have decided once more to cherish it and give a new consecration it is in truth still magnificent it lives again for our gratitude in its noblest particulars and the almost incomparable roof has arched all this winter and spring over a scene probably more interesting and certainly more pathetic than any that have ever drawn down its ancient faroff blessing  the place has formed then the headquarters of the chelsea circle of hospitality to the exiled the broken and the bewildered and if i may speak of having taken home the lesson of their state and the sense of their story it is by meeting them in the finest club conditions conceivable that i have been able to do so hither month after month and day after day the unfortunates have flocked each afternoon and here the comparatively exempt almost ashamed of their exemption in presence of so much woe have made them welcome to every form of succour and reassurance certain afternoons each week have worn the character of the huge comprehensive teaparty a fresh wellwisher discharging the social and financial cost of the fresh occasionwhich has always festally profited in addition by the extraordinary command of musical accomplishment the high standard of execution that is the mark of the belgian people this exhibition of our splendid local resource has rested of course on a multitude of other resources still local but of a more intimate hospitality little by little worked out and applied and into the details of which i may not here pretend to go beyond noting that they have been accountable for the large housed and fed and clothed and generally protected and administered numbers all provided for in chelsea and its outer fringe on which our scheme of sociability at crosby hall itself has up to now been able to draw to have seen this scheme so long in operation has been to find it suggest many reflections all of the most poignant and moving order the foremost of which has perhaps had for its subject that never before can the wanton hand of history have descended upon a group of communities less expectant of public violence from without or less prepared for it and attuned to it  the bewildered and amazed passivity of the flemish civil population the state as of people surprised by sudden ruffians murderers and thieves in the dead of night and hurled out terrified and half clad snatching at the few scant household gods nearest at hand into a darkness mitigated but by flaring incendiary torchesthis has been the experience stamped on our scores and scores of thousands whose testimony to suffering dismay and despoilment silence alone the silence of vain uncontributive wonderment has for the most part been able to express never was such a revelation of a deeply domestic a rootedly domiciled and instinctively and separately clustered people a mass of communities for which the sight of the home violated the objects helping to form it profaned and the cohesive family the belgian ideal of the constituted life dismembered disembowelled and shattered had so supremely to represent the crack of doom and the end of everything there have been days and days when under this particular impression the mere aspect and manner of our serried recipients of relief something vague and inarticulate as in persons who have given up everything but patience and are living from hour to hour but in the immediate and the unexplained has put on such a pathos as to make the heart sick one has had just to translate any seated row of figures thankful for warmth and light and covering for sustenance and human words and human looks into terms that would exemplify some like exiled and huddled and charityfed predicament for our superior selves to feel our exposure to such a fate our submission to it our holding in the least together under it darkly unthinkable dim imaginations would at such moments interpose a confused theory that even at the worst our adventurous habits our imperial traditions our general defiance of the superstition of domesticity would dash from our lips the cup of bitterness from these it was at all events impossible not to come back to the consciousness that almost every creature there collected was indebted to our good offices for the means to come at all i thought of our parents and children our brothers and sisters aligned in borrowed garments and settled to an as yet undetermined future of eleemosynary tea and buns and i ask myself doubtless to little purpose either what grace of resignation or what clamour of protest we should beneath the same star be noted as substituting for the inveterate belgian decency  i can only profess at once that the sense of this last round about one was at certain hours when the music and the chant of consolation rose in the stillness from our improvised stage at the end of the great hall a thing to cloud with tears any pair of eyes lifted to our sublime saved roof in thanks for its vast comprehension questions of exhibited type questions as to a range of form and tradition a measure of sensibility and activity not our own dwindled and died before the gross fact of our having here an example of such a worldtragedy as we supposed europe had outlived and that nothing at all therefore mattered but that we should bravely and handsomely hold up our quite heavy enough end of it it is because we have responded in this degree to the call unprecedented that we are in common with a vast number of organisations scattered through these islands qualified to claim that no small part of the inspiration to our enormous act of welcome resides in the moral interest it yields one can indeed be certain of such a source of profit but in the degree in which one has found oneself personally drawing upon it yet it is obvious that we are not treated every day to the disclosure of a national character a national temperament and type confined for the time to their plainest and stoutest features and set on a prodigious scale in all the relief that the strongest alien air and alien conditions can give them great salience in such a case do all collective idiosyncrasies acquireupon the fullest enumeration of which however as the belgian instance and the british atmosphere combine to represent them i may not now embark prepossessed wholly as i am with the more generally significant social stamp and human aspect so revealed and with the quality derived from these things by the multiplied examples that help us to take them in this feeling that our visitors illustrate above all the close and comfortable household life with every implication of a seated and saturated practice of it practice of the intimate and private and personal the securely sensual and genial arts that flow from it has been by itself the key to a plenitude of observation and in particular to as much friendly searching insight as one could desire to enjoy  the moving the lacerating thing is the fashion after which such a reading of the native elements once adopted has been as a light flaring into every obscurest retreat as well as upon any puzzling ambiguity of the state of shock of the national character under the infamy of the outrage put upon it that they of all people the most given over to local and patriarchal beatitude among the admirable and the cherished objects handed down to them by their so interesting history on every spot where its action has been thickestthat is on every inch so to speak of their teeming territoryshould find themselves identified with the most shamelessly cynical public act of which the civilised world at this hour retains the memory is a fact truly representing the exquisite in the horrible so peculiarly addressed has been their fate to the desecration of ideals that had fairly become breath of their lungs and flesh of their flesh oh the installed and ensconced the immemorially edified and arranged the thoroughly furnished and provided and nourished peoplenot in the least besotted or relaxed in their security and density like the selfsmothered society of the ancient world upon which the earlier huns and vandals poured down but candidly complacent and admirably intelligent in their care for their living tradition and only so off their guard as to have consciously set the example of this care to all such as had once smoked with them their wondrous pipe of peace almost any posture of stupefaction would have been conceivable in the shaken victims of this delusion i can speak best however but of what i have already glanced at that temperamental weight of their fall which has again and again at sight of many of them gathered together made the considering heart as heavy for them as if it too had for the time been worsted  however it would take me far to tell of half the penetrating admonitions whether of the dazed or of the roused appearance that have for so long almost in like degree made our attention ache i think of particular faces in the whole connection when i want most to remembersince to remember always and never never to forget is a prescription shining before us like a possible light of dawnfaces saying such things in their silence or in their speech of quite different matters as to make the only thinkable comment or response some word or some gesture of reprieve to dumb or to dissimulated anguish blest be the power that has given to civilised men the appreciation of the facesuch an immeasurable sphere of exercise for it has this monstrous trial of the peoples come to supply such histories such a record of moral experience of emotion convulsively suppressed as one meets in some of them and this even if on the whole one has been able to think of these special allies all sustainingly much rather as the sturdiest than as the most demonstrative of sufferers i have in these rapid remarks to reduce my many impressions to the fewest but must even thus spare one of them for commemoration of the admirable cast of working countenance we are rewarded by the sight of wherever we turn amid the quantity of helpful service and all the fruitful industries that we have been able to start and that keep themselves going these are the lights in the picture and who indeed would wish that the lights themselves should be anything less than tragic the strong young man no young men are familiarly stronger mutilated amputated dismembered in penalty for their defence of their soil against the horde and now engaged at crosby hall in the

of their people that just to be in their presence is a blest renewal of faith excellent exemplary is this manly homely handy type grave in its somewhat strained attention but at once lighted to the briefest sincerest humour of protest by any direct reference to the general cruelty of its misfortune anything but unsuggestive the range of the quiet physiognomy when one feels the consciousness behind it not to have run thin thick and strong is the good flemish sense of life and all its functionswhich fact is responsible for no empty and really unmodelled mug  i am afraid at the same time that if the various ways of being bad are beyond our reckoning the condition and the action of exemplary goodness tend rather to reduce to a certain rich unity of appearance those marked by them however dissociated from each other such persons may have been by race and education otherwise what tribute shouldnt i be moved to pay to the gentleman of flanders to whom the specially improvised craftsmen i have just mentioned owe their training and their inspiration through his having in his proscribed and denuded state mastered the craft in order to recruit them to it and in fine so far as my observation has been concerned exhibit clear human virtue courage and patience and the humility of sought fellowship in privation with an unconscious beauty that i should be ashamed in this connection not to have noted publicly i scarce know what such a personality as his suggests to me if not that we had all on our good chelsea ground best take up and cherish as directly and ultimately as possible every scrap of our community with our gentleman of flanders i make such a point as this at the same time only to remember how almost wherever i have tried sustainingly to turn my imagination and my intelligence have been quickened and to recognise in particular for that matter that this couldnt possibly be more the case for them than in visiting a certain hostel in one of our comparatively contracted but amply decent local squaresriverside chelsea having of course its own urban identity in the multitudinous county of london which in itself as happy an example doubtless of the hostel smoothly working as one need cite placed me in grateful relation with a lady one of the victims of her countrys convulsion and in charge of the establishment i allude to whom simply to meet as we say is to learn how singular a dignity how clear a distinction may shine in active fortitude and economic selfeffacement under an all but crushing catastrophe talk about faces i could but privately ejaculate as i gathered the sense of all that this one represented in the way of natural nobleness and sweetness a whole past acquaintance with letters and art and taste insisting on their present restrictedness to bare sisterly service  the proud rigour of association with pressing service alone with absolutely nothing else the bare commodious house so otherwise known to me of old and nowlike most of our hostels if i am not mistaken the most unconditioned of loans from its relinquishing ownerthe lingering look of ancient peace in the precincts an element i had already as i passed and repassed at the afternoon hour found somehow not at all dispelled by the presence in the central green garden itself of sundry maimed and hobbling and smiling convalescents from an extemporised small hospital close at hand their battered khaki replaced by a like uniformity of the loose light blue and friendly talk with them through the rails of their enclosure as blest to one participant at least as friendly talk with them always and everywhere is such were the hovering elements of an impression in which the mind had yet mainly to yield to that haunting force on the part of our waiting proscripts which never consents to be long denied the proof of which universally recognised power of their spell amid us is indeed that they have led me so far with a whole side of my plea for them still unspoken this however i hope on another occasion to come back to and i am caught meanwhile by my memory of how the note of this conviction was struck for me with extraordinary force many months ago and in the first flush of recognition of what the fate that had overtaken our earliest tides of arrival and appeal really meantmeant so that all fuller acquaintance since pursued has but piled one congruous reality after another upon the horror  it was in september in a tiny sussex town which i had not quitted since the outbreak of the war and where the advent of our first handful of fugitives before the warning of louvain and aerschoot and termonde and dinant had just been announced our small hilltop city covering the steep sides of the compact pedestal crowned by its great church had reserved a refuge at its highest point and we had waited all day from occasional train to train for the moment at which we should attest our hospitality it came at last but late in the evening when a vague outside rumour called me to my doorstep where the unforgettable impression at once assaulted me up the precipitous little street that led from the station over the old grassgrown cobbles where vehicles rarely pass came the panting procession of the homeless and their comforting their almost clinging entertainers who seemed to hurry them on as in a sort of overflow of expression of the fever of charity it was swift and eager in the autumn darkness and under the flare of a single lampwith no vociferation and but for a womans voice scarce a sound save the shuffle of mounting feet and the thickdrawn breath of emotion the note i except however was that of a young mother carrying her small child and surrounded by those who bore her on and on almost lifting her as they went together the resonance through our immemorial old street of her sobbing and sobbing cry was the voice itself of history it brought home to me more things than i could then quite take the measure of and these just because it expressed for her not direct anguish but the incredibility as who should say of honest assured protection months have elapsed and from having been then one of a few hundred she is now one of scores and scores of thousands yet her cry is still in my ears whether to speak most of what she had lately or of what she actually felt and it plays to my own sense as a great fitful tragic light over the dark exposure of her people     the american volunteer motorambulance corps in france  a letter to the editor of an american journal   sirseveral of us americans in london are so interested in the excellent work of this body lately organised by mr richard norton and now in active operation at the rear of a considerable part of the longest line of battle known to history that i have undertaken to express to you our common conviction that our countrymen at home will share our interest and respond to such particulars as we are by this time able to give the idea of the admirable enterprise was suggested to mr norton when early in the course of the war he saw at the american hospital at neuilly scores of cases of french and british wounded whose lives were lost or who must incur lifelong disability and suffering through the long delay of their removal from the field of battle to help energetically to remedy this dire fact struck him at once as possible and his application of energy was so immediate and effective that in just three weeks after his return to london to take the work in hand he had been joined by a number of his countrymen and of others possessed of cars who had offered them as ambulances already fitted or easily convertible and had not less promptly offered themselves as capable chauffeurs to this promptly gathered equipment the recruiting of which no red tape had hampered and no postponement to committeemeetings had delayed were at once added certain other cars of purchasethese made possible by funds rapidly received from many known and unknown friends in america the fleet so collected amounted to some fifteen cars to the service of the british red cross and that of the st john ambulance it then addressed itself gratefully welcomed and enjoying from that moment the valuable association of colonel a j barry of the british army who was already employed in part on behalf of the red cross i have within a few days had the opportunity to learn from this zealous and accomplished coadjutor as well as from mr norton himself some of the particulars of their comprehensive activity they each having been able to dash over to london for a visit of the briefest duration it has thus been brought home to me how much the success of the good work depends on american generosity both in the personal and the pecuniary wayexercised that is by the contribution of cars to which personal service that of their contributors attaches itself and of course by such gifts of money as shall make the corps more and more worthy of its function and of the american name  its function is primarily that of gathering in the wounded and those disabled by illness though the question is almost always of the former from the postes de secours and the field hospitals the various nearest points to the front bestrewn with patient victims to which a motorcar can workably penetrate and conveying them to the base hospitals and when necessary the railway stations from which they may be further directed upon places of care centres of those possibilities of recovery which the splendid recent extension of surgical and medical science causes more and more to preponderate the great and blessed fact is that conditions of recovery are largely secured by the promptitude and celerity that motortransport offers as compared with railway services at the mercy of constant interruption and arrest in the case of bad and already neglected wounds those aggravated by exposure and delay the long lying on the poisonous field before the blest regimental brancardiers or stretcherbearers waiting for the shelter of night but full also of their own strain of pluck can come and remove them carried mostly by rude arts a mercy much hindered at the best to the shelter often hastily improvised at which first aid becomes possible for them they are there as immediately and tenderly as possible stowed in our waiting or arriving cars each of which receives as large a number as may be consistent with the particular suffering state of the stricken individual some of these are able to sit at whatever cost from the inevitable shake over rough country roads for others the lying posture only is thinkable and the ideal car is the one which may humanely accommodate three men outstretched and four or five seated three outstretched is sometimes a tight fit but when this is impossible the gain in poor blessés assis is the greaterwedged together though broken shoulder or smashed arm may have to be with a like shrinking and shuddering neighbour the moral of these rigours is of course that the more numerous the rescuing vehicles the less inevitable the sore crowding i find it difficult to express to you the sense of practical human pity as well as the image of general helpful energy applied in innumerable chance ways that we get from the report of what the corps has done and holds itself in readiness to do thanks to the admirable spirit of devotion without stint of really passionate work animating its individual members these have been found beneficently and inexhaustibly active it is interesting to be able to note in proportion as they possess the general educated intelligence the cultivated tradition of tact and i may perhaps be allowed to confess that for myself i find a positive added beauty in the fact that the unpaid chauffeur the wise amateur driver and ready lifter helper healer and so far as may be consoler is apt to be a university man and acquainted with other pursuits one gets the sense that the labour with its multiplied incidents and opportunities is just unlimitedly inspiring to the keen spirit or the sympathetic soul the recruit with energies and resources on hand that plead with him for the beauty of the vivid and palpable social result  not the least of the good offices open to our helpers are the odds and ends of aid determined by wayside encounters in a ravaged country where distracted women and children flee from threatened or invaded villages to be taken up to be given the invaluable lift if possible in all the incoherence of their alarm and misery sometimes with the elder men mixed in the tragic procession tragicomic even very nearly when the domestic or household objects they have snatched up in their headlong exodus and are solemnly encumbered with bear the oddest misproportion to the gravity of the case they are hurried in if the car be happily free and carried on to comparative safety but with the admirable cleverness and courage of the frenchwoman of whatever class essentially in evidence in whatever contact never more so for instance than when a rude field hospital has had of a sudden to be knocked together in the poor schoolhouse of a village and the mangled and lacerated brought into it on stretchers or on any rough handcart or trundled barrow that has been impressed into the service have found the villageoises bereft of their men full of the bravest instinctive alertness not wincing at sights of horror fit to try even trained sensibilities handling shattered remnants of humanity with an art as extemporised as the refuge itself and having each precarious charge ready for the expert transfer by the time the car has hurried up emphasised enough by the ceaseless thunder of the front the quality of the french and the british resistance and the pitch of their spirit but one feels what is meant none the less when one hears the variety of heroism and the brightness of devotion in the women over all the region of battle described from observation as unsurpassable do we take too much for granted in imagining that this offered intimacy of appreciation of such finest aspects of the admirable immortal france and of a relation with them almost as illuminating to ourselves as beneficent to them may itself rank as something of an appeal where the seeds of response to her magnificent struggle in the eye of our free longings and liberal impulses already exist  i should mention that a particular great army corps on the arrival of our first cars on the scene appealed to them for all the service they could render and that to this corps they have been as yet uninterruptedly attached on the condition of a reserve of freedom to respond at once to any british invitation to a transfer of activity such an assurance had already been given the commissioner for the british red cross on the part of mr norton and colonel barry with their arrival at boulogne where that body cordially welcomed them and whence in fact on its request a fourstretchercar with its american owner and another of our volunteers in charge proceeded to work for a fortnight night and day along the firing line on the belgian frontier otherwise we have continuously enjoyed in large defined limits up to the present writing an association with one of the most tremendously engaged french armies the length of its line alone were i to state it here in kilometres would give some measure of the prodigious fighting stretch across what is practically the whole breadth of france and it is in relation to a fraction of the former front that we have worked very quickly i may mention we found one of our liveliest opportunities mr norton and colonel barry proceeding together to ascertain what had become of one of the field hospitals known to have served in a small assaulted town a few days before when during a bombardment colonel barry had saved many lives just as our volunteers arrived a fresh bombardment began and though assured by the fleeing inhabitants including the mayor of the place who was perhaps a trifle overresponsibly in advance of them that there were no wounded left behindas in fact proved to be the casewe nevertheless pushed on for full assurance there were then no wounded to bring out but it was our first happy chance of bearing away all the hopeless and helpless women and children we could carry this was a less complicated matter however than that of one of colonel barrys particular reminiscences an occasion when the germans were advancing on a small place that it was clear they would take and when pressing news came to him of 400 wounded in it who were to be got out if humanly possible they were got out and motored awaythough it took the rescuing party thus three days in the face of their difficulties and dangers to effect the blest clearance it may be imagined how precious in such conditions the power of the chauffeurdriven vehicle becomes though indeed i believe the more special moral of this transaction as given was in the happy fact that the squad had blessedly been able to bring and keep with it four doctors whose immediate service on the spot and during transport was the means of saving very many lives the moral of that in turn would seem to be that the very ideal for the general case is the not so inconceivable volunteer who should be an ardent and gallant and not otherwise too much preoccupied young doctor with the possession of a car and the ability to drive it above all the ability to offer it as his crowning attribute perhaps i sketch in such terms a slightly fantastic figure but there is so much of strenuous suggestion which withal manages at the same time to be romantic in the information before me that it simply multiplies for the hopeful mind the possibilities and felicities of equipped goodwill an association of the grimmest reality clings at the same time i am obliged to add to the record of success i have just citedthe very last word of which seems to have been that in one of the houses of the little distracted town were two french sisters of mercy who were in charge of an old bedridden lady and whom with the object of their care every effort was made in vain to remove they absolutely declined all such interference with the fate god had appointed them to meet as nunsif it was his will to make them martyrs the curtain drops upon what became of them but they too illustrate in their way the range of the frenchwomans power to face the situation  still another form of high usefulness comes to our corps i should finally mention in its opportunities for tracing the whereabouts and recovering the identity of the dead the english dead named in those grim lists supplied to them by the military authorities which their intercourse with the people in a given area where fighting has occurred enables them often blessedly to clear up their pervasiveness their ubiquity keeps them in touch with the people witnesses of what happens on the battleswept area when after the storm has moved on certain of the lifeless sweepings are gathered up old villagers searched out and questioned testify and give a clue through which the whereabouts of the committal to thin earth of the last mortality of this that or the other of the obscurely fallen comes as a kind of irony of relief to those waiting in suspense this uncertainty had attached itself for weeks to the fate in particular of many of the men concerned in the already so historic retreat of the allies from monsground still considerably in the hands of the germans but also gradually accessible and where as quickly as it becomes so colonel barry pushes out into it in search of information sternly touching are such notes of general indication information from the curé the village carpenter the gravedigger of the place a man called soandso and a gentleman called something else as to the burial of fortyfive dead english in the public cemetery of such and such a small locality as to the interment somewhere else of an englishman believed to be an officer as to a hundred english surprised in a certain church and killed all but forty and buried as is not always their fortune for their kindred without removal of their discs of identification among such like data we move when not among those of a more immediate violence and all to be in their way scarce less considerately handled mixed with such gleanings one comes upon other matters of testimony of which one hopes equal note is madetestimony as to ferocities perpetrated upon the civil population which i may not here specify every form of assistance and inquiry takes place of course in conditions of some danger thanks to the risk of stray bullets and shells not infrequently met when cars operate as they neither avoid doing nor wastefully seek to do in proximity to the lines the germans moreover are noted as taking the view that the insignia of the red cross with the implication of the precarious freight it covers are in all circumstances a good mark for their shots a view characteristic of their belligerent system at large but not more deterrent for the ministers of the adversary in this connection than in any other when the admirable end is in question  i have doubtless said enough however in illustration of the interest attaching to all this service a service in which not one of the forces of social energy and devotion not one of the true social qualities sympathy ingenuity tact and taste fail to come into play such an exercise of them as all the incidental possibilities are taken advantage of represents for us all who are happily not engaged in the huge destructive work the play not simply of a reparatory or consolatory but a positively productive and creative virtue in which there is a peculiar honour we americans are as little neutrals as possible where any aptitude for any action of whatever kind that affirms life and freshly and inventively exemplifies it instead of overwhelming and undermining it is concerned great is the chance in fact for exhibiting this as our entirely elastic our supremely characteristic social aptitude we cannot do so cheaply indeed any more than the opposite course is found under whatever fatuity of presumption inexpensive and readymade what i therefore invite all those whom this notice may reach to understand as for that matter they easily will is that the expenses of our enlightened enterprise have to be continuously met and that if it has confidence in such support it may go on in all the alert pride and pity that need be desired i am assured that the only criticism the members of the corps make of it is that they wish more of their friends would come and support it either personally or financiallyor best of all of course both at the moment i write i learn this invocation to have been met to the extent of mr nortons having within two or three days annexed five fresh cars with their owners to work themand all as i hear it put with elation excellent university men as an extremely helpful factor on the part of volunteers is some facility in french and the goodwill to stay on for whatever reasonable length of time i assume the excellence of these gentlemen to include those signal merits most members of the staff of thirtyfour in all as the number till lately at least has stood have been glad to pay their own living expenses but it is taken for granted that in cases where individuals are unable to meet that outlay indefinitely the subscribers to the fund will not grudge its undertaking to find any valuable man in food and lodging such charges amount at the outside to 1 dollar 75 per day the expenses of petrol and tyres are paid by the french government or the british red cross so that the contributor of the car is at costs only for the maintenance of his chauffeur if he brings one or for necessary repairs mr eliot norton of 2 rector street new york is our recipient of donations on your side of the sea mr george f read hon treas care of messrs brown shipley  co 123 pall mall sw kindly performs this office in london and i am faithfully yours  henry james  london november 25 1914     france   i think that if there is a general ground in the world on which an appeal might be made in a civilised circle with a sense of its being uttered only to meet at once and beyond the need of insistence a certain supreme recognition and response the idea of what france and the french mean to the educated spirit of man would be the nameable thing it would be the cause uniting us most quickly in an act of glad intelligence uniting us with the least need of any wondering why we should understand and answer together just by the magic of the mention the touch of the two or three words and this in proportion to our feeling ourselves social and communicating creaturesto the point in fact of a sort of shame at any imputation of our not liberally understanding of our waiting in any degree to be nudged or hustled the case of france as one may hold it where the perceptive social mind is concerned and set in motion is thus only to be called exquisiteso far as we dont seem so to qualify things down we certainly all feel in the beautiful connection in two general ways one of these being that the spring pressed with such happy effect lifts the sense by its mere vibration into the lightest and brightest air in which taking our world all round it is given to our finer interest about things to breathe and move and the other being that just having our intelligence our experience at its freest and bravest taken for granted is a compliment to us as not purely instinctive persons which we should miss if it were not paid rather to the degree of finding the omission an insult  such as i say is our easy relation to the sound of a voice raised even however allusively and casually on behalf of that great national and social presence which has always most oppositely most sensibly most obsessively as i surely may put it and above all most dazzlingly neighboured and admonished us here after such a fashion as really to have made the felt breath of its life across an interval constantly narrowing a part of our education as distinguished from our luck our luck in all our past has been enormous the greatest luck on the whole assuredly that any race has ever had but it has never been a conscious reaction or a gathered fruition as one may say it has just been a singular felicity of position and of temperament and this felicity has made us observe and perceive and reflect much less than it has made us directly act and profit and enjoy enjoy of course by attending tremendously to all the business involved in our position so far as we have had reactions therefore they have not sprung when they have been at all intensified from the extraordinary good fortune of our state unless indeed i may put it that what they have very considerably sprung from has been exactly a part of our general prodigythe good fortune itself of our being neighboured by a native genius so different from our own so suggestive of wondrous and attaching comparisons as to keep us chronically aware of the difference and the contrast and yet all the while help us to see into them and through them  we were not to all appearance appointed by fate for the most perceptive and penetrative offices conceivable so that to have over against us and within range a proposition as we nowadays say that could only grow more and more vivid more and more engaging and inspiring in the measure of our growth of criticism and curiosity or in other words of the capacity just to pay attention pay attention otherwise than by either sticking very fast at home or inquiring of the antipodes the antipodes almost exclusivelywhat has that practically been for us but one of the very choicest phases of our luck aforesaid one of the most appraisable of our felicities the very one doubtless that our dissimilarity of temperament and taste would have most contradictiously and most correctively prescribed from the moment we were not to be left simply to stew in our juice if the advantage i so characterise was to be in its own way thoroughly affirmative there was yet nothing about it to do real or injurious violence to that abysmal good nature which sometimes strikes me as our most effective contribution to human history the vision of france at any rate so close and so clear at propitious hours was to grow happily illustrational for us as nothing else in any like relation to us could possibly have become other families have a way on good opportunity of interesting us more than our own and here was this immense acquaintance extraordinarily mattering for us and at the same time not irritating us by a single claim of cousinship or a single liberty taken on any such score any liberties taken were much rather liberties i think of oursalways abounding as we did in quite free and perhaps slightly rough and on the whole rather superficial movement beyond our island circle and toward whatever lay in our path france lay very much in our path our path to almost everything that could beckon us forth from our baseand there were very few things in the world or places on the globe that didnt so beckon us according to which she helped us along on our expansive course a good deal more doubtless than either she or we always knew  all of which you see is but a manner of making my point that her name means more than anything in the world to us but just our own only at present it means ever so much more almost unspeakably more than it has ever done in the past and i cant help inviting you to feel with me for a very few moments what the real force of this association to which we now throb consists of and why it so moves us we enjoy generous emotions because they are generous because generosity is a noble passion and a glow because we spring with it for the time above our common pedestrian paceand this just in proportion as all questions and doubts about it drop to the ground but great reasons never spoil a great sympathy and to see an inspiring object in a strong light never made any such a shade less inspiring so therefore in these days when our great neighbour and ally is before us in a beauty that is tragic tragic because menaced and overdarkened the closest possible appreciation of what it is that is thereby in peril for ourselves and for the world makes the image shine with its highest brightness at the same time that the cloud upon it is made more black when i sound the depth of my own affection so fondly excited i take the like measure for all of us and feel the glad recognition i meet in thus putting it to you for our full illumination that what happens to france happens to all that part of ourselves which we are most proud and most finely advised to enlarge and cultivate and consecrate  our heroic friend sums up for us in other words and has always summed up the life of the mind and the life of the senses alike taken together in the most irrepressible freedom of eitherand after that fashion positively lives for us carries on experience for us does it under our tacit and our at present utterly ungrudging view of her being formed and endowed and constantly prompted toward such doing on all sorts of sides that are simply so many reasons for our standing off standing off in a sort of awed intellectual hush or social suspense and watching and admiring and thanking her she is sole and single in this that she takes charge of those of the interests of man which most dispose him to fraternise with himself to pervade all his possibilities and to taste all his faculties and in consequence to find and to make the earth a friendlier an easier and especially a more various sojourn and the great thing is the amiability and the authority intimately combined with which she has induced us all to trust her on this ground there are matters as to which every set of people has of course most to trust itself most to feel its own genius and its own stoutnessas we are here and all round about us knowing and abiding by that now as we have never done but i verily think there has never been anything in the worldsince the most golden aspect of antiquity at leastlike the way in which france has been trusted to gather the rarest and fairest and sweetest fruits of our so tremendously and so mercilessly turnedup garden of life she has gardened where the soil of humanity has been most grateful and the aspect so to call it most toward the sun and there at the high and yet mild and fortunate centre she has grown the precious intimate the nourishing finishing things that she has inexhaustibly scattered abroad and if we have all so taken them from her so expected them from her as our right to the point that she would have seemed positively to fail of a passed pledge to help us to happiness if she had disappointed us this has been because of her treating us to the impression of genius as no nation since the greeks has treated the watching world and because of our feeling that genius at that intensity is infallible  what it has all amounted to as i say is that we have never known otherwise an agent so beautifully organised organised from within for a mission and that such an organisation at free play has made us really want never to lift a finger to break the charm we catch at every turn of our present longdrawn crisis indeed that portentous name its displayed to us on a measureless scale that our enemy is organised organised possibly to the effect of binding us with a spell if anything could keep us passive the term has been in a manner by that association compromised and vulgarised i say vulgarised because any history of organisation from without and for intended aggression and selfimposition however elaborate the thing may be shows for merely mechanical and bristling compared with the condition of being naturally and functionally endowed and appointed this last is the only fair account of the complete and perfect case that france has shown us and that civilisation has depended on for half its assurances well now we have before us this boundless extension of the case that as we have always known what it was to see the wonderful character i speak of range through its variety and keep shining with another and still another light so in these days we assist at what we may verily call the supreme evidence of its incomparable gift for vivid exhibition it takes our great ally and her only to be as vivid for concentration for reflection for intelligent inspired contraction of life toward an end all but smothered in sacrifice as she has ever been for the most splendidly wasteful diffusion and communication and to give us a view of her nature and her mind in which laying down almost every advantage every art and every appeal that we have generally known her by she takes on energies forms of collective sincerity silent eloquence and selected example that are fresh revelationsand so bleeding at every pore while at no time in all her history so completely erect makes us feel her perhaps as never before our incalculable immortal france     the long wards   there comes back to me out of the distant past an impression of the citizen soldier at once in his collective grouping and in his impaired his more or less warworn state which was to serve me for long years as the most intimate vision of him that my span of life was likely to disclose this was a limited affair indeed i recognise as i try to recover it but i mention it because i was to find at the end of time that i had kept it in reserve left it lurking deep down in my sense of things however shyly and dimly however confusedly even as a term of comparison a glimpse of something by the loss of which i should have been the poorer such a residuary possession of the spirit in fine as only needed darkness to close round it a little from without in order to give forth a vague phosphorescent light it was early it must have been very early in our civil war yet not so early but that a large number of those who had answered president lincolns first call for an army had had time to put in their short period the first term was so short then as was likewise the first number and reappear again in camp one of those of their small new england state under what seemed to me at the hour that of a splendid autumn afternoon the thickest mantle of heroic history if i speak of the impression as confused i certainly justify that mark of it by my failure to be clear at this moment as to how much they were in general the worse for wearsince they cant have been exhibited to me through their waterside settlement of tents and improvised shanties in anything like hospital conditions however i cherish the rich ambiguity and have always cherished it for the sake alone of the general note exhaled the thing that has most kept remembrance unbroken i carried away from the place the impression the one that not only was never to fade but was to show itself susceptible of extraordinary eventual enrichment i may not pretend now to refer it to the more particular sources it drew upon at that summers end of 1861 or to say why my repatriated warriors were if not somehow definitely stricken so largely either lying in apparent helplessness or moving about in confessed languor it suffices me that i have always thought of them as expressing themselves at almost every point in the minor key and that this has been the reason of their interest what i call the note therefore is the characteristic the most of the essence and the most inspiringinspiring i mean for consideration of the admirable sincerity that we thus catch in the act the note of the quite abysmal softness the exemplary genius for accommodation that forms the alternative aspect the passive as distinguished from the active of the fighting man whose business is in the first instance formidably to bristle this aspect has been produced i of course recognise amid the horrors that the german powers had up to a twelvemonth ago been for years conspiring to let loose upon the world by such appalling engines and agencies as mankind had never before dreamed of but just that is the lively interest of the fact unfolded to us now on a scale beside which and though save indeed for a single restriction the whole previous illustration of history turns pale even if i catch but in a generalising blur that exhibition of the first american levies as a measure of experience had stamped and harrowed them the signally attaching mark that i refer to is what i most recall so that if i didnt fear for the connection to appear to compare the slighter things with the so much greater the diminished shadow with the farspread substance i should speak of my small old scrap of truth miserably small in contrast with the immense evidence even then to have been gathered but in respect to which latter occasion didnt come to me as having contained possibilities of development that i must have languished wellnigh during a lifetime to crown it with  one had during the long interval not lacked opportunity for a vision of the soldier at peace moving to and fro with a professional eye on the horizon but not fished out of the bloody welter and laid down to pant as we actually see him among the allies almost on the very bank and within sound and sight of his deepest element the effect of many of the elapsing years the time in england and france and italy had indeed been to work his collective presence so closely and familiarly into any human scene pretending to a full illustration of our most generally approved conditions that i confess to having missed him rather distressfully from the picture of things offered me during a series of months spent not long ago in a few american cities after years of disconnection i can scarce say why i missed him sadly rather than gladlyi might so easily have prefigured ones delight in his absence but certain it is that my almost outraged consciousness of our practically doing without him amid american conditions was a revelation of the degree in which his great imaging his great reminding and enhancing function is rooted in the european basis i felt his nonexistence on the american positively produce a void which nothing else as a vivifying substitute hurried forward to fill this being indeed the case with many of the other voids the most aching which left the habituated eye to cast about as for something to nibble in a state of dearth we never know i think how much these wanting elements have to suggest to the pampered mind till we feel it living in view of the community from which they have been simplified away on these occasions they conspire with the effect of certain other certain similar expressions examples of social life proceeding as by the serene the possibly too serene process of mere ignorance to bring to a head for the fond observer the wonder of what is supposed to strike for the projection of a finished world the note that they are not there to strike however as i quite grant the hypothesis of an observer still fond and yet remarking the lapse of the purple patch of militarism but with a joy unclouded i limit myself to the merely personal point that the fancy of a particular brooding analyst could so sharply suffer from a vagueness of privation something like an unseasoned observational diet and then rather to his relief find the mystery cleared up and the strict relevancy of the bewilderment i glance at moreover becomes questionable further by reason of my having with the outbreak of the horrors in which we are actually steeped caught myself staring at the exhibited militarism of the general british scene not much less ruefully than i could remember to have stared a little before at the utter american deficit which proves after all that the rigour of the case had begun at a bound to defy the largest luxury of thought so that the presence of the military in the picture on the mere moderate insular scale struck one as furnishing a menaced order but in a pitiful and pathetic degree  the degree was to alter however by swift shades just as ones comprehension of the change grew and grew with it and thus it was that to cut short the record of our steps and stages we have left immeasurably behind us here the question of what might or what should have been that belonged with whatever beguiled or amused ways of looking at it to the abyss of our past delusion a collective state of mind in which it had literally been possible to certain sophists to argue that so far from not having soldiers enough we had more than we were likely to know any respectable public call for it was in the very fewest weeks that we replaced a pettifogging consciousness by the most splendidly liberal and having swept through all the first phases of anxiety and suspense found no small part of our measure of the matter settle down to an almost luxurious study of our multiplied defenders after the fact as i may call it or in the light of that acquaintance with them as products supremely tried and tested which i began by speaking of we were up to our necks in this relation before we could turn round and what upwards of a years experience of it has done in the contributive and enriching way may now well be imagined i might feel that my marked generalisation the main hospital impression steeps the case in too strong or too stupid a synthesis were it not that to consult my memory a recollection of countless associative contacts is to see the emphasis almost absurdly thrown on my quasiparadox just so it is of singular interest for the witnessing mind itself to feel the happy truth stoutly resist any qualifying hintsince i am so struck with the charm as i can only call it of the tone and temper of the man of action the creature appointed to advance and explode and destroy and elaborately instructed as to how to do these things reduced to helplessness in the innumerable instances now surrounding us it doesnt in the least take the edge from my impression that his sweet reasonableness representing the opposite end of his wondrous scale is probably the very oldest story of the touching kind in the world so far indeed from my claiming the least originality for the appealing appearance as it has lately reached me from so many sides i find its suggestion of vast communities communities of patience and placidity acceptance and submission pushed to the last point to be just what makes the whole show most illumination  wonderful that from east to west they must all be like this one says to oneself in presence of certain consistencies certain positive monotonies of aspect wonderful that if joy of battle for the classic term in spite of new horrors seems clearly still to keep its old sense has to so attested a pitch animated these forms the disconnection of spirit should be so prompt and complete should hand the creature over as by the easiest turn to the last refinements of accommodation the disconnection of the flesh of physical function in whatever ravaged area that may well be measureless but how interesting if the futility of such praise doesnt too much dishonour the subject the exquisite anomaly of the intimate readjustment of the really more inflamed and exasperated part or in other words of the imagination the captured the haunted vision to life at its most innocent and most ordered to that point ones unvarying thought of the matter which yet though but a meditation without a conclusion becomes the very air in which fond attention spends itself so far as commerce of the acceptable the tentatively helpful kind goes one looks for the key to success then among the victims exactly on that ground of the apprehension pacified and almost so to call it trivialised the attaching thing becomes thus ones intercourse with the imagination of the particular patient subject the individual himself in the measure in which this interest bears us up and carries us along which name for the life of his spirit has to cover by a considerable stretch all the ground by the stretch of the name moreover i am far from meaning any stretch of the faculty itselfwhich remains for the most part a considerably contracted or inert force a force in fact often so undeveloped as to be insusceptible of measurement at all so that one has to resort in face of the happy fact that communion still does hold good to some other descriptive sign for it that sign however fortunately presents itself with inordinate promptitude and fits to its innocent head with the last perfection the cap in fact the very crown of an office that we can only appraise as predetermined good nature we after this fashion score our very highest on behalf of a conclusion i think in feeling that whether or no the british warriors good nature has much range of fancy his imagination whatever there may be of it is at least so goodnatured as to show absolutely everything it touches everything without exception even the worst machinations of the enemy in that colour variety and diversity of exhibition in a world virtually divided as now into hospitals and the preparation of subjects for them are i accordingly conceive to be looked for quite away from the question of physical patience of the general consent to suffering and mutilation and instead of that in this connection of the sort of mind and thought the sort of moral attitude that are born of the sufferers other relations which i like to think of as being different from country to country from class to class and as having their fullest national and circumstantial play  it would be of the essence of these remarks could i give them within my space all the particular applications naturally awaiting them that they pretend to refer here to the british private soldier onlygeneralisation about his officers would take us so considerably further and so much enlarge our view the high average of the beauty and modesty of these in the stricken state causes them to affect me i frankly confess as probably the very flower of the human race ones apprehension of tommyand i scarce know whether more to dislike the liberty this mode of reference takes with him or to incline to retain it for the tenderness really latent in itis in itself a theme for fine notation but it has brought me thus only to the door of the boundless hospital ward in which these many months i have seen the successive and the so strangely quiet tides of his presence ebb and flow and it stays me there before the incalculable vista the perspective stretches away in its mild order after the fashion of a tunnel boring into the very character of the people and so going on for evernever arriving or coming out that is at anything in the nature of a station a junction or a terminus so it draws off through the infinite of the common personal life but planted and bordered all along its passage with the thickgrowing flower of the individual illustration this sometimes vivid enough and sometimes pathetically pale the great fact to my now so informed vision is that it undiscourageably continues and that an unceasing repetition of its testifying particulars seems never either to exhaust its sense or to satisfy that of the beholder its sense indeed if i may so far simplify is pretty well always the same that of the jolly fatalism abovementioned a state of moral hospitality to the practices of fortune however outrageous that may at times fairly be felt as providing amusement providing a new and thereby a refreshing turn of the personal situation for the most interested party it is true that one may be sometimes moved to wonder which is the most interested party the stricken subject in his numbered bed or the friendly the unsated inquirer who has tried to forearm himself against such a measure of the criticism of life as might well be expected to break upon him from the couch in question and who yet a thousand occasions for it having been all round him inevitably neglected finds this ingenious provision quite left on his hands he may well ask himself what he is to do with people who so consistently and so comfortably content themselves with beingbeing for the most part incuriously and instinctively admirablethat nothing whatever is left of them for reflection as distinguished from their own practice but the only answer that comes is the reproduction of the note he may in the interest of appreciation try the experiment of lending them some scrap of a complaint or a curse in order that they shall meet him on congruous ground the ground of encouragement to his own participating impulse they are imaged under that possibility after the manner of those unfortunates the very poor the victims of a fire or shipwreck to whom you have to lend something to wear before they can come to thank you for helping them the inmates of the long wards however have no use for any imputed or derivative sentiments or reasons they feel in their own way they feel a great deal they dont at all conceal from you that to have seen what they have seen is to have seen things horrible and monstrousbut there is no estimate of them for which they seek to be indebted to you and nothing they less invite from you than to show them that such visions must have poisoned their world their world isnt in the least poisoned they have assimilated their experience by a process scarce at all to be distinguished from their having healthily got rid of it  the case thus becomes for you that they consist wholly of their applied virtue which is accompanied with no waste of consciousness whatever the virtue may strike you as having been and as still being greater in some examples than in others but it has throughout the same sign of differing at almost no point from a supreme amiability how can creatures so amiable you allow yourself vaguely to wonder have welcomed even for five minutes the stress of carnage and how can the stress of carnage the murderous impulse at the highest pitch have left so little distortion of the moral nature it has left none at all that one has at the end of many months been able to discover so that perhaps the most steadying and refreshing effect of intercourse with these hospital friends is through the almost complete rest from the facing of generalisations to which it treats you one would even like perhaps as a stimulus to talk more generalisation but one gets enough of that out in the world and one doesnt get there nearly so much of what one gets in this perspective the particular perfect sufficiency of the extraordinary principle whatever it is which makes the practical answer so supersede any question or any argument that it seems fairly to have acted by chronic instinctive anticipation the habit of freely throwing the personal weight into any obvious opening the personal weight in its various forms and degrees is what lies there with a head on the pillow and whatever wise bandages thereabout or elsewhere and it becomes interesting in itself and just in proportion i think to its having had all its history after the fact all its history is that of the particular application which has brought it to the pass at which you find it and is a stream round about which you have to press a little hard to make it flow clear then in many a case it does flow certainly as clear as one could wish and with the strain that it is always somehow english history and illustrates afresh the english way of doing things and regarding them of feeling and naming them the sketch extracted is apt to be least coloured when the prostrate historian as i may call him is an englishman of the english it has more point though not perhaps more essential tone when he is a scot of the scots and has most when he is an irishman of the irish but there is absolutely no difference in the light of race and save as by inevitable variation from individual to individual about the really constant and precious matter the attested possession on the part of the contributor of a free loose undisciplined quantity of being to contribute  this is the palpable and ponderable the admirably appreciable residuumas to which if i be asked just how it is that i pluck the flower of amiability from the bramble of an individualism so bristling with accents i am afraid i can only say that the accents would seem by the mercy of chance to fall together in the very sense that permits us to detach the rose with the fewest scratches the rose of active good nature irreducible incurable or in other words all irreflective that is the variety which the individualistic tradition happens up and down these islands to wear upon its ample breasteven it may be with considerable effect of monotony there it is for what it is and the very simplest summary of ones poor bedside practice is perhaps to confess that one has most of all kept ones nose buried in it there hangs about the poor practitioner by that fact i profess an aroma not doubtless at all mixed or in the least mystical but so unpervertedly wholesome that what can i pronounce it with any sort of conscience but sweet that is the rough unless i rather say the smooth report of it which covers of course i hasten to add a constant shift of impression within the happy limits did i not by way of introduction to these awaiters of acknowledgment find myself first of all early in the autumn in presence of the first aligned rows of lacerated belgiansthe eloquence of whose mere mute expression of their state and thereby of their cause remains to me a vision unforgettable for ever and this even though i may not here stretch my scale to make them flemings of flanders though they were fit into my remarks with the english of the english and the scotch of the scotch if other witnesses might indeed here fit in they would decidedly come nearest for there were aspects under which one might almost have taken them simply for britons comparatively starved of sport and to make up for that on straighter and homelier terms with their other senses and appetites but their effect thanks to their being so seated in everything that their ripe and rounded temperament had done for them was to make their english entertainers and their successors in the long wards especially seem ever so much more complicatedbesides making of what had happened to themselves for that matter an enormity of outrage beyond all thought and pity their fate had cut into their spirit to a peculiar degree through their flesh as if they had had an unusual thickness of this so to speakwhich up to that time had protected while it now but the more exposed and collectively entrapped them so that the ravaged and plundered domesticity that one felt in them which was mainly what they had to oppose made the terms of their exile and their suffering an extension of the possible and the dreadful but all that vision is a chapter by itselfthe essence of which is perhaps that it has been the privilege of this placid and sturdy people to show the world a new shade and measure of the tragic and the horrific the first wash of the great flemish tide ebbed at any rate from the hospitalscreating moreover the vast needs that were to be so unprecedentedly met and the native procession which has prompted these remarks set steadily in i have played too uncertain a light i am well aware not arresting it at half the possible points yet with one aspect of the case staring out so straight as to form the vivid moral that asks to be drawn the deepest impression from the sore human stuff with which such observation deals is that of its being strong and sound in an extraordinary degree for the conditions producing it these conditions represent one feels at the best the crude and the waste the ignored and neglected state and under the sense of the small care and scant provision that have attended such hearty and happy growths struggling into life and air with no furtherance to speak of the question comes pressingly home of what a better economy might or verily mightnt result in if this abundance all slighted and unencouraged can still comfort us what wouldnt it do for us tended and fostered and cultivated that is my moral for i believe in culturespeaking strictly now of the honest and of our own congruous kind   glasgow w collins sons and co ltd
