19027635	blown to bits a tale of the krakatoa volcanic explosion by rm ballantyne    this book is a most enjoyable read  we can however detect that ballantyne had been reading up various works by whg kingston and by g manville fenn  its just the knowledge of forest life in java and sumatra that makes us think that  but that knowledge is good for it makes those parts of the book that take place in these forests ring all the more true  as so often with victorian authors writing for teenagers there is a delightful coloured auxiliary hero  but there is another even more important auxiliary hero van der kemp and it is this man and his doings that form the real interest of this story  he had made himself a home in an island of the krakatoa group and a very interesting home it is too  he travels about mostly in a threeseater canoe of the rob roy type that seems able to travel great distances over the sea sailing some of the way and to withstand heavy weather in a most surprising manner  there is a good description of the eruption or rather explosion of krakatoa  this was one of the major geological events of the century and might well have been taken for granted with the author assuming that his youthful readers knew all about it but thank goodness he does not    blown to bits a tale of the krakatoa volcanic explosion by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the play commences  blown to bits bits so inconceivably so ineffably so microscopically small thatbut let us not anticipate  about the darkest hour of a very dark night in the year 1883 a large brig lay becalmed on the indian ocean not far from that region of the eastern world which is associated in some minds with spices volcanoes coffee and piratical junks namely the malay archipelago  two men slowly paced the brigs quarterdeck for some time in silence as if the elemental quietude which prevailed above and below had infected them  both men were broad and apparently strong  one of them was tall the other short  more than this the feeble light of the binnaclelamp failed to reveal  father said the tall man to the short one i do like to hear the gentle pattering of the reefpoints on the sails it is so suggestive of peace and rest  doesnt it strike you so  cant say it does lad replied the short man in a voice which naturally mellow and hearty had been rendered nautically harsh and gruff by years of persistent roaring in the teeth of wind and weather more suggestive to me of lost time and leeway  the son laughed lightly a pleasant kindly soft laugh in keeping with the scene and hour  why father he resumed after a brief pause you are so sternly practical that you drive all the sentiment out of a fellow  i had almost risen to the regions of poetry just now under the pleasant influences of nature  glad i got hold of ee lad before you rose growled the captain of the brigfor such the short man was  when a young fellow like you gets up into the clouds o poetry hes like a man in a balloonscarce knows how he got there doesnt know very well how hes to get down an has no more idea where hes goin to or what hes drivin at than the man in the moon  take my advice lad an get out o poetical regions as fast as ye can  it dont suit a young fellow who has got to do duty as first mate of his fathers brig and push his way in the world as a seaman  when i sent you to school an made you a far better scholar than myself i had no notion they was goin to teach you poetry  the captain delivered the last word with an emphasis which was meant to convey the idea of profound but not illnatured scorn  why father returned the young man in a tone which plainly told of a gleeful laugh within him which was as yet restrained it was not school that put poetry into meif indeed there be any in me at all  what was it then  it was mother returned the youth promptly and surely you dont object to poetry in her  object cried the captain as though speaking in the teeth of a norwester  of course not  but then nigel poetry in your mother is poetry an she can do it ladscreeds of itequal to anything that dibdin or orthat other fellow you know i forget his name ever put pen towhy your mother is herself a poem neatly made up rounded off at the corners frenchpolished and all shipshape  ha you neednt go an shelter yourself under her wings wi your inflated up in the clouds reefpoint patterin balloonlike nonsense  well well father dont get so hot about it i wont offend again besides im quite content to take a very low place so long as you give mother her right position  we wont disagree about that but i suspect that we differ considerably about the other matter you mentioned  what other matter demanded the sire  my doing duty as first mate answered the son  it must be quite evident to you by this time i should think that i am not cut out for a sailor  after all your trouble and my own efforts during this long voyage round the cape im no better than an amateur  i told you that a youth taken fresh from college without any previous experience of the sea except in boats could not be licked into shape in so short a time it is absurd to call me first mate of the sunshine  that is in reality mr moors position  no it isnt nigel my son interrupted the captain firmly  mr moor is second mate  i say so an if i the skipper and owner o this brig dont know it id like to know who does  now look here lad  youve always had a bad habit of underratin yourself an contradictin your father  im an old salt you know an i tell ee that for the time youve bin at sea an the opportunities youve had youre a sort o walkin miracle  youre no more an ammytoor than i am and another voyage or two will make you quite fit to work your way all over the ocean an finally to take command o this here brig an let your old father stay at home wiwi  with the poetess suggested nigel  just sowi the equal o dibdin not to mention the other fellow  now it seems to me  hows er head  the captain suddenly changed the subject here  nigel who chanced to be standing next the binnacle stooped to examine the compass and the flood of light from its lamp revealed a smooth but manly and handsome face which seemed quite to harmonise with the cheery voice that belonged to it  noreastandbyeast he said  are ee sure lad  your doubting me father does not correspond with your lately expressed opinion of my seamanship does it  let me see returned the captain taking no notice of the remark and stooping to look at the compass with a critical eye  the flood of light in this case revealed a visage in which goodnature had evidently struggled for years against the virulent opposition of wind and weather and had come off victorious though not without evidences of the conflict  at the same time it revealed features similar to those of the son though somewhat rugged and red besides being smothered in hair  vulcan must be concoctin a new brew he muttered as he gazed inquiringly over the bow or hes stirring up an old one  what dyou mean father  i mean that theres somethin goin on thereawayin the neighbourhood o sunda straits answered the captain directing attention to that point of the compass towards which the ships head was turned darkness like this dont happen without a cause  ive had some experience o them seas before now an depend upon it that vulcan is stirring up some o the fires that are always blazin away more or less around the straits settlements  by which you mean i suppose that one of the numerous volcanoes in the malay archipelago has become active said nigel but are we not some five or six hundred miles to the souwest of sunda  surely the influence of volcanic action could scarcely reach so far  so far repeated the captain with a sort of humph which was meant to indicate mild contempt that shows how little you know with all your booklearnin about volcanoes  i dont profess to know much father retorted nigel in a tone of cheery defiance  why boy continued the other resuming his perambulation of the deck explosions have sometimes been heard for hundreds ay hundreds of miles  i thought i heard one just now but no doubt the unusual darkness works up my imagination and makes me suspicious for its wonderful what fools the imag  hallo  dee feel that  he went smartly towards the binnaclelight as he spoke and holding an arm close to it found that his sleeve was sprinkled with a thin coating of fine dust  didnt i say so he exclaimed in some excitement as he ran to the cabin skylight and glanced earnestly at the barometer  that glance caused him to shout a sudden order to take in all sail  at the same moment a sigh of wind swept over the sleeping sea as if the stormfiend were expressing regret at having been so promptly discovered and met  seamen are well used to sudden dangerespecially in equatorial seas and to prompt unquestioning action  not many minutes elapsed before the sunshine was under the smallest amount of sail she could carry even before this had been well accomplished a stiff breeze was tearing up the surface of the sea into wild foam which a furious gale soon raised into raging billows  the storm came from the sunda straits about which the captain and his son had just been talking and was so violent that they could do nothing but scud before it under almost bare poles  all that night it raged towards morning it increased to such a pitch that one of the backstays of the foremast gave way  the result was that the additional strain thus thrown on the other stays was too much for them  they also parted and the foretopmast snapping short off with a report like a cannonshot went over the side carrying the maintopgallantmast and all its gear along with it    chapter two  the haven in the coral ring  it seemed as if the stormfiend were satisfied with the mischief he had accomplished for immediately after the disaster just described the gale began to moderate and when the sun rose it had been reduced to a stiff but steady breeze  from the moment of the accident onward the whole crew had been exerting themselves to the utmost with axe and knife to cut and clear away the wreck of the masts and repair damages  not the least energetic among them was our amateur first mate nigel roy  when all had been made comparatively snug he went aft to where his father stood beside the steersman with his legs nautically wide apart his souwester pulled well down over his frowning brows and his hands in their native pockets  this is a bad ending to a prosperous voyage said the youth sadly but you dont seem to take it much to heart father  how much or little i take it to heart you know nothin whatever about my boy seein that i dont wear my heart on my coatsleeve nor yet on the point of my nose for the inspection of all and sundry  besides you cant tell whether its a bad or a good endin for it has not ended yet one way or another  moreover what appears bad is often found to be good an what seems good is pretty often uncommon bad  you are a walking dictionary of truisms father  i suppose you mean to take a philosophical view of the misfortune and make the best of it said nigel with what we may style one of his twinkling smiles for on nearly all occasions that young mans dark brown eyes twinkled in spite of him as vigorously as any little star that was ever told in prose or song to do soand much more expressively too because of the eyebrows of which little stars appear to be destitute  no lad retorted the captain i take a commonsense viewnot a philosophical one an when youve bin as long at sea as i have youll call nothin a misfortune until its proved to be such  the only misfortune i have at present is a son who cannot see things in the same light as his father sees em  well then according to your own principle that is the reverse of a misfortune for if i saw everything in the same light that you do youd have no pleasure in talking to me youd have no occasion to reason me out of error or convince me of truth  take the subject of poetry now  luff said captain roy sternly to the man at the wheel  when the man at the wheel had gone through the nautical evolution involved in luff the captain turned to his son and said abruptlywell run for the cocoskeelin islands nigel an refit  are the keeling islands far off  lift up your head and look straight along the bridge of your nose lad and youll see them  theyre an interesting group are the keelin islands  volcanic they are with a coral topdressin so to speak sit down here an ill tell ee about em  nigel shut up the telescope through which he had been examining the thin blue line on the horizon that indicated the islands in question and sat down on the cabin skylight beside his father  theyve got a romantic history too though a short one an are set like a gem on the bosom of the deep blue sea  come father youre drifting out of your true coursethats poetical  i know it lad but im only quotin your mother  well you must know that the keelin islandswe call them keelin for shortwere uninhabited between fifty and sixty years ago when a scotsman named ross thinking them well situated as a port of call for the repair and provisioning of vessels on their way to australia and china set his heart on them and quietly took possession in the name of england  then he went home to fetch his wife and family of six children intendin to settle on the islands for good  returning in 1827 with the family and fourteen adventurers twelve of whom were english one a portugee and one a javanee he found to his disgust that an englishman named hare had stepped in before him and taken possession  this hare was a very bad fellow a rich man who wanted to live like a rajah with lots o native wives and retainers an be a sort of independent prince  of course he was on bad terms at once with ross who finding that things were going badly felt that it would be unfair to hold his people to the agreement which was made when he thought the whole group was his own so he offered to release them  they all except two men and one woman accepted the release and went off in a gunboat that chanced to touch there at the time  for a good while hare and his rival lived therethe one tryin to get the dutch the other to induce the english government to claim possession  neither dutch nor english would do so at first but the english did it at long lastin 1878and annexed the islands to the government of ceylon  long before that date howeverbefore 1836hare left and went to singapore where he died leaving ross in possessionthe king of the cocos islands as he came to be called  in a few yearschiefly through the energy of rosss eldest son to whom he soon gave up the management of affairsthe group became a prosperous settlement  its ships traded in cocoanuts the chief produce of the islands throughout all the straits settlements and boatbuildin became one of their most important industries  but there was one thing that prevented it from bein a very happy though prosperous place an that was the coolies who had been hired in java for the only men that could be got there at first were criminals who had served their time in the chaingangs of batavia  as these men were fit for anythingfrom pitchandtoss to murderand soon outnumbered the colonists the place was kept in constant alarm and watchfulness  for as i dare say you know the malays are sometimes liable to have the spirit of amok on them which leads them to care for and fear nothin and to go in for a fighttodeath from which we get our sayinrun amuck  an when a strong fellow is goin about loose in this state o mind its about as bad as havin a tiger prowlin in ones garden  well sometimes two or three o these coolies would mutiny and bide in the woods o one o the smaller uninhabited islands  an the colonists would have no rest till they hunted them down  so to keep matters right they had to be uncommon strict  it was made law that no one should spend the night on any but what was called the home island without permission  every man was bound to report himself at the guardhouse at a fixed hour every fire to be out at sunset and every boat was numbered and had to be in its place before that time  so they went on till the year 1862 when a disaster befell them that made a considerable changeat first for the worse but for the better in the longrun  provin the truth my lad of what i waswell noi was goin to draw a moral here but i wont  it was a cyclone that did the business  cyclones have got a freeaneasy way of makin a clean sweep of the work of years in a few hours  this cyclone completely wrecked the homes of the keelin islanders and rossthats the second ross the son of the first one sent home for his son who was then a student of engineering in glasgow to come out and help him to put things to rights  ross the third obeyed the call like a good sonobserve that nigel  all right father fire away  like a good son repeated the captain an he turned out to be a firstrate man which was lucky for his poor father died soon after leavin him to do the work alone  an well able was the young engineer to do it  he got rid o the chaingang men altogether and hired none but men o the best character in their place  he cleared off the forests and planted the ground with cocoanut palms  got out steam mills circular saws lathes etcetera and established a system of general education with a younger brother as headmasteran tailmaster too for i believe there was only one  he also taught the men to work in brass iron and wood and his wifea cocos girl that he married after comin outtaught all the women and girls to sew cook and manage the house  in short everything went on in full swing of prosperity till the year 1876 when the islandborn inhabitants were about 500 as contented and happy as could be  in january of that year another cyclone paid them a visit  the barometer gave them warning and remembering the visit of fourteen years before they made ready to receive the new visitor  all the boats were hauled up to places of safety and every other preparation was made  down it came on the afternoon o the 28thworse than they had expected  many of the storehouses and mills had been lately renewed or built  they were all gutted and demolished  everything movable was swept away like bits of paper  lanes hundreds of yards in length were cleared among the palmtrees by the whirling wind which seemed to perform a demondance of revelry among them  in some cases it snapped trees off close to the ground  in others it seemed to swoop down from above lick up a patch of trees bodily and carry them clean away leaving the surrounding trees untouched  sometimes it would select a tree of thirty years growth seize it spin it round and leave it a permanent spiral screw  i was in these regions about the time and had the account from a native who had gone through it all and couldnt speak of it except with glaring eyeballs and gasping breath  about midnight of the 28th the gale was at its worst  darkness that could be felt between the flashes of lightning  thunder that was nearly drowned by the roaring of the wind an the crashing of everything all round  to save their lives the people had to fling themselves into ditches and hollows of the ground  mr ross and some of his people were lying in the shelter of a wall near his house  there had been a schooner lying not far off  when mr ross raised his head cautiously above the wall to have a look to windard he saw the schooner comin straight for him on the top of a big wave  hold on he shouted fell flat down and laid hold o the nearest bush  next moment the wave burst right over the wall roared on up to the garden 150 yards above highwater mark and swept his house clean away  by good fortune the wall stood the shock and the schooner stuck fast just before reachin it but so near that the end of the jibboom passed right over the place where the household lay holdin on for dear life and half drowned  it was a tremendous night concluded the captain an nearly everything on the islands was wrecked but theyve survived it as youll see though its seven years since that cyclone swep over them theyre all right and goin ahead again full swing as if nothin had happened  and is ross the third still king asked nigel with much interest  ayat least he was king a few years ago when i passed this way and had occasion to land to replace a topsl yard that had been carried away  then you wont arrive as a stranger  i should think not returned the captain getting up and gazing steadily at the atoll or group of islets enclosed within a coral ring which they were gradually approaching  night had descended however and the gale had decreased almost to a calm ere they steered through the narrow channelor what we may call a broken part of the ringwhich led to the calm lagoon inside  nigel roy leaned over the bow watching with profound attention the numerous phosphorescent fish and eellike creatures which darted hither and thither like streaks of silver from beneath their advancing keel  he had enough of the naturalist in him to arouse in his mind keen interest in the habits and action of the animal life around him and these denizens of the coralgroves were as new to him as their appearance was unexpected  youll find em very kind and hospitable lad said the captain to his son  what the fish  no the inhabitants  portportsteady  steady it is responded the man at the wheel  let go shouted the captain  a heavy plunge followed by the rattling of chains and swinging round of the brig told that they had come to an anchor in the lagoon of the cocoskeeling islands    chapter three  interesting particulars of various kinds  by the first blush of dawn nigel roy hastened on deck eager to see the place in regard to which his fathers narrative had awakened in him considerable interest  it not only surpassed but differed from all his preconceived ideas  the brig floated on the bosom of a perfectly calm lake of several miles in width the bottom of which with its bright sand and brilliant coralbeds could be distinctly seen through the pellucid water  this lake was encompassed by a reef of coral which swelled here and there into treeclad islets and against which the breakers of the indian ocean were dashed into snowy foam in their vain but ceaseless efforts to invade the calm serenity of the lagoon  smaller islands rich with vegetation were scattered here and there within the charmed circle through which several channels of various depths and sizes connected the lagoon with the ocean  we shall soon have the king himself off to welcome us said captain roy as he came on deck and gave a sailorlike glance all round the horizon and then up at the sky from the mere force of habit  visitors are not numerous here  a few scientific men have landed now and again darwin the great naturalist among others in 1836 and forbes in 1878 no doubt theyll be very glad to welcome nigel roy in this year of grace 1883  but im not a naturalist father mores the pity  no matter lad youre an ammytoor first mate an praps a poet may count for somethin here  they lead poetical lives and are fond o poetry  perhaps that accounts for the fondness you say they have for you father  just so lad  seetheres a boat puttin off already the king no doubt  he was right  mr ross the appointed governor and king of the cocos islands was soon on deck heartily shaking hands with and welcoming captain roy as an old friend  he carried him and his son off at once to breakfast in his islandhome introduced nigel to his family and then showed them round the settlement assuring them at the same time that all its resources were at their disposal for the repair of the sunshine  thank ee kindly said the captain in reply but ill only ask for a stick to rig up a foretopmast to carry us to batavia where well give the old craft a regular overhaulfor its just possible she may have received some damage below the waterline wi bumpin on the mast and yards  the house of the king was a commodious comfortable building in the midst of a garden in which there were roses in great profusion as well as fruittrees and flowering shrubs  each keeling family possessed a neat wellfurnished plank cottage enclosed in a little garden besides a boathouse at the wateredge on the inner or lagoon side of the reef and numerous boats were lying about on the white sand  the islanders being almost born sailors were naturally very skilful in everything connected with the sea  there was about them a good deal of that kindly innocence which one somehow expects to find associated with a mild paternal government and a limited intercourse with the surrounding world and nigel was powerfully attracted by them from the first  after an extensive ramble during which mr ross plied the captain with eager questions as to the latest news from the busy centres of civilisationespecially with reference to new inventions connected with engineeringthe island king left them to their own resources till dinnertime saying that he had duties to attend to connected with the kingdom  now boy said the captain when their host had gone whatll ee do take a boat and have a pull over the lagoon or go with me to visit a family im particularly fond of an who are uncommon fond of me  visit the family of course said nigel  i can have a pull any day  come along then  he led the way to one of the neatest of the plank cottages which stood on the highest ridge of the island so that from the front windows it commanded a view of the great blue ocean with its breakers that fringed the reef as with a ring of snow while on the opposite side lay the peaceful waters and islets of the lagoon  a shout of joyful surprise was uttered by several boys and girls at sight of the captain for during his former visit he had won their hearts by telling them wild stories of the sea onehalf of each story being founded on fact and personal experience the other half on a vivid imagination  we are rejoiced to see you said the mother of the juveniles a stout woman of mixed nationalitythat of dutch apparently predominating  she spoke english however remarkably well as did many of the cocos people though malay is the language of most of them  the boys and girls soon hauled the captain down on a seat and began to urge him to tell them stories using a style of english that was by no means equal to that of the mother  stop stop let me see sister kathy first  i cant begin without her where is she  somewhere i spose said the eldest boy  no doubt of that  gofetch her returned the captain  at that moment a backdoor opened and a girl of about seventeen years of age entered  she was pleasantlooking rather than prettytall graceful and with magnificent black eyes  here she comes cried the captain rising and kissing her  why kathy how youve grown since i saw you last  quite a woman i declare  kathy was not too much of a woman however to join her brothers and sisters in forcing the captain into a seat and demanding a story on the spot  stop stop cried the captain grasping round their waists a small boy and girl who had already clambered on his knees  let me inquire about my old friends firstand let me introduce my son to youyouve taken no notice of him yet  thats not hospitable  all eyes were turned at once on nigel some boldly others with a shy inquiring look as though to say can you tell stories  come now said nigel advancing since you are all so fond of my father i must shake hands with you all round  the hearty way in which this was done at once put the children at their ease  they admitted him as it were into their circle and then turning again to the captain continued their clamour for a story  no noabout old friends first  howhows old mother morris  quite well they shouted  fatterer than ever added an urchin who in england would have been styled cheeky  yes lisped a very little girl one of e doors in e house too small for she  why gerchin youve learned to speak english like the rest said the captain  yes father make every one learn  well now continued the captain what about black sam  gone to batavia chorused the children  andandwhatsisnamethe man wi the nose  a burst of laughter and wes all got noses here was the reply  yes but you know who i meanthe short man wi the  oh with the turned up nose  i know cried the cheeky boy you means johnson  he hoed away nobody know whar  and little kelly drew what of her  a sudden silence fell on the group and solemn eyes were turned on sister kathy who was evidently expected to answer  not dead said the captain earnestly  no but very very ill replied the girl  dear kelly have never git over the loss of her brother who  at this point they were interrupted by another group of the captains little admirers who having heard of his arrival ran forward to give him a noisy welcome  before stories could be commenced however the visitors were summoned to mr rosss house to dinner and then the captain had got into such an eager talk with the king that evening was upon them before they knew where they were as nigel expressed it and the stories had to be postponed until the following day  of course beds were offered and accepted by captain roy and nigel just before retiring to them father and son went out to have a stroll on the margin of the lagoon  aint it a nice place nigel asked the former whose kindly spirit had been stirred up to quite a jovial pitch by the gushing welcome he had received alike from old and young  its charming father  quite different from what you had led me to expect  my boy returned the captain with that solemn deliberation which he was wont to assume when about to deliver a palpable truism  wen youve come to live as long as me youll find that everything turns out different from what people have bin led to expect  leastways thats my experience  well in the meantime till i have come to your time of life ill take your word for that and i do hope you intend to stay a long time here  no my son i dont  why do ye ask  because i like the place and the people so much that i would like to study it and them and to sketch the scenery  business before pleasure my lad said the captain with a grave shake of the head  you know weve bin blown out of our course and have no business here at all  ill only wait till the carpenter completes his repairs and then be off for batavia  duty first everything else afterwards  but you being owner as well as commander there is no one to insist on duty being done objected nigel  pardon me returned the captain there is a certain owner named captain david roy a very stern disciplinarian who insists on the commander o this here brig performin his duty to the letter  you may depend upon it that if a man aint true to himself hes not likely to be true to any one else  but its likely that we may be here for a couple of days so i release you from duty that you may make the most o your time and enjoy yourself  by the way it will save you wastin time if you ask that little girl kathy holbein to show you the best places to sketch for shes a born genius with her pencil and brush  no thank you father returned nigel  i want no little girl to bother me while im sketchingeven though she be a born geniusfor i think i possess genius enough myself to select the best points for sketching and to get along fairly well without help  at least ill try what i can do  please yourself lad  nevertheless i think you wouldnt find poor kathy a bother shes too modest for thatmoreover she could manage a boat and pull a good oar when i was here last and no doubt she has improved since  nevertheless id rather be alone persisted nigel  but why do you call her poor kathy  she seems to be quite as strong and as jolly as the rest of her brothers and sisters  ah poor thing these are not her brothers and sisters returned the captain in a gentler tone  kathy is only an adopted child and an orphan  her name kathleen is not a dutch one  she came to these islands in a somewhat curious way  sit down here and ill tell ee the little i know about her  father and son sat down on a mass of coral rock that had been washed up on the beach during some heavy gale and for a few minutes gazed in silence on the beautiful lagoon in which not only the islets but the brilliant moon and even the starry hosts were mirrored faithfully  about thirteen years ago said the captain two pirate junks in the sunda straits attacked a british barque and after a fight captured her  some o the crew were killed in action some were taken on board the junks to be held to ransom i spose and some jumping into the sea to escape if possible by swimming were probably drowned for they were a considerable distance from land  it was one o these fellows however who took to the water that managed to land on the java shore more dead than alive  he gave information about the affair and was the cause of a gunboat that was in these waters at the time bein sent off in chase o the pirate junks  this man who swam ashore was a lascar  he said that the chief o the pirates who seemed to own both junks was a big ferocious malay with only one eyehe might have added with no heart at all if what he said o the scoundrel was true for he behaved with horrible cruelty to the crew o the barque  after takin all he wanted out of his prize he scuttled her and then divided the people that were saved alive between the two junks  there were several passengers in the vessel among them a young mana widowerwith a little daughter four year old or so  he was bound for calcutta  being a very powerful man he fought like a lion to beat the pirates off but he was surrounded and at last knocked down by a blow from behind  then his arms were made fast and he was sent wi the rest into the biggest junk  this poor fellow recovered his senses about the time the pirates were dividin the prisoners among them  he seemed dazed at first so said the lascar but as he must have bin in a considerable funk himself i suspect his observations couldnt have bin very correct  anyhow he said he was sittin near the side o the junk beside this poor man whose name he never knew but who seemed to be an englishman from his language when a wild scream was heard in the other junk  it was the little girl who had caught sight of her father and began to understand that she was going to be separated from him  at the sound o her voice he started up and looking round like a wild bull caught sight o the little one on the deck o the other junk just as they were hoistin sail to take advantage of a breeze that had sprung up  whether it was that they had bound the man with a piece o bad rope or that the strength o samson had been given to him the lascar could not tell but he saw the englishman snap the rope as if it had bin a bit o packthread and jump overboard  he swam for the junk where his little girl was  if he had possessed the strength of a dozen samsons it would have availed him nothin for the big sail had caught the breeze and got way on her  at the same time the other junk lay over to the same breeze and the two separated  at first the oneeyed pirate jumped up with an oath and fired a pistol shot at the englishman but missed him  then he seemed to change his mind and shouted in bad english with a diabolical laughswim away swim hard praps you kitch im up  of course the two junks were soon out of sight o the poor swimmerand that was the end of him for of course he must have been drowned  but what of the poor little girl asked nigel whose feelings were easily touched by the sorrows of children and who began to have a suspicion of what was coming  im just comin to that  well the gunboat that went to look for the pirates sighted one o the junks out in the indian ocean after a long search and captured her but not a single one o the barques crew was to be found in her and it was supposed they had been all murdered and thrown overboard wi shots tied to their feet to sink them  enough o the cargo o the british barque was found however to convict her and on a more careful search bein made the little girl was discovered hid away in the hold  bein only about four year old the poor little thing was too frightened to understand the questions put to her  all she could say was that she wanted to go to father and that her name was kathy probably short for kathleen but she could not tell  then that is the girl who is now here exclaimed nigel  the same lad  the gunboat ran in here like as we did to have some slight repairs done and kathy was landed  she seemed to take at once to motherly mrs holbein who offered to adopt her and as the captain of the gunboat had no more notion than the maninthemoon who the child belonged to or what to do with her he gladly handed her over so here she has been livin ever since  of coarse attempts have been made to discover her friends but without success and now all hope has been given up  the poor girl herself never speaks on the subject but old holbein and his wife tell me she is sure that kathy has never forgotten her father  it may be so anyhow she has forgotten his nameif she ever knew it  next day nigel made no objections to being guided to the most picturesque spots among the coral isles by the interesting orphan girl if she had been older he might even have fallen in love with her an event which would have necessitated an awkward modification of the groundwork of our tale  as it was he pitied the poor child sincerely and not onlyrecognising her geniusasked her advice a good deal on the subject of art butrecognising also her extreme youth and ignorancevolunteered a good deal of advice in exchange quite in a paternal way    chapter four  nigel undergoes some quite new and interesting experiences  the arrangements made on the following day turned out to be quite in accordance with the wishes and tastes of the various parties concerned  the ships carpenter having been duly set to work on the repairs and being inspected in that serious piece of prosaic business by the second mate our captain was set free to charm the very souls of the juveniles by wandering for miles along the coral strand inventing narrating exaggerating to his hearts content  pausing now and then to ask questions irrelevant to the story in hand like a wily actor for the purpose of intensifying the desire for more he would mount a block of coral and thence sometimes as from a throne or platform or pulpit impress some profound piece of wisdom or some thrilling point or some exceedingly obvious moral on his followers openmouthed and openeyed  these were by no means idlers steeped in the too common business of having nothing to do  no they had regularly sought and obtained a holiday from work or school for all the activities of social and civilised life were going on full swingfuller indeed than the average swingin that remote scarcely known and beautiful little gem of the indian ocean  meanwhile nigel and kathy with sketchbooks under their arms went down to where the clear waters of the lagoon rippled on the white sand and launching a cockleshell of a boat rowed out toward the islets  now kathy you must let me pull said nigel pushing out the sculls for although the captain tells me you are very good at rowing it would never do for a man you know to sit lazily down and let himself be rowed by a girl  very well said kathy with a quiet and most contented smile for she had not yet reached the selfconscious ageat least as ages go in the cocoskeeling islands  besides kathy was gifted with that charming disposition which never objects to anythinganything of course that does not involve principle  but it was soon found that as the cockleshell had no rudder and the intricacies they had to wind among were numerous frequent directions and corrections were called for from the girl  dyou know said nigel at last as i dont know where you want me to go to it may be as well after all that you should row  very well said kathy with another of her innocent smiles  i thinked it will be better so at first  nigel could not help laughing at the way she said this as he handed her the sculls  she soon proved herself to be a splendid boatwoman and although her delicate and shapely arms were as mere pipestems to the great brawny limbs of her companion yet she had a deft mysterious way of handling the sculls that sent the cockleshell faster over the lagoon than before  now we go ashore here said kathy turning the boatwith a prompt backwater of the left scull and a vigorous pull of the right oneinto a little cove just big enough to hold it  the keel went with such a plump on the sand that nigel who sat on a forward thwart with his back landward reversed the natural order of things by putting his back on the bottom of the boat and his heels in the air  to this day it is an unsettled question whether this was done on purpose by kathy  certain it is that she did not tumble but burst into a hearty fit of laughter while her large lustrous eyes half shut themselves up and twinkled  why you dont even apologise you dreadful creature exclaimed nigel joining in the laugh as he picked himself up  why should i pologise asked the girl in the somewhat broken english acquired from her adopted family  why you not look out  right kathy right ill keep a sharp lookout next time  meanwhile i will return good for evil by offering my hand to help you ahallo  while he spoke the girl had sprung past him like a grasshopper and alighted on the sand like a butterfly  a few minutes later and this little jesting fit had vanished and they were both engaged with pencil and book eagerlyfor both were enthusiasticsketching one of the most enchanting scenes that can well be imagined  we will not attempt the impossible  description could not convey it  we can only refer the readers imagination to the one old hackneyed but expressive wordfairyland  one peculiarly interesting point in the scene was that on the opposite side of the lagoon the captain could be seen holding forth to his juvenile audience  when a pretty long time had elapsed in absolute silence each sketcher being totally oblivious of the other nigel looked up with a long sigh and said  well you have chosen a most exquisite scene for me  the more i work at it the more i find to admire  may i look now at what you have done  oh yes but i have done not much  i am slow said the girl as nigel rose and looked over her shoulder  whywhathow beautifulbutbutwhat do you mean exclaimed the youth  i dont understand you said the girl looking up in surprise  why kathy i had supposed you were drawing that magnificent landscape all this time andand youve only been drawing a group of shells splendidly done i admit but why  he stopped at that moment for her eyes suddenly filled with tears  forgive me dear child said nigel hurriedly i did not intend to hurt your feelings  i was only surprised at your preference  you have not hurt me returned kathy in a low voice as she resumed her work but what you say calls back to memy father was very fond of shells  she stopped and nigel blaming himself for having inadvertently touched some tender chord hastened somewhat clumsily to change the subject  you draw landscape also i doubt not  oh yesplenty  if you come home to me tonight i will show you some  i shall be only too happy returned the youth sitting down again to his sketch and perhaps i may be able to give you a hint or two especially in reference to perspectivefor ive had regular training you know kathy and i dare say you have not had that here  not what you will think much perhaps yet i have study a little in school and very much from nature  well you have been under the best of masters returned nigel if you have studied much from nature  and who has been your other teacher  a brother of mr ross  i think he must understand very much  he was an engineer and has explained to me the rules of perspective and many other things which were at first very hard to understand  but i do see them now  perhaps then kathleen said nigel in that drawling absent tone in which artists are apt to indulge when busy at workperhaps you may be already too far advanced to require instruction from me  perhapsbut i think no for you seems to understand a great deal  but why you call me kathleen just now  because i suppose that is your real namekathy being the short for it is it not so  well praps it is  i have hear mother holbein say so once  i like kathleen best  then may i call you kathleen  if you like  at this point both artists had become so engrossed in their occupation that they ceased to converse and for a considerable time profound silence reignedat least on their part though not as regarded others for every now and then the faint sound of laughter came floating over the tranquil lagoon from that part of the coral strand where captain roy was still tickling the fancies and expanding the imaginations and harrowing or soothing the feelings of the cocoskeeling juveniles  inferior animal life was also in ceaseless activity around the sketchers filling the air with those indescribably quiet noises which are so suggestive of that general happiness which was originally in terrestrial paradise and is ultimately to be the lot of redeemed creation  snipe and curlews were wading with jaunty step and absorbed inquiring gaze in the shallow pools  hermitcrabs of several species and sizes were scuttling about searching for convenient shells in which to deposit their naturally homeless and tender tails  overhead there was a sort of searookery the trees being tenanted by numerous gannets frigate birds and ternsthe first gazing with a stupid yet angry air the lastone beautiful little snowwhite species in particularhovering only a few feet above the sketchers heads while their large black eyes scanned the drawings with the owlish look of wisdom peculiar to connoisseurs  noddies also were there and on the ground lizards and spiders and innumerable ants engaged in all the varied activities connected with their several domestic arrangements  altogether it was a scene of bright peaceful felicity which seemed to permeate nigels frame right inward to the spinal marrow and would have kept him entranced there at his work for several hours longer if the cravings of a healthy appetite had not warned him to desist  now kathleen he said rising and stretching himself as one is apt to do after sitting long in a constrained position it seems to me about time toby the way weve forgotten to bring something to eat  his expression as he said this made his companion look up and laugh  plenty cocoanuts she said pointing with her pencil to the overarching trees  true but i doubt my ability to climb these long straight stems besides i have got only a small claspknife which would be but a poor weapon with which to attack the thick outer husk of the nuts  but i have got a few without the husks in the boat said the girl rising and running to the place where the cockleshell had been left  she returned immediately with several nuts divested of their thick outer covering and in the condition with which we are familiar in england some of them were already broken so that they had nothing to do but sit down to lunch  here is one said kathy handing a nut to nigel that has got no meat yet in itonly milk  bore a hole in it and drink but see you bore in the right hole  the right hole echoed the youth are some of them wrong ones  oh yes only one of the three will do  one of our crawbs knows that and has claws that can bore through the husk and shell  we calls him coconut crawb  indeed  that is strange i never heard before of a crab that fed on cocoanuts  this one do  he is very big and also climbs trees  it goes about most at night  perhaps you see one before you go away  the crab to which kathy referred is indeed a somewhat eccentric crustacean besides being unusually large  it makes deep tunnels in the ground larger than rabbit burrows which it lines with cocoanut fibre one of its claws is developed into an organ of extraordinary power with which it can break a cocoanut shell and even it is said a mans limb  it never takes all the husk off a cocoanutthat would be an unnecessary troublebut only enough off the end where the three eyelets are to enable it to get at the inside  having pierced the proper eye with one of its legs it rotates the nut round it until the hole is large enough to admit the point of its great claw with which it continues the work  this remarkable creature also climbs the palmtrees but not to gather nuts that is certain for its habits have been closely watched and it has been ascertained that it feeds only on fallen nuts  possibly it climbs for exercise or to obtain a more extended view of its charming habitat or simply for fun  why not  all this and a great deal more was told to nigel by kathleen who was a bit of a naturalist in her tendenciesas they sat there under the graceful fronds of the palmtrees admiring the exquisite view eating and drinking cocoanuts  i suppose you have plenty of other kinds of food besides this said nigel  oh yes plenty  most of the fish in our lagoon be good for eating and so also the crawbs and we have turtle too  indeed  how do you catch the turtle  another nut pleasethank you  the way we gets turtle is by the men diving for them and catching them in the water  we has pigs tooplenty and the wild birds are some very nice  see note  when the artists had finished they proceeded to the shore and to their surprise and amusement found the cockleshell in possession of a piratical urchin of about four years of age in a charmingly light state of clothing  he was wellknown to kathleen and it turned out that having seen the cockle start at too great a distance to be hailed and having set his heart on joining in the excursion he had watched their movements observed their landing on the isletwhich was not far from the main circlet of landand running round till he came opposite to it swam off and got into the boat  being somewhat tired he had lain down to rest and fallen sound asleep  on the way home this urchins sole delight was to lean over the bow and watch the fish and coralgroves over which they skimmed  in this he was imitated by nigel who ungallantly permitting his companion to row also leaned over the side and gazed down into the clear crystal depths with unwearying delight  for the wonderful colours displayed in those depths must be seen to be believed  not only is the eye pleased with the evervarying formations of the coral bowers but almost dazzled with the glittering fishblue emerald green scarlet orange banded spotted and stripedthat dart hither and thither among the richtoned seaweed and the variegated anemones which spread their tentacles upwards as if inviting the gazer to come down  among these crabs could be seen crawling with undecided motion as if unable to make up their minds while in out of the way crevices clams of a gigantic size were gaping in deadly quietude ready to close with a snap on any unfortunate creature that should give them the slightest touch  nigel was sharply awakened from his dream by a sudden splash  looking up he observed that the small boy was gone  with a bound he stood erect one foot on the gunwale and hands clasped ready to dive when a glance revealed the fact that kathy was smiling broadly  dont jump she said  he is only after a fish  even while she spoke nigel saw the brown little fellow shooting about like a galvanised tadpole with a small harpoon in his hand  next moment he appeared on the surface shouting and spluttering with a splendid fish on the end of his harpoon  both were hauled into the boat and very soon after they drew near to land  in the shallow water nigel observed some remarkable creatures which resembled hedgehogs having jaws armed with formidable teeth to enable them to feed kathy said on coral insects  filefishes also drew his attention particularly  these were magnificently striped and coloured and apparently very fearless  what convenient tails they have to lay hold of remarked our hero as they slowly glided past one i believe i could catch it with my hand  stooping swiftly as he spoke he dipped his arm into the water and actually did grasp the fish by its tail but dropped it again instantlyto the shrieking delight of the urchin and kathyfor the tail was armed with a series of sharp spines which ran into his hand like lancets  this was an appropriate conclusion to a day that would have been otherwise too enjoyable  poor nigels felicity was further diluted when he met his father  well have to sleep aboard tonight said the captain for theres a fair breeze outside which seems likely to hold and the mast has been temporarily rigged up so well have to up anchor and away by break of day tomorrow  nigels heart sank  tomorrow father  ay tomorrow  business first pleasure afterwards  well i suppose you are right but it seems almost a shame to leave such a heaven upon earth as this in such a hurry  besides is it not unkind to such hospitable people to bolt off after youve got all that you want out of them  cant help that lad    dooty first an fun to follow   thats what beats creation hollow  come father dont say that you quote that from mother  no more i do my boy  its my ownhomemade  i put it together last night when i couldnt sleep for your snorin  dont tell fibs father  you know i never snore  butreallyare we to start at daylight  we are if the wind holds  but you may stay as late as you choose on shore tonight  nigel availed himself of the opportunity to see as much of the place and people as was possible in the limited time  next morning the good though damaged brig was running in the direction of sunda straits before a stiff and steady breeze    note 1  we recommend those who desire more curious information on the fauna and flora of the keeling islands to apply to henry o forbes most interesting book a naturalists wanderings in the eastern archipelago published by sampson low    chapter five  captain roy surprises and gratifies his son who surprises a negro and suddenly forms an astonishing resolve  arrived in bataviathe lowlying seaport and capital of the dutch island of javacaptain roy had his brig examined and found that the damage she had sustained was so serious that several months would probably elapse before she would be again ready for sea  now nigel my lad said the old gentleman on the morning after the examination had been made come down below with me i want to have a confabulation with ee  why father said the youth when seated at the small cabin table opposite his rugged parent you seem to be in an unusually solemn frame of mind this morning  has anything happened  nothin boynothin  leastwise nothin in particular  you know all about the brig an what a deal o repair shes got to undergo  of course i do  you know i was present when you talked the matter over with that fellowwhatsisnamethat gave you his report  just so  well now nigel you dont suppose do you that im goin to keep you here for some months knockin about with nothin to doeatin your grub in idleness  certainly not said the youth regarding the stern countenance of his parent with an amused look  i have no intention of acting such an ignoble part and im surprised at you askin the question for you know i am not lazyat least not more so than average active menand there must be plenty of work for me to do in looking after the cargo superintending repairs taking care of the ship and men  i wonder at you father  you must either have had a shock of dotage or fallen into a poetical vein  what is a first mate fit for if  nigel said captain roy interrupting im the owner an commander of the sunshine besides bein the paternal parent of an impertinent son and i claim to have the right to do as i pleasetherefore hold your tongue and listen to me  all right father replied the young man with a benignant grin proceed but dont be hard upon me spare my feelings  well now this is how the land lies said the old seaman resting his elbows on the table and clasping his hands before him  as mr moor and i with the stooard and men are quite sufficient to manage the affairs o the brig and as we shall certainly be here for a considerable time to come ive made up my mind to give you a holiday  youre young you see an foolish and your mind needs improvin  in short you want a good deal o the poetry knocked out o you for its not like your mothers poetry by any means so you neednt flatter yourselfnot built on the same lines by a long way  wellwhere was i  only got the length of the holiday yet father  only indeed  you ungrateful dog  its a considerable length to get that isnt it  well i also intend to give you some money to enable you to move about in this curious archipelagonot much but enough to keep you from starvation if used with economy so i recommend you to go into the town make general inquiries about everything and everywhere an settle in your mind what youll do for i give you a rovin commission an dont want to be bothered with you for some time to come  are you in earnest father asked nigel who had become more interested while the captain unfolded his plan  never more in earnest in my lifeexcept praps when i inquired over twenty years ago whether you was a boy or a girl  well now that is good of you father  of course i need not say that i am charmed at the prospect you open up to me  andand when may i start  at once  up anchor and away tonight if you choose  butwhere  anywhereeverywhere java sumatra borneoall malaysia before you where to choose  now be off and think over it for ive got too much to do to waste time on you at present said the captain rising and staynigel  well said the youth looking back as he was about to leave the cabin  whatever you do dont grow poetical about it  you know it is said somewhere that mischief is found for idle hands to do  all right father  ill keep clear of poetryleave all that sort o nonsense to you  ill    ill flee temptations siren voice   throw poesy to the crows   and let my souls ethereal fire   gush out in sober prose  it need scarcely be said that our hero was not slow to take advantage of the opportunity thus thrown in his way  he went off immediately through the town armed with the introduction of his fathers wellknown name and made inquiries of all sorts of people as to the nature the conditions the facilities and the prospects of travel in the malay archipelago  in this quest he found himself sorely perplexed for the very good reason that all sorts of people having all sorts of ideas and tastes gave amazingly conflicting accounts of the region and its attractions  wearied at last with his researches he sauntered towards afternoon in the direction of the port and began in a listless sort of way to watch the movements of a man who was busily engaged with a boat as if he were making preparations to put to sea  now whatever philosophers may say to the contrary we hold strongly to the opinion that likings and dislikings among men and women and children are the result of some profound occult cause which has nothing whatever to do with experience  no doubt experience may afterwards come in to modify or intensify the feelings but it is not the originating cause if you say it is how are we to account for love at first sight  beauty has nothing necessarily to do with it for men fall in love at first sight with what the world calls plain womenhappily  character is not the cause for love assails the human breast ofttimes before the loved object has uttered a word or perpetrated a smile or even fulminated a glance to indicate character  so in like manner affection may arise between man and man  it was so on this occasion with nigel roy  as he stood abstractedly gazing at the boatman he fell in love with himat least he took a powerful fancy to him and this was all the more surprising that the man was a negroa woollyheaded flatnosed thicklipped nigger  we would not for a moment have it supposed that it is unnatural to love such a man  quite the reverse  but when such a man is a perfect stranger has never uttered a word in ones presence or vouchsafed so much as a glance and is gravely stolidly engaged in the unsavoury work of greasing some of the tackling of a boat it does seem unaccountable that he should be unwittingly capable of stirring up in another mans bosom feelings of ardent goodwill to put it mildly  after watching him for some time nigel under an almost involuntary impulse shouted hullo  hullo replied the negro looking up with a somewhat stern frown and a pout of his thick lips as much as to saywho are you  nigel smiled and made that suggestive motion with his forefinger which signifies come here  the frown fled and the pout became a smile as the negro approached wiping his hands on a piece of cottonwaste  what you want wi me sar he asked  well upon my word said nigel somewhat perplexed i cant very well say  i suppose something must have been in my mind butanyhow i felt a desire to have a talk with you that is if you can spare the time  the first part of this reply induced a slight recurrence of the frown and pout but at its conclusion the black brow cleared and the mouth expanded to such a gumandteethexposing extent that nigel fairly burst into a laugh  yous bery good sar said the man an is hab much pleasure to make your acquaintanceder ant no grease on em now  the last remark had reference to the enormous black paw which he held out  nigel at once grasped it and shook it heartily  is bery fond ob a talk sar continued the negro so as you wants one heabe ahead  thus encouraged our hero began by remarking that he seemed to be preparing for a trip  dats zackly what is adoin sar  a long one  well dat depends on what you call short  goin to sunda straits which praps you know sar is nigh a hundred miles fro here  and what may you be going to do there asked nigel  goin home to krakatoa  why i thought that was an uninhabited island  i passed close to it on my way here and saw no sign of inhabitants  dats cause i was absint fro home  an massa he keeps indoors a good deal  and pray who is massa asked nigel  sar said the negro drawing up his square sturdy frame with a look of dignity fairplay is eberyting wid me  youve ax me a heap o questions  nows my turn  whar you comes fro  from england replied nigel  an whar you go to  well youve posed me now for i really dont know where im going to in fact that is the very thing i have been trying to find out all day so if youll help me ill be much obliged  here nigel explained his position and difficulties and it was quite obvious judging from the glittering eyes and mobile mouth that he poured his tale into peculiarly sympathetic ears  when he had finished the negro stood for a considerable time gazing in meditative silence at the sky  yes he said at last as if communing with himself i tinki aint quite sure but i tinki may ventur  whatever it is you are thinking about remarked nigel you may venture to say anything you like to me  the negro who although comparatively short of stature was herculean in build looked at the youth with an amused expression  youre bery good sar but dats not what is tinkin ob  is tinkin whedder i dar ventur to introdoce you to my massa  hes not fond o company an it might make im angry but he came by a heaby loss lately an praps he may condsend to receibe you  anyhow youd be quite safe for hes sure to be civil to any friend ob mine  is he then so fierce asked nigel becoming interested as well as amused  fierce no hes gentle as a lamb but hes awrful when hes roused tigers crokindiles noceroses is nuffin to him  indeed whats his name and what does he do how does he live  the negro shook his head  das moren i dar tell till i ax his leave sar  i kin only say de peepil around calls im the hermit ob rakata cause he libs by hisself wid me ob course but i counts for nuffin close under de ole volcano ob krakatoa  dey tinksome ob de foolish peepildat he hab sold hisself to de dibil but i knows better  hes a good man and youd hab great fun if you stop wid him now what is agwine to advise you is come wid me an see de hermit if he lets you stop good  if not i fetch you ober to de main land whar you pleasean you kin come back here or go whar you choose  its wort your while to take your chance anyhow  the negro said this with such an earnest look that nigel made up his mind on the spot to accept this curious invitation  ill go he exclaimed with sudden energy  when do you start  tomorrer at daybreak sar  well i shall have to talk it over first with my father but im sure he wont object so you may look out for me here at daybreak  shall i have to fetch any provisions with me for the voyage  no nuffin  boats crammed wi grub  but youd better bring a gun o some sort an a volver an a big knife an a mortal big appetite for a mans no good widout dat  i always carry that about with me said the youth whatever else i may leave behind and ill see to the other thingsby the way whats your name  moses  is that all  isnt dat enuff returned the negro with a look of dignity  quite but i have the advantage of you there moses for i have two namesnigel roy  well i dont see much use ob two but which does you like to be called bynadgel or roy  whichever you please moses ill answer to either  so now goodbye for the present and look out for me tomorrow at daylight  goodbye massa nadgel till tomorrer  the negro waved his hand and sauntering slowly back to his boat remarked in an undertone i lub dat young feller  saying which he resumed his greasing operations  of course captain roy made no objection to his sons proposal though he freely gave his opinion that it was a wildgoose chase  however lad please yourself and youll please me he added and now be particular to bear in mind that youve got to write to me every time you get within hail of a postoffice or a passing ship or steamer that may chance to be comin this way and in each letter be sure to tell me where youre goin to next so as i may send a letter there to you in case i want you to return sudden or otherwise  we mustnt lose touch you see  you neednt write long screeds  i only want to know your whereabouts from time to time  for the restyou can spin it out in yarns when you come back    chapter six  the hermit of rakata introduced  nothing worthy of particular note occurred during the boatvoyage along the northern shore of java to sunda straits  a fair steady breeze wafted them westward and on the morning of the third day they came in sight of the comparatively small uninhabited island of krakatoa  the boat in which they voyaged although a little one had a small portion of the bow decked over so that our hero and his sable friend could find shelter from the night air when disposed to sleep and from the fierce rays of the sun at noon  by the advice of his father nigel had changed his sailor costume for the shoregoin toggery in which he had landed on the keeling islands as being more suitable to his new character as a traveller namely a white cloth cap with a peak in front and a curtain behind to protect his neck a lightgrey tunic belted at the waist and a pair of strong canvas trousers  he had also purchased an oldfashioned doublebarrelled fowlingpiece muzzleloading and with percussion locks  for you see nigel the captain had said its all very well to use breechloaders when youve got towns and railways and suchlike to supply you wi cartridges but when youve got to cruise in outotheway waters theres nothin like the old style  its not difficult to carry a few thousand percussioncaps an a bulletmould about wi you wherever you go  as to powder why youll come across that most everywhere an lead too and for the matter o that if your life depended on it you could shove a handful of gravel or a penknife or toothpick into your gun an blaze away but with a breechloader if you run out o cartridges where are you  so as nigel could not say where he was the percussiongun had been purchased  the peak of rakatathe highest in the islanda little over 2600 feet came in sight first gradually the rest of the island rose out of the horizon and ere long the rich tropical verdure became distinguishable  krakatoadestined so soon to play a thrilling part in the worlds history to change the aspect of the heavens everywhere to attract the wondering gaze of nearly all nations and to devastate its immediate neighbourhoodis of volcanic origin and at the time we write of 1883 was beginning to awaken from a long deep slumber of two hundred years  its last explosion occurred in the year 1680  since that date it had remained quiet  but now the tremendous subterranean forces which had originally called it into being were beginning to reassert their existence and their power  vulcan was rousing himself again and beginning once more to blow his bellows  so said some of the sailors who were constantly going close past the island and through sunda straits which may be styled the narrows of the worlds highway to the china seas  subterranean forces however are so constantly at work more or less violently in those regions that people took little notice of these indications in the comparatively small island of krakatoa which was between five and six miles long by four broad  as we have said it was uninhabited and lying as it does between sumatra and java about sixteen miles from the former and over twenty miles from the latter it was occasionally visited by fishermen  the hermit whom nigel was about to visit might in some sort be counted an inhabitant for he had dwelt there many years but he lived in a cave which was difficult of access and held communication with no one  how he spent his time was a mystery for although his negro servant went to the neighbouring town of anjer in java for supplies and sometimes to batavia as we have seen no piece of inanimate ebony from the forest could have been less communicative than he  indeed our hero was the first to unlock the door of his lips with that key of mysterious sympathy to which reference has already been made  some of the bolder of the young fishermen of the neighbouring coasts had several times made futile efforts to find out where and how the hermit lived but the few who got a glimpse of him at a distance brought back such a report that a kind of superstitious fear of him was generated which kept them at a respectful distance  he was ten feet high some romancers said with shoulders four feet broad a chest like a sugarhogshead and a countenance resembling a compound of orangutan and tiger  of course our hero knew nothing of these rumours and as moses declined to give any information regarding his master beyond that already given he was left to the full play of his imagination  moses was quite candid about it  he made no pretence to shroud things in mystery  you mus know massa nadgel he said as they slowly drew near to the island is fraid ob im dough i lub im  but why do you love him moses  cause he sabe my life an set me free  indeed well that is good reason  and why do you fear him  das what i don know massa replied the negro with a puzzled look  is he harsh then  no  passionate  no  gentle as a lamb  strong  yesoh mighty strong an big  surely youre not afraid of his giving you a licking moses  oh no returned the negro with a smile of expansive benignity is not fraid ob dat  is bin a slabe once got used to lickins  dont care nuffin at all for a lickin  then it must be that youre afraid of hurting his feelings moses for i know of no other kind of fear  praps das it said the negro with a bright look now i wouldnt wonder if yous right massa nadgel  it neber come into my head in dat light before  i used to be tink tinkin ob nightswhen is tired ob countin my fingers an toes  but i couldnt make nuffin ob it  now i knows  its fraid i am ob hurtin his feelins  in the excess of his satisfaction at the solution of this longstanding puzzle moses threw back his head shut his eyes opened his enormous mouth and chuckled  by the time he had reversed this process they were sufficiently near to krakatoa to distinguish all its features clearly and the negro began to point out to nigel its various localities  there were three prominent peaks on it he said named respectively perboewatan about 400 feet high at the northern end of the island danan near the centre 1500 feet and rakata at the southern end over 2600 feet  it was high up on the sides of the last cone that the residence of the hermit was situated  and you wont tell me your masters name said nigel  moses shook his woolly head  no sar no  is fraid ob himhe he i fraid ob hurtin his feelins  well never mind ill find it out from himself soon  by the way what were you telling me about explosions yesterday when that little white gull came to admire your pretty face and took off our attention  well i dun know  not got much to tell only dars bin rumblin an grumblins an heavins lately in de mountains as didnt use to be an cracks like sometin bustin down blow an massa he shook is head two or tree times an look solemn  he dont often do datshook is head i meanfor he mostly always looks solemn  a few minutes later the boat running through a narrow opening among the rocks into a small circular harbour not more than fifty yards in diameter rested its keel gently on a little bed of pure yellow sand the shore there was so densely covered with bushes that the harbour might easily have been passed without being observed  jumping ashore moses made the painter fast to a tree  what a quiet cosy place said nigel as he sprung on the beach and looked admiringly round  yes an not easy to find if you dont knows im  we will leabe de boat hereno danger ob bein tooked awayan den go up to de cave  is it far asked nigel  a good bitnear de top ob de mountain answered the negro who looked at his companion somewhat uneasily  why whats the matter moses  nuffinoh nuffinbutbut when massa axes you who you is an what you bin up to an whar youre agwine to an what wages you want jist you answer im in a sorter permiscuous way an dont be too partikler  wages man what dye mean  well youll scuse me sar returned the negro with an air of profound humility but my massa lost a old sarvinta nigger like myselfonly last munt an he wants to go on one ob his usual expeditions jus now so he sends me to batavia to git anoder mana good one you know says massaan as you sar was good nuff to ax me what you should do an you looked a pritty smart man i  you scoundrel cried nigel interrupting him do you really mean to tell me that youve brought me here as a hired servant  well not zackly returned moses with solemn simplicity you neednt ax no wages unless you like  but what if i dont want to take service demanded our hero with a savage frown  you kin go home agin answered moses humbly  nigel could contain himself no longer  as he observed the mans deprecatory air and thought of his own position he burst into a fit of hearty laughter whereupon the negro recovered himself and smiled the smile of the guiltless  come said nigel at last  lead on you rascal  when i see your master i shall know what to say  all right massa nadgel but mind what you say else i wont answer for de consikences  foller me an look arter your feet for de road is roughish  the negros last remark was unquestionably true for the roadif a mere footpath merits the namewas rugged in the extremehere winding round the base of steep cliffs there traversing portions of luxuriant forest elsewhere skirting the margin of the sea  moses walked at such a pace that nigel young and active though he was found it no easy matter to keep up with him  pride however forbade him to show the slightest sign of difficulty and made him even converse now and then in tones of simulated placidity  at last the path turned abruptly towards the face of a precipice and seemed to terminate in a small shallow cave  any one following the path out of mere curiosity would have naturally imagined that the cave was the termination of it and a very poor termination too seeing that it was a rather uninteresting cave the whole of the interior of which could be seen at a single glance from its mouth  but this cave served in reality as a blind  climbing by one or two projecting points the negro closely followed by nigel reached a narrow ledge and walked along it a short distance  on coming to the end of the ledge he jumped down into a mass of undergrowth where the track again became visiblewinding among great masses of weatherworn lava here the ascent became very steep and moses put on what sporting men call a spurt which took him far ahead of nigel despite the best efforts of the latter to keep up  still our hero scorned to run or call out to his guide to wait and thereby admit himself beaten  he pushed steadily on and managed to keep the active moses in view  presently the negro stepped upon a platform of rock high up on the cliffs where his form could be distinctly seen against the bright sky there nigel observed that he was joined by a man whose tall commanding figure seemed in such a position to be of gigantic proportions  the two stood engaged in earnest conversation while watching nigel  the latter immediately slackened his pace in order at once to recover breath and approach with a leisurely aspect  the wild man of the island i suppose he thought as he drew near but on coming still nearer he saw that he must be mistaken for the stranger who advanced to meet him with gracious ease and selfpossession was obviously a gentleman and dressed not unlike himself in a sort of mixed travelling and shooting costume  i must apologise mr roy for the presumption of my man in bringing you here under something like false pretences said the stranger holding out his hand which nigel shook heartily  moses i find has failed to execute my commission and has partially deceived you but as you are now here the least i can do is to bid you welcome and offer you the hospitality of my roof  there was something so courteous and kindly in the tone and manner of the stranger and something so winning in his soft gentle tones which contrasted strangely with his grand towering figure and massive bearded countenance that nigel felt drawn to him instantly  indeed there was a peculiar and mysterious something about him which quite fascinated our hero as he looked up at him for bordering on six feet though nigel was the stranger stood several inches above him  you are very kind said the visitor and i dont think that moses can fairly be charged with deceiving me although he has been somewhat unwise in his way of going about this business for i had told him i wanted to see something of these regions and perhaps it may be to my advantage to travel in your servicethat is if i can be of any use to you but the time at my disposal may be too limited  how much time have you to spare asked the stranger  well say perhaps three months  that will do returned his questioner looking thoughtfully at the ground  we will talk of this hereafter  butexcuse me said nigel your man spoke of you as a hermita sort ofofforgive mea wildmanoftheisland if i may  no i didnt massa nadgel said the negro the edge of whose flat contradiction was taken off by the extreme humility of his look  well returned nigel with a laugh you at least gave me to understand that other people said something of that sort  das right massa nadgelkite right  youre krect now  people have indeed got some strange ideas about me i believe interposed the hermit with a grave almost sad expression and tone but come let me introduce you to my hermitage and you shall judge for yourself  so saying this singular being turned and led the way further up the rugged side of the peak of rakata  after about five minutes walk in silence the trio reached a spot where there was a clear view over the treetops revealing the blue waters of the strait with the java shores and mountains in the distance  behind them there yawned dark and mysterious a mighty cavern so black and high that it might well suggest a portal leading to the regions below where vulcan is supposed to stir those tremendous fires which have moulded much of the configuration of the world and which are ever seethingan awful infernounder the thin crust of the globe on which we stand  curiouslyformed and largeleaved trees of the tropics with their pendent parasites as well as rank grasses sprouting from below and hanging from above partially concealed this cavern from nigel when he first turned towards it but a few steps further on he could see it in all its rugged grandeur  my home said the hermit with a very slight smile and the air of a prince as he turned towards his visitor and waved his hand towards it  a magnificent entrance at all events said nigel returning the smile with something of dubiety for he was not quite sure that his host was in earnest  follow me said the hermit leading the way down a narrow wellworn path which seemed to lose itself in profound darkness  after being a few minutes within the cavern however nigels eyes became accustomed to the dim light and he perceived that the roof rapidly lowered while its walls narrowed until they reached a spot which was not much wider than an ordinary corridor  here however it was so dark that it was barely possible to see a small door in the righthand wall before which they halted  lifting a latch the hermit threw the door wide open and a glare of dazzling light almost blinded the visitor  passing through the entrance nigel followed his guide and the negro let the heavy door shut behind him with a clang that was depressingly suggestive of a prison  again i bid you welcome to my home said the hermit turning round and extending his hand which nigel mechanically took and pressed but without very well knowing what he did for he was almost dumfounded by what he saw and for some minutes gazed in silence around him  and truly there was ground for surprise  the visitor found himself in a small but immensely high and brilliantly lighted cavern or natural chamber the walls of which were adorned with drawings of scenery and trees and specimens of plants while on various shelves stood innumerable stuffed birds and shells and other specimens of natural history  a table and two chairs stood at one end of the cave and strangest of all a small but wellfilled bookcase ornamented the other end  arabian nights thought nigel  i must be dreaming  his wandering eyes travelled slowly round the cavern until they rested at last on the door by which they had entered beside which stood the negro with a broad grin on his sable visage    chapter seven  wonders of the hermits cave and island  the thing that perhaps surprised nigel most in this strange cavern was the blaze of light with which it was filled for it came down direct through a funnelshaped hole in the high roof and bore a marvellous resemblance to natural sunshine  he was well aware that unless the sun were shining absolutely in the zenith the laws of light forbade the entrance of a direct ray into such a place yet there were the positive rays although the sun was not yet high in the heavens blinding him while he looked at them and casting the shadows of himself and his new friends on the floor  there was the faintest semblance of a smile on the hermits face as he quietly observed his visitor and waited till he should recover selfpossession  as for moseswords are wanting to describe the fields of teeth and gum which he displayed but no sound was suffered to escape his magnificent lips which closed like the slide of a dark lantern when the temptation to give way to feeling became too strong  my cave interests you said the hermit at last  it amazes me returned our hero recovering himself and looking earnestly at his host for you seem not only to have all the necessaries of life around you in your strange abode but many of the luxuries among them the cheering presence of sunshinethough how you manage to get it is beyond my powers of conception  it is simple enough as you shall see returned the hermit  you have heard of the saying no doubt that all things are possible to welldirected labour  yes and that nothing can be achieved without labour  well i have proved that to some extent continued the hermit  you see by the various and miscellaneous implements on my shelves that i am given to dabbling a little in science and thus have made my lonely home as pleasant as such a home can bebut let us not talk of these matters just now  you must be hungry  have you had breakfast  no we have notunless at least you count a sea biscuit dipped in salt water a breakfast  after all that may well be the case for hermits are noted for the frugality of their fare  i am not a genuine hermit remarked his host gravely  men do indeed call me the hermit of rakata because i dwell alone here under the shadow of this particular cone of krakatoa but i do not ape the austere life of the conventional hermit as you see either in my domestic arrangements or food  come your breakfast is ready  from my outlook i saw your boat approaching some hours ago and knew that it was mine so i made ready for your arrival though i did not guess that moses was bringing me a guest instead of a servant  so saying he led the way through a short natural passage to an inner cave the entrance to which like the outer one was boarded  on opening a small door nigel was again greeted as before with brilliant rays of sunshine and in addition with a gush of odours that were exceedingly grateful to a hungry man  a low ho ho behind him told that his black companion was equally gratified  the inner cave or messroom as the host styled it combined diningroom and kitchen for while in one corner stood a deal table with plates cups etcetera but no tablecloth in another stood a small stove heated by an oillamp from which issued puffing and sputtering sounds and the savoury odours above referred to  nigel now perceived that although his strange host necessarily spoke a good deal while welcoming him and offering him the hospitalities of his abode he was by no means communicative  on the contrary it was evident that he was naturally reserved and reticent and that although polite and gentle in the extreme there was a quiet grave dignity about him which discouraged familiarity  it must not be supposed however that he was in any degree morosely silent  he was simply quiet and undemonstrative said little except when asked questions and spoke alike to nigel and moses in the soft low kindly tones with which one might address very young people  going to the stove he took a coffeepot therefrom and set it on the table  at the same time moses without requiring to be told opened the oven and brought forth fried fish meat of some kind and cakes of he knew not what but cared little for their excellence was unquestionable  during the meal that followed nigel ventured as far as politeness permittedindeed a little further if truth must be toldto inquire into the circumstances and motives of his entertainer in taking up his abode in such a strange place but he soon found that his eccentric friend was not one who could be pumped  without a touch of rudeness and in the sweetest of voices he simply assumed an absent manner and changed the subject of discourse when he did not choose to reply by drawing attention to some irrelevant matter or by putting a counter question which led away from the subject  nigel also found that his host never laughed and rarely smiled though when he did so the smile was so slight as merely to indicate a general feeling of urbanity and goodwill and it was followed instantly by a look of gravity if not sadness  altogether the guest was much perplexed about the host at first and somewhat constrained in consequence but gradually he began to feel at ease  another discovery that he soon made was that the hermit treated moses not as a servant but as if he were in all respects an equal and a comrade  after eating for some time in silence and having tried to draw out his host without success nigel changed his tactics and said  you were so kind as to speak of me as your guest mrmri beg pardon may i  my name is van der kemp said the hermit quietly  well mr van der kemp i must tell you that i am quite willing to accept the position for which moses hired me  no i didnt contradicted the negro flatly yet very gently both in tone and manner for long residence with the hermit had apparently imbued him with something of his spirit  well then said nigel the position for which moses should have hired some one else  krect now whispered moses of course i do not intend to ask for or accept wages and also of course i accept the position on the understanding that you think me fit for the service may i ask what that service is to be and where you think of going to  the service returned the hermit slowly and with his eyes fixed on the floor as if pondering his reply is to accompany me as my attendant and companion to take notes as occasion may serve and to paddle a canoe  at this reply our hero almost laughed but was prevented from doing so by his host asking abruptly if he understood canoeing  well yes  at least i can manage what in england is known as the rob roy canoe having possessed one in my boyhood  that will do returned the hermit gravely  can you write shorthand  i can  a friend of mine a reporter on one of the london dailies once gave me a few lessons and becoming fond of the subject i followed it up  that is well you did well  it is of immense advantage to a man whatever his position in life that he should be able to write shorthand with facility  especially useful is it in commerce  i know that having had some experience of commercial life  at this point in the conversation nigel was startled by what was to him an absolutely new sensation namely a shaking or trembling of the whole cavern accompanied by faint rumbling sounds as if in deeper caverns below him  he glanced quickly at his host and at the negro but to his surprise these remarkable men seemed not to be aware of the shaking although it was severe enough to cause some of the furniture to rattle  observing his look of surprise moses remarked with a benignant though capacious smile mountains got de mulligrumps pritty bad jist now  we are pretty well accustomed to that said the host observing that nigel turned to him for an explanation  no doubt you are aware that this region is celebrated for earthquakes and volcanoes so much so that the inhabitants pay little attention to them unless they become unusually violent  this island of krakatoa is itself the fragment of an extinct volcano but the term extinct is scarcely applicable to volcanoes for it is wellknown that many which were for centuries supposed to be extinct have awakened to sudden and violent activityquiescent might be a more appropriate term  yes said moses ceasing to masticate for purposes of speech dem stinkt volcanoes hab got an okard habit ob unstinkin dereselves hereabouts when you don spect it of em  go on massa  i ax yer pardn for truptin  the hermits peculiar goodnatured little smile played for a moment on his massive features and then faded away as he continued  perhaps you may have heard that this is the very heart of the district that has long been recognised as the greatest focus of volcanic activity on the globe  i have heard something of the sort answered nigel but i confess that my knowledge is limited and my mind hazy on the subject  i doubt it not returned his friend for geographical and scientific training in primary schools anywhere is not what it might be  the island of java with an area about equal to that of england contains no fewer than fortynine great volcanic mountains some of which rise to 12000 feet above the sealevel  many of these mountains are at the present time active  yes much too active muttered the negro and more than half of them have been seen in eruption since java was occupied by europeans  hot springs mudvolcanoes and vapourvents abound all over the island whilst earthquakes are by no means uncommon there is a distinct line in the chain of these mountains which seems to point to a great fissure in the earths crust caused by the subterranean fires  this tremendous crack or fissure crosses the straits of sunda and in consequence we find a number of these ventsas volcanic mountains may be styledin the island of sumatra which you saw to the norard as you came along  but there is supposed to be another great crack in the earths crustindicated by several volcanic mountainswhich crosses the other fissure almost at right angles and at the exact point where these two lines intersect stands this island of krakatoa  i emphasise the fact continued the hermit after a pause first because although this has been a quiescent volcano since the year 1680 and people have come to regard it as extinct there are indications now which lead me to believe that its energy is reviving and second because this focus where fissures cross each otherthis krakatoa islandis in reality part of the crater of an older and much larger volcanic mountain which must have been literally blown away in prehistoric times and of which krakatoa and the neighbouring islets of varlaten polish hat lang island and the rest are but the remnants of the great crater ring  if these rumblings and minor earthquakes which i have noticed of lateand the latest of which you have just experiencedare the precursors of another explosion my home here may be rendered untenable  hi exclaimed moses who had been listening with open mouth and eyes to this discourse which was obviously news to him i hope massa he aint agwine to splode todayanyhow not till arter breakfast  you must have studied the subject of volcanoes a good deal i suppose from what you say observed nigel  naturally living as i do almost on the top of one  my library which i will show you presently contains many interesting works on the subject  but come if you have finished we will ascend the peak of rakata and i will introduce you to my sunshine  he rose and led his guest back to the outer cavern leaving moses still busy with knife and fork apparently meditating on the pleasure of breakfasting with the prospect of a possible and immediate explosion  in passing through the first chamber nigel observed in a natural recess the library just referred to  he also noted that besides stuffed birds and other specimens and seashells there were chisels saws hammers and other tools besides something like a forge and carpenters bench in a sidechamber opening out of the large one which he had not at first seenfrom all which he concluded that the hermit was imbued with mechanical as well as scientific and literary tastes  at the further and darker end of the outer cave there was a staircase partly natural and partly improved by art which led upward into profound darkness  let me take your hand here said the hermit looking down upon his guest with his slight but winning smile it is a rough and dark staircase  you will be apt to stumble  nigel placed his hand in that of his host with perfect confidence and with a curious feelingaroused probably by the actionof having returned to the days of childhood  the stair was indeed rugged as well as winding and so pitchy dark that the youth could not have advanced at all without stumbling unless his host had held him all the way  at last a glimmer of light was seen in the distance  it seemed to increase suddenly and in a few moments the two emerged from total darkness into dazzling sunshine  when nigel looked round him he saw that they had gained a plateau high up on the very summit of the mountain which appeared to be absolutely inaccessible by any means save that by which they had reached it  this is what i call my observatory said the hermit turning to his guest  we have passed right through the peak of rakata and reached its northern side which commands as you see a view of all the northern part of the island  i come here often in the night to study the face of the heavens the moon and stars and meditate on their mysterious maker whose ways are indeed wonderful and past finding out but all which must in the nature of things be right  as this was the first mention that the hermit had made of the creator and the reference was one requiring more thought than nigel had yet bestowed on it he made no rejoinder  have you studied astronomy mr roy  noat least not more of it than was needful for navigation  but pray sir do not call me mr roy said the youth with a somewhat embarrassed air  if i am to be your assistant and familiar companion for two or three months i hope that you will agree to call me nigel your man has done so already without asking leave  i will on one condition  and that is  that you also dispense with the mr and sir and call me van der kemp  agreed said nigel though it does not seem so appropriate in me as in you considering the difference of our years  look here said the hermit turning abruptly to a small wooden shed which had hitherto escaped the youths observation so covered was it with overhanging boughs and tropical creeping plants these are my astronomical instruments  he pointed to a table in the hut on which stood several telescopesand microscopes as wellone of the former being a large instrument certainly not less than six feet long with a diameter of apparently six or eight inches  here you see i have the means of investigating the wonders of nature in her grandest as well as her minutest scales  and there he added pointing to a couple of large reflecting mirrors in strong wooden frames erected on joints in such a way that they could be turned in any directionthere you have the secret of my sunshine  one of these mirrors catches the sunshine direct and reflects it on the other which as you see is so arranged that it transmits the rays down the natural funnel or chimney into the cave  by means of chains connected with the mechanism and extending below i can change the direction of the mirrors as the sun changes its place in the sky without requiring to come up here  very ingenious said nigel but how do you manage when the mountain comes between you and the sun as i see it cannot fail to do during some part of the day  simply enough returned the hermit pointing to a distant projecting cliff or peak  on yon summit i have fixed four mirrors similar to these  when the sun can no longer be reflected from this pair the first of the distant mirrors takes it up and shoots a beam of light over here  when the sun passes from that the second mirror is arranged to catch and transmit it and so on to the fourth  after that i bid goodbye to the sun and light my lamp  nigel felt an almost irresistible tendency to smile at this but the grave simplicity of the man forbade such familiarity  look yonder continued the hermit sweeping one of his long arms towards sumatra in that direction runs the line of volcanic disturbancethe fissure of which i have already spoken  focus this telescope to suit your sight  now do you see the little island away there to the norwest  yes  well that is varlaten  i mentioned it when at breakfast  sweep your glass round to the norard the little island there is polish hat and you see lang island in the noreast  these with krakatoa are merely the higher parts still remaining above water of the ring or lip of the ancient crater  this will give you some idea what an enormous mountain the original of this old volcano must have been  this islandmountain is estimated to have been twentyfive miles in circumference and 10000 to 12000 feet high  it was blown into the air in 1680 and this island with the few islets i have pointed out is all that remains of it  now cast your eye down the centre of the island on which we stand you see several cones of various sizes  these are ancient vents supposed to be extinct  but one of them the one furthest away interrupted nigel steadying his telescope on the branch of a tree seems to be anything but extinct for i see a thin column of white smoke or steam rising from it  that is just what i was going to point out  they call that perboewatan  it is the lowest peak on the island about 400 feet high and stands i should say in the very centre of the ancient crater where are the two fissures i have mentioned  for two hundred years perboewatan has not smoked like that and slight though it is at present i cannot help thinking that it indicates an impending eruption especially when i consider that earthquakes have become more numerous of late years and there was one in 1880 which was so violent as to damage seriously the lighthouse on javas first point  then you have resided here for some time said nigel  yes for many years replied the hermit in a low sad tone  but is it wise in you to stay if you think an explosion so likely dont you needlessly run considerable risk  i do not fear to die  nigel looked at his new friend in surprise but there was not a shadow of boastfulness or affectation either in his look or tone  besides he continued the explosion may be but slight and perboewatan is as you see about four miles off  people in the neighbourhood of the straits and passing ships are so accustomed to volcanic explosions on a more or less grand scale that they will never notice this little cloud hanging over krakatoa  those who like myself know the ancient history of the island regard it in a more serious light but we may be wrong  come now we will descend again and have a ramble over part of the island  it will interest you  not many men have penetrated its luxuriant forests or know their secrets  i have wandered through them in all directions and can guide you  indeed moses could do that as well as i for he has lived with me many years come  returning to the cavern they found that the active negro had not only finished his breakfast but had washed the dishes and cleared up the kitchen so that he was quite ready to shoulder a wallet and a gun when his master bade him prepare for a day in the forest  it is not however our intention to follow the trio thither  matters of greater interest if not importance claim our attention at present let it suffice to say therefore that after a most delightful day spent in wandering amongst the luxuriant tropical vegetation with which the island was densely covered visiting one of the extinct craters bathing in one of the numerous hot springs and collecting many objects of interest to the hermit in the shape of botanical and geological specimens they returned in the evening to their cavernhouse not only ready but eager for sustenance and repose    chapter eight  perboewatan becomes moderately violent  the cave was enshrouded in almost total darkness when they entered it but this was quickly dispelled to nigels no little surprise by the rays of a magnificent oillamp which moses lighted and placed on the table in the larger cave  a smaller one of the same kind already illuminated the kitchen  not much conversation was indulged in during the progress of the supper that was soon spread upon the rude table  the three men being uncommonly hungry and powerfully robust found in food a sufficient occupation for their mouths for some time  after supper they became a little but not much more sociable for although nigels active mind would gladly have found vent in conversation he experienced some difficulty in making headway against the discouragement of van der kemps very quiet disposition and the cavernous yawns with which moses displayed at once his desire for slumber and his magnificent dental arrangements  we always retire early to rest after a day of this sort said the hermit at last turning to his guest  do you feel disposed for bed  indeed i do said nigel with a halfsuppressed yawn that was irresistibly dragged out of him by the sight of another earthquake on the negros face  come then i will show you your berth we have no bedrooms here said the hermit with a sort of deprecatory smile as he led the way to the darker end of the cavern where he pointed to a little recess in which there was a pile of something that smelt fresh and looked like heather spread on which there was a single blanket  sailors are said to be indifferent to sheets  you wont miss them i daresay  not in the least returned nigel with a laugh  goodnight he added shaking hands with his host and suppressing another yawn for moses face even in the extreme distance was irresistibly infectious  our hero was indifferent not only to sheets but also in certain circumstances to the usual habiliments of night  indeed while travelling in outoftheway regions he held it to be a duty to undress but partially before turning in so that he might be ready for emergencies  on lying down he found his mattress whatever it was to be a springy luxurious bed and was about to resign himself to slumber when he observed that from the position in which he lay he could see the cavern in all its extent  opening his halfclosed eyes therefore he watched the proceedings of his host and in doing so as well as in speculating on his strange character and surroundings he became somewhat wakeful  he saw that van der kemp returning to the other end of the cave sat down beside the lamp the blaze of which fell full on his fine calm countenance  a motion of his head brought moses to him who sat down beside him and entered into earnest conversation to judge from his gestures for nothing could be heard where nigel lay save the monotonous murmur of their voices  the hermit did not move  except for an occasional inclination of the head he appeared to be a grand classic statue but it was otherwise with the negro  his position in front of the lamp caused him to look if possible even blacker than ever and the blackness was so uniform that his entire profile became strongly pronounced thus rendering every motion distinct and the varied pouting of his huge lips remarkably obvious  the extended left hand too with the frequent thrusting of the index finger of the other into the palm was suggestive of argument and of much reasoning effortif not power  after about halfanhour of conversation moses arose shook his master by the hand appeared to say goodnight very obviously yawned and retired to the kitchen whence in five minutes or so there issued sounds which betokened felicitous repose  meanwhile his master sat motionless for some time gazing at the floor as if in meditation  then he rose went to his bookcase and took down a large thick volume which he proceeded to read  nigel had by that time dropped into a drowsy condition yet his interest in the doings of his strange entertainer was so great that he struggled hard to keep awake and partially succeeded  i wonder he muttered in sleepy tones if thats a ffamly bible hes readingorora volm o the enencyclopida brit  he dropped off at this point but feeling that he had given way to some sort of weakness he struggled back again in to wakefulness and saw that the hermit was bending over the large book with his massive brow resting on the palms of both hands and his fingers thrust into his irongrey hair  it was evident however that he was not reading the book at that moment for on its pages was lying what seemed to be a miniature or photograph case at which he gazed intently  nigel roused himself to consider this and in doing so again dropped offnot yet soundly however for curiosity induced one more violent struggle and he became aware of the fact that the hermit was on his knees with his face buried in his hands  the youths thoughts must have become inextricably confused at this point yet their general drift was indicated by the muttered words  iim glad o thata good signanan its not th encyclop here morpheus finally conquered and he sank into dreamless repose  how long this condition lasted he could not tell but he was awakened violently by sensations and feelings of dread which were entirely new to him  the bed on which he rested seemed to heave under him and his ears were filled by sharp rattling sounds something likeyet very different fromthe continuous roll of musketry  starting up he sprang into the large cavern where he found van der kemp quietly tightening his belt and moses hastily pulling on his boots  sometins busted an no mistake exclaimed the latter  an eruption from one of the cones said the hermit  i have been for a long time expecting it  come with us  he went swiftly up the staircase and passages which led to the observatory as he spoke  the scene that met their eyes on reaching the ledge or plateau was sublime in the extreme as well as terrific  as i thought said van der kemp in a low tone  it is perboewatan that has broken out  the cone from which i observed smoke rising asked nigel  the same  the one over the very centre of the old crater showing that we were wrong in supposing it to be extinct it was only slumbering  it is in what vulcanologists term moderate eruption now and perhaps may prove a safetyvalve which will prevent a more violent explosion  that the cone of perboewatan was indeed in a state of considerable activity worthy of a stronger term than moderate was very obvious although at a distance as we have said of four miles the glare of its fires on the three figures perched near the top of rakata was very intense while explosion after explosion sent molten lava and redhot rocks pumice and dust high into the thickening airclouds of smoke and steam being vomited forth at the same time  the wind of which there was very little blew it all away from the position occupied by the three observers  what if the wind were to change and blow it all this way asked nigel with very pardonable feelings of discomfort  we could return to the cavern said the hermit  but what if rakata itself should become active  it was evident from the very solemn expression on the negros face that he awaited the reply to nigels question with some anxiety  rakata answered the hermit thoughtfully although the highest cone is the one most distant from the great centre of activity  it is therefore not likely that the volcanic energy will seek a vent here while there are other cones between us and perboewatan  but we shall soon see whether the one vent is likely to suffice  there is undoubtedly no diminution in the explosions at present  there certainly was not for the voice of the speaker was almost drowned by the horrible din caused apparently by the hurtling of innumerable fragments of rock and stones in the air while a succession of fiery flashes each followed by a loud explosion lit up the domeshaped mass of vapour that was mounting upwards and spreading over the sky  vivid flashes of lightning were also seen playing around the vapourcolumn at the same time there began a fall of fine white dust resembling snow which soon covered the foliage and the ground of all the lower part of the island  the sea around was also ere long covered with masses of pumice which being very light floated away into the indian ocean and these were afterwards encountered in large quantities by various vessels passing through sunda straits  the scientific committee which ultimately wrote on the details of this eruption in krakatoa mention this first outburst as being a phase of moderate activity similar to that which is said to have been exhibited for some months during the years 1680 and 1681 and they added that the outburst was one of considerable violence especially at its commencement that falls of dust were noticed at the distance of three hundred miles and that the commander of the german warvessel elizabeth estimated the height of the dustcolumn issuing from the volcano at 11 kilometres 36000 feet or about 7 miles  to our hero however and to moses the outburst seemed anything but moderate and that night as they two sat together in the cave after supper listening with awestruck faces to the cannonading and wild musketry going on as it seemed under their very feet the negro solemnly imparted to nigel in a low whisper that he thought de end ob de wurld hab come at last  returning at that moment from his observatory to which he had ascended for a few minutes to view the scene through one of his glasses van der kemp relieved their anxieties somewhat by remarking in his quiet manner that there was a distinct diminution in the violence of the explosions and that from his knowledge and experience of other volcanoes in java sumatra and elsewhere he thought it probable they had seen the worst of it at that time and that none of the other cones would be likely to break out  im glad to hear you say so observed nigel for although the sight is extremely magnificent and very interesting both from a scientific and artistic point of view i cannot help thinking that we should be safer away from this island at presentat least while the volcano is active  the hermit smiled almost pitifully  i do not apprehend danger he said at least nothing unusual  but it happens that my business requires me to leave in the course of a few days at any rate so whether the eruption becomes fiercer or feebler it will not matter to us  i have preparations to make however and i have no doubt you wont object to remain till all is ready for a start  oh as to that returned the youth slightly hurt by the implied doubt as to his courage if you are willing to risk going off the earth like a skyrocket i am quite ready to take my chance of following you  an moses am de man said the negro smiting his broad chest with his fist whats ready to serve as a rocketstick to bof an go up along wid you  the hermit made the nearest approach to a laugh which nigel had yet seen as he left the cave to undertake some of the preparations above referred to    note 1  see the eruption of krakatoa and subsequent phenomena page 11  tribner and company london    chapter nine  describes among other things a singular meeting under peculiar circumstances  there is unquestionably a class of menespecially englishmenwho are deeply imbued with the idea that the universe in general and our world in particular has been created with a view to afford them what they call fun  it would be great fun said an english commercial man to a friend who sat beside him to go and have a look at this eruption  they say it is krakatoa which has broken out after a sleep of two centuries and as it has been bursting away now for nearly a week it is likely to hold on for some time longer  what would you say to charter a steamer and have a grand excursion to the volcano  the friend said he thought it would indeed be capital fun  we have never been able to ascertain who these englishmen were but they must have been men of influence or able to move men of influence for they at once set to work and organised an excursion  the place where this excursion was organised was batavia  although that city was situated in java nearly a hundred miles distant from krakatoa the inhabitants had not only heard distinctly the explosions of the volcano but had felt some quakings of the earth and much rattling of doors and windows besides a sprinkling of ashes which indicated that the eruption even in that eruptive region was of unusual violence they little imagined to what mighty throes the solid rocks of krakatoa were yet to be subjected before those volcanic fires could find a vent meanwhile as we have said there was enough of the unusual in it to warrant our merchants in their anticipation of a considerable amount of fun  a steamer was got ready a number of sightseeing enthusiasts were collected and they set forth on the morning of the 26th of may  among these excursionists was our friend captain david roynot that he was addicted to running about in search of fun but being unavoidably thrown idle at the time and having a poetical turn of mindderived from his wifehe thought he could not do better than take a run to the volcano and see how his son was getting along  the party reached the scene of the eruption on the morning of the 27th having witnessed during the night several tolerably strong explosions which were accompanied by earthquake shocks  it was found that krakatoa and all the adjoining islands were covered with a fine white dust like snow and that the trees on the northern part of the former island and varlaten had been to a great extent deprived of their leaves and branches by falling pumice while those on lang island and polish hat as well as those on the peak of rakata had to a great extent escaped no doubt owing to the prevailing direction of the wind  it was soon seen that perboewatan on krakatoa was the cone in active eruption and the steamer made for its neighbourhood landing her party within a short distance of its base  explosions were occurring at intervals of from five to ten minutes  each explosion being accompanied by an uncovering of the molten lava in the vent the overhanging steamcloud was lighted up with a grand glow for a few seconds  some of the party who seemed to be authorities on such matters estimated that the vapourcolumn rose to a height of nearly 10000 feet and that fragments of pumice were shot upwards to a height of 600 feet  thats a sign that the violence of the eruption is diminished remarked the young merchant who was in search of fun as he prepared to wade ankledeep in the loose pumice up the slopes of the cone  diminished repeated our captain who had fraternised much with this merchant during their short voyage  if thats what you call diminishin i shouldnt like to be here when its increasin  pooh exclaimed the merchant thats nothing  ive seen at other volcanoes pieces of pumice blown up so high that theyve been caught by the upper currents of the atmosphere and carried away in an opposite direction to the wind that was blowing below at the time  ay i believe that dust is sometimes blown miles up into the air  as captain roy thought that the merchant was drawing the long bow he made no reply but changed the subject by asking what was the height of perboewatan  three hundred feet or thereabouts replied his friend  i hope my son will have the sense to clear out of the island if things look like gittin worse muttered the captain as an unusually violent explosion shook the whole side of the cone  no fear of him returned the merchant  if he is visiting the hermit of rakata as you tell me hell be safe enough  although something of a daredevil the hermit knows how to take care of himself  im afraid however that youll not find it so easy to look up your son as you seem to think  just glance round at these almost impenetrable forests you dont know what part of the island he may be in just now and you might as well look for a needle in a bundle of hay as look for him there  he is probably at the other end of krakatoafour or five miles offon the south side of rakata where the hermits cave is supposed to be for no one seems to be quite sure as to its whereabouts  besides youll have to stick by the excursionists if you wish to return to batavia  captain roy paused for a moment to recover breath and looking down upon the dense tropical forest that stretched between him and the peak of rakata he shook his head and admitted that the merchant was right turning round he addressed himself once more to the ascent of the cone on the sides of which the whole excursion party now straggled and struggled remarking as he panted along that hillclimbing among ashes and cinders didnt come easy to a seafarin man  now nothing was more natural than that van der kemp and his guest should be smitten with the same sort of desire which had brought these excursionists from batavia  the only thing that we do not pretend to account for is the strange coincidence that they should have been so smitten and had so arranged their plans that they arrived at perboewatan almost at the same time with the excursionistsonly about half an hour before them  their preliminary walk however through the tangled almost impassable forest had been very slow and toilsome and having been involved in its shadow from daybreak they were of course quite unaware of the approach of the steamer or the landing of the excursion party  if the volcano seems quieting down said nigel to his host shall you start tomorrow  yes by daybreak  even if the eruption does not quiet down i must set out for my business presses  nigel felt much inclined to ask what his business was but there was a quiet something in the air of the hermit when he did not choose to be questioned which effectually silenced curiosity  falling behind a little till the negro came up with him nigel tried to obtain information from him for he felt that he had a sort of right to know at least something about the expedition in which he was about to act a part  do you know moses what business your master is going about he asked in a low voice  no more nor de man ob de moon massa nadgel said moses with an air at once so truthful and so solemn that the young man gave it up with a laugh of resignation  on arriving at perboewatan and ascending its sides they at last became aware of the approach of the excursion steamer  strange muttered the hermit vessels dont often touch here  perhaps they have run short of water suggested nigel  even if they had it would not be worth their while to stop here for that returned the hermit resuming the ascent of the cone after an intervening clump of trees had shut out the steamer from view  it was with feelings of profound interest and considerable excitement that our hero stood for the first time on the top of a volcanic cone and gazed down into its glowing vent  the crater might be described as a huge basin of 3000 feet in diameter from the rim of this basin on which the visitors stood the sides sloped so gradually inward that the flat floor at the bottom was not more than half that in diameter  this floorwhich was about 150 feet below the upper edgewas covered with a black crust and in the centre of it was the tremendous cavitybetween one and two hundred feet in diameter from which issued the great steamcloud  the cloud was mixed with quantities of pumice and fragments of what appeared to be black glass the roar of this huge vent was deafening and stupendous  if the reader will reflect on the wonderful hubbub that can be created even by a kitchen kettle when superheated and on the exasperating shrieks of a steamboats safetyvalve in action or the bellowing of a foghorn he may form some idea of the extent of his incapacity to conceive the thunderous roar of krakatoa when it began to boil over  when to this awful sound there were added the intermittent explosions the horrid crackling of millions of rockmasses meeting in the air and the bubbling up of molten lavaverily it did not require the imagination of a dante to see in all this the very vomiting of gehenna  so amazed and wellnigh stunned was nigel at the sights and sounds that he neither heard nor saw the arrival of the excursionists until the equally awestricken moses touched him on the elbow and drew his attention to several men who suddenly appeared on the craterbrim not fifty yards off but who like themselves were too much absorbed with the volcano itself to observe the other visitors  probably they took them for some of their own party who had reached the summit before them  nigel was yet looking at these visitors in some surprise when an elderly nautical man suddenly stood not twenty yards off gazing in openmouthed amazement past our heros very nose at the volcanic fires  hallo father shouted the one  zounds  nigel exclaimed the other  both men glared and were speechless for several seconds  then nigel rushed at the captain and the captain met him halfway and they shook hands with such hearty goodwill as to arrest in his operations for a few moments a photographer who was hastily setting up his camera  yes science has done much to reveal the marvellous and arouse exalted thoughts in the human mind but it has also done something to crush enthusiasts and shock the romantic  veracity constrains us to state that there he was with his tripod and his eager haste and his hideous black cloth preparing to take perboewatan on a dry plate  and he took it too  and you may see it if you will as a marvellous frontispiece to the volume by the krakatoa committeea work which is apparently as exhaustive of the subject of krakatoa as was the great explosion itself of those internal fires which will probably keep that volcano quiet for the next two hundred years  but this was not the great eruption of krakatoaonly a rehearsal as it were  what brought you here my son asked the captain on recovering speech  my legs father  dont be insolent boy  its not insolence father  its only poetical licence meant to assure you that i did not come by bus or rail though you did by steamer  but let me introduce you to my friend mr   he stopped short on looking round for van der kemp was not there  he hoed away wheneber he saw de peepil comin up de hill said moses who had watched the meeting of father and son with huge delight  but you kin interdooce me instead he added with a craterlike smile  true true exclaimed nigel laughing  this is moses father my hosts servant and my very good friend and a remarkably freeandeasy friend as you see  he will guide us back to the cave since van der kemp seems to have left us  whos van der kemp asked the captain  the hermit of rakata fatherthats his name  his father was a dutchman and his mother an english or irish womani forget which  hes a splendid fellow quite different from what one would expect no more like a hermit than a hermitcrab except that he lives in a cave under the peak of rakata at the other end of the island  but you must come with us and pay him a visit  he will be delighted to see you  what steer through a green sea of leaves like that said the captain stretching his arm towards the vast forest that lay stretched out below them and on my legs too that have been used all their lives to a ships deck  no my son  i will content myself with this lucky meetin  but i say nigel lad continued the old man somewhat more seriously what if the peak o rakata whats is name should take to spoutin like this one an you as you say livin under it  ha das zackly what i say interposed moses  das what i oftin says to massa but he nebber answers  he only smile  massas not always so purlite as he might be  there is no fear said nigel not at present anyhow for van der kemp says that the force of this eruption is diminishing  it dont look much like it muttered the captain as the volcano at that moment gave vent to a burst which seemed like a sarcastic laugh at the hermits opinion and sent the more timid of the excursionists sprawling down the cinderslope in great alarm  theres reason in what you say father said nigel when the diminution of noise rendered speech more easy and after all as we start off on our travels tomorrow your visit could not have been a long one  where do you go first asked the captain  not sure  do you know moses  no no moren de man ob de moon  praps borneo  he go dar sometimes  at this point another roar from the volcano and a shout from the leader of the excursionists to return on board broke up the conference  well lad im glad ive seen you  dont forget to write your whereabouts  they say theres a lot o wild places as well as wild men and beasts among them islands so keep your weathereye open an your powder dry  goodbye nigel  take care of him moses and keep him out o mischief if ye canwhich is more than ever i could  goodbye my boy  goodbye father  they shook hands vigorously  in another minute the old seaman was sailing down the cindercone at the rate of fourteen knots an hour while his son setting off under the guidance of moses towards a different point of the compass was soon pushing his way through the tangled forest in the direction of the hermits cave    chapter ten  a curious seagoing craftthe unknown voyage begun  it was early next morning when van der kemp and his man left their couches and descended to the shore leaving their visitor enjoying the benefit of that profound slumber which bids defiance to turmoil and noise however stupendous and which seems to be the peculiar privilege of healthy infants and youthful seamen  perboewatan had subsided considerably towards morning and had taken to that internal rumbling which in the feline species indicates mitigated indignation  the hermit had therefore come to the conclusion that the outburst was over and went with moses to make arrangements for setting forth on his expedition after breakfast  they had scarcely left the cave when nigel awoke  feeling indisposed for further repose he got up and went out in that vague state of mind which is usually defined as having a look at the weather  whether or not he gathered much information from the look we cannot tell but taking up his short gun which stood handy at the entrance of the cave he sauntered down the path which his host had followed a short time before  arrived at the shore he observed that a branch path diverged to the left and appeared to run in the direction of a high precipice he turned into it and after proceeding through the bushes for a short way he came quite unexpectedly on a cavern the mouth of which resembled but was much higher and wider than that which led to the hermits home  just as he approached it there issued from its gloomy depths a strange rumbling sound which induced him to stop and cock his gun  a curious feeling of seriocomic awe crept over him as the idea of a fiery dragon leaped into his mind  at the same time the fancy that the immense abyss of darkness might be one of the volcanic vents diminished the comic and increased the serious feeling  ere long the sound assumed the definite tone of footsteps and the dragon fancy seemed about to become a reality when he beheld a long narrow thing of uncertain form emerging from the darkness  it must be coming out tailforemost he muttered with a short laugh at his semicredulity  another instant and the hermit emerged into the blazing sunshine and stood pictured against the intense darkness like a being of supernatural radiance with the end of a long narrow canoe on his shoulder  as nigel passed round a bush to reach him he perceived the dark form of moses emerging from the depths and supporting the body of the canoe  i see you are active and an early riser said the hermit with a nod of approval on seeing our hero  i almost took you for a krakatoa monster said nigel as they came out in front of the cavern and laid the canoe on the ground  why youve got here one of the craft which we in england call a rob roy canoe  it is fashioned on the same pattern said the hermit but with one or two alterations of my own devising and an improvementas i think founded on what i have myself seen when travelling with the eskimos of greenland  van der kemp here pointed out that the canoe was not only somewhat broader than the kind used in england but was considerably longer and with three openings or manholes in the deck so that it was capable of holding three persons  also that there was a large rounded mass of wood fixed in front of the three manholes  these saddles as i call them said the hermit have been suggested to me by the eskimos who instead of wearying their arms by supporting the doublebladed paddle continuously rest it on the saddle and let it slide about thereon while being used  thus they are able to carry a much longer and heavier paddle than that used in the rob roy canoe the weight of which as it rests on the saddle is not felt  moreover it does not require nearly so much dip to put it in the water  i have heard of a sort of upright with a universal joint being applied to the english canoe but it seems to me a much more clumsy and much less effective because rigid contrivance than the eskimo saddle  inside under the deck as i will show you by and by i have lighter and shorter paddles for use when in narrow rivers but i prefer the long heavy paddle when traversing great stretches of ocean  you dont mean to say you ever go to sea in an eggshell like that exclaimed nigel in surprise  indeed we do returned the hermit and we are fitted out for longish voyages and rough weather  besides it is not so much of an eggshell as you suppose  i made it myself and took care that it should be fit for the work required of it  the wood of which it is made although light is very tough and it is lined with a skin of strong canvas which is fixed to the planks with tar  this makes the craft watertight as well as strong  the ribs also are very light and close together and every sixth rib is larger and longer than the others and made of tougher wood all these ribs are bound together by longitudinal pieces or laths of very tough wood yet so thin that the whole machine is elastic without being weak  besides this there are two strong oiledcanvas partitions which divide the canoe into three watertight compartments any two of which will float it if the third should get filled  is this then the craft in which you intend to voyage asked nigel  it is  we shall start in an hour or two  i keep it in this cave because it is near the landingplace  but come you will understand things better when you see us making our arrangements  of course you understand how to manage sails of every kind  if i did not it would ill become me to call myself a sailor returned our hero  that is well because you will sit in the middle from which position the sail is partly managed  i usually sit in the bow to have free range for the use of my gun if need be and moses steers  van der kemp proceeded down the track as he said this having with the negro again lifted the canoe on his shoulder  a few minutes walk brought them to the beach at the spot where nigel had originally landed  here a quantity of cargo lay on the rocks ready to be placed in the canoe  there were several small bags of pemmican which van der kemp had learned to make while travelling on the prairies of north america among the red indiansfor this singular being seemed to have visited most parts of the habitable globe during his not yet very long life  there were five small casks of fresh water two or three canisters of gunpowder a small box of tea and another of sugar besides several bags of biscuits  there were also other bags and boxes which did not by their appearance reveal their contents and all the articles were of a shape and size which seemed most suitable for passing through the manholes and being conveniently distributed and stowed in the three compartments of the canoe  there was not very much of anything however so that when the canoe was laden and ready for its voyage the hermit and his man were still able to raise and carry it on their shoulders without the assistance of nigel  there was one passenger whom we have not yet mentioned namely a small monkey which dwelt in the cave with the canoe and which although perfectly free to come and go when he pleased seldom left the cave except for food but seemed to have constituted himself the guardian of the little craft  spinkie as moses had named him was an intensely affectionate creature with a countenance of pathetic melancholy which utterly belied his character for mischief and fun were the dominating qualities of that monkey  he was seated on a watercask when nigel first caught sight of him holding the end of his long tail in one hand and apparently wiping his nose with it  is that what he is doing asked nigel of the negro  oh no massa nadgel said moses  spinkie nebber ketch cold an hab no need ob a pockethangkitcher  he only tickles his nose wid is tail  but hes bery fond ob doin dat  being extremely fond of monkeys nigel went forward to fondle him and spinkie being equally fond of fondling resigned himself placidlyafter one interrogative gaze of wideeyed suspicioninto the strangers hands  a lifelong friendship was cemented then and there  after stowing the cargo the party returned to the upper cavern leaving the monkey to guard the canoe  an hes a good defender ob it said moses for if man or beast happen to come near it when spinkies in charge dat monkey sets up a skriekin fit to cause a splosion ob perboewatan  breakfast over the hermit put his cave in order for a pretty long absence and they again descended to the shore each man carrying his bed on his shoulder  each bed however was light and simple  it consisted merely of one blanket wrapped up in an oilcloth sheet besides an oldfashioned powderflask and shot belt  van der kemp and nigel had slung a bulletpouch on their shoulders and carried small hatchets and huntingknives in their belts  moses was similarly armed with this difference that his couteau de chasse bore stronger resemblance to an ancient roman sword than a knife and his axe was of larger size than the hatchets of his companions  launching the canoe the hermit and his man held it fast at either end while nigel was directed to take his place in the central of the three openings or manholes  he did so and found himself seated on a flat board on the bottom of the canoe which was so shallow that the deck scarcely rose as high as his waist  round the manhole there was a ledge of thin wood about three inches high to which a circular apron of oiledcanvas was attached  yes youd better understand that thing before we start said van der kemp observing that nigel was examining the contrivance with some curiosity  its an apron to tie round you in bad weather to keep the water out  in fine weather it is rolled as you see it now round the ledge  undo the buckle before and behind and you will see how it is to be used  acting as directed nigel unbuckled the roll and found that he was surrounded by a sort of petticoat of oilskin which could be drawn up and buckled round his chest  in this position it could be kept by a loop attached to a button or a wooden pin thrust through the coat  you see explained the hermit the waves may wash all over our deck and round our bodies without being able to get into the canoe while we have these things onthere are similar protections round the other holes  i understand said nigel  but how if water gets in through a leak below  do you see that brass thing in front of you returned the hermit that is a pump which is capable of keeping under a pretty extensive leak  the handle unships so as to be out of the way when not wanted i keep it here under the deck in front of me along with mast and sails and a good many other things  as he spoke he raised a plank of the deck in front of the foremost hole and disclosed a sort of narrow box about six feet long by six inches broad  the plank was hinged at one end and fastened with a hook at the other so as to form a lid to the box  the hole thus disclosed was not an opening into the interior of the canoe but was a veritable watertight box just under the deck so that even if it were to get filled with water not a drop could enter the canoe itself  but the planklid was so beautifully fitted besides shutting tightly down on indiarubber that the chance of leakage through that source was very remote  although very narrow this box was deep and contained a variety of useful implements among them a slender mast and tiny sail which could be rendered still smaller by means of reefpoints  all these things were fitted into their respective places with so keen an eye to economy of space that the arrangement cannot be better described than by the familiar phrasemultum in parvo  we dont use the sails much we depend chiefly on this said the hermit as he seated himself in the front hole and laid the long heavy doublebladed paddle on the saddle in front of him  moses uses a singleblade partly because it is handier for steering and partly because he has been accustomed to it in his own land  you are at liberty to use which you prefer  thanks i will follow the lead of moses for i also have been accustomed to the singleblade and prefer itat least while i am one of three  if alone i should prefer the doubleblade  now moses are you ready asked the hermit  all ready massa  get in then and shove off  come along spinkie  the monkey which all this time had been seated on a rock looking on with an expression of inconsolable sorrow at once accepted the invitation and with a lively bound alighted on the deck close to the little mast which had been set up just in front of nigel and to which it held on when the motions of the canoe became unsteady  you need not give yourself any concern about spinkie said the hermit as they glided over the still water of the little cove in which the canoe and boat were harboured  he is quite able to take care of himself  rounding the entrance to the cove and shooting out into the ocean under the influence of van der kemps powerful strokes they were soon clear of the land and proceeded eastward at a rate which seemed unaccountable to our hero for he had not sufficiently realised the fact that in addition to the unusual physical strength of van der kemp as well as that of moses to say nothing of his own the beautiful fishlike adaptation of the canoe to the water the great length and leverage of the bowpaddle and the weight of themselves as well as the cargo gave this canoe considerable advantage over other craft of the kind  about a quarter of an hour later the sun arose in cloudless splendour on a perfectly tranquil sea lighted up the shores of java glinted over the mountains of sumatra and flooded as with a golden haze the forests of krakatoaemulating the volcanic fires in gilding the volumes of smoke that could be seen rolling amid fitful mutterings from perboewatan until the hermits home sank from view in the western horizon    chapter eleven  canoeing on the seaa mysterious nightsurprise and sudden flight  at first the voyagers paddled over the glassy sea in almost total silence  nigel was occupied with his own busy thoughts speculating on the probable end and object of their voyage and on the character the mysterious life and unknown history of the man who sat in front of him wielding so powerfully the great doublebladed paddle  van der kemp himself was as we have said naturally quiet and silent save when roused by a subject that interested him  as for moses although quite ready at any moment to indulge in friendly intercourse he seldom initiated a conversation and spinkie grasping the mast and leaning against it with his head down seemed to be either asleep or brooding over his sorrows  only a few words were uttered now and then when nigel asked the name of a point or peak which rose in the distance on either hand  it seemed as if the quiescence of sea and air had fallen like a soft mantle on the party and subdued them into an unusually sluggish frame of mind  they passed through the sunda straits between sumatra and javanot more at the narrowest part than about thirteen miles wideand in course of time found themselves in the great islandstudded archipelago beyond  about noon they all seemed to wake up from their lethargic state  van der kemp laid down his paddle and looking round asked nigel if he felt tired  not in the least he replied but i feel uncommonly hungry and i have just been wondering how you manage to feed when at sea in so small a craft  ho ho laughed moses in guttural tones you soon see dati spose it time for me to get out de grub massa  yes moseslets have it  the negro at once laid down his steering paddle and lifted a small square hatch or lid in the deck which was rendered watertight by the same means as the lid in front already described  from the depths thus revealed he extracted a bird of some sort that had been shot and baked the day before  tearing off a leg he retained it and handed the remainder to nigel  help youself massa nadgel an pass im forward  without helping himself he passed it on to van der kemp who drew his knife sliced off a wing with a mass of breast and returned the rest  always help yourself before passing the food in future said the hermit we dont stand on ceremony here  nigel at once fell in with their custom tore off the remaining drumstick and began  biskit said moses with his mouth full an look out for spinkie  he handed forward a deep tray of the sailors familiar food but nigel was too slow to profit by the warning given for spinkie darted both hands into the tray and had stuffed his mouth and cheeks full almost before a man could wink  the negro would have laughed aloud but the danger of choking was too great he therefore laughed internallyan operation which could not be fully understood unless seen  splosions of perboewatan may suggest the thing  sorrow griefwhatever it was that habitually afflicted that monkey disappeared for the time being while it devoted itself heart and soul to dinner  feelings of a somewhat similar kind animated nigel as he sat leaning back with his mouth full a biscuit in one hand and a drumstick in the other and his eyes resting dreamily on the horizon of the still tranquil sea while the bright sun blazed upon his already bronzed face  to many men the fierce glare of the equatorial sun might have proved trying but nigel belonged to the salamander type of humanity and enjoyed the great heat  van der kemp seemed to be similarly moulded and as for moses he was in his native elementso was spinkie  strange as it may seem seabirds appeared to divine what was going on for several specimens came circling round the canoe with great outstretched and all but motionless wings and with solemn sidelong glances of hope which van der kemp evidently could not resist for he flung them scraps of his allowance from time to time  if you have plenty of provisions on board i should like to do that too said nigel  do it returned the hermit  we have plenty of food for some days and our guns can at any time replenish the store  i like to feed these creatures he added they give themselves over so thoroughly to the enjoyment of the moment and seem to be grateful  whether they are so or not of course is matter of dispute  cynics will tell us that they only come to us and fawn upon us because of the memory of past favours and the hope of more to come  i dont agree with them  neither do i said nigel warmly  any man who has ever had to do with dogs knows full well that gratitude is a strong element of their nature  and it seems to me that the speaking eyes of spinkie to whom i have just given a bit of biscuit tell of a similar spirit  as he spoke nigel was conveying another piece of biscuit to his own mouth when a small brown hand flashed before him and the morsel in the twinkling of an eye was transferred to the monkeys already swollen cheekwhereat moses again became suddenly splosive and red as well as black in the face for his capacious mouth was inordinately full as usual  clear water from one of the casks and poured into a tin mug washed down their cold collation and then refreshed and reinvigorated the trio resumed their paddles which were not again laid down till the sun was descending towards the western horizon  by that time they were not far from a small wooded islet near the coast of java on which van der kemp resolved to spend the night  during the day they had passed at some distance many boats and prahus and other native vessels the crews of which ceased to row for a few moments and gazed with curiosity at the strange craft which glided along so swiftly and seemed to them little more than a long plank on the water but these took no further notice of our voyagers  they also passed several shipspart of that constant stream of vessels which pass westward through those straits laden with the valuable teas and rich silks of china and japan  in some cases a cheer of recognition as being an exceptional style of craft was accorded them to which the hermit replied with a wave of the handmoses and nigel with an answering cheer  there is something very pleasant in the rest which follows a day of hard and healthful toil  our maker has so ordained it as well as stated it for is it not written the sleep of the labouring man is sweet and our travellers experienced the truth of the statement that night in very romantic circumstances  the small rocky islet not more than a few hundred yards in diameter which they now approached had several sheltered sandy bays on its shore which were convenient for landing  the centre was clothed with palmtrees and underwood so that fuel could be procured and cocoanuts  sometimes said the hermit while he stooped to arrange the fire after the canoe and cargo had been carried to their campingplace at the edge of the bushessometimes it is necessary to keep concealed while travelling in these regions and i carry a little spiritlamp which enables me to heat a cup of tea or coffee without making a dangerous blaze but here there is little risk in kindling a fire  i should not have thought there was any risk at all in these peaceful times said nigel as he unstrapped his blanket and spread it on the ground under an overhanging bush  there are no peaceful times among pirates returned the hermit and some of the traders in this archipelago are little better than pirates  where i puts your bed massa asked moses turning his huge eyes on his master  thereunder the bush beside nigel  an where would you like to sleep massa spinkie added the negro with a low obeisance to the monkey which sat on the top of what seemed to be its favourite seata watercask  spinkie treated the question with calm contempt turned his head languidly to one side and scratched himself  unpurliteness is your kracter from skin to marrow you son of a insolent mother said moses shaking his fist whereat spinkie promptly making an o of his mouth looked fierce  the sagacious creature remained where he was till after supper which consisted of another roast fowlhot this timeand shipsbiscuit washed down with coffee  of course spinkies portion consisted only of the biscuit with a few scraps of cocoanut  having received it he quietly retired to his native wilds with the intention of sleeping there according to custom till morning but his repose was destined to be broken as we shall see  after supper the hermit stretching himself on his blanket filled an enormous meerschaum and began to smoke  the negro rolling up a little tobacco in tissue paper sat down tailorwise and followed his masters example while our herowho did not smokelay between them and gazed contemplatively over the fire at the calm dark sea beyond enjoying the aroma of his coffee  from what you have told me of your former trading expeditions said nigel looking at his friend you must have seen a good deal of this archipelago before you tookexcuse meto the hermit life  aya good deal  have you ever travelled in the interior of the larger islands asked nigel in the hope of drawing from him some account of his experiences with wild beasts or wild menhe did not care which so long as they were wild  yes in all of them returned the hermit curtly for he was not fond of talking about himself  i suppose the larger islands are densely wooded continued nigel interrogatively  they are very  but the wood is not of much value i fancy in the way of trade pursued our hero adopting another line of attack which proved successful for van der kemp turned his eyes on him with a look of surprise that almost forced him to laugh  not of much value in the way of trade he repeatedforgive me if i express surprise that you seem to know so little about usbut after all the world is large and one cannot become deeply versed in everything  having uttered this truism the hermit resumed his meerschaum and continued to gaze thoughtfully at the embers of the fire  he remained so long silent that nigel began to despair but thought he would try him once again on the same lines  i suppose he said in a careless way that none of the islands are big enough to contain many of the larger wild animals  my friend returned van der kemp with a smile of urbanity as he refilled his pipe it is evident that you do not know much about our archipelago  borneo to the woods and wild animals of which i hope ere long to introduce you is so large that if you were to put your british islands including ireland down on it they would be engulfed and surrounded by a sea of forests  new guinea is perhaps larger than borneo  sumatra is only a little smaller  france is not so large as some of our islands  java luzon and celebes are each about equal in size to ireland  eighteen more islands are on the average as large as jamaica more than a hundred are as large as the isle of wight and the smaller isles and islets are innumerable  in short our archipelago is comparable with any of the primary divisions of the globe being full 4000 miles in length from east to west and about 1300 in breadth from north to south and would in extent more than cover the whole of europe  it was evident to nigel that he had at length succeeded in opening the floodgates  the hermit paused for a few moments and puffed at the meerschaum while moses glared at his master with absorbed interest and pulled at the cigarette with such oblivious vigour that he drew it into his mouth at last spat it out and prepared another  nigel sat quite silent and waited for more  as to trade continued van der kemp resuming his discourse in a lower tone why of goldthe great representative of wealthwe export from sumatra alone over 26000 ounces annually and among other gold regions we have a mount ophir in the malay peninsula from which there is a considerable annual export  continuing his discourse van der kemp told a great deal more about the products of these prolific islands with considerable enthusiasmas one who somewhat resented the underrating of his native land  were you born in this region van der kemp asked nigel during a brief pause  i wasin java  my father as my name tells was of dutch descent  my mother was irish  both are dead  he stopped  the fire that had been aroused seemed to die down and he continued to smoke with the sad absent look which was peculiar to him  and what about large game asked nigel anxious to stir up his friends enthusiasm again but the hermit had sunk back into his usual condition of gentle dreaminess and made no answer till the question had been repeated  pardon me he said i was dreaming of the days that are gone  ah nigel you are yet too young to understand the feelings of the oldthe sad memories of happy years that can never return of voices that are hushed for ever  no one can know till he has felt  but you are not old said nigel wishing to turn the hermits mind from a subject on which it seemed to dwell too constantly  not in years he returned but old very old in experience and stay what was it that you were asking about  ah the big game  well we have plenty of that in some of the larger of the islands we have the elephant the rhinoceros the tiger the puma that great manmonkey the orangutan or as it is called here the mias besides wild pigs deer and innumerable smaller animals and birds  the hermit stopped abruptly and sat motionless with his head bent on one side like one who listens intently  such an action is always infectious  nigel and the negro also listened but heard nothing  by that time the fire had died down and not being required for warmth had not been replenished  the faint light of the coming moon which however was not yet above the horizon only seemed to render darkness visible so that the figure of moses was quite lost in the shadow of the bush behind him though the whites of his solemn eyes appeared like two glowworms  do you hear anything asked nigel in a low tone  oars answered the hermit  i hear im massa whispered the negro but das not suprisin plenty boats about  this boat approaches the island and i can tell by the sound that it is a large prahu  if it touches here it will be for the purpose of spending the night and malay boatmen are not always agreeable neighbours  however it is not likely they will ramble far from where they land so we may escape observation if we keep quiet  as he spoke he emptied the remains of the coffee on the dying fire and effectually put it out  meanwhile the sound of oars had become quite distinct and as had been anticipated the crew ran their boat into one of the sandy bays and leaped ashore with a good deal of shouting and noise  fortunately they had landed on the opposite side of the islet and as the bush on it was very dense there was not much probability of any one crossing over  our voyagers therefore lay close resolving to be off in the morning before the unwelcome visitors were stirring  as the three lay there wrapped in their blankets and gazing contemplatively at the now risen moon voices were heard as if of men approaching  it was soon found that two of the strangers had sauntered round by the beach and were slowly drawing near the encampment  nigel observed that the hermit had raised himself on one elbow and seemed to be again listening intently  the two men halted on reaching the top of the ridges of rock which formed one side of the little bay and their voices became audible though too far distant to admit of words being distinguishable  at the same time their forms were clearly defined against the sky  nigel glanced at van der kemp and was startled by the change that had come over him  the moonbeams which had by that time risen above some intervening shrubs shone full on him and showed that his usually quiet gentle countenance was deadly pale and transformed by a frown of almost tigerlike ferocity  so strange and unaccountable did this seem to our hero that he lay quite still as if spellbound  nor did his companions move until the strangers having finished their talk turned to retrace their steps and finally disappeared  then van der kemp rose with a sigh of relief  the negro and nigel also sprang up  whats wrong massa asked moses in much anxiety  nothing nothing said the hermit hurriedly  i must cross over to see these fellows  all right massa  i go wid you  no i go alone  not widout arms exclaimed the negro laying his hand on his masters shoulder  yes without arms  as he spoke he drew the long knife that usually hung at his girdle and flung it down  now attend both of you he added with sudden and almost threatening earnestness  do not on any account follow me  i am quite able to take care of myself  next moment he glided into the bushes and was gone  can you guess what is the matter with him asked nigel turning to his companion with a perplexed look  not more nor de man ob de moon  i nebber sawd im like dat before  i tink hes go mad  i tell you whatill foller him wid a rifle an knife and two revolvers  youll do nothing of the sort said nigel laying hold of the negros wrist with a grip of iron when a man like van der kemp gives an order its the duty of inferior men like you and me strictly to obey  wellpraps youre right nadgel returned moses calmly  if you wasnt id knock you into de middle ob nixt week for takin a grip o me like dat  youll wish yourself into the middle of next fortnight if you disobey orders returned our hero tightening the grip  moses threw back his head opened his cavern and laughed silently at the same time he twisted his arm free with a sudden wrench  yous awrful strong nadgel but you dont quite come up to niggers howseber yous right  ill obey orders neberdeless ill get ready for action  so saying the negro extracted from the canoe several revolvers two of which he handed to nigel two he thrust into his own belt and two he laid handy for massa when he should return  now if youre smart at aritmetic youll see dat six time six am tirtysix and two double guns das fortyforty dead mens moren enuffbesides de knives  moses had barely finished these deadly preparations when van der kemp returned as quietly as he had gone  his face was still fierce and haggard and his manner hurried though quite decided  i have seen him he said in a low voice  seen who asked nigel  him whom i had hoped and prayed never more to see  my enemy  come quick we must leave at once and without attracting their notice  he gave his comrades no time to put further questions but laid hold of one end of the canoe moses took the other end and it was launched in a few seconds while nigel carried down such part of the lading as had been taken out  five minutes sufficed to put all on board and that space of time was also sufficient to enable spinkie to observe from his retreat in the bushes that a departure was about to take place he therefore made for the shore with all speed and bounded to his accustomed place beside the mast  taking their places they pushed off so softly that they might well have been taken for phantoms  a cloud conveniently hid the moon at the time each man plied his paddle with noiseless but powerful stroke and long before the cloud uncovered the face of the queen of night they were shooting far away over the tranquil sea    chapter twelve  weathering a storm in the open sea  in profound silence they continued to paddle until there was no chance of their being seen by the party on the islet  then van der kemp rested his paddle in front of him and looked slowly round the horizon and up at the sky as if studying the weather  nigel longed to ask him more about the men they had seen and of this enemy whom he had mentioned but there was that in the hermits grave look which forbade questioning and indeed nigel now knew from experience that it would be useless to press him to speak on any subject in regard to which he chose to be reticent  i dont like the look of the sky he said at last  we are going to have a squall i fear  had we not better run for the nearest land said nigel who although not yet experienced in the signs of the weather in those equatorial regions had quite enough of knowledge to perceive that bad weather of some sort was probably approaching  the nearest island is a good way off returned the hermit and we might miss it in the dark for daylight wont help us yet awhile  no we will continue our course and accept what god sends  this remark seemed to our hero to savour of unreasoning contempt of danger for the facing of a tropical squall in such an eggshell appeared to him the height of folly  he ventured to reply therefore in a tone of remonstrance  god sends us the capacity to appreciate danger van der kemp and the power to take precautions  he does nigeltherefore i intend to use both the capacity and the power  there was a tone of finality in this speech which effectually sealed nigels lips and in truth his everincreasing trust in the wisdom power and resource of his friend indisposed him to further remark  the night had by this time become intensely dark for a bank of black cloud had crept slowly over the sky and blotted out the moon  this cloud extended itself slowly obliterating ere long most of the stars also so that it was scarcely possible to distinguish any object more than a yard or two in advance of them  the dead calm however continued unbroken and the few of heavens lights which still glimmered through the obscurity above were clearly reflected in the great black mirror below  only the faint gleam of krakatoas threatening fires was visible on the horizon while the occasional boom of its artillery sounded in their ears  it was impossible for any inexperienced man however courageous to avoid feelings of awe almost amounting to dread in the circumstances and nigelas he tried to penetrate the darkness around him and glanced at the narrow craft in which he sat and over the sides of which he could dip both hands at once into the seamight be excused for wishing with all his heart that he were safely on shore or on the deck of his fathers brig  his feelings were by no means relieved when van der kemp said in a low soliloquising tone  the steamers will constitute our chief danger tonight  they come on with such a rush that it is not easy to make out how they are steering so as to get out of their way in time  but should we not hear them coming a long way off asked nigel  ay  it is not during a calm like this that we run risk but when the gale begins to blow we cannot hear and shall not perhaps see very well  as he spoke the hermit lifted the covering of the forehatch and took out a small sail which he asked nigel to pass aft to the negro  closereef it moses we shall make use of the wind as long as possible  after that we will layto  all right massa said the negro in the same cheerful freeandeasy tone in which he was wont to express his willingness to obey orders whether trifling or important  don forgit spinkie massa  you may be sure i wont do that replied the hermit  come along monkey  evidently van der kemp had trained his dumb companion as thoroughly to prompt obedience as his black follower for the little creature instantly bounded from its place by the mast on to the shoulder of its master who bade it go into the place from which he had just extracted the sail  nigel could not see thisnot only because of the darkness but because of the intervention of the hermits bulky person but he understood what had taken place by the remark  thats a good little fellow  keep your head down now while i shut you in  from the same place van der kemp had drawn a small triangular foresail which he proceeded to attach to the bow of the canoerunning its point out by means of tackle laid along the deckwhile moses was busy reefing the mainsail  from the same repository were extracted three waterproof coats which when put on by the canoemen the tails thrust below deck and the aprons drawn over them and belted round their waists protected their persons almost completely from water  now nigel said the hermit unship the mast reeve the halyard of this foresail through the top and then reship it  moses will give you the mainsail when ready and you can hook the halyards on to it  the thing is too simple to require explanation to a sailor  i attend to the foresail and moses manages the mainsheet but you have to mind the halyards of both which as you would see if it were light enough run down alongside the mast  all i ask you to remember is to be smart in obeying orders for squalls are sometimes very sudden herebut i doubt not that such a caution is needless  ill do my best said nigel  by this time a slight puff of air had ruffled the sea thereby intensifying if possible the blackness which already prevailed  the tiny sails caught the puff causing the canoe to lean slightly over and glide with a rippling sound through the water while moses steered by means of his paddle  you have put spinkie down below i think said nigel who had been struck more than once with the hermits extreme tenderness and care of the little creature  yes to prevent it from being washed overboard  i nearly lost the poor little thing once or twice and now when we are likely to be caught in bad weather i put him below  is he not apt to be suffocated asked nigel  with everything made so tight to prevent water getting into the canoe you necessarily prevent air entering also  i see you have a mechanical turn of mind returned the hermit  you are right  yet in so large a canoe the air would last a considerable time to satisfy a monkey  nevertheless i have made provision for that there is a short tube alongside the mast and fixed to it which runs a little below the deck and rises a foot above it so as to be well above the wash of most waves and in the deck near the stern there is a small hole with a cap fitted so as to turn the water but admit the air  thus free circulation of air is established below deck  suddenly a hissing sound was heard to windward  look out moses said van der kemp  there it comes  let go the sheet  keep good hold of your paddle nigel  the warning was by no means unnecessary for as the canoes head was turned to meet the blast a hissing sheet of white water swept right over the tiny craft completely submerging it insomuch that the three men appeared to be sitting more than waistdeep in the water  lower the mainsail shouted the hermit for the noise of wind and sea had become deafening  nigel obeyed and held on to the flapping sheet  the hermit had at the same moment let go the foresail the flapping of which he controlled by a ropetackle arranged for the purpose  he then grasped his singleblade paddle and aided moses in keeping her head to wind and sea for a few minutes this was all that could be done  then the first violence of the squall passed off allowing the deck of the little craft to appear above the tormented water  soon the waves began to rise  the mere keeping of the canoes head to wind required all the attention of both master and man while nigel sat waiting for orders and looking on with mingled feelings of surprise and curiosity  of course they were all three wet to the skin for the water had got up their sleeves and down their necks but being warm that mattered little and the oiled aprons before mentioned being securely fastened round their waists effectually prevented any of it from getting below save the little that passed through the thickness of their own garments  no word was spoken for at least a quarter of an hour during which time although they rose buoyantly on the water the waves washed continually over the lowlying deck  as this deck was flush with the gunwale or rather had no gunwale at all the water ran off it as it does off a whales back  then there came a momentary lull  now mosesbout ship shouted van der kemp  stand by nigel  ay ay sir  although the canoe was longand therefore unfitted to turn quicklythe powerful strokes of the two paddles in what may be called counteractingharmony brought the little craft right round with her stern to the waves  hoist away nigel  we must run right before it now  up went the mainsail the tiny foresail bulged out at the same moment and away they went like the driving foam appearing almost to leap from wave to wave  all sense of danger was now overwhelmed in nigels mind by that feeling of excitement and wild delight which accompanies some kinds of rapid motion  this was if possible intensified by the crashing thunder which now burst forth and the vivid lightning which began to play revealing from time to time the tumultuous turmoil as if in clearest moonlight only to plunge it again in still blacker night  by degrees the gale increased in fury and it soon became evident that neither sails nor cordage could long withstand the strain to which they were subjected  amost too much massa said the negro in a suggestive shout  right moses returned his master  i was just thinking we must risk it  risk what  i wonder thought nigel  he had not long to wait for an answer to his thought  down wi the mainsail was quickly followed by the lowering of the foresail until not more than a mere corner was shown merely to keep the canoe endon to the seas  soon even this was lowered and van der kemp used his doubleblade paddle to keep them in position at the same time telling nigel to unship the mast  and plug the hole with that he added handing him a bit of wood which exactly fitted the hole in the deck  watching for another lull in the blast the hermit at last gave the order and round they came as before head to wind but not quite so easily and nigel felt that they had narrowly escaped overturning in the operation  keep her so moses  you can help with your paddle nigel while i get ready our anchor  anchor exclaimed our hero in amazementobeying orders however at the same moment  the hermit either did not hear the exclamation or did not care to notice it  he quickly collected the mast and sails with a couple of boathooks and all the paddles excepting two single ones  these he bound together by means of the sheets and halyards attached the whole to a hawserone end of which passed through an iron ring at the bow and tossed it into the seapaying out the hawser rapidly at the same time so as to put a few yards between them and their floating anchorif it may be so calledin the lee of which they prepared to ride out the gale  it was well that they had taken the precaution to put on their waterproofs before the gale began because while turned head to wind every breaking wave swept right over their heads and even now while under the lee of the floating anchor they were for some time almost continually overwhelmed by thick spray  being however set free from the necessity of keeping their tiny craft in position they all bowed their heads on the deck sheltered their faces in their hands and awaited the end  whilst in this attitudeso like to that of prayernigel almost naturally thought of him who holds the water in the hollow of his hand and lifted his soul to god for amid the roaring of the gale the flashes of lightning the appalling thunder the feeling that he was in reality all but under the waves and the knowledge that the proverbial plank between him and death was of the very thinnest description a sensation of helplessness and of dependence on the almighty such as he had never before experienced crept over him  what the thoughts of the hermit were he could not tell for that strange man seldom spoke about himself but moses was not so reticent for he afterwards remarked that he had often been caught by gales while in the canoe and had been attached for hours to their floating anchor but that dat was out ob sight de wust bust ob wedder deyd had since dey come to lib at krakatoa an he had bery nigh giben up in despair  the use of the floating breakwater was to meet the full force of the seas and break them just before they reached the canoe  in spite of this some of them were so tremendous that broken though they were the swirling foam completely buried the craft for a second or two but the sharp bow cut its way through and the water poured off the deck and off the stooping figures like rain from a ducks back  of course a good deal got in at their necks sleeves and other small openings and wet them considerably but that as moses remarked was noting to speak ob  thus they lay tossing in the midst of the raging foam for several hours now and then each would raise his head a little to see that the rope held fast but was glad to lower it again  they hardly knew when day broke  it was so slow in coming and so gloomy and dark when it did come that the glare of the lightningflash seemed more cheerful  it may be easily believed that there was no conversation during those hours of elemental strife though the thoughts of each were busy enough at last the thunder ceased or rather retired as if in growling defiance of the world which it had failed to destroy  then the sky began to lighten a little and although the wind did not materially abate in force it became more steady and equal  before noon however it had subsided so much that moses suggested the propriety of continuing the voyage  to this van der kemp agreed and the floating anchor was hauled in the large paddle was resumed by the hermit and the dangerous process of turning the canoe was successfully accomplished  when the mast was again set up and the closereefed main and foresails were hoisted the light craft bounded away once more before the wind like a fleck of foam  then a gleam of sunshine forced its way through the driving clouds and painted a spot of emerald green on the heaving sea  soon after that van der kemp opened the lid or hatch of the forehold and spinkie jumping out with alacrity took possession of his usual seat beside the mast to which he clung with affectionate tenacity  gradually the wind went down  reef after reef of the two sails was shaken out and for several hours thereafter our travellers sped merrily on plunging into the troughs and cutting through the crests of the stormy sea    chapter thirteen  friends are met with also pirates and a lifeordeath paddle ensues  in physics as in morals a storm is frequently the precursor of a dead calm  much to the monkeys joy to say nothing of the men the sun ere long asserted its equatorial power and clearing away the clouds allowed the celestial blue to smile on the turmoil below  the first result of that smile was that the wind retired to its secret chambers leaving the ships of men to flap their idle sails  then the ocean ceased to fume though its agitated bosom still continued for some time to heave gradually the swell went down and soon the unruffled surface reflected a dimpling smile to the sky  when this happy stage had been reached our voyagers lowered and stowed the canoesails and continued to advance under paddles  we get along wonderfully fast van der kemp said nigel while resting after a pretty long spell but it seems to me nevertheless that we shall take a considerable time to reach borneo at this rate seeing that it must be over two hundred miles away and if we have much bad weather or contrary wind we shant be able to reach it for weeksif at all  i have been thrown somewhat out of my reckoning returned the hermit by having to fly from the party on the islet where i meant to remain till a steamer owned by a friend of mine should pass and pick us up canoe and all  the steamer is a shortvoyage craft and usually so punctual that i can count on it to a day  but it may have passed us in the gale  if so i shall take advantage of the first vessel that will agree to lend us a hand  howdo you get them to tow you  nay that were impossible  a jerk from the towrope of a steamer at full speed would tear us asunder  have you observed these two strong ropes running all round our gunwale and the bridles across with ringbolts in them  i have and did not ask their use as i thought they were merely meant to strengthen the canoe  so they are continued the hermit but they have other uses besides  massa cried moses at this point  youll scuse me for truptin you but its my opinion dat spinkies sufferin jus now from a empty stummik  the hermit smiled and nigel laughed  laying down his paddle the former said  i understand moses  that speech means that you are suffering from the same complaint  wellget out the biscuit  jus de way ob de wurld muttered the negro with a bland smile  if a poor man obsarves an feels for de sorrows ob anoder he allers gits credit for tinkin ob hisself  neber mind is used to it  evidently the unjust insinuation did not weigh heavily on the negros spirit for he soon began to eat with the appetite of a healthy alligator  while he was thus engaged he chanced to raise his eyes towards the southwestern horizon and there saw something which caused him to splutter for his mouth was too full to speak but his speaking eyes and pointing finger caused his companions to turn their faces quickly to the quarter indicated  a steamer exclaimed the hermit and nigel in the same breath  the vessel in question was coming straight towards them and a very short time enabled van der kemp to recognise with satisfaction the steamer owned by his friend  look here run that to the masthead said van der kemp handing a red flag to nigel  we lie so low in the water that they might pass quite close without observing us if we showed no signal  an immediate though slight change in the course of the steamer showed that the signal had been seen  hereupon the hermit and moses performed an operation on the canoe which still farther aroused nigels surprise and curiosity  he resolved to ask no questions however but to await the issue of events  from the marvellous hold of the canoe which seemed to be a magazine for the supply of every human need moses drew a short but strong rope or cable with a ring in the middle of it and a hook at each end  he passed one end along to his master who hooked it to the bridlerope at the bow before referred to  the other end was hooked to the bridle in the stern so that the ring in the centre came close to nigels elbow  this arrangement had barely been completed when the steamer was within hail but no hail was given for the captain knew what was expected of him  he reduced speed as the vessel approached the canoe and finally came almost to a stop as he ranged alongside  what cheer van der kemp  dye want a lift today shouted the skipper looking over the side  a nod and a wave of the hand was the hermits reply  heave a rope boysbow and sternand lower away the tackle was the skippers order  a coil was flung to van der kemp who deftly caught it and held on tight  another was flung to moses who also caught it and held on slack  at the same moment nigel saw a large block with a hook attached descending towards his head  catch it nigel and hook it to the ring at your elbow said the hermit  our hero obeyed still in surprise though a glimmer of what was to follow began to dawn  haul away shouted the skipper and next moment the canoe was swinging in the air kept in position by the lines in the hands of van der kemp and moses  at the same time another order was given and the steamer went ahead full speed  it was all so suddenly done and seemed such a reckless proceeding that nigel found himself on the steamers deck with the canoe reposing beside him before he had recovered from his surprise sufficiently to acknowledge in suitable terms the welcome greeting of the hospitable skipper  you see nigel said van der kemp that night as the two friends paced the deck together after supper i have other means besides paddles and sails of getting quickly about in the java seas  many of the traders and skippers here know me and give me a lift in this way when i require it  very kind of them and very convenient returned nigel  he felt inclined to add but why all this moving about for it was quite evident that trade was not the hermits object but the question as usual died on his lips and he somewhat suddenly changed the subject  dye know van der kemp that i feel as if i must have seen you somewhere or other before now for your features seem strangely familiar to me  have you ever been in england  never  as i have told you i was born in java and was educated in hong kong at an english school  but a fancy of this sort is not very uncommon  i myself once met a perfect stranger who bore so strong a resemblance to an old friend that i spoke to him as such and only found out from his voice that i was mistaken  the captain of the steamer came on deck at that moment and cut short the conversation  are you engaged van der kemp he asked  noi am at your service  come below then i want to have a talk with you  thus left alone and overhearing a loud burst of laughter at the fore part of the steamer nigel went forward to see what was going on  he found a group of sailors round his comrade moses apparently engaged in goodnatured chaff  come now blackey said one be a good fellow for once in your life an tell us what makes your master live on a desert island like robinson crusoe an go about the ocean in a canoe  look ere now whitey returned moses what you take me for  a nigger of course  ob course an youre right for once which is such an unusual ting dat i dvise you go an ax de cappen to make a note ob it in de log is a nigger an a niggers so much more cute dan a white man dat you shouldnt ought to expect him to blab his massas secrets  right you are moses  come then if you wont reveal secrets give us a song  couldnt tink ob such a ting said the negro with a solemn remonstrant shake of the head  why not  cause i neber sing a song widout a moral an i dont like to hurt your feelins by singin a moral dat would be sure to waken up some o your consciences  never mind that darkey  our consciences are pretty tough  heave ahead  but deres a chorus said moses looking round doubtfully  what o that  well do our best with itif it aint too difficult  oh its not diffikilt but if de lazy fellers among you sings de chorus deyll be singin lies an i dont zackly like to help men to tell lies  howseber here goes  it begins wid de chorus sos you may know it afore you has to sing it  so saying moses struck two fingers on the capstan after the manner of a tuningfork and holding them gravely to his ear as if to get the right pitch began in a really fine manly voice to chant the following ditty    go to work    oh when de sun am shinin bright and eberyting am fair   clap on de steam an go to work an take your proper share   de wurld hab got to go ahead an dem whats young and strong   mus do deir best wid all de rest to roll   de wurld along

were evidently much pleased took up the chorus moderately at the second verse came out strong at the third and sang with such genuine fervour at the last that it was quite evident as moses remarked there was not a lazy man amongst themat least if they all sang conscientiously  the weather improved every hour and after a fine run of about twentyfour hours over that part of the malay sea our three voyagers were lowered over the steamers side in their canoe when within sight of the great island of borneo  im sorry said the captain at parting that our courses diverge here for i would gladly have had your company a little longer goodbye  i hope well come across you some other time when im in these parts  thanksthanks my friend replied van der kemp with a warm grip of the hand and a touch of pathos in his tones  i trust that we shall meet again  you have done me good service by shortening my voyage considerablyfarewell  i say moses shouted one of the seamen as he looked down on the tiny canoe while they were pushing off  hallo  keep your heart up forwell try to do to oders all around de ting whats good an true  das de way boyan oders turning tit for tat will do de same to you  he yelled rather than sang this at the top of his tuneful voice and waved his hand as the sharp craft shot away over the sea  fortunately the sea was calm for it was growing dark when they reached the shores of borneo and entered the mouth of a small stream up which they proceeded to paddle  the banks of the stream were clothed with mangrove trees  we have said the banks but in truth the mouth of that river had no distinguishable banks at all for it is the nature of the mangrove to grow in the waterusing its roots as legs with which as it were to wade away from shore  when darkness fell suddenly on the landscape as it is prone to do in tropical regions the gnarled roots of those mangroves assumed the appearance of twining snakes in nigels eyes  possessing a strongly imaginative mind he could with difficulty resist the belief that he saw them moving slimily about in the black water and in the dim mysterious light treestems and other objects assumed the appearance of hideous living forms so that he was enabled to indulge the uncomfortable fancy that they were traversing some terrestrial styx into one of dantes regions of horror  in some respects this was not altogether a fancy for they were unwittingly drawing near to a band of human beings whose purposes if fully carried out would render the earth little better than a hell to many of their countrymen  it is pretty wellknown that there is a class of men in borneo called head hunters  these men hold the extraordinary and gruesome opinion that a youth has not attained to respectable manhood until he has taken the life of some human being  there are two distinct classes of dyaksthose who inhabit the hills and those who dwell on the seacoast  it is the latter who recruit the ranks of the pirates of those eastern seas and it was to the camp of a band of such villains that our adventurers were as already said unwittingly drawing near  they came upon them at a bend of the dark river beyond which point the mangroves gave place to other treesbut what sort of trees they were it was scarcely light enough to make out very distinctly except in the case of the particular tree in front of which the dyaks were encamped the roots of which were strongly illuminated by their camp fire  we say roots advisedly for this singular and gigantic tree started its branches from a complexity of aerial roots which themselves formed a pyramid some sixty feet high before the branches proper of the tree began  if our voyagers had used oars the sharp ears of the pirates would have instantly detected them  as it was the softly moving paddles and the sharp cutwater of the canoe made no noise whatever  the instant that van der kemp from his position in the bow observed the camp he dipped his paddle deep and noiselessly backed water  there was no need to give any signal to his servant  such a thorough understanding existed between them that the mere action of the hermit was sufficient to induce the negro to support him by a similar movement on the opposite side and the canoe glided as quickly backward as it had previously advanced  when under the deep shadow of the bank moses thrust the canoe close in and his master laying hold of the bushes held fast and made a sign to him to land and reconnoitre  creeping forward to an opening in the bushes close at hand moses peeped through  then he turned and made facial signals of a kind so complicated that he could not be understood as nothing was visible save the flashing of his teeth and eyes  van der kemp therefore recalled him by a sign and stepping ashore whispered nigel to land  another minute and the three travellers stood on the bank with their heads close together  wait here for me said the hermit in the lowest possible whisper  i will go and see who they are  strange said nigel when he was gone strange that in so short a time your master should twice have to stalk strangers in this way history repeats itself they say  it appears to do so rather fast in these regions  does he not run a very great risk of being discovered  not de smallest replied the negro with as much emphasis as was possible in a whisper  massa hab ride wid de vaquieros ob ameriky an hunt wid de injuns on de rockies  no more fear ob deir ketchin him dan ob ketchin a streak o lightnin  he come back bery soon wid all de news  moses was a true prophet  within halfanhour van der kemp returned as noiselessly as he had gone  he did not keep them long in uncertainty  i have heard enough he whispered to assure me that a plot of which i had already heard a rumour has nearly been laid  we fell in with the chief plotters on the islet the other night the band here is in connection with them and awaits their arrival before carrying out their dark designs  there is nothing very mysterious about it  one tribe plotting to attack anotherthat is all but as a friend of mine dwells just now with the tribe to be secretly attacked it behoves me to do what i can to save him  i am perplexed however  it would seem sometimes as if we were left in perplexity for wise purposes which are beyond our knowledge  perhaps to test our willingness to do right suggested nigel  i know not returned the hermit as if musing but never raising his voice above the softest whisper  my difficulty lies here i must go forward to save the life of my friend  i must not leave you at the mouth of a mangrove river to die or be captured by pirates and yet i have no right to ask you to risk your life on my account  you may dismiss your perplexities then said nigel promptly for i decline to be left to die here or to be caught by pirates and i am particularly anxious to assist you in rescuing your friend  besides am i not your hired servant  the risk we run is only at the beginning said van der kemp  if we succeed in passing the dyaks unseen all will be well  if they see us they will give chase and our lives under god will depend on the strength of our arms for i am known to them and have thwarted their plans before now  if they catch us death will be our certain doom are you prepared  ready whispered nigel  without another word the hermit took his place in the bow of the canoe moses stepped into the stern and our hero sat down in the middle  before pushing off the hermit drew a revolver and a cutlass from his storeroom in the bow and handed them to nigel who thrust the first into his belt and fastened the other to the deck by means of a strap fixed there on purpose to prevent its being rolled or swept off  this contrivance as well as all the other appliances in the canoe had previously been pointed out and explained to him  the hermit and negro having armed themselves in similar way let go the bushes which held them close to the bank and floated out into the stream  they let the canoe drift down a short way so as to be well concealed by the bend in the river and a mass of bushes  then they slowly paddled over to the opposite side and commenced to creep up as close to the bank as possible under the deep shadow of overhanging trees and so noiselessly that they appeared in the darkness like a passing phantom  but the sharp eyes of the pirates were too much accustomed to phantoms of every kind to be easily deceived  just as the canoe was about to pass beyond the line of their vision a stir was heard in their camp then a stern challenge rolled across the river and awoke the slumbering echoes of the forestperchance to the surprise and scaring away of some prowling beast of prey  no need for concealment now said van der kemp quietly we must paddle for life  if you have occasion to use your weapons nigel take no life needlessly  moses knows my mind on this point and needs no warning  any fool can take away life  only god can give it  i will be careful replied nigel as he dipped his paddle with all the muscular power at his command  his comrades did the same and the canoe shot up the river like an arrow  a yell from the dyaks and the noise of jumping into and pushing off their boats told that there was no time to lose  they are strong men and plenty of them to relieve each other said the hermit who now spoke in his ordinary tones so they have some chance of overhauling us in the smooth water but a few miles further up there is a rapid which will stop them and will only check us  if we can reach it we shall be safe  while he was speaking every muscle in his broad back and arms was strained to the uttermost so also were the muscles of his companions and the canoe seemed to advance by a series of rapid leaps and bounds yet the sound of the pursuers oars seemed to increase and soon the proverb it is the pace that kills received illustration for the speed of the canoe began to decrease a littlevery little at firstwhile the pursuers with fresh hands at the oars gradually overhauled the fugitives  put on a spurt said the hermit setting the example  the pirates heard the words and understood either them or the action that followed for they also put on a spurt and encouraged each other with a cheer  moses heard the cheer and at the same time heard the sound of the rapid to which they were by that time drawing near  he glanced over his shoulder and could make out the dim form of the leading boat with a tall figure standing up in the bow not thirty yards behind  shall we manage it moses asked van der kemp in that calm steady voice which seemed to be unchangeable either by anxiety or peril  no massa  unpossablewidout dis  the negro drew the revolver from his belt slewed round took rapid aim and fired  the tall figure in the bow of the boat fell back with a crash and a hideous yell  great shouting and confusion followed and the boat dropped behind  a few minutes later and the canoe was leaping over the surges of a shallow rapid  they dashed from eddy to eddy taking advantage of every stone that formed a tail of backwater below it and gradually worked the light craft upward in a way that the hermit and his man had learned in the norwestern rivers of america  we are not safe yet said the former resting and wiping his brow as they floated for a few seconds in a calm basin at the head of the rapid  surely they cannot take a boat up such a place as that  nay but they can follow up the banks on foot  however we will soon baffle them for the river winds like a serpent just above this and by carrying our canoe across one two or three spits of land we will gain a distance in an hour or so that would cost them nearly a day to ascend in boats  they know that and will certainly give up the chase  i think they have given it up already but it is well to make sure  i wonder why they did not fire at us remarked nigel  probably because they felt sure of catching us returned the hermit and when they recovered from the confusion that moses threw them into we were lost to them in darkness besides being pretty well beyond range  i hope moses that you aimed low  yes massabut its scacely fair when life an def am in de balance to expect me to hit im on de legs on a dark night  legs is a bad targit  bullets apt to pass between em  howseber dat feller wont hop much for some time to come  a couple of hours later having carried the canoe and baggage across the spits of land above referred to and thus put at least halfadays journey between themselves and their foes they came to a halt for the night  it wont be easy to find a suitable place to camp on remarked nigel glancing at the bank where the bushes grew so thick that they overhung the water brushing the faces of our travellers and rendering the darkness so intense that they had literally to feel their way as they glided along  we will encamp where we are returned the hermit  ill make fast to a bush and you may get out the victuals moses  das de bery best word youve said dis day massa remarked the negro with a profound sigh  is pritty well tired now an de bery tought ob grub comforts me  do you mean that we shall sleep in the canoe asked nigel  ay why not returned the hermit who could be heard though not seen busying himself with the contents of the fore locker  youll find the canoe a pretty fair bed  you have only to slip down and pull your head and shoulders through the manhole and go to sleep  you wont want blankets in this weather and seethere is a pillow for you and another for moses  i cannot see but i can feel said nigel with a soft laugh as he passed the pillow aft  tank ee nadgel said moses herefeel behind you an youll find grub for yourself an some to pass forid to massa  mind when you slip down for go to sleep dat you dont dig your heels into massas skull deres no bulkhead to purtect it  ill be careful said nigel beginning his invisible supper with keen appetite  but how about my skull moses  is there a bulkhead between it and your heels  no but you dont need to mind for i allers sleeps doubled up wid my knees agin my chin  it makes de arms an legs feel more sociable like  with this remark moses ceased to encourage conversationhis mouth being otherwise engaged  thereafter they slipped down into their respective places laid their heads on their pillows and fell instantly into sound repose while the dark waters flowed sluggishly past and the only sound that disturbed the universal stillness was the occasional cry of some creature of the night or the flap of an alligators tail    chapter fourteen  a new friend foundnew dangers encountered and new hopes delayed  when grey dawn began to dispel the gloom of night nigel roy awoke with an uncomfortable sensation of having been buried alive  stretching himself as was his wont he inadvertently touched the head of van der kemp an exclamation from whom aroused moses who uncoiling himself awoke spinkie  it was usually the privilege of that affectionate creature to nestle in the negros bosom  with the alacrity peculiar to his race spinkie sprang through the manhole and sat down in his particular place to superintend perhaps to admire the work of his human friends whose dishevelled heads emerged simultaneously from their respective burrows  dawn is a period of the day when the spirit of man is calmly reflective speech seemed distasteful that morning and as each knew what had to be done it was needless  the silently conducted operations of the men appeared to arouse fellowfeeling in the monkey for its careworn countenance became more and more expressive as it gazed earnestly and alternately into the faces of its comrades  to all appearance it seemed about to speakbut it didnt  pushing out from the shore they paddled swiftly up stream and soon put such a distance between them and their late pursuers that all risk of being overtaken was at an end  all day they advanced inland without rest save at the breakfast hour and again at midday to dine  towards evening they observed that the country through which they were passing had changed much in character and aspect  the low and swampy region had given place to hillocks and undulating ground all covered with the beautiful virgin forest with its palms and creepers and noble fruittrees and rich vegetation conspicuous among which magnificent ferns of many kinds covered the steep banks of the stream  on rounding a point of the river the travellers came suddenly upon an interesting group in the midst of a most beautiful woodland scene under the trees on a flat spot by the riverbank were seated round a fire a man and a boy and a monkey  the monkey was a tame orangutan youthful but large  the boy was a dyak in light cotton drawers with the upper part of his body naked brass rings on his arms heavy ornaments in his ears and a bright kerchief worn as a turban on his head  the man was a sort of nondescript in a semieuropean shooting garb with a widebrimmed sombrero on his head black hair a deeply tanned face a snub nose huge beard and moustache and immense blue spectacles  something not unlike a cheer burst from the usually undemonstrative van der kemp on coming in sight of the party and he waved his hand as if in recognition  the nondescript replied by starting to his feet throwing up both arms and giving vent to an absolute roar of joy  he seems to know you remarked nigel as they made for a landingplace  yes  he is the friend i have come to rescue replied the hermit in a tone of quiet satisfaction  he is a naturalist and lives with the rajah against whom the pirates are plotting  he dont look zif he needs much rescuin remarked moses with a chuckle as they drew to land  the man looked in truth as if he were well able to take care of himself in most circumstances being of colossal bulk although somewhat short of limb  ah mein frond mine brodder he exclaimed in fairly idiomatic english but with a broken pronunciation that was a mixture of dutch american and malay  his language therefore like himself was nondescript  in fact he was an americanborn dutchman who had been transported early in life to the straits settlements had received most of his education in hong kong was an old schoolfellow of van der kemp became an enthusiastic naturalist and being possessed of independent means spent most of his time in wandering about the various islands of the archipelago making extensive collections of animal and vegetable specimens which he distributed with liberal hand to whatever museums at home or abroad seemed most to need or desire them  owing to his tastes and habits he had been dubbed professor by his friends  ach  van der kemp he exclaimed while his coalblack eyes glittered as they shook hands vat a bootterfly i saw today  it beat all creation  the vay it flewoh  but excuse mevere did you come from and vy do you come  an who is your frond  he turned to nigel as he spoke and doffed his sombrero with a gracious bow  an englishmannigel roywho has joined me for a few months said the hermit  let me introduce you nigel to my good friend professor verkimier  nigel held out his hand and gave the naturalists a shake so hearty that a true friendship was begun on the spota friendship which was rapidly strengthened when the professor discovered that the english youth had a strong leaning towards his own favourite studies  ve vill hont an shot togezzer mine frond he said on making this discovery ant i vill show you vere de best bootterflies are to be fountoh sooch a von as i saw tobut excuse me van der kemp  vy you come here joost now  to save you said the hermit with a scintillation of his halfpitiful smile  to safe me exclaimed verkimier with a look of surprise which was greatly intensified by the rotundity of the blue spectacles  vell i dont feel to vant safing joost at present  it is not that danger threatens you so much as your friend the rajah returned the hermit  but if he falls all under his protection fall along with him  i happen to have heard of a conspiracy against him on so large a scale that certain destruction would follow if he were taken by surprise so i have come on in advance of the conspirators to warn him in time  you know i have received much kindness from the rajah so i could do no less than warn him of impending danger and then the fact that you were with him made me doubly anxious to reach you in time  while the hermit was saying this the naturalist removed his blue glasses and slowly wiped them with a corner of his coattails replacing them he gazed intently into the grave countenance of his friend till he had finished speaking  are zee raskils near he asked sternly  no  we have come on many days ahead of them  but we found a party at the rivers mouth awaiting their arrival  ant zey cannot arrife you say for several veeks  probably noteven though they had fair and steady winds  a sigh of satisfaction broke through the naturalists moustache on hearing this  zen i villve vill you and i mister roygo after ze bootterflies tomorrow  but we must push on remonstrated van der kemp for preparations to resist an attack cannot be commenced too soon  you may push on mine frond go ahead if you vill but i vill not leave zee bootterflies  you know vell zat i vill dieif need befor zee rajah  ve must all die vonce at least and i should like to die if i must diein a goot cause  what cause better zan frondship  but you say joost now zere is no dancher  vell i vill go ant see zee bootterflies tomorrow  after zat i will go ant dieif it must be with zee  i heartily applaud your sentiment said nigel with a laugh as he helped himself to some of the food which the dyak youth and moses had prepared and if van der kemp will give me leave of absence i will gladly keep you company  zank you  pass round zee victuals  my appetite is strong  it always vas more or less strong  vat say you van der kemp  i have no objection  moses and i can easily take the canoe up the river  there are no rapids and it is not far to the rajahs village so you are welcome to go nigel  das de most straordnary craze i eber knowd men inflicted wid said moses that night as he sat smoking his pipe beside the dyak boy  it passes my comprension what fun dey find runnin like childn arter butterflies an beetles an sitch like varmint  my massa am de wisest man on eart yet he go a little wild dat way toosometimes  moses looked at the dyak boy with a puzzled expression but as the dyak boy did not understand english he looked intently at the fire and said nothing  next morning nigel entered the forest under the guidance of verkimier and the dyak youth and the orangutan which followed like a dog and sometimes even took hold of its masters arm and walked with him as if it had been a very small human being  it was a new experience to nigel to walk in the sombre shade beneath the tangled arches of the wilderness  in some respects it differed entirely from his expectations and in others it surpassed them  the gloom was deeper than he had pictured it but the shade was not displeasing in a land so close to the equator  then the trees were much taller than he had been led to suppose and the creeping plants more numerous while to his surprise the wildflowers were comparatively few and small  but the scarcity of these was somewhat compensated by the rich and brilliant colouring of the foliage  the abundance and variety of the ferns also struck the youth particularly  ah zey are magnificent exclaimed verkimier with enthusiasm  look at zat treefern  you have noting like zat in englandeh  i have found nearly von hoondred specimens of ferns  zen look at zee fruittrees  ve have here you see zee lansat mangosteen rambutan jack jambon blimbing ant many ozersbut zee queen of fruits is zee durian  have you tasted zee durian  no not yet  ha a new sensation is before you  stay you vill eat von by ant by look zat is a durian tree before you  he pointed as he spoke to a large and lofty tree which mr ar wallace the celebrated naturalist and traveller describes as resembling an elm in general character but with a more smooth and scaly bark  the fruit is round or slightly oval about the size of a mans head of a green colour and covered all over with short spines which are very strong and so sharp that it is difficult to lift the fruit from the ground  only the experienced and expert can cut the tough outer rind  there are five faint lines extending from the base to the apex of the fruit through which it may be divided with a heavy knife and a strong hand so as to get to the delicious creamy pulp inside  there is something paradoxical in the descriptions of this fruit by various writers but all agree that it is inexpressibly good  says onewriting of the sixteenth centuryit is of such an excellent taste that it surpasses in flavour all the other fruits of the world another writes this fruit is of a hot and humid nature  to those not used to it it seems at first to smell like rotten onions but immediately they have tasted it they prefer it to all other food wallace himself says of it when brought into the house the smell is so offensive that some persons can never bear to taste it  this was my own case in malacca but in borneo i found a ripe fruit on the ground and eating it out of doors i at once became a confirmed durianeater  this was exactly the experience of nigel roy that day and the way in which the fruit came to him was also an experience but of a very different sort  it happened just as they were looking about for a suitable spot on which to rest and eat their midday meal  verkimier was in front with the orangutan reaching up to his arm and hobbling affectionately by his sidefor there was a strong mutual affection between them  the dyak youth brought up the rear with a sort of gamebag on his shoulders  suddenly nigel felt something graze his arm and heard a heavy thud at his side  it was a ripe durian which had fallen from an immense height and missed him by a hairbreadth  zank got you have escaped exclaimed the professor looking back with a solemn countenance  i have indeed escaped what might have been a severe blow said nigel stooping to examine the fruit apparently forgetful that more might follow  comecome avay  my boy vill bring it  men are sometimes killed by zis fruit  here now ve vill dine  they sat down on a bank which was canopied by ferns  while the boy was arranging their meal verkimier drew a heavy huntingknife from his belt and applying it with an unusually strong hand to the durian laid it open  nigel did not at all relish the smell but he was not fastidious or apt to be prejudiced  he tastedand like mr wallace became a confirmed durianeater from that day  ve draw near to zee region vere ve shall find zee bootterflies said the naturalist during a pause in their luncheon  i hope we shall be successful said nigel helping himself to some more of what may be styled durian cream  to judge from the weight and hardness of this fruit i should think a blow on ones head from it would be fatal  sometimes not always  i suppose zat dyak skulls are strong  but zee wound is terrible for zee spikes tear zee flesh dreadfully  zee dyak chief rajah with whom i dwell joost now was floored once by one and he expected to diebut he did not  he is alife ant vell as you shall see  as he spoke a large butterfly fluttered across the scene of their festivities  with all the energy of his enthusiastic spirit and strong muscular frame the naturalist leaped up overturned his dinner rushed after the coveted specimen tripped over a root and measured his length on the ground  zat comes of too much horry he remarked as he picked up his glasses and returned humbly to continue his dinner  mine frond learn a lesson from a foolish man  i shall learn two lessons said nigel laughingfirst to avoid your too eager haste and second to copy if i can your admirable enthusiasm  you are very goot  some more cheekin if you please  zanks  ve most make haste viz our meal ant go to vork  the grandeur and novelty of the scenery through which they passed when they did go to work was a source of constant delight and surprise to our hero whose inherent tendency to take note of and admire the wonderful works of god was increased by the unflagging enthusiasm and interesting running commentary of his companion whose flow of language and eager sympathy formed a striking contrast to the profound silence and gravity of the dyak youth as well as to the pathetic and affectionate selfishness of the manmonkey  it must not however be supposed that the young orangutan was unworthy of his victuals for besides being an amusing and harmless companion he had been trained to use his natural capacity for climbing trees in the service of his master  thus he ascended the tall durian trees when ordered and sent down some of the fruit in a few minutesan operation which his human companions could not have accomplished without tedious delay and the construction of an ingenious ladder having slender bamboos for one of its sides and the tree to be ascended for its other side with splinters of bamboo driven into it by way of rounds  zat is zee pitcherplant said verkimier as nigel stopped suddenly before a plant which he had often read of but never seen  he was told by his friend that pitcherplants were very numerous in that region that every mountaintop abounded with them that they would be found trailing along the ground and climbing over shrubs and stunted trees with their elegant pitchers hanging in every direction  some of these he said were long and slender others broad and short  the plant at which they were looking was a broad green one variously tinted and mottled with red and was large enough to hold two quarts of water  resuming the march nigel observed that the group of orchids was abundant but a large proportion of the species had small inconspicuous flowers  some however had large clusters of yellow flowers which had a very ornamental effect on the sombre forest  but although the exceptions were striking he found that in borneo as elsewhere flowers were scarcer than he had expected in an equatorial forest  there were however more than enough of striking and surprising things to engage the attention of our hero and arouse his interest  one tree they came to which rendered him for some moments absolutely speechless to the intense delight of the professor who marched his newfound sympathiser from one object of interest to another with the secret intention of surprising him and when he had got him to the point of openmouthed amazement he was wont to turn his spectacles full on his face like the mouths of a blue binocular in order to witness and enjoy his emotions  nigel found this out at last and was rather embarrassed in consequence  zat exclaimed the naturalist after gazing at his friend for some time in silence zat is a tree vitch planted itself in midair and zen sent its roots down to zee ground and its branches up to zee sky  it looks as if it had returned nigel i have seen a tree of the same kind near the coast  how came it to grow in this way  i know not  it is zought zat zey spring from a seed dropped by a bird into zee fork of anozer tree  zee seed grows sends his roots down ant his branches up  ven his roots reach zee ground he lays hold ant ven strong enough kills his supportzus returning efil for good like a zankless dependent  ah zere is much resemblance between plants and animals  com ve must feed here said the professor resting his gun against one of the roots i had expected to find zee bootterflies sooner  it cannot be helped  let us make zis our banquetinghall  ve vill have a durian to refresh us ant here is a handy tree which seems to have ripe vones on itgo he added turning to the orangutan and send down von or two  the creature looked helplessly incapable pitifully unwilling scratching its side the while  evidently it was a lazy monkey  do you hear said verkimier sternly  the orang moved uneasily but still declined to go  turning sharply on it the professor bent down placed a hand on each of his knees and stared through the blue goggles into the animals face  this was more than it could stand  with a very bad grace it hobbled off to the durian tree ascended it with a sort of lazy lumbering facility and hurled down some of the fruit without warning those below to look out  my little frond is obstinate sometimes remarked the naturalist picking up the fruit but ven i bring my glasses to bear on him he always gives in i never found zem fail  come now eat an ve vill go to vork again  ve must certainly find zee bootterflies somevere before night  but verkimier was wrong  it was his destiny not to find the butterflies that night or in that region at all for he and his companion had not quite finished their meal when a dyak youth came running up to them saying that he had been sent by the rajah to order their immediate return to the village  alas ve most go  it is dancherous to disobey zee rajahant i am sorryvery sorryzat i cannot show you zee bootterflies today  no mattergo to the dyak youth tell your chief ve vill come better lock zee next time    chapter fifteen  hunting the great manmonkey  although professor verkimier had promised to return at once he was compelled to encamp in the forest being overtaken by night before he could reach the river and procure a boat  next morning they started at daybreak  the country over which they passed had again changed its character and become more hilly  on the summits of many of the hills dyak villages could be seen and rice fields were met with as they went along  several gullies and rivulets were crossed by means of native bamboo bridges and the professor explained as he went along the immense value of the bamboo to the natives  with it they make their suspension bridges build their houses and procure narrow planking for their floors  if they want broader planks they split a large bamboo on one side and flatten it out to a plank of about eighteen inches wide  portions of hollow bamboo serve as receptacles for milk or water  if a precipice stops a path the dyaks will not hesitate to construct a bamboo path along the face of it using branches of trees wherever convenient from which to hang the path and every crevice or notch in the rocks to receive the ends of the bamboos by which it is supported  honeybees in borneo hang their combs to be out of danger no doubt under the branches of the tappan which towers above all the other trees of the forest  but the dyaks love honey and value wax as an article of trade they therefore erect their ingenious bamboo ladderwhich can be prolonged to any height on the smooth branchless stem of the tappanand storm the stronghold of the bees with much profit to themselves for beeswax will purchase from the traders the brass wire rings goldedged kerchiefs and various ornaments with which they decorate themselves  when travelling the dyaks use bamboos as cooking vessels in which to boil rice and other vegetables as jars in which to preserve honey sugar etcetera or salted fish and fruit  split bamboos form aqueducts by which water is conveyed to the houses  a small neatly carved piece of bamboo serves as a case in which are carried the materials used in the disgusting practice of betelnut chewingwhich seems to be equivalent to the western tobaccochewing  if a pipe is wanted the dyak will in a wonderfully short space of time make a huge hubblebubble out of bamboos of different sizes and if his longbladed knife requires a sheath the same gigantic grass supplies one almost readymade  but the uses to which this reed may be applied are almost endless and the great outstanding advantage of it is that it needs no other tools than an axe and a knife to work it  at about midday the river was reached and they found a native boat or prahu which had been sent down to convey them to the rajahs village here nigel was received with the hospitality due to a friend of van der kemp who somehowprobably by unselfish readiness as well as ability to obligehad contrived to make devoted friends in whatever part of the malay archipelago he travelled  afterwards in a conversation with nigel the professor referring to those qualities of the hermit which endeared him to men everywhere said with a burst of enthusiasm which almost outdid himself  you cannot oonderstant van der kemp  no man can oonderstant him  he is goot right down to zee marrowkind amiable oonselfish obliging nevair seems to zink of himself at all ant abof all zings is capable vat he vill do he can dovat he can do he vill do  but he is sad very sad  i have observed that of course said nigel  do you know what makes him so sad  the professor shook his head  no i do not know  nobody knows  i have tried to find out but he vill not speak  the orangkaya or rich man as this hill chief was styled had provided lodgings for his visitors in the headhouse  this was a large circular building erected on poles  there is such a house in nearly all dyak villages  it serves as a tradingplace a strangers room a sleepingroom for unmarried youths and a general councilchamber  here nigel found the hermit and moses enjoying a good meal when he arrived to which he and the professor sat down after paying their respects to the chief  the orangkaya hopes that we will stay with him some time and help to defend the village said van der kemp when they were all seated  of course you have agreed said nigel  yes i came for that purpose  wes allers ready to fight in a good cause remarked moses just before filling his mouth with rice  or to die in it added verkimier engulfing the breast of a chicken at a bite  but as zee pirates are not expected for some days ve may as vell go after zee miaszat is what zee natifs call zee orangutan  it is a better word being short  moses glanced at the professor out of the corners of his black eyes and seemed greatly tickled by his enthusiastic devotion to business  i am also continued the professor extremely anxious to go at zee bootterflies before  you die suggested nigel venturing on a pleasantry whereat moses opened his mouth in a soundless laugh but observing the professors goggles levelled at him he transformed the laugh into an astounding sneeze and immediately gazed with pouting innocence and interest at his plate  do you always sneeze like zat asked verkimier  not allers answered the negro simply sometimes i gibs way a good deal wuss  depends on de inside ob my nose an de state ob de wedder  what the professor would have replied we cannot say for just then a dyak youth rushed in to say that an unusually large and gorgeous butterfly had been seen just outside the village  no application of fire to gunpowder could have produced a more immediate effect  the professors rice was scattered on the floor and himself was outside the headhouse before his comrades knew exactly what was the matter  hes always like that said the hermit with a slight twinkle in his eyes  nothing discouragesnothing subdues him  twice i pulled him out of deadly danger into which he had run in his eager pursuit of specimens  and he has returned the favour to me for he rescued me once when a mias had got me down and would certainly have killed me for my gun was empty at the moment and i had dropped my knife  is then the orangutan so powerful and savage  truly yes when wounded and driven to bay returned the hermit  you must not judge of the creature by the baby that verkimier has tamed  a fullgrown male is quite as large as a man though very small in the legs in proportion so that it does not stand high  it is also very much stronger than the most powerful man  you would be quite helpless in its grip i assure you  i hope with the professor returned nigel that we may have a hunt after them either before or after the arrival of the pirates  i know he is very anxious to secure a good specimen for some museum in which he is interestedi forget which  as he spoke the youth who had brought information about the butterfly returned and said a few words to moses in his native tongue  what does he say asked niger  dat massa verkimier is in full chase an its my opinion dat when he comes back hell be wet all ober and hab his shins and elbows barked  why dyou think so  cause dats de way he hoed on when we was huntin wid him last year he nebber larns fro sperience  thats a very finelooking young fellow remarked nigel referring to the dyak youth who had just returned and who with a number of other natives was watching the visitors with profound interest while they ate  as the young man referred to was a good sample of the youth of his tribe we shall describe him  though not tall he was well and strongly proportioned and his skin was of a reddishbrown colour  like all his comrades he wore little clothing  a gay handkerchief with a gold lace border encircled his head from beneath which flowed a heavy mass of straight jetblack hair  large crescentshaped ornaments hung from his ears  his face was handsome and the expression pleasing though the mouth was large and the lips rather thick  numerous brass rings encircled his arms above and below the elbows  his only other piece of costume was a waistcloth of blue cotton which hung down before and behind  it ended in three bands of red blue and white  there were also rows of brass rings on his legs and armlets of white shells  at his side he wore a long slender knife and a little pouch containing the materials for betelchewing  yes and he is as good as he looks said the hermit  his name is gurulam and all the people of his tribe have benefited by the presence in borneo of that celebrated englishman sir james brookerajah brooke as he was calledwho did so much to civilise the dyaks of borneo and to ameliorate their condition  the prophecy of moses about the professor was fulfilled  just as it was growing dark that genial scientist returned drenched to the skin and covered with mud having tumbled into a ditch  his knuckles also were skinned his knees and shins damaged and his face scratched but he was perfectly happy in consequence of having secured a really splendid specimen of a bootterfly as big as his hand the scientific name of which for very sufficient reasons we will not attempt to inflict on our readers and the description of which may be shortly stated by the single wordgorgeous  being fond of verkimier and knowing his desire to obtain a fullgrown orangutan gurulam went off early next morning to search for one halfadozen of his comrades accompanied him armed only with native spears for their object was not to hunt the animal but to discover one if possible and let the professor know so that he might go after it with his rifle for they knew that he was a keen sportsman as well as a man of science  they did not indeed find what they sought for but they were told by natives with whom they fell in that a number of the animals had been seen among the treetops not more than a days march into the forest they hurried home therefore with this information and that day accompanied by the dyak youths nigel the hermit and mosesverkimier started off in search of the mias intending to camp out or to take advantage of a native hut if they should chance to be near one when night overtook them  descending the hill region they soon came to more level ground where there was a good deal of swamp through which they passed on dyak roads these roads consisted simply of treetrunks laid end to end along which the natives being barefooted walk with ease and certainty but our booted hunters were obliged to proceed along them with extreme caution  the only one who came to misfortune was as usual the professor and in the usual way  it occurred at the second of these treeroads  look look at that remarkable insect exclaimed nigel eagerly in the innocence of his heart  the professor was in front of him he obediently looked saw the insect made an eager step towards it and next moment was flat on the swamp while the woods rang with his companions laughter  the remarkable insect whatever it was vanished from the scene and the professor was dragged smiling though confused out of the bog  these things affected him little  his soul was large and rose superior to such trifles  the virgin forest into which they penetrated was of vast extent spreading over plain mountain and morass in every direction for hundreds of miles for we must remind the reader that the island of borneo is considerably larger than all the british islands put together while its inhabitants are comparatively few  verkimier had been absolutely revelling in this forest for several monthsranging its glades penetrating its thickets bathing inadvertently in its quagmires and maiming himself generally with unwearied energy and unextinguishable enthusiasm shooting skinning stuffing preserving and boiling the bones of all its inhabitantsexcept the humanto the great advantage of science and the immense interest and astonishment of the natives  yet with all his energy and perseverance the professor had failed up to that time to obtain a large specimen of a male orangutan though he had succeeded in shooting several small specimens and females besides catching the young one which he had tamed  it was therefore with much excitement that he learned from a party of beeswax hunters on the second morning of their expedition that a large male mias had been seen that very day  towards the afternoon they found the spot that had been described to them and a careful examination began  you see said verkimier in a low voice to nigel as he went a step in advance peering up into the trees with rifle at the ready and bending a little as if by that means he better avoided the chance of being seen  you see i came to borneo for zee express purpose of obtaining zee great manmonkey and vatching his habitshush  do i not hear someting  nothing but your own voice i think said nigel with a twinkle in his eye  vellhush  keep kviet all of you  as the whole party marched in single file after the professor and were at the moment absolutely silent this order induced the display of a good many teeth  just then the man of science was seen to put his rifle quickly to the shoulder the arches of the forest rang with a loud report various horrified creatures were seen and heard to scamper away and next moment a middlesized orangutan came crashing through the branches of a tall tree and fell dead with a heavy thud on the ground  the professors rifle was a breechloader  he therefore lost no time in recharging and hurried forward as if he saw other game while the rest of the partyexcept van der kemp nigel and gurulamfell behind to look at and pick up the fallen animal  look out whispered nigel pointing to a bit of brown hair that he saw among the leaves high overhead  vere  i cannot see him whispered the naturalist whose eyes blazed enough almost to melt his blue glasses  do you fire mr roy  my gun is charged only with smallshot for birds  it is useless for such game said nigel  ach  i see  up went the rifle and again the echoes were startled and the animal kingdom astounded especially that portion at which the professor had fired for there was immediately a tremendous commotion among the leaves overhead and another orang of the largest size was seen to cross an open space and disappear among the thick foliage  evidently the creature had been hit but not severely for it travelled among the treetops at the rate of full five miles an hour obliging the hunters to run at a rapid pace over the rough ground in order to keep up with it  in its passage from tree to tree the animal showed caution and foresight selecting only those branches that interlaced with other boughs so that it made uninterrupted progress and also had a knack of always keeping masses of thick foliage underneath it so that for some time no opportunity was found of firing another shot  at last however it came to one of those dyak roads of which we have made mention so that it could not easily swing from one tree to another and the stoppage of rustling among the leaves told that the creature had halted for some time they gazed up among the branches without seeing anything but at last in a place where the leaves seemed to have been thrust aside near the top of one of the highest trees a great red hairy body was seen and a huge black face gazed fiercely down at the hunters  verkimier fired instantly the branches closed and the monster moved off in another direction  in desperate anxiety nigel fired both barrels of his shotgun  he might as well have fired at the moon  gurulam was armed only with a spear and van der kemp who was not much of a sportsman carried a similar weapon  the rest of the party were still out of sight in rear looking after the dead mias  it was astonishing how little noise was made by so large an animal as it moved along  more than once the hunters had to halt and listen intently for the rustling of the leaves before they could make sure of being on the right track  at last they caught sight of him again on the top of a very high tree and the professor got two more shots but without bringing him down then he was seen quite exposed for a moment walking in a stooping posture along the large limb of a tree but the hunter was loading at the time and lost the chance  finally he got on to a tree whose top was covered with a dense mass of creepers which completely hid him from view  then he halted and the sound of snapping branches was heard  youve not much chance of him now remarked the hermit as they all stood in a group gazing up into the treetop  i have often seen the mias act thus when severely wounded  he is making a nest to lie down and die in  zen ve must shoot again said the professor moving round the tree and looking out for a sign of the animal  at last he seemed to have found what he wanted for raising his rifle he took a steady aim and fired  a considerable commotion of leaves and fall of broken branches followed then the huge red body of the mias appeared falling through but it was not dead for it caught hold of branches as it fell and hung on as long as it could then it came crashing down and alighted on its face with an awful thud  after firing the last shot verkimier had not reloaded being too intent on watching the dying struggles of the creature and when it fell with such violence he concluded that it was dead  for the same reason nigel had neglected to reload after firing  thus it happened that when the enormous brute suddenly rose and made for a tree with the evident intention of climbing it no one was prepared to stop it except the dyak youth gurulam  he chanced to be standing between the mias and the tree  boldly he levelled his spear and made a thrust that would probably have killed the beast if it had not caught the point of the spear and turned it aside  then with its left paw it caught the youth by the neck seized his thigh with one of its hind paws and fixed its teeth in his right shoulder  never was man rendered more suddenly and completely helpless and death would have been his sure portion before the hunters had reloaded if van der kemp had not leaped forward and thrusting his spear completely through the animals body killed it on the spot    chapter sixteen  begins with a terrible fight and ends with a hasty flight  the hunt we need scarcely say was abruptly terminated and immediate preparations were made for conveying the wounded man and the two orangs to the dyak village  this was quickly arranged for the convenient bamboo afforded readymade poles wherewith to form a litter on which to carry them  the huge creature which had given them so much trouble and so nearly cost them one human life was found to be indeed of the largest size it was not tall but very broad and large  the exact measurements taken by the professor who never travelled without his tapemeasure were as follows  height from heel to top of head 4 feet 2 inches  outstretched arms across chest 7 feet 8 inches  width of face 1 foot 2 inches  girth of arm 1 foot 3 inches  girth of wrist 5 inches  the muscular power of such a creature is of course immense as nigel and the professor had a rare chance of seeing that very eveningof which more presently  on careful examination by nigel who possessed some knowledge of surgery it was found that none of gurulams bones had been broken and that although severely lacerated about the shoulders and right thigh no very serious injury had been donethanks to the promptitude and vigour of the hermits spearthrust  the poor youth however was utterly helpless for the time being and had to be carried home  that afternoon the party reached a village in a remote part of the forest where they resolved to halt for the night as no other restingplace could be reached before dark  while a supper of rice and fowl was being cooked by moses van der kemp attended to the wounded man and nigel accompanied the professor along the banks of the stream on which the village stood  having merely gone out for a stroll they carried no weapons except walkingsticks intending to go only a short distance  interesting talk however on the character and habits of various animals made them forget time until the diminution of daylight warned them to turn  they were about to do so when they observed seated in an open place near the stream the largest orang they had yet seen  it was feeding on succulent shoots by the waterside a fact which surprised the professor for his inquiries and experience had hitherto taught him that orangs never eat such food except when starving  the fat and vigorous condition in which this animal was forbade the idea of starvation  besides it had brought a durian fruit to the banks of the stream and thrown it down so that either taste or eccentricity must have induced it to prefer the shoots perhaps its digestion was out of order and it required a tonic  anyhow it continued to devour a good many young shoots while our travellers were peeping at it in mute surprise through the bushes  that they had approached so near without being observed was due to the fact that a brawling rapid flowed just there and the mias was on the other side of the stream  by mutual consent the men crouched to watch its proceedings  they were not a little concerned however when the brute seized an overhanging bough and with what we may style sluggish agility swung itself clumsily but lightly to their side of the stream it picked up the durian which lay there and began to devour it  biting off some of the strong spikes with which that charming fruit is covered it made a small hole in it and then with its powerful fingers tore off the thick rind and began to enjoy a feast  now with monkeys no less than with men there is many a slip twixt the cup and the lip for the mias had just begun its meal or rather its dessert when a crocodile which the professor had not observed and nigel had mistaken for a log suddenly opened its jaws and seized the big monkeys leg  the scene that ensued baffles description  grasping the crocodile with its other three hands by nose throat and eyes the mias almost performed the american operation of gougingdigging its powerful thumbs and fingers into every crevice and tearing open its assailants jaws  the crocodile taken apparently by surprise went into dire convulsions and making for deep water plunged his foe therein over head and ears  nothing daunted the mias regained his footing hauled his victim on to a mudbank and jumping on his back began to tear and pommel him  there was nothing of the prizefighter in the mias  he never clenched his fistnever hit straight from the shoulder but the buffeting and slapping which he gave resounded all over the place  at last he caught hold of a fold of his opponents throat which he began to tear open with fingers and teeth  wrenching himself free with a supreme effort the crocodile shot into the stream and disappeared with a sounding splash of its tail while the mias waded lamely to the shore with an expression of sulky indignation on its great black face  slowly the creature betook itself to the shelter of the forest and we need scarcely add that the excited observers of the combat made no attempt to hinder its retreat  it is said that the python is the only other creature that dares to attack the orangutan and that when it does so victory usually declares for the manmonkey which bites and tears it to death  the people of the village in which the hunters rested that night were evidently not accustomed to white menperhaps had never seen them beforefor they crowded round them while at supper and gazed in silent wonder as if they were watching a group of whitefaced baboons feeding they were however very hospitable and placed before their visitors an abundance of their best food without expecting anything in return brass rings were the great ornament in this villageas they are indeed among the dyaks generally  many of the women had their arms completely covered with them as well as their legs from the ankle to the knee  their petticoats were fastened to a coil of rattan stained red round their bodies  they also wore coils of brass wire girdles of small silver coins and sometimes broad belts of brass ringarmour  it was break of dawn next morning when our hunters started bearing their wounded comrade and the dead orangs with them  arrived at the village they found the people in great excitement preparing for defence as news had been brought to the effect that the pirates had landed at the mouth of the river joined the disaffected band which awaited them and that an attack might be expected without delay for they were under command of the celebrated malay pirate baderoon  nigel observed that the countenance of his friend van der kemp underwent a peculiar change on hearing this mans name mentioned  there was a combination of anxiety which was unnatural to him and of resolution which was one of his chief characteristics  is baderoon the enemy whom you saw on the islet on our first night out asked nigel during a ramble with the hermit that evening  yes and i fear to meet him replied his friend in a low voice  nigel was surprised  the impression made on his mind since their intercourse was that van der kemp was incapable of the sensation of fear  is he so very bitter against you asked nigel  very was the curt reply  have you reason to think he would take your life if he could  i am sure he would  as i told you before i have thwarted his plans more than once  when he hears that it is i who have warned the orang kaya against him he will pursue me to the death andand i must not meet him  indeed exclaimed nigel with renewed surprise  but the hermit took no note of the exclamation  anxiety had given place to a frown and his eyes were fixed on the ground  it seemed to nigel so evident that he did not wish to pursue the subject that he slightly changed it  i suppose he said that there is no fear of the dyaks of the village being unable to beat off the pirates now that they have been warned  none whatever  indeed this is so wellknown to baderoon that i think he will abandon the attempt  but he will not abandon his designs on me however we must wait and see how god will order events  next morning spies returned to the village with the information that the pirates had taken their departure from the mouth of the river  do you think this is an attempt to deceive us asked the chief turning to van der kemp when he heard the news  i think not  and even should it be so and they should return you are ready and well able to meet them  yes readyand well able to meet them replied the orangkaya drawing himself up proudly  did they all go in one direction asked van der kemp of the youths who had brought the news  yes all went in a body to the northexcept one boat which rowed southward  hmm  i thought so  my friends listen to me  this is no pretence they do not mean to attack you now you are on your guard but that boat which went south contains baderoon and i feel certain that he means to hang about here till he gets the chance of killing me  that is well returned the chief calmly  my young men will hunt till they find where he is  then they will bring us the information and van der kemp will go out with a band and slay his enemy  no my friend said the hermit firmly that shall not be  i must get out of his way and in order to do so will leave you at once for there will be no further need for my services here  the chief looked at his friend in surprise  well he said you have a good judgment and understand your own affairs  but you have already rendered me good service and i will help you to flythough such is not the habit of the dyaks  there is a traders vessel to start for sumatra by the first light of day  will my friend go by that  i am grateful answered the hermit but i need no helpsave some provisions for i have my little canoe which will suffice  as this colloquy was conducted in the native tongue it was unintelligible to nigel but after the interview with the chief the hermit explained matters to him and bade moses get ready for a start several hours before dawn  you see we must do the first part of our trip in the dark for baderoon has a keen eye and ear  then we will land and sleep all day where the sharpest eye will fail to find usand luckily pirates have been denied the power of scenting out their foes  when night comes we will start again and get out of sight of land before the next dawn  mine frond said the professor turning his moonlike goggles full on the hermit  i vill go viz you  i should be only too happy to have your company returned the hermit but my canoe cannot by any contrivance be made to hold more than three  zat is no matter to me rejoined verkimier you forget zee traders boat  i vill go in zat to sumatra  ve vill find out zee port he is going to ant you vill meet me zere  vait for me if i have not arrivedor i vill vait for you  i have longed to visit sumatra ant vat better fronds could i go viz zan yourselfs  but my good friend returned the hermit my movements may not exactly suit yours  here they areyou can judge for yourself  first i will god permitting cross over to sumatra in my canoe  but it is tree hoondert miles across if not more  no matterthere are plenty of islands on the way  besides some passing vessel will give me a lift no doubt  then i will coast along to one of the eastern ports where i know there is a steamboat loading up about this time  the captain is an old friend of mine  he brought me and my companions the greater part of the way here  if i find him i will ask him to carry my canoe on his return voyage through sunda straits and leave it with another friend of mine at telok betong on the south coast of sumatranot far as you know from my home in krakatoa then i will proceed overland to the same place so that my friend nigel roy may see a little of the country  ant vat if you do not find your frond zee captain of zee steamer  why then i shall have to adopt some other plan  it is the uncertainty of my movements that makes me think you should not depend on them  zat is noting to me van der kemp you joost go as you say  i vill follow ant take my chance  i am use to ooncertainties ant difficoolties  zey can not influence me  after a good deal of consideration this plan was agreed to  the professor spent part of the night in giving directions about the preserving of his specimens which he meant to leave at the village in charge of a man whom he had trained to assist him while van der kemp with his companions lay down to snatch a little sleep before setting out on their voyage or as the dyak chief persisted in calling it their flight  when nigel had slept about five minutesas he thoughthe was awakened by moses  dont make a noise massa nadgel  dere may be spies in de camp for all we knows so we mus git off like mice  canoes ready an massa waitin we gib you to de last momint  in a few minutes our hero was sleepily following the negro through the woods to the spot where the canoe was in waiting  the night was very dark  this was in their favourat least as regarded discovery  but how shall we ever see to make our way down stream asked nigel of the hermit in a whisper on reaching the place of embarkation  the current will guide us  besides i have studied the river with a view to this flight  be careful in getting in  now moses are you ready  all right massa  shove off then  there was something so eerie in the subdued tones and stealthy motions and profound darkness that nigel could not help feeling as if they were proceeding to commit some black and criminal deed  floating with the current with as little noise as possible and having many a narrow escape of running against points of land and sandbanks they flew swiftly towards the sea so that dawn found them among the mud flats and the mangrove swamps  here they found a spot where mangrove roots and bushes formed an impenetrable screen behind which they spent the day chiefly in sleep and in absolute security  when darkness set in they again put forth and cautiously clearing the rivers mouth were soon far out on the open sea which was fortunately calm at the time the slight air that blew being in their favour  we are safe from pursuit now said van der kemp in a tone of satisfaction as they paused for a breathing spell  o massa exclaimed moses at that moment in a voice of consternation wes forgotten spinkie  so we have returned the hermit in a voice of regret so profound that nigel could scarce restrain a laugh in spite of his sympathy  but spinkie had not forgotten himself  observing probably that these night expeditions were a change in his masters habits he had kept an unusually watchful eye on the canoe so that when it was put in the water he had jumped on board unseen in the darkness and had retired to the place where he usually slept under hatches when the canoe travelled at night  awakened from refreshing sleep at the sound of his name spinkie emerged suddenly from the sternmanhole right under the negros nose and with a sleepy oo oo gazed up into his face  ho  dare you is you misrible hyperkrite exclaimed moses kissing the animal in the depth of his satisfaction  hes here massa all right  now you go to bed agin you small bundle ob hair  the creature retired obediently to its place and laying its little cheek on one of its small hands committed itself to repose  van der kemp was wrong when he said they were safe  a pirate scout had seen the canoe depart  being alone and distant from the rendezvous of his commander some time elapsed before the news could be conveyed to him  when baderoon was at length informed and had sailed out to sea in pursuit returning daylight showed him that his intended victim had escaped    chapter seventeen  tells of the joys etcetera of the professor in the sumatran forests also of a catastrophe averted  fortunately the weather continued fine at first and the light wind fair so that the canoe skimmed swiftly over the wide sea that separates borneo from sumatra  sometimes our travellers proceeded at night when the distance between islets compelled them to do so  at other times they landed on one of these isles when opportunity offered to rest and replenish the watercasks  we will not follow them step by step in this voyage which occupied more than a week and during which they encountered without damage several squalls in which a small open boat could not have lived  reaching at last the great island of sumatrawhich like its neighbour borneo is larger in extent than the british islandsthey coasted along southwards without further delay than was absolutely necessary for rest and refreshment until they reached a port where they found the steamer of which they were in search just about to start on its return voyage van der kemp committed his little craft to the care of the captain who after vainly advising his friend to take a free passage with him to the straits of sunda promised to leave the canoe in passing at telok betong  we may add that spinkie was most unwillingly obliged to accompany the canoe  now we must remain here till our friend verkimier arrives said the hermit turning to nigel after they had watched the steamer out of sight  i suppose we must said nigel who did not at all relish the delayof course we must he added with decision  i sees no ob course about it massa nadgel observed moses who never refrained from offering his opinion from motives of humility or of respect for his employer  my dvice is to go on an let de purfesser foller  but i promised to wait for him said the hermit with one of his kindly halfhumorous glances and you know i never break my promises  das true massa but you dint promise to wait for him for eber an eber  not quite but of course i meant that i would wait a reasonable time  the negro appeared to meditate for some moments on the extent of a reasonable time for his huge eyes became huger as he gazed frowningly at the ground  then he spoke  a reasonable time massa is such an oncertain timewariable so to speak accordin to the mind that tinks upon it  howseber if yous promised ob coorse dats an end ob it for wen a man promises hes bound to stick to it  such devotion to principle was appropriately rewarded the very next day by the arrival of the trading prahu in which the professor had embarked  we did not expect you nearly so soon said nigel as they heartily shook hands  it vas because zee vind freshen soon after ve set sailant zen ve made a straight line for zis port wereas you possibly crossed over ant zen push down zee coast  exactly so and that accounts for your overtaking us said the hermit is that the lad baso i see down there with the crew of the prahu  it is  you must have some strainch power of attracting frondship van der kemp for zee poor yout is so fond of you zat he began to entreat me to take him ant he says he vill go on vit zee traders if you refuse to let him follow you  well he may come  indeed we shall be the better for his services for i had intended to hire a man here to help to carry our things  much of our journeying you see must be done on foot  baso to his great joy thus became one of the party  we pass over the next few days which were spent in arranging and packing their provisions etcetera in such a way that each member of the party should carry on his shoulders a load proportioned to his strength  in this arrangement the professor much against his will was compelled to accept the lightest load in consideration of his liability to dart off in pursuit of creeping things and bootterflies at a moments notice  the least damageable articles were also assigned to him in consideration of his tendency at all times to tumble into bogs and stumble over fallen trees and lose himself and otherwise get into difficulties  we also pass over part of the journey from the coast and plunge with our travellers at once into the interior of sumatra  one evening towards sunset they reached the brow of an eminence which being rocky was free from much wood and permitted of a wide view of the surrounding country  it was covered densely with virgin forest and they ascended the eminence in order that the hermit who had been there before might discover a forest road which led to a village some miles off where they intended to put up for the night  having ascertained his exact position van der kemp led his followers down to this footpath which led through the dense forest  the trees by which they were surrounded were varied and magnificent some of them rising clear up seventy and eighty feet without a branch many of them had superb leafy crowns under any one of which hundreds of men might have found shelter  others had trunks and limbs warped and intertwined with a wild entanglement of huge creepers which hung in festoons and loops as if doing their best to strangle their supports themselves being also encumbered or adorned with ferns and orchids and delicate twining epiphytes  a forest of smaller trees grew beneath this shade and still lower down were thorny shrubs rattanpalms broadleaved bushes and a mass of tropical herbage which would have been absolutely impenetrable but for the native road or footpath along which they travelled  a most suitable abode for tigers i should think remarked nigel to the hermit who walked in front of himfor they marched in single file are there any in these parts  ay plenty  indeed it is because i dont like sleeping in their company that i am so anxious to reach a village  are zey dangerows asked the professor who followed close on nigel  well they are not safe replied the hermit  i had an adventure with one on this very road only two years ago  indeed vat vas it asked the professor whose appetite for anecdote was insatiable  do tell us about it  with pleasure  it was on a pitchdark night that it occurred  i had occasion to go to a neighbouring village at a considerable distance and borrowed a horse from a friend  anozer frond exclaimed the professor vy van der kemp zee country seems to be svarming vid your fronds  i have travelled much in it and made many friends returned the hermit  the horse that i borrowed turned out to be a very poor one and went lame soon after i set out  business kept me longer than i expected and it was getting dark before i started to return  ere long the darkness became so intense that i could scarcely see beyond the horses head and could not distinguish the path  i therefore let the animal find his own wayknowing that he would be sure to do so for he was going home  as we jogged along i felt the horse tremble  then he snorted and came to a dead stop with his feet planted firmly on the ground  i was quite unarmed but arms would have been useless in the circumstances  suddenly and fortunately the horse reared and next moment a huge dark object shot close past my faceso close that its fur brushed my cheekas it went with a heavy thud into the jungle on the other side  i knew that it was a tiger and felt that my life humanly speaking was due to the rearing of the poor horse  are ve near to zee spote asked the professor glancing from side to side in some anxiety  not far from it replied the hermit but there is not much fear of such an attack in broad daylight and with so large a party  ve are not a very large party returned the professor  i do not zink i would fear much to face a tiger vid my goot rifle but i do not relish his choomping on me unavares  push on please  they pushed on and reached the village a little before nightfall  hospitality is a characteristic of the natives of sumatra  the travellers were received with open arms so to speak and escorted to the public building which corresponds in some measure to our western townhalls  it was a huge building composed largely of bamboo woodenplanks and wickerwork with a high thatched roof and it stood like all the other houses on posts formed of great treestems which rose eight or ten feet from the ground  you have frunds here too i zink said verkimier to the hermit as they ascended the ladder leading to the door of the hall  well yesi believe i have two or three  there could be no doubt upon that point unless the natives were consummate hypocrites for they welcomed van der kemp and his party with effusive voice look and gesture and immediately spread before them part of a splendid supper which had just been prepared for they had chanced to arrive on a festive occasion  i do believe said nigel in some surprise that they are lighting up the place with petroleum lamps  ay and you will observe that they are lighting the lamps with congreve matchesat least with matches of the same sort supplied by the dutch and chinese  many of their old customs have passed away among others that of procuring fire by friction and now we have the appliances of western civilisation to replace them  no doubt steam is zee cause of zee change remarked the professor  that said nigel has a good deal to do with most thingsfrom the singing of a teakettle to the explosion of a volcano though doubtless the commercial spirit which is now so strong among men is the proximate cause  surely dese people mus be reech said the professor looking round him with interest  they are rich enoughand well off in every respect save that they dont know very well how to make use of their riches  as you see much of their wealth is lavished on their women in the shape of ornaments most of which are of solid gold and silver  there could be little doubt about that for besides the ornaments proper such as the bracelets and rings with which the arms of the young women were covered and earrings etceteraall of solid gold and nativemadethere were necklaces and collars composed of spanish and american dollars and british halfcrowns and other coins  in short these sumatran young girls carried much of the wealth of their parents on their persons and were entitled to wear it until they should be relegated to the ranks of the marriedthe supposedtobe unfrivolous and the evidently unadorned  as this was a region full of birds beasts and insects of many kinds it was resolved for the professors benefit that a few days should be spent in it  accordingly the village chief set apart a newlybuilt house for the visitors accommodation and a youth named grogo was appointed to wait on them and act as guide when they wished to traverse any part of the surrounding forest  the house was on the outskirts of the village a matter of satisfaction to the professor as it enabled him at once to plunge into his beloved work unobserved by the youngsters  it also afforded him a better opportunity of collecting moths etcetera by the simple method of opening his window at night  a mat or wickerwork screen divided the hut into two apartments one of which was entirely given over to the naturalist and his materiel  i vil begin at vonce said the eager man on taking possession  and he kept his word by placing his lamp on a table in a conspicuous position so that it could be well seen from the outside  then he threw his window wide open as a general invitation to the insect world to enter  moths flying beetles and other creatures were not slow to accept the invitation  they entered by twos fours sixesat last by scores insomuch that the room became uninhabitable except by the man himself and his comrades soon retired to their own compartment leaving him to carry on his work alone  you enjoy this sort of thing said nigel as he was about to retire  enchoy it yesit is paradise regained  he pinned a giant moth at the moment and gazed triumphant through his blue glasses  paradise lost to the moth anyhow said nigel with a nod as he bade him goodnight and carefully closed the wicker door to check the incursions of uncaptured specimens  being rather tired with the days journey he lay down on a mat beside the hermit who was already sound asleep  but our hero found that sleep was not easily attainable so close to an inexhaustible enthusiast whose every step produced a rattling of the bamboo floor and whose unwearied energy enabled him to hunt during the greater part of the night  at length slumber descended on nigels spirit and he lay for some time in peaceful oblivion when a rattling crash awoke him  sitting up he listened and came to the conclusion that the professor had upset some piece of furniture for he could hear him distinctly moving about in a stealthy manner as if on tiptoe giving vent to a grumble of dissatisfaction every now and then  what can he be up to now i wonder murmured the disturbed youth sleepily  the hermit who slept through all noises with infantine simplicity made no answer but a peculiar snort from the negro who lay not far off on his other side told that he was struggling with a laugh  hallo moses are you awake asked nigel in a low voice  ho yes massa nadgel  is bin wakin a good while larfin fit to bust my sides  de purfessers been agoin on like a mad renoceros for moren an hour  hes arter suthin which he cant ketch  listen  you hear im goin round an round on

thus the unsuccessful man relieved his feelings in a growling tone as he continued to move about on tiptoe rattling the bamboo flooring in spite of his careful efforts to move quietly  why verkimier what are you after cried nigel at last loud enough to be heard through the partition  ahi am sorry to vake you he replied without however suspending his hunt  i have tried my best to make no noice but zee bamboo floor ishah  i have im at last  what is it asked nigel becoming interested  von leetle bat  he come in vis a moss  a what  a mossa big beautiful moss  oh a mothwell  vell i shut zee window

friziigootness  zere goes zee lamp  the crash that followed told too eloquently of the catastrophe and broke the slumbers even of the hermit  the whole party sprang up and entered the naturalists room with a light for the danger from fire was great  fortunately the lamp had been extinguished in its fall so that beyond an overpowering smell of petroleum and the destruction of a good many specimens no serious results ensued  after securing the caelops frithii removing the shattered glass wiping up the oil and putting chairs and tables on their legs the professor was urged to go to bedadvice which in his excitement he refused to take until it was suggested that if he did not he would be totally unfit for exploring the forest next day  vy it is next day already he exclaimed consulting his watch  just so  now do turn in  i vill  and he did    chapter eighteen  a trying ordealdanger threatens and flight again resolved on  when the early birds are singing and the early mists are scattering and the early sun is rising to gladden as with the smile of god all things with life in earth and sea and skythen it is that earlyrising man goes forth to reap the blessings which his lazy fellowman fails to appreciate or enjoy  among the early risers that morning was our friend moses  gifted with an inquiring mind the negro had proceeded to gratify his propensities by making inquiries of a general nature and thus had acquired among other things the particular information that the river on the banks of which the village stood was full of fish  now moses was an ardent angler  i lub fishing he said one day to nigel when in a confidential mood i cant tell you how much i lub it  seems to me dat ders nuffin like it for proggin a man  when nigel demanded an explanation of what proggin meant moses said he wasnt quite sure  he could understand tings easy enough though he couldnt allers splain em  on the whole he thought that prog had a compound meaningit was a combination of poke and pull wid a flavour ob ticklin about it and was rather pleasant  you see he continued when a leetle fish plays wid your hook it progs your intellec an tickles up your fancy a leetle  when he grabs you dat progs your hopes a good deal  when a big fish do de same dat progs you deeper  an when a real walloper almost pulls you into de ribber dat progs your heart up into your troat where it stick till you land him  with surroundings and capacities such as we have attempted to describe it is no wonder that moses sat down on the riverbank and enjoyed himself in company with a little malay boy who lent him his bamboo rod and volunteered to show him the pools  but there were no particular pools in that river  it was a succession of pools and fish swarmed in all of them  there were at least fifteen different species which nothing short of an ichthyologist could enumerate correctly  the line used by moses was a single fibre of bark almost as strong as gut the hook was a white tinned weapon like a small anchor supplied by traders and meant originally for service in the deep sea  the bait was nothing in particular but as the fish were not particular that was of no consequence  the reader will not be surprised then when we state that in an hour or so moses had had his heart progged considerably and had filled a large bag with superb fish with which he returned perspiring beaming and triumphant to breakfast  after breakfast the whole party went forth for what verkimier styled zee business of zee day armed with guns spears botanical boxes bags wallets and butterflynets  in the immediate neighbourhood of the village large clearings in the forest were planted as coffee gardens each separated from the other for the purpose of isolation for it seems that coffee like the potato is subject to disease  being covered with scarlet flowers these gardens had a fine effect on the landscape when seen from the heights behind the village  passing through the coffee grounds the party was soon in the tangled thickets of underwood through which many narrow paths had been cut  we do not intend to drag our readers through bog and brake during the whole of this days expedition suffice it to say that the collection of specimens made of all kinds far surpassed the professors most sanguine expectations and as for the others those who could more or less intelligently sympathise did so while those who could not were content with the reflected joy of the man of science  at luncheonwhich they partook of on the riverbank under a magnificently umbrageous treeplans for the afternoon were fixed  we have kept together long enough i think said van der kemp  those of us who have guns must shoot something to contribute to the national feast on our return  vell let us divide assented the amiable naturalist  indeed he was so happy that he would have assented to anythingexcept giving up the hunt  von party can go von vay anoder can go anoder vay  i vill continue mine business  zee place is more of a paradise zan zee last ve must remain two or tree veeks  the hermit glanced at nigel  i fear it is impossible for me to do so said the latter  i am pledged to return to batavia within a specified time and from the nature of the country i perceive it will take all the time at my disposal to reach that place so as to redeem my pledge  ha  zat is a peety  vell nevair mind  let us enchoy today  com ve must not vaste more of it in zee mere gratification of our animal natures  acting on this broad hint they all rose and scattered in different groupsthe professor going off ahead of his party in his eager haste armed only with a butterflynet  now as the party of nativesincluding baso who carried the professors biggest box and grogo who bore his gundid not overtake their leader they concluded that he must have joined one of the other parties and as it was impossible to ascertain which of them they calmly went hunting on their own account  thus it came to pass that the man of science was soon lost in the depths of that primeval forest  but little cared the enthusiast for thator rather little did he realise it  with perspiration streaming from every poreexcept where the pores were stopped by mudhe dashed after bootterflies with the wisdom of solomon and the eagerness of a schoolboy and not until the shades of evening began to descend did his true position flash upon him  then with all the vigour of a powerful intellect and an enlightened mind he took it in at a glanceand came to a sudden halt  vat shall i do he asked  not even an echo answered and the animal kingdom was indifferent  lat me see  i have been vandering avay all dis time  now i have noting to do but rightaboutface and vander back  could reasoning be clearer or more conclusive  he acted on it at once but after wandering back a long time he did not arrive at any place or object that he had recognised on the outward journey  meanwhile as had been appointed the rest of the party met a short time before dark at the rendezvous where they had lunched  where is the professor baso asked van der kemp as he came up  baso did not know and looked at grogo who also professed ignorance but both said they thought the professor had gone with nigel  i thought he was with you said the latter looking anxiously at the hermit  hes hoed an lost hisself cried moses with a look of concern  van der kemp was a man of action  not a moment to lose he said and organised the band into several smaller parties each led by a native familiar with the jungle  let this be our meetingplace he said as they were on the point of starting off together and let those of us who have firearms discharge them occasionally  meanwhile the professor was walking at full speed in what he supposed to beand in truth wasback  he was not alone however  in the jungle close beside him a tiger prowled along with the stealthy lithe sneaking activity of a cat  by that time it was not absolutely dark but the forest had assumed a very sombre appearance  suddenly the tiger made a tremendous bound on to the track right in front of the man  whether it had miscalculated the position of its intended victim or not we cannot say but it crouched for another spring  the professor almost instinctively crouched also and being a brave man stared the animal straight in the face without winking and so the two crouched there absolutely motionless and with a fixed glare such as we have often seen in a couple of tomcats who were mutually afraid to attack each other  what the tiger thought at that critical and crucial moment we cannot tell but the professors thoughts were swift varied tremendous almost sublime and once or twice even ridiculous  vat shall i do  deaf stares me in zee face  no veapons only a net ant he is not a bootterfly  science adieu  home of my chilthood farevell  my moderhah zee fusees  such were a few of the thoughts that burned but found no utterance  the last thought however led to action  verkimier foolish man was a smoker  he carried fusees  slowly with no more apparent motion than the hourhand on the face of a watch he let his hand glide into his coatpocket and took out the box of fusees  the tiger seemed uneasy but the bold man never for one instant ceased to glare and no disturbed expression or hasty movement gave the tiger the slightest excuse for a spring  bringing the box up by painfully slow degrees in front of his nose the man opened it took out a fusee struck it and revealed the blue binoculars  the effect on the tiger was instantaneous and astounding  with a demivolt or backward somersault it hurled itself into the jungle whence it had come with a terrific roar of alarm and its tailundoubtedly though not evidentlybetween its legs  heaving a deep longdrawn sigh the professor stood up and wiped his forehead  then he listened intently  a shote if mine ears deceive me not he said and listened again  he was right  another shot much nearer was heard and he replied with a shout to which joy as much as strength of lung gave fervour  hurrying along the tracknot without occasional sideglances at the junglethe hero was soon again in the midst of his friends and it was not until his eyes refused to remain open any longer that he ceased to entertain an admiring circle that night with the details of his facetoface meeting with a tiger  but verkimiers anticipations in regard to that paradise were not to be realised  the evil passions of a wicked man with whom he had personally nothing whatever to do interfered with his plans  in the middle of the night a native malay youth named babu arrived at the village and demanded an interview with the chief  that worthy after the interview conducted the youth to the hut where his visitors lived and rousing van der kemp without disturbing the others bade him listen to what the young man had to say  an expression of great anxiety overspread the hermits usually placid countenance while babu was speaking  it is fate he murmured as if communing with himselfthen after a pauseno there is no such thing as fate  it is it must be the will of god  go young man mention this to no one  i thank you for the kindness which made you take so long a journey for my sake  it is not kindness it is love that makes me serve you returned the lad earnestly  every one loves you van der kemp because that curse of mankind revenge has no place in your breast  strange how little man does know or guess the secret thoughts of his fellow said the hermit with one of his pitiful smiles  revenge no place in mebut i thank you boy for the kind thought as well as the effort to save me  my life is not worth much to any one  it will not matter i think if my enemy should succeed  go now babu and god be with you  he will surely succeed if you do not leave this place at once rejoined the youth in a tone of decision  baderoon is furious at all times  he is worse than ever just now because you have thwarted his plansso it is saidvery often  if he knew that i am now thwarting them also he would hunt me to death  i will not leave you till you are safe beyond his reach  the hermit looked at the lad with kindly surprise  how comes it he said that you are so much interested in me  i remember seeing you two years ago but have no recollection of having done you any service  do you not remember that my mother was ill when you spent a night in our hut and my little sister was dying  you nursed her and tried your best to save her and when you could not save her and she died you wept as if the child had been your own  i do not forget that van der kemp  sympathy is of more value than service  strangely mistaken again murmured the hermit  who can know the workings of the human mind  self was mixed with my feelings profoundlyyet my sympathy with you and your mother was sincere  we never doubted that returned babu with a touch of surprise in his tone  well now what do you propose to do as you refuse to leave me asked the hermit with some curiosity  i will go on with you to the next village  it is a large one  the chief man there is my uncle who will aid me i know in any way i wish i will tell him what i know and have heard of the pirates intention of which i have proof  he will order baderoon to be arrested on suspicion when he arrives  then we will detain him till you are beyond his reach  that is not unjust  trueand i am glad to know by your last words that you are sensitive about the justice of what you propose to do  indifference to pure and simple justice is the great curse of mankind  it is not indeed the root but it is the fruit of our sins  the suspicion that detains baderoon is more than justified for i could bring many witnesses to prove that he has vowed to take my life and i know him to be a murderer  at breakfasttime van der kemp announced to his friends his intention of quitting the village at once and gave an account of his interview with the malay lad during the night  this of course reconciled them to immediate departurethough in truth the professor was the only one who required to be reconciled  it is very misfortunate he remarked with a sigh which had difficulty in escaping through a huge mass of fish and rice  you see zee vonderful variety of ornizological specimens i could find here ant zee herbareum not to mention zee magnificent

would be all de same  pass de venison massa nadgel an dont look as if you was goin to gib in aready  it spoils my appetite  you will have opportunities continued van der kemp addressing the professor to gather a good many specimens as we go along  besides if you will consent to honour my cave in krakatoa with a visit i promise you a hearty welcome and an interesting field of research  you have no idea what a variety of species in all the branches of natural history my little island contains  hereupon the hermit proceeded to enter into details of the flora fauna and geology of his islandhome and to expatiate in such glowing language on its arboreal and herbal wealth and beauty that the professor became quite reconciled to immediate departure  but how he asked am i to get zere ven ve reach zee seacoast for your canoe holds only tree as you have told me  there are plenty of boats to be had  besides i can send over my own boat for you to the mainland  the distance is not great  goot  zat vill do  i am happay now  so remarked nigel as he went off with moses to pack up his paradise regained is rather speedily to be changed into paradise forsaken  off wi the old love and on wi the new  the expulsive power of a new affection  das true massa nadgel observed moses who entertained profound admiration for anything that sounded like proverbial philosophy  de purfesser am an affectionit

service to my massa an also to de whole ob mankind    chapter nineteen  a terrible murder and a strange revelation  after letting the chief of the village know that the news just received rendered it necessary that they should proceed at once to the next townbut carefully refraining from going into particulars lest baderoon should by any means be led to suspect their intentionsthe party started off about daybreak under the guidance of the malay youth babu  anxious as he was that no evil should befall his friend nigel could not help wondering that a man of such a calm spirit and such unquestionable courage should be so anxious to escape from this pirate  i cant understand it at all he said to moses as they walked through the forest together a little in rear of the party  no more kin i massa nadgel answered the negro with one of those shakes of the head and glares of solemn perplexity with which he was wont to regard matters that were too deep for him  surely van der kemp is well able to take care of himself against any single foe  das true massa nadgelgainst any halfdozen foes as well  fear therefore cannot be the cause  the negro received this with a quiet chuckle  no said he  massa nebber knowed fear but ob dis you may be bery sure massas allers got good reasons for what he does  one tings sartin i neber saw him do nuffin for fear nor revenge nor anger no nor yet for fun allers for luband added moses after a moments thought sometimes for money when we goes on a tradin spiditionbut he dont make much account ob dat  well perhaps the mystery may be cleared up in time said nigel as they closed up with the rest of the party who had halted for a short rest and some refreshment  this last consisted largely of fruit which was abundant everywhere and a little rice with water from sparkling springs to wash it down  in the afternoon they reached the towna large one with a sort of marketplace in the centre which at the time of their arrival was crowded with people  strangers especially europeans were not often seen in that region so that van der kemp and his friends at once attracted a considerable number of followers  among these was one man who followed them about very unobtrusively usually hanging well in rear of the knot of followers whose curiosity was stronger than their sense of propriety  this man wore a broad sunhat and had a bandage round his head pulled well over one eye as if he had recently met with an accident or been wounded  he was unarmed with the exception of the kriss or long knife which every man in that region carries  this was no other than baderoon himself who had outwitted his enemies had somehow discovered at least part of their plans and had hurried on in advance of them to the town where disguising himself as described he awaited their arrival  babu conducted his friends to the presence of his kinsman the chief man of the town and having told his story received a promise that the pirate should be taken up when he arrived and put in prison  meanwhile he appointed to the party a house in which to spend the night  baderoon boldly accompanied the crowd that followed them saw the house glanced between the heads of curious natives who watched the travellers while eating their supper and noted the exact spot on the floor of the building where van der kemp threw down his mat and blanket thus taking possession of his intended couch  he did not however see that the hermit afterwards shifted his position a little and that babu desiring to be near his friend lay down on the vacated spot  in the darkest hour of the night when even the owls and bats had sought repose the pirate captain stole out of the brake in which he had concealed himself and kriss in hand glided under the house in which his enemy lay  native houses as we have elsewhere explained are usually built on posts so that there is an open space under the floors which is available as a store or lumberroom  it is also unfortunately available for evil purposes  the bamboo flooring is not laid so closely but that sounds inside may be heard distinctly by any one listening below voices were heard by the pirate as he approached which arrested his steps  they were those of van der kemp and nigel engaged in conversation  baderoon knew that as long as his enemy was awake and conversing he might probably be sitting up and not in a position suitable to his fell purpose  he crouched therefore among some lumber like a tiger abiding its time  why are you so anxious not to meet this man asked nigel who was resolved if possible without giving offence to be at the bottom of the mystery  for some moments the hermit was silent then in a constrained voice he said slowlybecause revenge burns fiercely in my breast  i have striven to crush it but cannot  i fear to meet him lest i kill him  has he then done you such foul wrong  ay he has cruellyfiendishlydone the worst he could  he robbed me of my only childbut i may not talk of it  the unholy desire for vengeance burns more fiercely when i talk  vengeance is mine saith the lord  my constant prayer is that i may not meet him  goodnight  as the hermit thus put an abrupt end to the conversation he lay down and drew his blanket over him  nigel followed his example wondering at what he had heard and in a few minutes their steady regular breathing told that they were both asleep  then baderoon advanced and counted the bamboo planks from the side towards the centre of the house  when looking between the heads of the people he had counted the same planks above  standing under one he looked up listened intently for a few seconds and drew his kriss  the place was almost pitchdark yet the blade caught a faint gleam from without which it reflected on the pirates face as he thrust the long keen weapon swiftly yet deliberately between the bamboos  a shriek that filled those who heard it with a thrill of horror rang out on the silent night  at the same moment a gush of warm blood poured over the murderers face before he could leap aside  instant uproar and confusion burst out in the neighbourhood and spread like wildfire until the whole town was aroused  when a light was procured and the people crowded into the hut where the strangers lay van der kemp was found on his knees holding the hand of poor babu who was at his last gasp  a faint smile that yet seemed to have something of gladness in it flitted across his pale face as he raised himself grasped the hermits hand and pressed it to his lips  then the fearful drain of blood took effect and he fell backdead  one great convulsive sob burst from the hermit as he leaped up drew his knife and with a fierce glare in his blue eyes rushed out of the room  vengeance would indeed have been wreaked on baderoon at that moment if the hermit had caught him but as might have been expected the murderer was nowhere to be found  he was hid in the impenetrable jungle which it was useless to enter in the darkness of night  when daybreak enabled the townspeople to undertake an organised search no trace of him could be discovered  flight personal safety formed no part of the pirates plan  the guilty man had reached that state of depravity which especially among the natives of that region borders close on insanity  while the inhabitants of the village were hunting far afield for him baderoon lay concealed among some lumber in rear of a hut awaiting his opportunity  it was not very long of coming  towards afternoon the various searching parties began to return and all assembled in the marketplace where the chief man with the hermit and his party were assembled discussing the situation  i will not now proceed until we have buried poor babu said van der kemp  besides baderoon will be sure to return  i will meet him now  i do not agree viz you mine frond said the professor  zee man is not a fool zough he is a villain  he knows vat avaits him if he comes  he will not come openly returned the hermit but he will not now rest till he has killed me  even as he spoke a loud shouting mingled with shrieks and yells was heard at the other end of the main street  the sounds of uproar appeared to approach and soon a crowd of people was seen rushing towards the marketplace uttering cries of fear in which the word amok was heard  at the sound of that word numbers of people specially women and childrenturned and fled from the scene but many of the men stood their ground and all of them drew their krisses among the latter of course were the white men and their native companions  we have already referred to that strange madness to which the malays seem to be peculiarly liable during the paroxysms of which those affected by it rush in blind fury among their fellows slaying right and left  from the terrified appearance of some of the approaching crowd and the maniac shouts in rear it was evident that a man thus possessed of the spirit of amok was venting his fury on them  another minute and he drew near brandishing a kriss that dripped with the gore of those whom he had already stabbed  catching sight of the white men he made straight for them  he was possessed of only one eye but that one seemed to concentrate and flash forth the fire of a dozen eyes while his dishevelled hair and bloodstained face and person gave him an appalling aspect  it is baderoon said van der kemp in a subdued but stern tone  nigel who stood next to him glanced at the hermit  his face was deadly pale his eyes gleamed with a strange almost unearthly light and his lips were firmly compressed  with a sudden nervous motion unlike his usually calm demeanour he drew his long knife and to nigels surprise cast it away from him  at that moment a woman who came in the madmans way was stabbed by him to the heart and rent the air with her dying shriek as she fell  no one could have saved her the act was so quickly done  van der kemp would have leaped to her rescue but it was too late besides there was no need to do so now for the maniac recognising his enemy rushed at him with a shout that sounded like a triumphant yell  seeing this and that his friend stood unarmed as well as unmoved regarding baderoon with a fixed gaze nigel stepped a pace in advance to protect him but van der kemp seized his arm and thrust him violently aside  next moment the pirate was upon him with uplifted knife but the hermit caught his wrist and with a heave worthy of samson hurled him to the ground where he lay for a moment quite stunned  before he could recover the natives who had up to this moment held back sprang upon the fallen man with revengeful yells and a dozen knives were about to be buried in his breast when the hermit sprang forward to protect his enemy from their fury  but the man whose wife had been the last victim came up at the moment and led an irresistible rush which bore back the hermit as well as his comrades who had crowded round him and in another minute the maniac was almost hacked to pieces  i did not kill himthank god muttered van der kemp as he left the marketplace where the relatives of those who had been murdered were wailing over their dead  after this event even the professor was anxious to leave the place so that early next morning the party resumed their journey intending to make a short stay at the next village  failing to reach it that night however they were compelled to encamp in the woods  fortunately they came upon a hill which although not very high was sufficiently so with the aid of watchfires to protect them from tigers  from the summit which rose just above the treetops they had a magnificent view of the forest  many of the trees were crowned with flowers among which the setting sun shone for a brief space with glorious effulgence  van der kemp and nigel stood together apart from the others contemplating the wonderful scene  what must be the dwellingplace of the creator himself when his footstool is so grand said the hermit in a low voice  that is beyond mortal ken said nigel  truetrue  eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor mind conceived it yet methinks the glory of the terrestrial was meant to raise our souls to the contemplation of the celestial  and yet how signally it has failed in the case of baderoon returned nigel with a furtive glance at the hermit whose countenance had quite recovered its look of quiet simple dignity  would it be presumptuous if i were to ask why it is that this pirate had such bitter enmity against you  it is no secret answered the hermit in a sad tone  the truth is i had discovered some of his nefarious plans and more than once have been the means of preventing his intended deeds of violenceas in the case of the dyaks whom we have so lately visited  besides the man had done me irreparable injury and it is one of the curious facts of human experience that sometimes those who injure us hate us because they have done so  may i venture to ask for a fuller account of the injury he did you said nigel with some hesitancy  for some moments the hermit did not answer  he was evidently struggling with some suppressed feeling  turning a look full upon his young friend he at length spoke in a low sad voicei have never mentioned my grief to mortal man since that day when it pleased god to draw a cloud of thickest darkness over my life  but nigel there is that in you which encourages confidence  i confess that more than once i have been tempted to tell you of my grieffor human hearts crave intelligent sympathy  my faithful servant and friend moses is no doubt intensely sympathetic butbutwell i cannot understand still less can i explain why i shrink from making a confidant of him  certainly it is not because of his colour for i hold that the souls of men are colourless  i need not trouble you with the story of my early life continued the hermit  i lost my dear wife a year after our marriage and was left with a little girl whose lovely face became more and more like that of her mother every day she lived  my soul was wrapped up in the child after three years i went with her as a passenger to batavia  on the way we were attacked by a couple of pirate junks  baderoon was the pirate captain  he killed many of our men took some of us prisoners sank the vessel seized my child and was about to separate us putting my child into one junk while i was retained bound in the other  he paused and gazed over the glowing treetops into the golden horizon with a longing wistful look  at the same time something like an electric shock passed through nigels frame for was not this narrative strangely similar in its main features to that which his own father had told him on the keeling islands about beautiful little kathleen holbein and her father  he was on the point of seizing the hermit by the hand and telling him what he knew when the thought occurred that attacks by pirates were common enough in those seas that other fathers might have lost daughters in this way and that perhaps his suspicion might be wrong  it would be a terrible thing he thought to raise hope in his poor friends breast unless he were pretty sure of the hope being well founded  he would wait and hear more  he had just come to this conclusion and managed to subdue the feelings which had been aroused when van der kemp turned to him again and continued his narrativei know not how it was unless the lord gave me strength for a purpose as he gave it to samson of old but when i recovered from the stinging blow i had received and saw the junk hoist her sails and heard my child scream i felt the strength of a lion come over me i burst the bonds that held me and leaped into the sea intending to swim to her  but it was otherwise ordained  a breeze which had sprung up freshened and the junk soon left me far behind  as for the other junk i never saw it again for i never looked back or thought of itonly as i left it i heard a mocking laugh from the oneeyed villain who i afterwards found out owned and commanded both junks  nigel had no doubt now but the agitation of his feelings still kept him silent  need i say continued the hermit that revenge burned fiercely in my breast from that day forward  if i had met the man soon after that i should certainly have slain him  but god mercifully forbade it  since then he has opened my eyes to see the crucified one who prayed for his enemies  and up till now i have prayed most earnestly that baderoon and i might not meet  my prayer has not been answered in the way i wished but a better answer has been granted for the sin of revenge was overcome within me before we met  van der kemp paused again  go on said nigel eagerly  how did you escape  escape  where was ioh  i remember said the hermit awaking as if out of a dream well i swam after the junk until it was out of sight and then i swam on in silent despair until so completely exhausted that i felt consciousness leaving me  then i knew that the end must be near and i felt almost glad but when i began to sink the natural desire to prolong life revived and i struggled on  just as my strength began a second time to fail i struck against something  it was a dead cocoanut tree  i laid hold of it and clung to it all that night  next morning i was picked up by some fishermen who were going to telok betong by the outer passage round sebesi island and were willing to land me there  but as my business connections had been chiefly with the town of anjer i begged of them to land me on the island of krakatoa  this they did and it has been my home ever since  i have been there many years  have you never seen or heard of your daughter since asked nigel eagerly and with deep sympathy  neveri have travelled far and near all over the archipelago into the interior of the islands great and small but have failed to find her  i have long since felt that she must be deadforfor she could not live with the monsters who stole her away  a certain contraction of the mouth as he said this and a gleam of the eyes suggested to nigel that revenge was not yet dead within the hermits breast although it had been overcome  what was her name asked nigel willing to gain time to think how he ought to act and being afraid of the effect that the sudden communication of the news might have on his friend  winniedarling winnieafter her mother said the hermit with deep pathos in his tone  a feeling of disappointment came over our hero  winnie bore not the most distant resemblance to kathleen  did you ever during your search asked nigel slowly visit the cocoskeeling islands  never  they are too far from where the attack on us was made  and you never heard of a gunboat having captured a pirate junk and  why do you ask and why pause said the hermit looking at his friend in some surprise  nigel felt that he had almost gone too far  well you know he replied in some confusion youyou are right when you expect me to sympathise with your great sorrow which i do most profoundly andandin short i would give anything to be able to suggest hope to you my friend  men should never give way to despair  thank you  it is kindly meant returned the hermit looking at the youth with his sad smile  but it is vain  hope is dead now  they were interrupted at this point by the announcement that supper was ready  at the same time the sun sank like the hermits hope and disappeared beyond the dark forest    chapter twenty  nigel makes a confidant of mosesundertakes a lonely watch and sees something wonderful  it was not much supper that nigel roy ate that night  the excitement resulting from his supposed discovery reduced his appetite seriously and the intense desire to open a safetyvalve in the way of confidential talk with some one induced a nervously absent disposition which at last attracted attention  you vant a goot dose of kvinine remarked verkimier when having satiated himself he found time to think of othersnot that the professor was selfish by any means only he was addicted to concentration of mind on all work in hand inclusive of feeding  the hermit paid no attention to anything that was said  his recent conversation had given vent to a flood of memories and feelings that had been pentup for many years  after supper nigel resolved to make a confidant of moses  the negros fidelity to and love for his master would ensure his sympathy at least if not wise counsel  moses he said when the professor had raised himself to the seventh heaven by means of tobacco fumes come with me  i want to have a talk  das what is allers wantin massa nadgel talkins my strong point if i hab a strong point at all  they went together to the edge of a cliff on the hilltop whence they could see an almost illimitable stretch of tropical wilderness bathed in a glorious flood of moonlight and sat down  on a neighbouring cliff which was crowned with a mass of grasses and shrubs a small monkey also sat down on a fallen branch and watched them with pathetic interest tempered it would seem by cutaneous irritation  moses i am sorely in need of advice said nigel turning suddenly to his companion with illsuppressed excitement  well massa nadgel you does look like it but im sorry i aint a doctor  praps de purfesser would help you better nor  you misunderstand me  can you keep a secret moses  i kin tryifif hes not too diffikilt to keep  well then listen  the negro opened his eyes and his mouth as if these were the chief orifices for the entrance of sound and advanced an ear  the distant monkey observing apparently that some unusual communication was about to be made also stretched out its little head cocked an ear and suspended its other operations  then in low earnest tones nigel told moses of his belief that van der kemps daughter might yet be alive and well and detailed the recent conversation he had had with his master  now moses what dye think of all that  profundity unfathomable sat on the negros sable brow as he replied massa nadgel i dont bery well know what to tink  but remember moses before we go further that i tell you all this in strict confidence not a word of it must pass your lips  the awful solemnity with which nigel sought to impress this on his companion was absolutely trifling compared with the expression of that companions countenance as with a longdrawn argumentative and remonstrative oh he replied  massa nadgel  does you really tink i would say or do any mortal ting watsumiver as would injure my massa  im sure you would not returned nigel quickly  forgive me moses i merely meant that you would have to be very cautiousvery carefulthat you do not let a word slipby accident you knowi believe youd sooner die than do an intentional injury to van der kemp if i thought you capable of that i think i would relieve my feelings by giving you a good thrashing  the listening monkey cocked its ear a little higher at this and moses who had at first raised his flat nose indignantly in the air gradually lowered it while a benignant smile supplanted indignation  youre right dere massa nadgel  id die a tousand times sooner dan injure massa  as to your last obserwation it rouses two idees in my mind  first i wonder how youd manidge to gib me a trashin an second i wonder if your own moder would rikognise you arter youd tried it  at this the monkey turned its other ear as if to make quite sure that it heard aright  nigel laughed shortly  but seriously moses he continued what do you think i should do should i reveal my suspicions to van der kemp  cernly not answered the negro with prompt decision  what wake up all his old hopes to hab em all dashed to bits praps when you find dat yous wrong  but i feel absolutely certain that im not wrong returned nigel excitedly  considerthere is first the oneeyed pirate second there is  scuse me massa nadgel deres no occasion to go all ober it again ill tell you what you do  well exclaimed nigel anxiously while his companion frowned savagely under the force of the thoughts that surged through his brain  heres what youll do said moses  well  impatiently as the negro paused

toothandgumdisclosing smile to see your fadder when he gits dat letter  the picture conjured up by his vivid imagination caused the negro to give way to an explosive laugh that sent the eavesdropping monkey like a brown thunderbolt into the recesses of its native jungle while nigel went off to write and despatch the important letter  next day the party arrived at another village where the report of their approach having preceded them they were received with much ceremonyall the more that the professors power with the rifle had been made known and that the neighbourhood was infested by tigers  there can be little doubt that at this part of the journey the travellers must have been dogged all the way by tigers and it was matter for surprise that so small a party should not have been molested possibly the reason was that these huge members of the feline race were afraid of white faces being unaccustomed to them or perchance the appearance and vigorous stride of even a few stalwart and fearless men had intimidated them  whatever the cause the party reached the village without seeing a single tiger though their footprints were observed in many places  the wild scenery became more and more beautiful as this village was neared  although flowers as a rule were small and inconspicuous in many parts of the great forest through which they passed the rich pink and scarlet of many of the opening leaves and the autumntinted foliage which lasts through all seasons of the year fully made up for the want of themat least as regards colour while the whole vegetation was intermingled in a rich confusion that defies description  the professor went into perplexed raptures his mind being distracted by the exuberant wealth of subjects which were presented to it all at the same time  look zere he cried at one turning in the path which opened up a new vista of exquisite beautylook at zat  ay it is a siamang apenext in size to the orangutan said van der kemp who stood at his friends elbow  the animal in question was a fine fullgrown specimen with long jetblack glancing hair  its height might probably have been a few inches over three feet and the stretch of its arms over rather than under five feet but at the great height at which it was seennot less than eighty feetit looked much like an ordinary monkey  it was hanging in the most easy nonchalant way by one hand from the branch of a tree utterly indifferent to the fact that to drop was to die  the instant the siamang observed the travellers it set up a loud barking howl which made the woods resound but it did not alter its position or seem to be alarmed in any degree  vat a straordinary noise remarked the professor  it is indeed returned the hermit and it has an extraordinary appliance for producing it  there is a large bag under its throat extending to its lips and cheeks which it can fill with air by means of a valve in the windpipe  by expelling this air in sudden bursts it makes the varied sounds you hear  mos vonderful  a sort of natural airgun  i vill shoot it said the professor raising his deadly rifle and there is no doubt that the poor siamang would have dropped in another moment if van der kemp had not quietly and gravely touched his friends elbow just as the explosion took place  hah you tooched me exclaimed the disappointed naturalist looking fiercely round while the amazed ape sent forth a bursting crack of its airgun as it swung itself into the treetop and made off  yes i touched you and if you will shoot when i am so close to you you cannot wonder at itespecially when you intend to take life uselessly  the time now at the disposal of my friend nigel roy will not permit of our delaying long enough to kill and preserve large specimens to say truth my friend we must press on now as fast as we can for we have a very long way to go  verkimier was not quite pleased with this explanation but there was a sort of indescribable power about the hermit when he was resolved to have his way that those whom he led found it impossible to resist  on arriving at the village they were agreeably surprised to find a grand banquet consisting chiefly of fruit with fowl rice and indian corn spread out for them in the balai or public hall where also their sleeping quarters were appointed  an event had recently occurred however which somewhat damped the pleasure of their reception  a young man had been killed by a tiger  the brute had leaped upon him while he and a party of lads were traversing a narrow path through the jungle and had killed him with one blow of its paw  the other youths courageously rushed at the beast with their spears and axes and driving it off carried the body of their comrade away  we have just buried the young man said the chief of the village and have set a trap for the tiger for he will be sure to visit the grave  my friends would like to see this trap said the hermit who of course acted the part of interpreter wherever they went being well acquainted with most of the languages and dialects of the archipelago  there will yet be daylight after you have finished eating said the chief  although anxious to go at once to see this trap they felt the propriety of doing justice to what had been provided for them and sat down to their meal for which to say truth they were quite ready  then they went with a large band of armed natives to see this curious tigertrap the bait of which was the grave of a human being  the grave was close to the outskirts of the village and on one side the jungle came up to within a few yards of it  the spot was surrounded by a strong and high bamboo fence except at one point where a narrow but very conspicuous opening had been left  here a sharp spear was so arranged beside the opening that it could be shot across it at a point corresponding with the height of a tigers heart from the groundas well at least as that point could be estimated by men who were pretty familiar with tigers  the motive power to propel this spear was derived from a green bamboo so strong that it required several powerful men to bend it in the form of a bow  a species of trigger was arranged to let the bent bow fly and a piece of fine cord passed from this across the opening about breasthigh for a tiger  the intention was that the animal in entering the enclosure should become its own executioner should commit unintentional suicide if we may so put it  i have an ambition to shoot a tiger said nigel to van der kemp that evening  do you think the people would object to my getting up into a tree with my rifle and watching beside the grave part of the night  i am sure that they would not  but your watch will probably be in vain for tigers are uncommonly sagacious creatures and seem to me to have exceptional powers for scenting danger  no matter i will try  accordingly a little before dark that evening our hero borrowed the professors doublebarrelled rifle being more suitable for large game than his own gun and sauntered with moses down to the grave where he ensconced himself in the branches of a large tree about thirty feet from the ground  the form of the tree was such that among its forks nigel could form a sort of nest in which he could sit in full view of the poor youths grave without the risk of falling to the ground even if he should chance to drop asleep  goodnight massa nadgel said moses as he turned to leave his companion to his solitary vigil  see you not go to sleep  no fear of that said nigel  an whateber you do dont miss  ill do my bestgoodnight  while there was yet a little daylight our hunter looked well about him took note of the exact position of the fence the entrance to the enclosure and the grave judged the various distances of objects and arranged the sights of the rifle which was already loaded with a brace of hardened balls  then he looked up through the treetops and wished for darkness  it came sooner than he expected  night always descends more suddenly in tropical than in temperate regions  the sun had barely dipped below the horizon when night seemed to descend like a pall over the jungle and an indescribable sensation of eerieness crept over nigels spirit  objects became very indistinct and he fancied that he saw something moving on the newlymade grave  with a startled feeling he grasped his weapon supposing that the tiger must have entered the enclosure with catlike stealth  on second thoughts however he discarded the idea for the entrance was between him and the grave and still seemed quite visible do what he would however the thought of ghosts insisted on intruding upon him  he did not believe in ghostsoh nohad always scouted the idea of their existence  why therefore did he feel uncomfortable  he could not tell  it must simply be the excitement natural to such a very new and peculiar situation  he would think of something else  he would devote his mind to the contemplation of tigers  in a short time the moon would rise he knewthen he would be able to see better  while he was in this very uncomfortable state of mind with the jungle wrapped in profound silence as well as gloom there broke on the night air a wail so indescribable that the very marrow in nigels bones seemed to shrivel up  it ceased but again broke forth louder than before increasing in length and strength until his ears seemed to tingle with the sound and then it died away to a sigh of unutterable woe  i have always muttered nigel believed myself to be a man of ordinary courage but nowi shall write myself a coward if not an ass  he attempted to laugh at this pleasantry but the laugh was hollow and seemed to freeze in his gullet as the wail broke forth again ten times more hideous than at first  after a time the wail became more continuous and the watcher began to get used to it  then a happy thought flashed into his mindthis was perhaps some sort of mourning for the dead  he was right  the duty of the father of the poor youth who had been killed was for several days after the funeral to sit alone in his house and chant from sunset till daybreak a deathdirge or as it is called the tjerita bari  it was not till next day that this was told to him but meanwhile the surmise afforded him instantaneous relief  as if nature sympathised with his feelings the moon arose at the same time and dispelled the thick darkness though it was not till much later that sailing across a clear sky she poured her bright beams through the treetops and finally rested on the dead mans grave  by that time nigel had quite recovered his equanimity and mentally blotted out the writing of coward and ass which he had written against himself  but another trouble now assailed him  he became sleepy  halfadozen times at least within halfanhour he started wide awake under the impression that he was falling off the tree  this will never do he exclaimed rising to his feet resting his rifle in a position of safety and then stretching himself to his utmost extent so that he became thoroughly awake  after this rouser as he called it he sat down again and almost immediately fell fast asleep  how long he sat in this condition it is impossible to say but he opened his eyes at length with an indescribable sensation that something required attention and the first thing they rested on for daylight was dawning was an enormous tiger not forty yards away from him gliding like a shadow and with catlike stealth towards the opening of the enclosure  the sight was so sudden and so unexpected that for the moment he was paralysed  perhaps he thought it was a dream  before he could recover presence of mind to seize his rifle the breast of the animal had touched the fatal line the trigger was drawn the stout bamboo straightened with a booming sound and the spearor rather the giant arrowwas shot straight through the tigers side  then occurred a scene which might well have induced nigel to imagine that he dreamt for the transfixed creature bounded into the enclosure with a terrific roar that rang fearfully through the arches of the hitherto silent forest  rushing across the grave it sprang with one tremendous bound right over the high fence carrying the spear along with it into the jungle beyond  by that time nigel was himself again with rifle in hand but too late to fire  the moment he heard the thud of the tigers descent he slid down the tree and forgetful or regardless of dangerwent crashing into the jungle while the yells and shouts of hundreds of aroused natives suggested the peopling of the region with an army of fiends  but our hero had not to go far  in his haste he almost tumbled over the tiger  it was lying stone dead on the spot where it had fallen  a few minutes more and the natives came pouring round him wild with excitement and joy  soon he was joined by his own comrades  well youve managed to shoot him i see said van der kemp as he joined the group  alas no  i have not fired a shot said nigel with a half disappointed look  yous got de better ob him anyhow remarked moses as he pushed to the front  the spear got the better of him moses  vell now zat is a splendid animal  lat me see said the professor pulling out his tapemeasure  it was with difficulty that the man of science made and noted his measurements for the people were pressing eagerly round the carcase to gratify their revenge by running their spears into the still warm body they dipped the points in the blood and passed their krisses broadside over the creature that they might absorb the courage and boldness which were supposed to emanate from it  then they skinned it and pieces of the heart and brain were eaten raw by some of those whose relatives had been killed by tigers  finally the skull was hacked to pieces for the purpose of distributing the teeth which are used by the natives as charms    chapter twenty one  in which the professor distinguishes himself  leaving this village immediately after the slaying of the tiger the party continued to journey almost by forced marches for not only was nigel roy very anxious to keep tryst with his father and to settle the question of kathleens identity by bringing father and daughter together but van der kemp himself strange to say was filled with intense and unaccountable anxiety to get back to his islandhome  i dont know how it is he said to nigel as they walked side by side through the forest followed by moses and the professor who had become very friendly on the strength of a certain amount of vacant curiosity displayed by the former in regard to scientific mattersi dont know how it is but i feel an unusually strong desire to get back to my cave i have often been absent from home for long periods at a time but have never before experienced these strange longings  i say strange because there is no such thing as an effect without a cause  may not the cause be presentiment suggested nigel who knowing what a tremendous possibility for the hermit lay in the future felt a little inclined to be superstitious  it did not occur to him just then that an equally if not more tremendous possibility lay in the future for himselftouching his recent discovery or suspicion  i do not believe in presentiments returned the hermit  they are probably the result of indigestion or a disordered intellect from neither of which complaints do i sufferat least not consciously  but you have never before left home in such peculiar circumstances said nigel  have you not told me that this is the first time for about two hundred years that krakatoa has broken out in active eruption  true but that cannot be to me the cause of longings or anxieties for i have seen many a longdormant crater become active without any important result either to me or to any one else  stop stop cried professor verkimier in a hoarse whisper at that moment look look at zee monkeys  monkeys are very abundant in sumatra but the nest of them which the travellers discovered at that time and which had called forth the professors admiration was enoughas moses saidto make a renocerus laugh  the trees around absolutely swarmed with monkeys those of a slender form and with very long tails being most numerous  they were engaged in some sort of game swinging by arms legs and tails from branches holding on to or chasing each other and taking the most astonishing leaps in circumstances where a slip would have no doubt resulted in broken limbs or in death  stand still  oh do stand stilllike you vas petrivied said the professor in a low voice of entreaty  being quite willing to humour him the whole party stood immovable like statues and thus avoided attracting the attention of the monkeys who continued their game  it seemed to be a sort of follow my leader for one big strong fellow led off with a bound from one branch to another which evidently tried the nerves of his more timid and less agile companions  they all succeeded however from the largest even to the smallestwhich last was a very tiny creature with a pink face a sad expression and a corkscrew tail  for a time they bounded actively among the branches now high now low till suddenly the big leader took a tremendous leap as if for the express purpose of baffling or testing his companions  it was immensely amusing to see the degrees of trepidation with which the others followed  the last two seemed quite unable to make up their minds to the leap until the others seemed about to disappear when one of them took heart and bounded wildly across  thus little pinkface with the corkscrew tail was left alone  twice did that little monkey make a desperate resolution to jump and twice did its little heart fail as it measured the distance between the branches and glanced at the abyss below  its companions seemed to entertain a feeling of pity for it numbers of them came back as if to watch the jump and encourage the little one  a third time it made an abortive effort to spring and looked round pitifully whereupon moses gave vent to an uncontrollable snort of suppressed laughter  vat you mean by zat growled the professor angrily  the growl and snort together revealed the intruders and all the monkeys except pinkface crowding the trees above the spot where they stood gazed down upon them with expressions in which unparalleled indignation and inconceivable surprise struggled for the mastery  then with a wild shriek the whole troop fled into the forest  this was too much for poor halfpetrified pinkface with the twisted tail  seeing that its comrades were gone in earnest it became desperate flung itself frantically into the air with an agonising squeak missed its mark went crashing through the slender branches and fell to the ground  fortunately these branches broke its fall so that it arose unhurt bounded into a bush still squeaking with alarm and made after its friends  why did you not shoot it professor asked nigel laughing as much at verkimiers grave expression as at the little monkeys behaviour  vy did i not shot it echoed the professor  i vould as soon shot a baby  zee pluck of zat leetle creature is admirable  it vould be a horrible shame to take his life  no  i do love to see ploock vezer in man or beast  he could not shoomp zat  he knew he could not shoomp it but he tried to shoomp it  he vould not be beat an i vould not kill himzough i vant im very mooch for a specimen  it seemed as if the professor was to be specially rewarded for his selfdenial on this occasion for while he was yet speaking a soft hush from van der kemp caused the whole party to halt in dead silence and look at the hermit inquiringly  you are in luck professor he murmured in a soft low voicevery different from that hissing whisper which so many people seem to imagine is an inaudible utterance  i see a splendid argus pheasant over there making himself agreeable to his wife  vare oh vare exclaimed the enthusiast with blazing eyes for although he had already seen and procured specimens of this most beautiful creature he had not yet seen it engage in the strange lovedanceif we may so call itwhich is peculiar to the bird  youll never get near enough to see it if you hiss like a serpent said the hermit  get out your binoculars follow me and hold your tongue all of youthat will be the safest plan  tread lightly  it was a sight to behold the professor crouching almost double in order to render himself less conspicuous with his hat pushed back and the blue glasses giving him the appearance of a greateyed seal  he carried his butterflynet in one hand and the unfailing rifle in the other  fortunately the hermits sharp and practised eye had enabled him to distinguish the birds in the distance before their advance had alarmed them so that they were able to reach a mound topped with low bushes over which they could easily watch the birds  zat is very koorious an most interesting murmured the professor after a short silence  he was right  there were two argus pheasants a male and femalethe male alone being decorated superbly  the argus belongs to the same family as the peacock but is not so gaudy in colouring and therefore perhaps somewhat more pleasing  its tail is formed chiefly by an enormous elongation of the two tail quills and of the secondary wing feathers no two of which are exactly the same and the closer they are examined the greater is seen to be the extreme beauty of their markings and the rich varied harmony of their colouring  when a male argus wishes to show off his magnificence to his spouseor when she asks him to show it off we know not whichhe makes a circle in the forest some ten or twelve feet in diameter which he clears of every leaf twig and branch  on the margin of this circus there is invariably a projecting branch or overarching root a few feet above the ground on which the female takes her place to watch the exhibition this consists of the male strutting about pluming his feathers and generally displaying his gorgeous beauty  vat ineffable vanity exclaimed the professor after gazing for some time in silence  his own folly in thus speaking was instantly proved by the two birds bringing the exhibition to an abrupt close and hastily taking wing  not long after seeing this they came to a small but deep and rapid river which for a time checked their progress for there was no ford and the porters who carried verkimiers packages seemed to know nothing about a bridge either natural or artificial  after wandering for an hour or so along its banks however they found a giant tree which had fallen across the stream and formed a natural bridge  on the other side of the stream the ground was more rugged and the forest so dense that they had to walk in a sort of twilightonly a glimpse of blue sky being visible here and there through the treetops in some places however there occurred bright little openings which swarmed with species of metallic tigerbeetles and sandbees and where sulphur swallowtailed and other butterflies sported their brief life away over the damp ground by the waters edge  the native forest path which they followed was little better than a tunnel cut through a grove of low rattanpalms the delicate but exceedingly tough tendrils of which hung down in all directions  these were fringed with sharp hooks which caught their clothing and tore it or held on unrelentingly so that the only way of escape was to step quietly back and unhook themselves  this of itself would have rendered their progress slow as well as painful but other things tended to increase the delay  at one place they came to a tree about seven feet in diameter which lay across the path and had to be scrambled over and this was done with great difficulty  at another a gigantic mudbath the wallowing hole of a herd of elephantsobstructed the way and a yell from one of the porters told that in attempting to cross it he had fallen in up to the waist  a comrade in trying to pull him out also fell in and sank up to the armpits  but they got over itas resolute men always dosomehow  zis is horrible exclaimed the professor panting from his exertions and making a wild plunge with his insectnet at some living creature hah zee brute  i have im  the man of science was flat on his stomach as he spoke with arm outstretched and the net pressed close to the ground while a smile of triumph beamed through the mud and scratches on his face  what have you got asked nigel doing his best to restrain a laugh  a splendid ornitoptera a dayflying moss said verkimier as he cautiously rose vich mimics zee trepsichrois mulciber  ant zis very morning i caught von leptocircus virescens vich derives protection from mimicking zee habits ant appearance of a dragonfly  what rubbish dat purfesser do talk remarked moses in an undertone to the hermit as they moved on again  not such rubbish as it sounds to you moses  these are the scientific names of the creatures and you know as well as he does that many creatures think they find it advantageous to pretend to be what they are not  man himself is not quite free from this characteristic  indeed you have a little of it yourself said the hermit with one of his twinkling glances  when you are almost terrified out of your wits dont you pretend that theres nothing the matter with you  nebber massa nebber answered the negro with remonstrative gravity when is nigh out ob my wits sos my innards feels like nuffin but warmish water i gits whiteygrey in de chops so is told an blue in de lips an i pretends nuffini dont care who sees it  the track for some distance beyond this point became worse and worse then the nature of the ground changed somewhatbecame more hilly and the path if such it could be styled more rugged in some places more swampy in others while to add to their discomfort rain began to fall and night set in dark and dismal without any sign of the village of which they were in search  by that time the porters who carried verkimiers boxes seemed so tired that the hermit thought it advisable to encamp but the ground was so wet and the leeches were so numerous that they begged him to go on assuring him that the village could not be far distant  in another halfhour the darkness became intense so that a man could scarcely see his fellow even when within two paces of him  ominous mutterings and rumblings like distant thunder also were heard which appeared to indicate an approaching storm  in these circumstances encamping became unavoidable and the order was given to make a huge fire to scare away the tigers which were known to be numerous and the elephants whose fresh tracks had been crossed and followed during the greater part of the day  the track of a rhinoceros and a tapir had also been seen but no danger was to be anticipated from those creatures  shall we have a stormy night think you asked nigel as he assisted in striking a light  it may be so replied the hermit flinging down one after another of his wet matches which failed to kindle  what we hear may be distant thunder but i doubt it  the sounds seem to me more like the mutterings of a volcano  some new crater may have burst forth in the sumatran ranges  this thick darkness inclines me to think soespecially after the new activity of volcanic action we have seen so recently at krakatoa  let me try your matches nigel perhaps they have escaped mine are useless  but nigels matches were as wet as those of the hermit  so were those of the professor  luckily moses carried the oldfashioned flint and steel with which and a small piece of tinder spark was at last kindled but as they were about to apply it to a handful of dry bamboo scrapings an extra spurt of rain extinguished it  for an hour and more they made ineffectual attempts to strike a light  even the cessation of the rain was of no avail  vat must ve do now asked the professor in tones that suggested a woebegone countenance though there was no light by which to distinguish  grin and bear it said nigel in a voice suggestive of a slight expansion of the mouththough no one could see it  deres nuffin else left to do said moses in a tone which betrayed such a very wide expansion that nigel laughed outright  hah you may laugh my yoong frond bot if zee tigers find us out or zee elephants trample on us your laughter vill be turned to veeping vat is zat  is not zat vonderful  the question and exclamation were prompted by the sudden appearance of faint mysterious lights among the bushes  that the professor viewed them as unfriendly lights was clear from the click of his riflelocks which followed  it is only phosphoric light explained van der kemp  i have often seen it thus in electric states of the atmosphere  it will probably increasemeanwhile we must seat ourselves on our boxes and do the best we can till daylight  are you there boys  this question addressed to the bearers in their native tongue was not answered and it was found on a feeling examination that in spite of leeches tigers elephants and the whole animal creation the exhausted porters had flung themselves on the wet ground and gone to sleep while their leaders were discussing the situation  dismal though the condition of the party was the appearances in the forest soon changed the professors woe into eager delight for the phosphorescence became more and more pronounced until every treestem blinked with a palish green light and it trickled like moonlight over the ground bringing out thick dumpy mushrooms like domes of light glowing caterpillars and centipedes crawled about leaving a trail of light behind them and fireflies darting to and fro peopled the air and gave additional animation to the scene  in the midst of the darkness thus made singularly visible the white travellers sat dozing and nodding on their luggage while the cries of metallictoned horned frogs and other nocturnal sounds peculiar to that weird forest formed their appropriate lullaby  but moses neither dozed nor nodded  with a pertinacity peculiarly his own he continued to play a running accompaniment to the lullaby with his flint and steel until his perseverance was rewarded with a spark which caught on a dry portion of the tinder and continued to burn  by that time the phosphoric lights had faded and his spark was the only one which gleamed through intense darkness  how he cherished that spark  he wrapped it in swaddling clothes of dry bamboo scrapings with as much care as if it had been the essence of his life  he blew upon it tenderly as though to fan its delicate brow with the soft zephyrs of a fathers affection  again he blew more vigorously and his enormous pouting lips came dimly into view  another blow and his flat nose and fat cheeks emerged from darkness  still anotherwith growing confidenceand his huge eyes were revealed glowing with hope  at last the handful of combustible burst into a flame and was thrust into a prepared nest of twigs  this communicating with a heap of logs kindled a sudden blaze which scattered darkness out of being and converted thirty yards of the primeval forest into a chamber of glorious light round which the human beings crowded with joy enhanced by the unexpectedness of the event and before which the wild things of the wilderness fled away  when daylight came at last they found that the village for which they had been searching was only two miles beyond the spot where they had encamped  here being thoroughly exhausted it was resolved that they should spend that day and night and we need scarcely add they spent a considerable portion of both in sleepat least such parts of both as were not devoted to food  and here the professor distinguished himself in a way that raised him greatly in the estimation of his companions and caused the natives of the place to regard him as something of a demigod  of course we do not vouch for the truth of the details of the incident for no one save himself was there to see and although we entertained the utmost regard for himself we were not sufficiently acquainted with his moral character to answer for his strict truthfulness  as to the main event there was no denying that  the thing happened thus  towards the afternoon of that same day the travellers began to wake up stretch themselves and think about supper  in the course of conversation it transpired that a tiger had been prowling about the village for some days and had hitherto successfully eluded all attempts to trap or spear it  they had tethered a goat several times near a small pond and watched the spot from safe positions among the trees with spears bows and arrows and blowpipes ready but when they watched the tiger did not come and when they failed to watch the tiger did come and carried off the goat  thus they had been baffled  mine frond said the professor to the hermit on hearing this  i vill shot zat tiger  i am resolved  vill you ask zee chief to show me zee place ant zen tell his people on pain of def not to go near it all night for if zey do i vill certainly shot zemby accident of course  the hermit did as he was bid but advised his sanguine friend against exposing himself recklessly  the chief willingly fell in with his wishes  wont you tell us what you intend to do professor asked nigel and let us help you  no i vill do it all by mineselfor die  i vill vant a shofel or a spade of some sort  the chief provided the required implement conducted his visitor a little before sunset to the spot just outside the village and left him there armed with his rifle a revolver and a long knife or kriss besides the spade  when alone the bold man put off his glasses made a careful inspection of the ground came to a conclusionfounded on scientific data no doubtas to the probable spot whence the tiger would issue from the jungle when about to seize the goat and just opposite that spot on the face of a slope about ten yards from the goat he dug a hole deep enough to contain his own person  the soil was sandy easy to dig and quite dry  it was growing dusk when the professor crept into this riflepit drew his weapons and the spade in after him and closed the mouth of the pit with moist earth leaving only a very small eyehole through which he could see the goat standing innocently by the brink of the pool  now said he as he lay resting on his elbows with the rifle laid ready to hand and the revolver beside it now i know not vezer you can smell or not but i have buried mineself in eart vich is a nonconductor of smell  ve shall see  it soon became very dark for there was no moon yet not so dark but that the form of the goat could be seen distinctly reflected in the pond  naturally the professors mind reverted to the occasion when nigel had watched in the branches of a tree for another tiger  the conditions were different and so he thought was the man  mine yoong frond he said mentally is brav oondoubtedly but his nerves have not been braced by experience like mine  it is vell for zere is more dancher here zan in a tree  it matters not  i am resolf to shot zat tigreor die  in this resolute and heroic frame of mind he commenced his vigil  it is curious to note how frequently the calculations of men fail them even those of scientific men  the tiger came indeed to the spot but he came in precisely the opposite direction from that which the watcher expected so that while verkimier was staring over the goats head at an opening in the jungle beyond the pond the tiger was advancing stealthily and slowly through the bushes exactly behind the hole in which he lay  suddenly the professor became aware of something  he saw nothing consciously he heard nothing but there stole over him somehow the feeling of a dread presence  was he asleep  was it nightmare  no it was nighttiger  he knew it somehow he felt itbut he could not see it  to face death is easy enoughaccording to some peoplebut to face nothing at all is at all times trying  verkimier felt it to be so at that moment  but he was a true hero and conquered himself  come now he said mentally dont be an ass  dont lose your shance by voomanly fears  keep kviet  another moment and there was a very slight sound right over his head he glanced upwardsas far as the little hole would permitand there not a foot from him was a tawny yellow throat with a tremendous paw moving slowly forwardso slowly that it might have suggested the imperceptible movement of the hourhand of a watch or of a glacier there was indeed motion but it was not perceptible  the professors perceptions were quick  he did not require to think he knew that to use the rifle at such close quarters was absolutely impossible  he knew that the slightest motion would betray him  he could see that as yet he was undiscovered for the animals nose was straight for the goat and he concluded that either his having buried himself was a safeguard against being smelt or that the tiger had a cold in its head  he thought for one moment of bursting up with a yell that would scare the monster out of his seven sensesif he had seven but dismissed the thought as cowardly for it would be sacrificing success to safety  he knew not what to do and the cold perspiration consequent upon indecision at a supreme moment broke out all over him suddenly he thought of the revolver  like lightning he seized it pointed it straight up and fired  the bulleta large army revolver oneentered the throat of the animal pierced the root of the tongue crashed through the palate obliquely and entered the brain  the tiger threw one indescribable somersault and fellfell so promptly that it blocked the mouth of the pit all the covering earth of which had been blown away by the shot and verkimier could feel the hairy side of the creature and hear the beating of its heart as it gasped its life away  but in his cramped position he could not push it aside  well aware of the tenacity of life in tigers he thought that if the creature revived it would certainly grasp him even in its dying agonies for the weight of its body and its struggles were already crushing in the upper part of the hole  to put an end to its sufferings and his own danger he pointed the revolver at its side and again fired  the crash in the confined hole was tremendousso awful that the professor thought the weapon must have burst  the struggles of the tiger became more violent than ever and its weight more oppressive as the earth crumbled away  again the cold perspiration broke out all over the man and he became unconscious  it must not be supposed that the professors friends were unwatchful although they had promised not to disturb him in his operations they had held themselves in readiness with rifle revolver and spear and the instant the first shot was heard they ran down to the scene of action  before reaching it the second shot quickened their pace as they ran down to the ponda number of natives yelling and waving torches at their heels  here he is cried moses who was first on the scene dead as mutton  what the professor cried nigel in alarm  no de tiger  wheres verkimier asked the hermit as he came up  i dun know massa said moses looking round him vacantly  search well men and be quick he may have been injured cried van der kemp seizing a torch and setting the example  let me out came at that moment from what appeared to be the bowels of the earth causing every one to stand aghast gazing in wonder around and on each other  zounds vy dont you let me out shouted the voice again  there was an indication of a tendency to flight on the part of the natives but nigels asking where are you had the effect of inducing them to delay for the answer  hereoonder zee tigre  kweek i am suffocat  instantly van der kemp seized the animal by the tail and with a force worthy of hercules heaved it aside as if it had been a dead cat revealing the man of science underneathalive and well but dishevelled scratched and soiledalso as deaf as a doorpost    chapter twenty two  a python discovered and a geyser interviewed  it never rains but it pours is a wellknown proverb which finds frequent illustration in the experience of almost every one  at all events verkimier had reason to believe in the truth of it at that time for adventures came down on him as it were in a sort of deluge more or less astounding insomuch that his enthusiastic spirit bathing if we may say so in an ocean of scientific delight pronounced sumatra to be the very paradise of the student of nature  we have not room in this volume to follow him in the details of his wonderful experiences but we must mention one adventure which he had on the very day after the tigerincident because it very nearly had the effect of separating him from his travelling companions  being deaf as we have saidowing to the explosion of his revolver in the holebut not necessarily dumb the professor after one or two futile attempts to hear and converse deemed it wise to go to bed and spend the few conscious minutes that might precede sleep in watching van der kemp who kindly undertook to skin his tiger for him  soon the selfsatisfied man fell into a sweet infantine slumber and dreamed of tigers in which state he gave vent to sundry grunts gasps and halfsuppressed cries to the immense delight of moses who sat watching him indulging in a running commentary suggestive of the recent event and giving utterance now and then to a few imitative growls by way of enhancing the effect of the dreams  look look  massa nadgel hes twitchin all ober  de tigers comin to him now  looks like it moses  yesan see he grip de volverno too soon or de tigers hoed away for hes stopped twitchindare de tiger comes agin  a gasp and clenching of the right hand seemed to warrant this assumption  then a yell rang through the hut moses displayed all and more than all his teeth and the professor springing up on one elbow glared fearfully  int it awrful inquired moses in a low tone  the professor awoke mentally recognised the situation smiled an imbecile smile and sank back again on his pillow with a sigh of relief  after that when the skinning of the tiger was completed the dreams appeared to leave him and all his comrades joined him in the land of nod  he was first to awake when daylight entered their hut the following morning and feeling in a fresh quiescent state of mind after the excitement of the preceding night he lay on his back his eyes fixed contentedly on the grand tigerskin which hung on the opposite wall  by degrees his eyes grew wearied of that object and he allowed them to travel languidly upwards and along the roof until they rested on the spot directly over his head where they became fixed and at the same time opened out to a glare compared to which all his previous glaring was as nothingfor there in the thatch looking down upon him was the angular head of a huge python  the snake was rolled up in a tight coil and had evidently spent the night within a yard of the professors head being unable to make out what sort of snake it was and fearing that it might be a poisonous one he crept quietly from his couch keeping his eyes fixed on the reptile as he did so  one result of this mode of action was that he did not see where he was going and inadvertently thrust one finger into moses right eye and another into his open mouth  the negro naturally shut his mouth with a snap while the professor opened his with a roar and in another moment every man was on his feet blinking inquiringly  look zee snake cried the professor when moses released him  we must get him out of that remarked van der kemp as he quietly made a noose with a piece of rattan and fastened it to the end of a long pole  with the latter he poked the creature up and when it had uncoiled sufficiently he slipped the noose deftly over its head  clear out friends he said looking round  all obeyed with uncommon promptitude except the professor who valiantly stood his ground  van der kemp pulled the python violently down to the floor where it commenced a tremendous scuffle among the chairs and posts  the hermit kept its head off with the pole and sought to catch its tail but failed twice  seeing this the professor caught the tail as it whipped against his legs and springing down the steps so violently that he snapped the cord by which the hermit held it and drew the creature straight outa thick monster full twelve feet long and capable of swallowing a dog or a child  out of zee way shouted the professor making a wild effort to swing the python against a tree but the tail slipped from his grasp the professor fell and the snake went crashing against a log under which it took refuge  nigel who was nearest to it sprang forward fortunately caught its tail and swinging it and himself round with such force that it could not coil up at all dashed it against a tree  before it could recover from the shock moses had caught up a hatchet and cut its head off with one blow  the tail wriggled for a few seconds and the head gaped once or twice as if in mild surprise at so sudden a finale  zat is strainchvery strainch slowly remarked the professor as still seated on the ground he solemnly noted these facts  not so very strange after all said van der kemp ive seen the head of many a bigger snake cut off at one blow  mine frond you mistake me  it is zee vorking of physical law in zee spiritual vorld zat perplexes me  moses has cut zee brute in two physical fact substance can be divided  zee two parts are still alife zerfore zee lifezee spirithas also been divided  it is indeed very strange said nigel with a laugh  stranger still that you may cut a worm into several parts and the life remains in each but strangest of all that you should sit on the ground professor instead of rising up while you philosophise  you are not hurt i hopeare you  i razer zink i am returned the philosopher with a faint smile mine onkle i zink is spraint  this was indeed true and it seemed as if the poor mans wanderings were to be for a time at least brought to an abrupt close  fortunately it was found that a pony could be procured at that village and as they had entered the borders of the mountainous regions and the roads were more open and passable than heretofore it was resolved that the professor should ride until his ankle recovered  we must now pass over a considerable portion of time and space and convey the reader by a forced march to the crater of an active volcano  by that time verkimiers ankle had recovered and the pony had been dismissed  the heavy luggage with the porters had been left in the low grounds for the mountain they had scaled was over 10000 feet above the sealevel  only one native from the plain below accompanied them as guide and three of their porters whose inquiring minds tempted them to make the ascent  at about 10000 feet the party reached what the natives called the dempo or edge of the volcano whence they looked down into the sawah or ancient crater which was a level space composed of brown soil surrounded by cliffs and lying like the bottom of a cup 200 feet below them  it had a sulphurous odour and was dotted here and there with clumps of heath and rhododendrons  in the centre of this was a cone which formed the trueor moderncrater  on scrambling up to the lip of the cone and looking down some 300 feet of precipitous rock they beheld what seemed to be a pure white lake set in a central basin of 200 feet in diameter  the surface of this lakelet smoked and although it reflected every passing cloud as if it were a mirror it was in reality a basin of hot mud the surface of which was about thirty feet below its rim  you will soon see a change come over it said the hermit as the party gazed in silent admiration at the weird scene  he had scarcely spoken when the middle of the lake became intensely black and scored with dark streaks  this though not quite obvious at first from the point where they stood was caused by the slow formation of a great chasm in the centre of the seething lake of mud  the lake was sinking into its own throat  the blackness increased  then a dull sullen roar was heard and next moment the entire lake upheaved not violently but in a slow majestic manner some hundreds of feet into the air whence it fell back into its basin with an awful roar which reverberated and echoed from the rocky walls of the caldron like the singing of an angry sea  an immense volume of steamthe motive power which had blown up the lakewas at the same time liberated and dissipated in the air  the wavecircles died away on the margin of the lake and the placid cloudreflecting surface was restored until the geyser had gathered fresh force for another upheaval  amazing exclaimed nigel who had gazed with feelings of awe at this curious exhibition of the tremendous internal forces with which the creator has endowed the earth  vonderful exclaimed the professor whose astonishment was such that his eyebrows rose high above the rim of his huge blue binoculars  moses to whom such an exhibition of the powers of nature was familiar was we are sorry to say not much impressed if impressed at all indeed he scarcely noticed it but watched with intense teethandgum disclosing satisfaction the faces of two of the native porters who had never seen anything of the kind before and whose terrified expressions suggested the probability of a precipitate flight when their trembling limbs became fit to resume duty  will it come again soon asked nigel turning to van der kemp  every fifteen or twenty minutes it goes through that process all day and every day replied the hermit  but if i may joodge from zee stones ant scoriae around said the professor zee volcano is not always so peaceful as it is joost now  you are right  about once in every three years and sometimes oftener the crops of coffee bananas rice etcetera in this region are quite destroyed by sulphurrain which covers everything for miles around the crater  hah it vould be too hote a place zis for us if zat vas to happin joost now remarked verkimier with a smile  it cannot be far off the time now i should think said van der kemp  all this talk moses translated and embellished to the native porters with the solemn sincerity of a true and thoroughpaced hypocrite  he had scarcely finished and was watching with immense delight the changeful aspect of their whiteygreen faces when another volcanic fit came on and the deeptoned roar of the coming explosion was heard  it was so awesome that the countenance even of van der kemp became graver than usual  as for the two native porters they gazed and trembled nigel and the professor also gazed with lively expectation  moseswe grieve to record ithugged himself internally and gloated over the two porters  another moment and there came a mighty roar  up went the mudlake hundreds of feet into the air out came the steam with the sound of a thousand trombones and away went the two porters head over heels down the outer slope of the cone and across the sawah as if the spirit of evil were after them  there was no cause however for alarm  the mudlake falling back into its native cup resumed its placid aspect and awaited its next upheaval with as much tranquillity as if it had never known disturbance in the past and were indifferent about the future  that evening our travellers encamped in close proximity to the crater supped on fowls roasted in an open crevice whence issued steam and sulphurous smells and slept with the geysers intermittent roar sounding in their ears and reechoing in their dreams    chapter twenty three  tells of volcanic fires and a strange return home  this tremendous introduction to volcanic fires was but the prelude to a period of eruptive action which has not been paralleled in the worlds history  for a short time after this indeed the genial nature of the weather tended to banish from the minds of our travellers all thoughts of violence either in terrestrial or human affairs and as the professor devoted himself chiefly to the comparatively mild occupation of catching and transfixing butterflies and beetles during the march southward there seemed to be nothing in the wide universe above or below save peace and tranquillityexcept perhaps in the minds of beetles and butterflies  throughout all this period nevertheless there were ominous growlings grumblings and tremorsfaint but frequentwhich indicated a condition of mother earth that could not have been called easy  some of the volcanoes of java must be at work i think said nigel one night as the party sat in a small isolated woodcutters hut discussing a supper of rice and fowls with his friends which they were washing down with homegrown coffee  it may be so said van der kemp in a dubious tone but the sounds though faint seem to me a good deal nearer  i cant help thinking that the craters which have so recently opened up in krakatoa are still active and that it may be necessary for me to shift my quarters for my cave is little more i suspect than the throat of an ancient volcano  hah say you so mine frond  zen i vould advise you to make no delay said the professor critically examining a wellpicked drumstick  you see it is not pleasant to be blown up eizer by the terrestrial eruptions of zee vorld or zee celestial explosions of your vifea leetle more rice moses if you please  zanks  now mine fronds he continued after having disposed of a supper which it might have taxed a volcanos throat to swallow it is viz great sorrow zat i must part from you here  part  why asked the hermit in surprise  vy because i find zis contrie is heaven upon eart  zat is of course only in a scientific point of view  zee voods are svarming zee air is teeming ant zee vaters are valloing vit life  i cannot tear myself avay  but ve shall meet againat telok betong or krakatoa or anjer or batavia  it was found that the man of science was also a man of decision nothing would persuade him to go a step further  the woodcutters hut suited him so did the woodcutter himself and so as he said did the region around him  with much regret therefore and an earnest invitation from the hermit to visit his cave and range the almost unexplored woods of his island the travellers parted from him and our three adventurers dismissing all attendants and hiring three ponies continued their journey to the southern shores of sumatra  as they advanced it soon became evident that the scene of volcanic activity was not so far distant as the island of java for the air was frequently darkened by the falling of volcanic dust which covered the land with a greyish powder  as however at least sixteen volcanoes have been registered in the island of sumatra and there are probably many others it was impossible to decide where the scene of eruption was that caused those signs  one afternoon the travellers witnessed a catastrophe which induced them to forego all idea of spending more time in examining the country  they had arrived at a village where they found a traveller who appeared to be going about without any special object in view  he spoke english but with a foreign accent  nigel naturally felt a desire to become sociable with him but he was very taciturn and evidently wished to avoid intercourse with chance acquaintances  hearing that there were curious hotwater and mud springs not far off the stranger expressed a desire to visit them  nigel also felt anxious to see them and as one guide was sufficient for the party the stranger joined the party and they went together  the spot they were led to was evidently a mere crust of earth covering fierce subterranean fires  in the centre of it a small pond of mud was boiling and bubbling furiously and round this on the indurated clay were smaller wells and craters full of boiling mud  the ground near them was obviously unsafe for it bent under pressure like thin ice and at some of the cracks and fissures the sulphurous vapour was so hot that the hand could not be held to it without being scalded  nigel and the stranger walked close behind the native guide both apparently being anxious to get as near as possible to the central pond  but the guide stopped suddenly and looking back said to van der kemp that it was not safe to approach nearer  nigel at once stopped and looking at the stranger was struck by the wild incomprehensible expression of his face as he continued to advance  stop stop sir cried the hermit on observing this but the man paid no attention to the warning  another instant and the crust on which he stood gave way and he sank into a horrible gulf from which issued a gust of sulphurous vapour and steam  the horror which almost overwhelmed nigel did not prevent him bounding forward to the rescue  well was it for him at that time that a cooler head than his own was near  the strong hand of the hermit seized his collar on the instant and he was dragged backward out of danger while an appalling shriek from the stranger as he disappeared told that the attempt to succour him would have been too late  a terrible event of this kind has usually the effect of totally changing at least for a time the feelings of those who witness it so as to almost incapacitate them from appreciating ordinary events or things  for some days after witnessing the sudden and awful fate of this unknown man nigel travelled as if in a dream taking little notice of or interest in anything and replying to questions in mere monosyllables  his companions seemed to be similarly affected for they spoke very little  even the volatile spirit of moses appeared to be subdued and it was not till they had reached nearly the end of their journey that their usual flow of spirits returned  arriving one night at a village not very far from the southern shores of sumatra they learned that the hermits presentiments were justified and that the volcano which was causing so much disturbance in the islands of the archipelago was indeed the long extinct one of krakatoa  ive heard a good deal about it from one of the chief men here said the hermit as he returned to his friends that night about suppertime he tells me that it has been more or less in moderate eruption ever since we left the island but adds that nobody takes much notice of it as they dont expect it to increase much in violence  i dont agree with them in that he added gravely  why not asked nigel  partly because of the length of time that has elapsed since its last eruption in 1680 partly from the fact that that eruptionjudging from appearancesmust have been a very tremendous one and partly because my knowledge of volcanic action leads me to expect it but i could not easily explain the reason for my conclusions on the latter point  i have just been to the brow of a ridge not far off whence i have seen the glow in the sky of the krakatoa fires  they do not however appear to be very fierce at the present moment  as he spoke there was felt by the travellers a blow as if of an explosion under the house in which they sat  it was a strong vertical bump which nearly tossed them all off their chairs  van der kemp and his man after an exclamation or two continued supper like men who were used to such interruptions merely remarking that it was an earthquake but nigel to whom it was not quite so familiar stood up for a few seconds with a look of anxious uncertainty as if undecided as to the path of duty and prudence in the circumstances  moses relieved him  sot down massa nadgel said that sable worthy as he stuffed his mouth full of rice its easier to sot dan to stand wen its eartquakin  nigel sat down with a tendency to laugh for at that moment he chanced to glance at the rafters above where he saw a small anxiousfaced monkey gazing down at him  he was commenting on this creature when another prolonged shock of earthquake came  it was not a bump like the previous one but a severe vibration which only served to shake the men in their chairs but it shook the small monkey off the rafter and the miserable little thing fell with a shriek and a flop into the ricedish  git out o datyou scoundril exclaimed moses but the order was needless for the monkey bounced out of it like indiarubber and sought to hide its confusion in the thatch while moses helped himself to some more of the rice which he said was none the worse for being monkeyfied  at last our travellers found themselves in the town of telok betong where being within fortyfive miles of krakatoa the hermit could both see and hear that his islandhome was in violent agitation tremendous explosions occurring frequently while dense masses of smoke were ascending from its craters  im happy to find said the hermit soon after their arrival in the town that the peak of rakata on the southern part of the island where my cave lies is still quiet and has shown no sign of breaking out  and now i shall go and see after my canoe  do you think it safe to venture to visit your cave asked nigel  well not absolutely safe returned the hermit with a peculiar smile but of course if you think it unwise to run the risk of  i asked a simple question van der kemp without any thought of myself interrupted the youth as he flushed deeply  forgive me nigel returned the hermit quickly and gravely it is but my duty to point out that we cannot go there without running some risk  and it is my duty to point out retorted his hurt friend that when any man worthy of the name agrees to follow another he agrees to accept all risks  to this the hermit vouchsafed no further reply than a slight smile and nod of intelligence  thereafter he went off alone to inquire about his canoe which it will be remembered his friend the captain of the steamer had promised to leave for him at this place  telok betong which was one of the severest sufferers by the eruption of 1883 is a small town at the head of lampong bay opposite to the island of krakatoa from which it is between forty and fifty miles distant  it is built on a narrow strip of land at the base of a steep mountain but little above the sea and is the chief town of the lampong residency which forms the most southerly province of sumatra  at the time we write of the only european residents of the place were connected with government  the rest of the population was composed of a heterogeneous mass of natives mingled with a number of chinese a few arabs and a large fluctuating population of traders from borneo celebes new guinea siam and the other innumerable isles of the archipelago  these were more or less connected with prahus laden with the rich and varied merchandise of the eastern seas  as each man in the town had been permitted to build his house according to his own fancy picturesque irregularity was the agreeable result  it may be added that as each man spoke his own language in his own tones babel and noise were the consequence  in a small hut by the waterside the hermit found the frienda malayto whom his canoe had been consigned and in a long low shed close by he found the canoe itself with the faithful spinkie in charge  dont go near the canoe till youve made friends with the monkey said the malay in his own tongue as he was about to put the key in the door  why not asked the hermit  because it is the savagest brute i ever came across said the man it wont let a soul come near the canoe  i would have killed it long ago if the captain of the steamer had not told me you wished it to be taken great care of  there look out  the vixen is not tied up  he flung open the sheddoor and revealed spinkie seated in his old place much deteriorated in appearance and scowling malevolently  the instant the poor creature heard its masters voice and saw his formfor his features must have been invisible against the strong lightthe scowl vanished from its little visage  with a shriek of joy it sprang like an acrobat from a springboard and plunged into the hermits bosomto the alarm of the malay who thought this was a furious attack  we need not say that van der kemp received his faithful little servant kindly and it was quite touching to observe the monkeys intense affection for him  it could not indeed wag its tail like a dog but it put its arms round its masters neck with a wondrously human air and rubbed its little head in his beard and whiskers drawing itself back now and then putting its black paws on his cheeks turning his face round to the light and opening its round eyes wideas well as its round little mouthas if to make sure of his identitythen plunging into the whiskers again and sometimes when unable to contain its joy finding a safetyvalve in a little shriek  when the meeting and greeting were over van der kemp explained that he would require his canoe by daybreak the following morning ordered a few provisions to be got ready and turned to leave  you must get down spinkie and watch the canoe for one night more said the hermit quietly  but spinkie did not seem to perceive the necessity for he clung closer to his master with a remonstrative croak  get down spinkie said the hermit firmly and watch the canoe  the poor beast had apparently learned that medopersic law was not more unchangeable than van der kemps commands  at all events it crept down his arm and leg waddled slowly over the floor of the shed with bent back and wrinkled brow like a man of ninety and took up its old position on the deck the very personification of superannuated woe  the hermit patted its head gently however thus relieving its feelings and probably introducing hope into its little heart before leaving then he returned to his friends and bade them prepare for immediate departure  it was the night of the 24th of august and as the eruptions of the volcano appeared to be getting more and more violent van der kemps anxiety to reach his cave became visibly greater  i have been told said the hermit to nigel as they went down with moses to the place where the canoe had been left the history of krakatoa since we left  a friend informs me that a short time after our departure the eruptions subsided a little and the people here had ceased to pay much attention to them but about the middle of june the volcanic activity became more violent and on the 19th in particular it was observed that the vapourcolumn and the force of the explosions were decidedly on the increase  at katimbang from which place the island can be seen it was noticed that a second column of vapour was ascending from the centre of the island and that the appearance of perboewatan had entirely changed its conspicuous summit having apparently been blown away  in july there were some explosions of exceptional violence and i have now no doubt that it was these we heard in the interior of this island when we were travelling hither quite lately  on the 11th of this month i believe the island was visited in a boat by a government officer but he did not land owing to the heavy masses of vapour and dust driven about by the wind which also prevented him from making a careful examination but he could see that the forests of nearly the whole island have been destroyedonly a few trunks of blighted trees being left standing above the thick covering of pumice and dust  he reported that the dust near the shore was found to be twenty inches thick  if so said nigel i fear that the island will be no longer fit to inhabit  i know not returned the hermit sadly in a musing tone  the officer reported that there is no sign of eruption at rakata so that my house is yet safe for no showers of pumice however deep can injure the cave  nigel was on the point of asking his friend why he was so anxious to revisit the island at such a time but recollecting his recent tiff on that subject refrained  afterwards however when van der kemp was settling accounts with the malay he put the question to moses  i cant help wondering he said that van der kemp should be so anxious to get back to his cave just now  if he were going in a big boat to save some of his goods and chattels i could understand it but the canoe you know could carry little more than her ordinary lading  well massa nadgel said moses its my opinion dat he wants to go back cause hes got an uncommon affekshnit heart  how  surely you dont mean that his love of the mere place is so strong that  no no massa nadgelsnot dat  but he was awrful fond ob his wife an darter an i know hes got a photogruff ob em bof togidder an i tink hed sooner lose his head dan lose dat for ive seed him look at em for hours an kiss em sometimes wen he tought i was asleep  the return of the hermit here abruptly stopped the conversation  the canoe was carried down and put into the water watched with profound interest by hundreds of natives and traders who were all more or less acquainted with the hermit of rakata  it was still daylight when they paddled out into lampong bay but the volumes of dust which rose from krakatoaalthough nearly fifty miles offdid much to produce an unusually early twilight  goin to be bery dark massa remarked moses as they glided past the shipping  shall i light de lamp  do moses but we shant need it for as we get nearer home the volcanic fires will light us on our way  de volcanic dust is agoin to powder us on our way too massa  keep your hands out o the way spinkie said the negro as he fixed a small oillamp to the mast and resumed his paddle  after we get out a bit the wind will help us said the hermit  yes massa if he dont blow too strong returned moses as a squall came rushing down the mountains and swept over the bay ruffling its now dark waters into foaming wavelets  altogether what with the increasing darkness and the hissing squall and the nightvoyage before them and the fires of krakatoa which were now clearly visible on the horizon nigel roy felt a more eerie sensation in his breast than he ever remembered to have experienced in all his previous life but he scorned to admit the facteven to himself and said mentally that it was rather romantic than otherwise  just then there burst upon their ears the yell of a steamwhistle and a few moments later a steamer bore straight down on them astern  steamer ahoy shouted van der kemp  will ye throw us a rope  ay ayease erstop er where are ee bound for demanded an unmistakably english voice  krakatoa replied the hermit  where are you  anjer on the java coast  do ee want to be smothered roasted and blown up asked the captain looking down on the canoe as it ranged alongside the dark hull  no we want to get home  home  well youre queer fellows in a queer eggshell for such waters every man to his taste  look out for the rope  all right cappen cried moses as he caught the coil  next moment the steamer went ahead and the canoe ploughed over the sunda straits at the rate of thirteen miles an hour with her sharp prow high out of the water and the stern correspondingly low  the voyage which would have otherwise cost our three travellers a long laborious night and part of next day was by this means so greatly shortened that when daybreak arrived they were not more than thirteen miles to the east of krakatoa  nearer than this the steamboat could not take them without going out of her course but as van der kemp and nigel gratefully acknowledged it was quite near enough  well i should just think it was rather too near said the captain with a grin  and truly he was justified in making the remark for the explosions from the volcano had by that time become not only very frequent but tremendously loud while the dense cloud which hung above it and spread far and wide over the sky covered the sea with a kind of twilight that struggled successfully against the full advent of day  lightning too was playing among the rolling black masses of smoke and the roaring explosions every now and then seemed to shake the very heavens  casting off the towrope they turned the bow of their canoe to the island  as a stiffish breeze was blowing they set the sails closereefed and steered for the southern shore at that part which lay under the shadow of rakata    chapter twenty four  an awful night and terrible morning  it was a matter of some satisfaction to find on drawing near to the shore that the peak of rakata was still intact and that although most other parts of the island which could be seen were blighted by fire and covered deeply with pumicedust much of the forest in the immediate neighbourhood of the cave was still undestroyed though considerably damaged  dyou think our old harbour will be available moses asked van der kemp as they came close to the first headland  praps  bes go an see was the negros practical reply  evidently rakata is not yet active said nigel looking up at the grey dustcovered crags as the canoe glided swiftly through the dark water  that is more than can be said for the other craters returned the hermit  it seems to me that not only all the old ones are at work but a number of new ones must have been opened  the constant roaring and explosions that filled their ears and the rain of fine ashes bore testimony to the truth of this though the solid and towering mass of rakata rose between them and the part of krakatoa which was in eruption preventing their seeing anything that was passing except the dense masses of smoke steam and dust which rose many miles into the heavens obstructing the light of day but forming cloudmasses from which the lurid flames of the volcano were reflected downward  on reaching the little bay or harbour it was found much as they had left it save that the rocks and bushes around were thickly covered with dust and their boat was gone  strange at such a time one would scarcely have expected thieves to come here said the hermit looking slowly round  no tief bin here massa said moses looking over the side of the canoe  i see de boat  he pointed downwards as he spoke and on looking over the side they saw the wreck of the boat at the bottom in about ten feet of water and crushed beneath a ponderous mass of lava which must have been ejected from the volcano and afterwards descended upon the boat  the destruction of the boat rendered it impossible to remove any of the property of the hermit and nigel now saw from his indifference that this could not have been the cause of his friends anxiety and determination to reach his islandhome in spite of the danger that such a course entailed  that there was considerable danger soon became very obvious for having passed to some extent at this point beyond the shelter of the cliffs of rakata and come partly into view of the other parts of the island the real extent of the volcanic violence burst upon nigel and moses as a new revelation  the awful sublimity of the scene at first almost paralysed them and they failed to note that not only did a constant rain of pumicedust fall upon them but that there was also a pretty regular dropping of small stones into the water around them  their attention was sharply aroused to this fact by the fall of a lump of semimolten rock about the size of a cannonshot a short distance off which was immediately followed by not less than a cubic yard of lava which fell close to the canoe and deluged them with spray  we must go said the hermit quietly  no need to expose ourselves here though the watching of the tremendous forces that our creator has at command does possess a wonderful kind of fascination  it seems to me the more we see of his power as exerted on our little earth the more do we realise the paltriness of our conception of the stupendous might that upholds the universe  while he was speaking van der kemp guided the canoe into its little haven and in a few minutes he and moses had carried it into the shelter of the cave out of which nigel had first seen it emerge  then the lading was carried up after which they turned into the track which led to the hermits home  the whole operation may be said to have been performed under fire for small masses of rock kept pattering continually on the dustcovered ground around them causing cloudlets like smoke to spring up wherever they struck  nigel and moses could not resist glancing upward now and then as they moved quickly to and fro and they experienced a shrinking sensation when a stone fell very near them but each scorned to exhibit the smallest trace of anxiety or to suggest that the sooner they got from under fire the better  as for van der kemp he moved about deliberately as if there was nothing unusual going on and with an absent look on his grave face as though the outbursts of smoke and fire and lava which turned the face of day into lurid night and caused the cliffs to reverberate with unwonted thunders had no effect whatever on his mind  a short walk however along the track which was more than ankledeep in dust brought them under the sheltering sides of rakata up which they soon scrambled to the mouth of their cave  here all was found as they had left it save that the entrance was kneedeep in pumicedust  and now a new and very strange sensation was felt by each of them for the loud reports and crackling sounds which had assailed their ears outside were reduced by the thick walls of the cave to a continuous dull groan as it were like the soft but thunderous bass notes of a stupendous organ  to these sounds were added others which seemed to be peculiar to the cave itself  they appeared to rise from crevices in the floor and were no doubt due to the action of those pentup subterranean fires which were imprisoned directly though it may be very far down under their feet  every now and then there came a sudden increase of the united sounds as if the swell of the great organ had been opened and such outgushing was always accompanied with more or less of indescribable shocks followed by prolonged tremors of the entire mountain  if the three friends had been outside to observe what was taking place they would have seen that these symptoms were simultaneous with occasional and extremely violent outbursts from the crater of perboewatan and his compeers  indeed they guessed as much and two of them at least were not a little thankful that awesome as their position was they had the thick mountain between them and the fiery showers outside  of all this the hermit took no notice but hastening into the inner cavern opened a small box and took therefrom a bundle of papers and a little object which at a first glance nigel supposed to be a book but which turned out to be a photograph case  these the hermit put carefully into the breastpocket of his coat and then turned to his companions with a sigh as if of relief  i think there is no danger of anything occurring at this part of the island he remarked looking round the cave for there is no sign of smoke and no sulphurous smell issuing from any of the crevices in walls or floor  this i think shows that there is no direct communication with rakata and the active volcanoat least not at present  do you then think there is a possibility of an outbreak at some future period asked nigel  who can tell  people here who dont study the nature of volcanoes much though surrounded by them will expect things ere long to resume their normal condition  i can never forget the fact that the greater part of krakatoa stands as you know exactly above the spot where the two great lines of volcanic action cross and right over the mouth of the immense crater to which perboewatan and all the other craters serve as mere chimneys or safetyvalves  we cannot tell whether a great eruption similar to that of 1680 may not be in store for us  the only reason that i can see for the quiescence of this peak of rakata is as i said to you once before that it stands not so much above the old crater as above and on the safe side of its lip  i tink massa if i may ventur to speak said moses dat de sooner we git off his lip de better lest we tumble into his mout  you may be right moses and i have no objection to quit returned the hermit now that i have secured the photograph and papers  at the same time i fear the rain of stones and lava is growing worse  it might be safer to stay till there is a lull in the violence of the eruption and then make a dash for it  what say you nigel  i say that you know best van der kemp  im ready to abide by your decision whatever it be  well then we will go out and have a look at the state of matters  the view from the entrance was not calculated to tempt them to forsake the shelter of the cave however uncertain that might be  the latest explosions had enshrouded the island in such a cloud of smoke and dust that nothing whatever was visible beyond a few yards in front and even that space was only seen by the faint rays of the lamp issuing from the outer cave  this lamplight was sufficient however to show that within the semicircle of a few yards there was a continuous rain of grey ashes and dust mingled with occasional stones of various sizes some larger than a mans fist  to go out in that would be simply to court death said nigel whose voice was almost drowned by the noise of the explosions and fall of material  as it was manifest that nothing could be done at the moment except to wait patiently they returned to the cave where they lighted the oilstove and moseswho had taken the precaution to carry up some provisions in a bag from the canoeproceeded to prepare a meal  stummicks must be attended to he murmured to himself as he moved about the cavekitchen and shook his head gravely  collapses in dat region is wuss a long way dan splosion of the eart  meanwhile nigel and the hermit went to examine the passage leading to the observatory  the eruption had evidently done nothing to it for having passed upwards without difficulty they finally emerged upon the narrow ledge  the scene that burst upon their astonished gaze here was awful in the extreme  it will be remembered that while the hermits cave was on the southern side of krakatoa facing java the stair and passage leading to the observatory completely penetrated the peak of rakata so that when standing on the ledge they faced northward and were thus in full view of all the craters between them and perboewatan  these were in full blast at the time and being so near the heat as well as the dust molten lava and other missiles instantly drove them back under the protection of the passage from which they had emerged  here they found a small aperture which appeared to have been recently formedprobably by a blow from a mass of falling rockthrough which they were able to obtain a glimpse of the pandemonium that lay seething below them  they could not see much however owing to the smoke which filled the air  the noise of the almost continuous explosions was so loud that it was impossible to converse save by placing the mouth to the ear and shouting  fortunately soon after their ascent the wind shifted and blew smoke fire and dust away to the northward enabling them to get out on the ledge where for a time they remained in comparative safety  look look at your mirrors exclaimed nigel suddenly as his wandering gaze happened to turn to the hermits sunguides  and he might well exclaim for not only was the glass of these ingenious machines shivered and melted but their iron frameworks were twisted up into fantastic shapes  lightning has been at work here said van der kemp  it did not at the moment occur to either of them that the position on which they stood was peculiarly liable to attack by the subtle and dangerous fluid which was darting and zigzagging everywhere among the rolling clouds of smoke and steam  a louder report than usual here drew their attention again to the tremendous scene that was going on in front of them  the extreme summit of perboewatan had been blown into a thousand fragments which were hurtling upwards and crackling loudly as the smaller masses were impelled against each other in their skyward progress  this crackling has been described by those who heard it from neighbouring shores as a strange rustling sound  to our hermit and his friend who were so to speak in the very midst of it the sound rather resembled the continuous musketry of a battlefield while the louder explosions might be compared to the booming of artillery though they necessarily lose by the comparison for no invention of man ever produced sounds equal to those which thundered at that time from the womb of krakatoa  immediately after this a fountain of molten lava at white heat welled up in the great throat that had been so violently widened and overflowing the edges of the crater rolled down its sides in fiery rivers  all the other craters in the island became active at the same moment and a number of new ones burst forth  indeed it seemed to those who watched them that if these had not opened up to give vent to the suppressed forces the whole island must have been blown away  as it was the sudden generation of so much excessive heat set fire to what remained of trees and everything combustible so that the island appeared to be one vast seething conflagration and darkness was for a time banished by a red glare that seemed to nigel far more intense than that of noonday  it is indeed the partiality if we may say so of conflagrationlight which gives to it the character of impressive power with which we are all so familiarthe intense lights being here cut sharply off by equally intense shadows and then grading into dull reds and duller greys  the sun on the other hand bathes everything in its genial glow so completely that all nature is permeated with it and there are no intense contrasts no absolutely black and striking shadows except in caverns and holes to form startling contrasts  these safetyvalves said the hermit referring to the new craters have under god been the means of saving us from destruction  it would seem so said nigel who was too overwhelmed by the sight to say much  even as he spoke the scene changed as if by magic for from the cone of perboewatan there issued a spout of liquid fire followed by a roar so tremendous that the awestruck men shrank within themselves feeling as though that time had really come when the earth is to melt with fervent heat  the entire lake of glowing lava was shot into the air and lost in the clouds above while mingled smoke and steam went bellowing after it and dust fell so thickly that it seemed as if sufficient to extinguish the raging fires  whether it did so or not is uncertain  it may have been that the new pall of black vapour only obscured them  at all events after the outburst the darkness of night fell suddenly on all around  just then the wind again changed and the whole mass of vapour smoke and ashes came sweeping like the very besom of destruction towards the giddy ledge on which the observers stood  nigel was so entranced that it is probable he might have been caught in the horrible tempest and lost had not his cooler companion grasped his arm and dragged him violently into the passagewhere they were safe though half suffocated by the heat and sulphurous vapours that followed them  at the same time the thunderous roaring became so loud that conversation was impossible  van der kemp therefore took his friends hand and led him down to the cave where the sounds were so greatly subdued as to seem almost a calm by contrast  we are no doubt in great danger said the hermit gravely as he sat down in the outer cave but there is no possibility of taking action tonight  here we are whether wisely or unwisely and here we must remainat least till there is a lull in the eruption  god is our refuge  he ought to be so at all times but there are occasions when this great and i would add glorious fact is pressed upon our understandings with unusual power  such a time is this  comewe will see what his word says to us just now  to nigels surprise and he afterwards confessed to his comfort and satisfaction the hermit called the negro from his work and taking down the large bible from its shelf read part of the 46th psalm god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble  therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea  he stopped reading at the verse where it is written be still and know that i am god  then going down on his kneeswithout even the familiar formula let us prayhe uttered a brief but earnest prayer for guidance and deliverance in the name of jesus  rising he quietly put the bible away and with the calmness of a thoroughly practical man who looks upon religion and ordinary matters as parts of one grand whole ordered moses to serve the supper  thus they spent part of that memorable night of 26th august 1883 in earnest social intercourse conversing chiefly and naturally about the character causes and philosophy of volcanoes while perboewatan and his brethren played a rumbling illustrative accompaniment to their discourse  the situation was a peculiar one  even the negro was alive to that fact  aint it koorious he remarked solemnly in a moment of confidence after swallowing the last bite of his supper  aint it koorious massa nadgel dat were a sottin here comfrably enjoyin our wittles ober de mout ob a vlicano as is quite fit to blow us all to bits an hois us into de bery middle ob next weekif not farder  it is strange indeed moses said nigel who however added no commentary feeling indisposed to pursue the subject  seeing this moses turned to his master  massa he said  you don want nuffin more tonight i spose  no moses nothing  an is you quite easy in your mind  quite replied the hermit with his peculiar little smile  den it would be wuss dan stoopid for me to be oneasy so ill bid ye bof goodnight an turn in  in this truly trustful as well as philosophical state of mind the negro retired to his familiar couch in the inner cave and went to sleep  nigel and the hermit sat up for some time longer  van der kemp said the former after a pause ii trust you wont think me actuated by impertinent curiosity if i venture to ask you aboutthephotograph that i think you  my young friend interrupted the hermit taking the case in question from his breastpocket i should rather apologise to you for having appeared to make any mystery of itand yet he added pausing as he was about to open the case i have not shown it to a living soul since the day thatwell wellwhy should i hesitate  it is all i have left of my dead wife and child  he placed the case in the hands of nigel who almost sprang from his seat with excitement as he beheld the countenance of a little child of apparently three or four years of age who so exactly resembled kathy holbeinallowing of course for the difference of agethat he had now no doubt whatever as to her being the hermits lost daughter  he was on the point of uttering her name when uncertainty as to the effect the sudden disclosure might have upon the father checked him  you seem surprised my friend said van der kemp gently  most beautiful said nigel gazing intently at the portrait  that dear childs face seems so familiar to me that i could almost fancy i had seen it  he looked earnestly into his friends face as he spoke but the hermit was quite unmoved and there was not a shadow of change in the sad low tone of his voice as he said  yes she was indeed beautiful like her mother  as to your fancy about having seen itmankind is formed in groups and types  we see many faces that resemble others  the absent look that was so common to the solitary man here overspread his massive features and nigel felt crushed as it were back into himself  thus without having disclosed his belief he retired to rest in a very anxious state of mind while the hermit watched  dont take off your clothes he said  if the sounds outside lead me to think things are quieting down i will rouse you and we shall start at once  it was very early on the morning of the 27th when van der kemp roused our hero  are things quieter asked nigel as he rose  yes a little but not muchnevertheless we must venture to leave  is it daylight yet  no  there will be no daylight today with which prophecy the hermit left him and went to rouse moses  massa said the faithful negro  isnt you agoin to take nuffin wid you  none ob de books or tings  nonothing except the old bible  all the rest i leave behind  the canoe could not carry much  besides we may have little time  get ready quick and follow me  moses required no spur  the three men left the cave together  it was so intensely dark that the road could not be distinguished but the hermit and his man were so familiar with it that they could have followed it blindfold  on reaching the cave at the harbour some light was obtained from the fitful outbursts of the volcano which enabled them to launch the canoe and push off in safety  then without saying a word to each other they coasted along the shore of the island and finally leaving its dangers behind them made for the island of javapoor spinkie sitting in his accustomed place and looking uncommonly subdued  scarcely had they pushed off into sunda straits when the volcano burst out afresh  they had happily seized on the only quiet hour that the day offered and had succeeded by the aid of the sails in getting several miles from the island without receiving serious injury although showers of stones and masses of rock of all sizes were falling into the sea around them  van der kemp was so far right in his prophecy that there would be no daylight that day  by that time there should have been light as it was nearly seven oclock on the memorable morning of the 27th of august but now although the travellers were some miles distant from krakatoa the gloom was so impervious that nigel from his place in the centre of the canoe could not see the form of poor spinkiewhich sat clinging to the mast only two feet in front of himsave when a blaze from perboewatan or one of the other craters lighted up island and ocean with a vivid glare  at this time the sea began to run very high and the wind increased to a gale so that the sails of the canoe small though they were had to be reduced  lower the foresail nigel shouted the hermit  i will closereef it do you the same to the mainsail  ay ay sir was the prompt reply  moses and nigel kept the little craft straight to the wind while the foresail was being reefed van der kemp and the former performing the same duty while nigel reefed the mainsail  suddenly there came a brief but total cessation of the gale though not of the tumultuous heaving of the waters  during that short interval there burst upon the world a crash and a roar so tremendous that for a few moments the voyagers were almost stunned  it is no figure of speech to say that the world heard the crash hundreds ay thousands of miles did the sound of that mighty upheaval pass over land and sea to startle more or less the nations of the earth  the effect of a stupendous shock on the nervous system is curiously various in different individuals  the three men who were so near to the volcano at that moment involuntarily looked round and saw by the lurid blaze that an enormous mass of krakatoa rent from top to bottom was falling headlong into the sea while the entire heavens were alive with flame lightning steam smoke and the upwardshooting fragments of the hideous wreck  the hermit calmly rested his paddle on the deck and gazed around in silent wonder  nigel not less smitten with awe held his paddle with an iron grasp every muscle quivering with tension in readiness for instant action when the need for action should appear  moses on the other hand turning round from the sight with glaring eyes resumed paddling with unreasoning ferocity and gave vent at once to his feelings and his opinion in the sharp exclamationblown to bits    chapter twenty five  adventures of the sunshine and an unexpected reunion  we must request the reader to turn back now for a brief period to a very different scene  a considerable time before the tremendous catastrophe described in the last chapterwhich we claim to have recorded without the slightest exaggeration inasmuch as exaggeration were impossiblecaptain david roy of the good brig sunshine received the letter which his son wrote to him while in the jungles of sumatra  the captain was seated in the back office of a batavian merchant at the time smoking a long clay pipeon the principle no doubt that moderate poisoning is conducive to moderate health  as he perused the letter the captains eyes slowly opened so did his mouth and the clay pipe falling to the floor was reduced to little pieces  but the captain evidently cared nothing for that  he gave forth a prolonged whistle got up smote upon his thigh and exclaimed with deeptoned emphasis  the rascal  then he sat down again and reperused the letter with a variety of expression on his face that might have recalled the typical april day minus the tears  the rascal he repeated as he finished the second reading of the letter and thrust it into his pocket  i knew there was somethin i the wind wi that little girl  the memory o my own young days when i boarded and captured the poetess is strong upon me yet  i saw it in the rascals eye the very first time they metan he thinks im as blind as a bat ill be bound with his poetical reefpointpattering sharpness but its a strange discovery he has made and must be looked into  the young dog  he gives me orders as if he were the owner  jumping up captain roy hurried out into the street  in passing the outer office he left a message with one of the clerks for his friend the merchant  tell him he said that ill attend to that little business about the bill when i come back  im going to sail for the keeling islands this afternoon  the keeling islands exclaimed the clerk in surprise  yesive got business to do there  ill be back all bein well in a weekmore or less  the clerks eyebrows remained in a raised position for a few moments until he remembered that captain roy being owner of his ship and cargo was entitled to do what he pleased with his own and himself  then they descended and he went on with his work amusing himself with the thought that the most curious beings in the world were seafaring men  mr moor said the captain somewhat excitedly as he reached the deck of his vessel are all the men aboard  all except jim sloper sir  then send and hunt up jim sloper at once for we sail this afternoon for the keeling islands  very well sir  mr moor was a phlegmatic man a selfcontained and a reticent man  if captain roy had told him to get ready to sail to the moon that afternoon he would probably have said very well sir in the same tone and with the same expression  may i ask sir what sort of cargo you expect there said mr moor for to his practical mind some rearrangement of the cargo already on board might be necessary for the reception of that to be picked up at keeling  the cargo well take on board will be a girl said the captain  a what sir  a girl  very well sir  this ended the business part of the conversation  thereafter they went into details so highly nautical that we shrink from recording them  an amateur detective in the form of a shipmate having captured jim sloper the sunshine finally cleared out of the port of batavia that evening shortly before its namesake took his departure from that part of the southern hemisphere  favouring gales carried the brig swiftly through sunda straits and out into the indian ocean  two days and a half brought her to the desired haven  on the way captain roy took note of the condition of krakatoa which at that time was quietly working up its subterranean forces with a view to the final catastrophe opening a safetyvalve now and then to prevent as it were premature explosion  my sons friend the hermit of rakata said the captain to his second mate will find his cave too hot to hold him i think when he returns  looks like it sir said mr moor glancing up at the vast clouds which were at that time spreading like a black pall over the reawakened volcano  do you expect em back soon sir  yestimes about up now  i shouldnt wonder if they reach batavia before us  arrived at the keeling islands captain roy was received as usual with acclamations of joy but he found that he was by no means as well fitted to act the part of a diplomatist as he was to sail a ship  it was in truth a somewhat delicate mission on which his son had sent him for he could not assert definitely that the hermit actually was kathleen holbeins father and her selfconstituted parents did not relish the idea of letting slip on a mere chance one whom they loved as a daughter  why not bring this man who claims to be her father here asked the perplexed holbein  becausebecause praps he wont come answered the puzzled mariner who did not like to say that he was simply and strictly obeying his sons orders  besides he continued the man does not claim to be anything at all  so far as i understand it my boy has not spoken to him on the subject for fear i suppose of raisin hopes that aint to be realised  he is right in that said mrs holbein and we must be just as careful not to raise false hopes in dear little kathy  as your son says it may be a mistake after all  we must not open our lips to her about it  right you are madam returned the captain  mums the word and weve only got to say shes goin to visit one of your old friends in anjerwhichll be quite true you know for the landlady o the chief hotel there is a great friend o yours and well take kathy to her straight  besides the trip will do her health a power o good though im free to confess it dont need no good to be done to it bein a1 at the present time  now just you agree to give the girl a holiday an ill pledge myself to bring her back safe and soundwith her father if hes him without him if he isnt  with such persuasive words captain roy at length overcame the holbein objections  with the girl herself he had less difficulty his chief anxiety being as he himself said to give her reasons for wishin her to go without tellin lies  wouldnt you like a trip in my brig to anjer my dear girl  he had almost said daughter but thought it best not to be too precipitate  oh  i should like it so much said kathleen clasping her little hands and raising her large eyes to the captains face  dear child said the captain to himself  then aloud well ill take you  but ii fear that father and mother would not like me to goperhaps  no fear o them my girl returned the captain putting his huge rough hand on her pretty little head as if in an act of solemn appropriation for unlike too many fathers this exemplary man considered only the sweetness goodness and personal worth of the girl caring not a straw for other matters and being strongly of opinion that a man should marry young if he possess the spirit of a man or the means to support a wife as he was particularly fond of kathleen and felt quite sure that his son had deeper reasons than he chose to express for his course of action he entertained a strong hope not to say conviction that she would also become fond of nigel and that all things would thus work together for a smooth course to this case of true love  it will be seen from all this that captain david roy was a sanguine man whether his hopes were well grounded or not remains to be seen  meanwhile having as mr moor said shipped the cargo the sunshine set sail once more for sunda straits in a measure of outward gloom that formed a powerful contrast to the sunny hopes within her commanders bosom for krakatoa was at that time progressing rapidly towards the consummation of its designs as partly described in the last chapter  short though that voyage was it embraced a period of action so thrilling that ever afterwards it seemed a large slice of lifes little day to those who went through it  we have said that the culminating incidents of the drama began on the night of the 26th  before that time however the cloudpall was fast spreading over land and sea and the rain of pumice and ashes had begun to descend  the wind being contrary it was several days before the brig reached the immediate neighbourhood of krakatoa and by that time the volcano had begun to enter upon the stage which is styled by vulcanologists paroxysmal the explosions being extremely violent as well as frequent  it is very awful said kathleen in a low voice as she clasped the captains arm and leaned her slight figure on it  i have often heard the thunder of distant volcanoes but never been so near as to hear such terrible sounds  dont be frightened my ducky said the captain in a soothing tone for he felt from the appearance of things that there was indeed some ground for alarm  volcanoes always look worse when youre near them  i not frightened she replied  only i got strange solemn feelings besides no danger can come till god allows  thats right lass  mrs holbein has been a true mother if she taught you that  no she did not taught me that  my father taught me that  what  old holbein  nomy father who is dead she said in a low voice  oh  i see  my poor child i should have understood you  forgive me  as the captain spoke a tremendous outburst on krakatoa turned their minds to other subjects  they were by that time drawing near to the island and the thunders of the eruption seemed to shake not only the heavens but even the great ocean itself  though the hour was not much past noon the darkness soon became so dense that it was difficult to perceive objects a few yards distant and as pieces of stone the size of walnuts or even larger began to fall on the deck the captain sent kathleen below  theres no saying where or when a big stone may fall my girl he said and its not the habit of englishmen to let women come under fire so youll be safer below  besides youll be able to see something of whats goin on out o the cabin windows  with the obedience that was natural to her kathleen went down at once and the captain made everything as snug as possible battening down the hatches and shortening sail so as to be ready for whatever might befall  i dont like the look o things mr moor said the captain when the second mate came on deck to take his watch  no more do i sir answered mr moor calmly  the aspect of things was indeed very changeable  sometimes as we have said all nature seemed to be steeped in thick darkness at other times the fires of the volcano blazed upward spreading a red glare on the rolling clouds and over the heaving sea  lightning also played its part as well as thunder but the latter was scarcely distinguishable from the volcanos roar  three days before sunday the 26th of august captain royas well as the crews of several other vessels that were in sunda straits at the timehad observed a marked though gradual increase in the violence of the eruption  on that day as we read in the report of the krakatoa committee of the royal society about 1 pm the detonations caused by the explosive action attained such violence as to be heard at batavia about 100 english miles away  at 2 pm of the same day captain thompson of the medea when about 76 miles eastnortheast of the island saw a black mass rising like clouds of smoke to a height which has been estimated at no less than 17 miles and the detonations were at that time taking place at intervals of ten minutes  but terrible though these explosions must have been they were but as the whisperings of the volcano  an hour later they had increased so much as to be heard at bandong and other places 150 miles away and at 5 pm they had become so tremendous as to be heard over the whole island of java the eastern portion of which is about 650 miles from krakatoa  and the sounds thus heard were not merely like distant thunder  in bataviaalthough as we have said 100 miles offthey were so violent during the whole of that terrible sunday night as to prevent the people from sleeping  they were compared to the discharge of artillery close at hand and caused a rattling of doors windows pictures and chandeliers  captain watson of the charles bal who chanced to be only 10 miles south of the volcano also compared the sounds to discharges of artillery but this only shows the feebleness of ordinary language in attempting to describe such extraordinary sounds for if they were comparable to close artillery at batavia the same comparison is inappropriate at only ten miles distance  he also mentions the crackling noise probably due to the impact of fragments in the atmosphere which were noticed by the hermit and nigel while standing stunned and almost stupefied on the giddy ledge of rakata that same sunday  about five in the evening of that day the brig sunshine drew still nearer to the island but the commotion at the time became so intense and the intermittent darkness so profound that captain roy was afraid to continue the voyage and shortened sail  not only was there a heavy rolling sea but the water was seething as if about to boil  heave the lead mr moor said the captain who stood beside the wheel  yes sir answered the imperturbable second mate who thereupon gave the necessary order and when the depth was ascertained the report was ten fathoms sand with a hot bottom  a hot bottom what do you mean  the leads ot sir replied the sailor  this was true as the captain found when he applied his hand to it  i do believe the worlds going on fire he muttered but its a comfort to know that it cant very well blaze up as long as the sea lasts  just then a rain of pumice in large pieces and quite warm began to fall upon the deck  as most people know pumice is extremely light so that no absolute injury was done to any one though such rain was excessively trying  soon however a change took place  the dense vapours and dustclouds which had rendered it so excessively dark were entirely lighted up from time to time by fierce flashes of lightning which rent as well as painted them in all directions  at one time this great mass of clouds presented the appearance of an immense pinetree with the stem and branches formed of volcanic lightning  captain roy fearing that these tremendous sights and sounds would terrify the poor girl in the cabin was about to look in and reassure her when the words oh how splendid came through the slightly opened door  he peeped in and saw kathleen on her knees on the stern locker with her hands clasped gazing out of one of the stern windows  hm shes all right he muttered softly reclosing the door and returning on deck  if she thinks its splendid she dont need no comfortin  its quite clear that she dont know what danger meansand why should she  humph there go some more splendid sights for her he added as what appeared to be chains of fire ascended from the volcano to the sky  just then a soft rain began to fall  it was warm and on examination at the binnaclelamp turned out to be mud  slight at first it soon poured down in such quantities that in ten minutes it lay six inches thick on the deck and the crew had to set to work with shovels to heave it overboard  at this time there was seen a continual roll of balls of white fire down the sides of the peak of rakata caused doubtless by the ejection of whitehot fragments of lava  then showers of masses like iron cinders fell on the brig and from that time onward till four oclock of the morning of the 27th explosions of indescribable grandeur continually took place as if the mountains were in a continuous roar of terrestrial agonythe sky being at one moment of inky blackness the next in a blaze of light while hot choking and sulphurous smells almost stifled the voyagers  at this point the captain again became anxious about kathleen and went below  he found her in the same place and attitudestill fascinated  my child he said taking her hand you must lie down and rest  oh no  do let me stay up she begged entreatingly  but you must be tiredsleepy  sleepy who could sleep with such wonders going on around  pray dont tell me to go to bed  it was evident that poor kathy had the duty of obedience to authority still strong upon her  perhaps the memory of the holbein nursery had not yet been wiped out  well well said the captain with a pathetic smile you are as safe comfortable i meanhere as in your berth or anywhere else  as there was a lull in the violence of the eruption just then the captain left kathleen in the cabin and went on deck  it was not known at that time what caused this lull but as it preceded the first of the four grand explosions which effectually evisceratedemptiedthe ancient crater of krakatoa we will give briefly the explanation of it as conjectured by the men of science  lying as it did so close to the sealevel the krakatoa volcano having blown away all its cones and vents and safetyvalvesfrom perboewatan southward except the peak of rakatalet the sea rush in upon its infernal fires  this result ordinary people think produced a gush of steam which caused the grand terminal explosions  vulcanologists think otherwise and with reasonwhich is more than can be said of ordinary people who little know the power of the forces at work below the crust of our earth  the steam thus produced although on so stupendous a scale was free to expand and therefore went upwards no doubt in a sufficiently effective gust and cloud  but nothing worthy of being named a blowup was there  the effect of the inrushing water was to cool the upper surface of the boiling lava and convert it into a thick hard solid crust at the mouth of the great vent  in this condition the volcano resembled a boiler with all points of egress closed and the safetyvalve shut down  oceans of molten lava creating expansive gases below no outlet possible underneath and the neck of the bottle corked with tons of solid rock one of two things must happen in such circumstances the cork must go or the bottle must burst  both events happened on that terrible night all night long the corks were going and at lastkrakatoa burst  in the hurlyburly of confusion smoke and noise no eye could note the precise moment when the island was shattered but there were on the morning of the 27th four supreme explosions which rang loud and high above the horrible average din  these occurredaccording to the careful investigations made at the instance of the dutch indian government by the eminent geologist mr rdm verbeekat the hours of 530 644 1002 and 1052 in the morning  of these the third about 10 was by far the worst for violence and for the widespread devastation which it produced  at each of these explosions a tremendous seawave was created by the volcano which swept like a watery ring from krakatoa as a centre to the surrounding shores  it was at the second of these explosionsthat of 644that the fall of the mighty cliff took place which was seen by the hermit and his friends as they fled from the island and on the crest of the resulting wave were carried along they scarce knew whither  as the previous wavethat of 530had given the brig a tremendous heave upwards the captain on hearing the second ran down below for a moment to tell kathleen there would soon be another wave but that she need fear no danger  the brig is deep and has a good hold o the water he said so the wave is sure to slip under her without damage  i wish i could hope it would do as little damage when it reaches the shore  as he spoke a strange and violent crash was heard overhead quite different from volcanic explosions like the falling of some heavy body on the deck  one o the yards down muttered the captain as he ran to the cabin door  hallo whats that mr moor  canoe just come aboard sir  a canoe  yes sir  crew three men and a monkey  all insensiblehallo  the hallo with which the second mate finished his remark was so unlike his wonted tone and so full of genuine surprise that the captain ran forward with unusual haste and found a canoe smashed to pieces against the foremast and the mate held a lantern close to the face of one of the men while the crew were examining the others  a single glance told the captain that the mudbespattered figure that lay before him as if dead was none other than his own son  the great wave had caught the frail craft on its crest and sweeping it along with lightning speed for a short distance had hurled it on the deck of the sunshine with such violence as to completely stun the whole crew even spinkie lay in a melancholy little heap in the lee scuppers  you think this a farfetched coincidence good reader  well all we can say is that we could tell you of anothera doublecoincidence which was far more extraordinary than this one but as it has nothing to do with our tale we refrain from inflicting it on you    chapter twenty six  a climax  three of those who had tumbled thus unceremoniously on the deck of the sunshine were soon sufficiently recovered to sit up and look around in dazed astonishmentnamely nigel moses and the monkeybut the hermit still lay prone where he had been cast with a pretty severe wound on his head from which blood was flowing freely  nigel my boy  father exclaimed the youth  where am i  what has happened  dont excite yourself lad said the mariner stooping and whispering into his sons ear  weve got her aboard  no treatment could have been more effectual in bringing nigel to his senses than this whisper  isisvan der kemp safe he asked anxiously  all rightonly stunned i think  thats him theyre just goin to carry below  put im in my bunk mr moor  ay ay sir  nigel sprang up  stay father he said in a low voice  she must not see him for the first time like this  all right boy  i understand  you leave that to me  my bunk has bin shifted foridmore amidshipsan kathys well aft  they shant be let run foul of each other  you go an rest on the main hatch till we get him down  why heres a nigger  where did you pick him oh  i remember  youre the man we met i suppose wi the hermit on krakatoa that day o the excursion from batavia  yes das me  but well meet on krakatoa no more for dat place am blown to bits  im pretty well convinced o that by this time my man  not hurt much i hope  no sarnot more n i can stan  but is fraid dat poor spinkies amost used uphallo what you gwine to do with massa demanded the negro whose wandering faculties had only in part returned  hes gone below  all right  now you go and lie down beside my son on the hatch  illsee to van der kemp  but captain david roys intentions like those of many men of greater note were frustrated by the hermit himself who recovered consciousness just as the four men who carried him reached the foot of the companionladder close to the cabin door  owing to the deeper than midnight darkness that prevailed a lamp was burning in the cabindimly as if infected by the universal chaos it were unwilling to enlighten the surrounding gloom  on recovering consciousness van der kemp was not unnaturally under the impression that he had fallen into the hands of foes  with one effectual convulsion of his powerful limbs he scattered his bearers right and left and turninglike all honest mento the light he sprang into the cabin wrenched a chair from its fastenings and facing round stood at bay  kathleen seeing this bloodstained giant in such violent action naturally fled to her cabin and shut the door  as no worse enemy than captain roy presented himself at the cabin door unarmed and with an anxious look on his rugged face the hermit set down the chair and feeling giddy sank down on it with a groan  i fear you are badly hurt sir  let me tie a handkerchief round your wounded head said the captain soothingly  thanks thanks  your voice is not unfamiliar to me returned the hermit with a sigh as he submitted to the operation  i thought i had fallen somehow into the hands of pirates  surely an accident must have happened  how did i get here  where are my comradesnigel and the negro  my son nigel is all right sir and so is your man moses  make your mind easyan pray dont speak while im working at you  ill explain it all in good time  stay ill be with you in a moment  the captainfearing that kathleen might come out from curiosity to see what was going on and remembering his sons injunctionwent to the girls berth with the intention of ordering her to keep close until he should give her leave to come out  opening the door softly and looking in he was startled almost horrified to see kathleen standing motionless like a statue with both hands pressed tightly over her heart  the colour had fled from her beautiful face her long hair was flung back her large lustrous eyes were wide open and her lips slightly parted as if her whole being had been concentrated in eager expectancy  whats wrong my girl asked the captain anxiously  youve no cause for fear  i just looked in to  that voice exclaimed kathleen with something of awe in her tonesoh  ive heard it so often in my dreams  hush shush my girl said the captain in a low tone looking anxiously round at the wounded man  but his precautions were unavailingvan der kemp had also heard a voice which he thought had long been silent in death  the girls expression was almost repeated in his face  before the wellmeaning mariner could decide what to do kathleen brushed lightly past him and stood in the cabin gazing as if spellbound at the hermit  winnie he whispered as if scarcely daring to utter the name  father  she extended both hands towards him as she spoke  then with a piercing shriek she staggered backward and would have fallen had not the captain caught her and let her gently down  van der kemp vaulted the table fell on his knees beside her and raising her light form clasped her to his heart just as nigel and moses alarmed by the scream sprang into the cabin  come come away wi youyou stoopid grampusses cried the captain pushing the intruders out of the cabin following them and closing the door behind him  this is no place for bunglers like you an me  we might have known that natur would have her way an didnt need no help from the like o us  lets on deck  theres enough work there to look after thats better suited to us  truly there was enoughand more than enoughto claim the most anxious attention of all who were on board of the sunshine that morning for hot mud was still falling in showers on the deck and the thunders of the great volcano were still shaking heaven earth and sea  to clear the decks and sails of mud occupied every one for some time so earnestly that they failed to notice at first that the hermit had come on deck found a shovel and was working away like the rest of them the frequent and prolonged blazes of intense light that ever and anon banished the darkness showed that on his face there sat an expression of calm settled triumphant joy which was strangely mingled with a look of quiet humility  i thank god for this said nigel going forward when he observed him and grasping his hand  you knew it exclaimed the hermit in surprise  yes  i knew itindeed helped to bring you together but did not dare to tell you till i was quite sure  i had hoped to have you meet in very different circumstances  it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps returned the hermit reverently  god bless you nigel  if you have even aimed at bringing this about i owe you more than my life  you must have lost a good deal of blood van der kemp  are you much hurt asked nigel as he observed the bandage round his friends head  somewhat  not much i hopebut joy as well as blood gives strength nigel  a report from a man who had just been ordered to take soundings induced the captain at this time to layto  it seems to me he said to nigel and the hermit who stood close beside him that we are getting too near shore  but in cases o this kind the bottom o the sea itself cant be depended on  what part of the shore are we near dyou think father  stand by to let go the anchor roared the captain instead of answering the question  ay ay sir replied the second mate whose cool singsong businesslike tone at such a moment actually tended to inspire a measure of confidence in those around him  another moment and the rattling chain caused a tremor through the vessel which ceased when the anchor touched bottom and they rode head to wind  coruscations of bluish light seemed to play about the masts and balls of electric fire tipped the yards throwing for a short time a ghastly sheen over the ship and crew for the profound darkness had again settled down owing no doubt to another choking of the krakatoa vent  before the light referred to went out moses was struck violently on the chest by something soft which caused him to stagger  it was spinkie  in the midst of the unusual horrors that surrounded him while clinging to the unfamiliar mizzen shrouds on which in desperation the poor monkey had found a temporary refuge the electric fire showed him the dark figure of his old familiar friend standing not far off  with a shriek of not quite hopeless despair and an inconceivable bound spinkie launched himself into space  his early training in the forest stood him in good stead at that crisis  as already said he hit the mark fairly and clung to moses with a tenacity that was born of mingled love and desperation  finding that nothing short of cruelty would unfix his little friend moses stuffed him inside the breast of his cotton shirt  in this haven of rest the monkey heaved a sigh of profound contentment folded his hands on his bosom and meekly went to sleep  two of the excessively violent paroxysms of the volcano above referred to had by that time taken place but the third and worstthat which occurred about 10 amwas yet in store for them though they knew it not and a lull in the roar accompanied by thicker darkness than ever was its precursor  there was not however any lull in the violence of the wind  i dont like these lulls said captain roy to the hermit as they stood close to the binnacle in the feeble light of its lamp  what is that striking against our sides mr moor  looks like floating pumice sir answered the second mate and i think i see palmtrees amongst it  ay i thought so we must be close to land said the captain  we cant be far from anjer and i fear the big waves that have already passed us have done some damage  lower a lantern over the sideno fetch an empty tarbarrel and lets have a flare  that will enable us to see things better  while the barrel was being fastened to a spar so as to be thrust well out beyond the side of the brig van der kemp descended the companion and opened the cabin door  come up now winnie darling  yes father was the reply as the poor girl who had been anxiously awaiting the summons glided out and clasped her fathers arm with both hands  are things quieting down  they are a little  it may be temporary butour father directs it all  true father  im so glad of that  mind the step we shall have more light on deck  there is a friend there who has just told me he met you on the cocoskeeling island nigel royyou start winnie  yyes father  i am so surprised for it is his father who sails this ship  and i cannot imagine how he or you came on board  well i was going to say that i believe it is partly through nigel that you and i have been brought together but there is mystery about it that i dont yet understand much has to be explained and this assuredly is not the time or place  here nigel is your old keeling friend  ayfriend humph said old roy softly to himself  my dearchild said young roy paternally to the girl as he grasped her hand  i cannot tell you how thankful i am that this has been brought about andand that i have had some little hand in it  theres more than pumice floating about in the sea sir said mr moor coming aft at the moment and speaking to the captain in a low tone  youd better send the young lady belowor get some one to take up her attention just now  here nigel  sit down under the lee of the companion an tell kathy how this all came about said the captain promptly as if issuing nautical orders  i want you here van der kemp  so saying the captain followed by the hermit went with the second mate to the place where the flaming tarbarrel was casting a lurid glare upon the troubled sea    chapter twenty seven  blown to bits  the sight that met their eyes was well calculated to shock and sadden men of much less tender feeling than van der kemp and captain roy  the water had assumed an appearance of inky blackness and large masses of pumice were floating past among which were numerous dead bodies of men women and children intermingled with riven trees fences and other wreckage from the land showing that the two great waves which had already passed under the vessel had caused terrible devastation on some parts of the shore  to add to the horror of the scene large seasnakes were seen swimming wildly about as if seeking to escape from the novel dangers that surrounded them  the sailors looked on in awestricken silence for some time  praps some of em may be alive yet whispered one  couldnt we lower a boat  impossible in such a sea said the captain who overheard the remark besides no life could exist there  captain roy said van der kemp earnestly let me advise you to get your foresail ready to hoist at a moments notice and let them stand by to cut the cable  why so  there seems no need at present for such strong measures  you dont understand volcanoes as i do returned the hermit  this lull will only last until the imprisoned fires overcome the block in the crater and the longer it lasts the worse will be the explosion  from my knowledge of the coast i feel sure that we are close to the town of anjer  if another wave like the last comes while we are here it will not slip under your brig like the last one  it will tear her from her anchor and hurl us all to destruction  you have but one chance that is to cut the cable and run in on the top of ita poor chance at the best but if god wills we shall escape  if we are indeed as near shore as you think said the captain i know what you say must be true for in shoal water such a wave will surely carry all before it  but are you certain there will be another explosion  no man can be sure of that  if the last explosion emptied the crater there will be no more  if it did not another explosion is certain all i advise is that you should be ready for whatever is coming and ready to take your only chance  right you are sir  send men to be ready to cut the cable mr moor and stand by the topsail halyards  ay ay sir  during the anxious minutes that followed the hermit rejoined winnie and nigel on the quarterdeck and conversed with the latter in a low voice while he drew the former to his side with his strong arm  captain roy himself grasped the wheel and the men stood at their various stations ready for action  let no man act without orders whatever happens said the captain in a deep powerful voice which was heard over the whole ship for the lull that we have mentioned extended in some degree to the gale as well as to the volcano  every one felt that some catastrophe was pending  winnie darling said the hermit tenderly as he bent down to see the sweet face that had been restored to him  i greatly fear that there is soon to be another explosion and it may be his will that we shall perish but comfort yourself with the certainty that no hair of your dear head can fall without his permissionand in any event he will not fail us  i know it father  i have no fearat least only a little  nigel said the hermit stick close to us if you can  it may be that if anything should befall me your strong arm may succour winnie mine has lost somewhat of its vigour he whispered  trust menothing but death shall sunder us said the anxious youth in a burst of enthusiasm  it seemed as if death were indeed to be the immediate portion of all on board the sunshine for a few minutes later there came a crash followed by a spout of smoke fire steam and molten lava compared to which all that had gone before seemed insignificant  the crash was indescribable  as we have said elsewhere the sound of it was heard many hundreds of miles from the seat of the volcano and its effects were seen and felt right round the world  the numerous vents which had previously been noticed on krakatoa must at that moment have been blown into one and the original crater of the old volcanosaid to have been about six miles in diametermust have resumed its destructive work  all the eyewitnesses who were near the spot at the time and sufficiently calm to take note of the terrific events of that morning are agreed as to the splendour of the electrical phenomena displayed during this paroxysmal outburst  one who at the time was forty miles distant speaks of the great vapourcloud looking like an immense wall or bloodred curtain with edges of all shades of yellow and bursts of forked lightning at times rushing like large serpents through the air  another says that krakatoa appeared to be alight with flickering flames rising behind a dense black cloud  a third recorded that the lightning struck the mainmast conductor five or six times and that the mudrain which covered the decks was phosphorescent while the rigging presented the appearance of saint elmos fire  it may be remarked here in passing that giant steamjets rushing through the orifices of the earths crust constitute an enormous hydroelectric engine and the friction of ejected materials striking against each other in ascending and descending also generates electricity which accounts to some extent for the electrical condition of the atmosphere  in these final and stupendous outbursts the volcano was expending its remaining force in breaking up and ejecting the solid lava which constituted its framework and not in merely vomiting forth the lavafroth or pumice which had characterised the earlier stages of the eruption  in point of factas was afterwards clearly ascertained by careful soundings and estimates taking the average height of the missing portion at 700 feet above water and the depth at 300 feet below ittwothirds of the island were blown entirely off the face of the earth  the mass had covered an area of nearly six miles and is estimated as being equal to one and oneeighth cubic miles of solid matter which as moses expressed it was blown to bits  if this had been all it would have been enough to claim the attention and excite the wonder of the intelligent worldbut this was not nearly all as we shall see for saddest of all the incidents connected with the eruption is the fact that upwards of thirtysix thousand human beings lost their lives  the manner in which that terrible loss occurred shall be shown by the future adventures of the sunshine    chapter twenty eight  the fate of the sunshine  stunned at first for a few minutes by the extreme violence of the explosion no one on board the sunshine spoke though each man stood at his post ready to act  strange said the captain at last  there seems to be no big wave this time  that only shows that we are not as near the island as we thought  but it wont be long ofsee  there it comes said the hermit  now winnie cling to my arm and put your trust in god  nigel who had secured a lifebuoy moved close to the girls side and looking anxiously out ahead saw a faint line of foam in the thick darkness which had succeeded the explosion  already the distant roar of the billow was heard proving that it had begun to break  the wind comes with it said van der kemp  stand by cried the captain gazing intently over the side  next moment came the sharp order to hoist the foretopsail and jib soon followed by cut the cable  there was breeze enough to swing the vessel quickly round  in a few seconds her stern was presented to the coming wave and her bow cleft the water as she rushed upon what every one now knew was her doom  to escape the great wave was no part of the captains plan  to have reached the shore before the wave would have been fatal to all  their only hope lay in the possibility of riding in on the top of it and the great danger was that they should be unable to rise to it stern first when it came up or that they should turn broadside on and be rolled over  they had not long to wait  the size of the wave before it came near enough to be seen was indicated by its solemn deeptoned everincreasing roar  the captain stood at the wheel himself guiding the brig and glancing back from time to time uneasily  suddenly the volcano gave vent to its fourth and final explosion  it was not so violent as its predecessors had been though more so than any that had occurred on the day before and the light of it showed them the full terrors of their situation for it revealed the mountains of java apparently quite close in front though in reality at a considerable distancewith a line of breakers beating white on the shore  but astern of them was the most appalling sight for there rushing on with awful speed and a sort of hissing roar came the monstrous wave emerging as it were out of thick darkness like a mighty wall of water with a foaming white crest not much lessaccording to an average of the most reliable estimatesthan 100 feet high  well might the seamen blanch for never before in all their varied experience had they seen the like of that  on it came with the unwavering force of fate  to the eye of captain roy it appeared that up its huge towering side no vessel made by mortal man could climb  but the captain had too often stared death in the face to be unmanned by the prospect now  steadily he steered the vessel straight on and in a quiet voice said  lay hold of something firmevery man  the warning was well timed  in the amazement if not fear caused by the unwonted sight some had neglected the needful precaution  as the billow came on the bubbling leaping and seething of its crest was apparent both to eye and ear  then the roar became tremendous  darling winnie said nigel at that moment  i will die for you or with you  the poor girl heard but no sign of appreciation moved her pale face as she gazed up at the approaching chaos of waters  next moment the brig seemed to stand on its bows  van der kemp had placed his daughter against the mast and throwing his long arms round both held on  nigel close to them had grasped a handful of ropes and every one else was holding on for life  another moment and the brig rose as if it were being tossed up to the heavens  immediately thereafter it resumed its natural position in a perfect wilderness of foam  they were on the summit of the great wave which was so large that its crest seemed like a broad rounded mass of tumbling snow with blackness before and behind while the roar of the tumult was deafening the brig rushed onward at a speed which she had never before equalled even in the fiercest galetossed hither and thither by the leaping foam yet always kept going straight onward by the expert steering of her captain  come aftall of you he shouted when it was evident that the vessel was being borne surely forward on the waves crest  the masts will go for certain when we strike  the danger of being entangled in the falling spars and cordage was so obvious that every one except the hermit and nigel obeyed  here nigel gasped the former  iivelost bloodfaint  our hero at once saw that van der kemp fainting from previous loss of blood coupled with exertion was unable to do anything but hold on indeed he failed even in that and would have fallen to the deck had nigel not caught him by the arm  can you run aft winnie said nigel anxiously  yes said the girl at once understanding the situation and darting to the wheel of which and of captain roy she laid firm hold while nigel lifted the hermit in his arms and staggered to the same spot  winnie knelt beside him immediately and forgetting for the moment all the horrors around her busied herself in replacing the bandage which had been loosened from his head  oh  mr roy save himsave him cried the poor child appealing in an agony to nigel for she felt instinctively that when the crash came her father would be utterly helpless even to save himself  nigel had barely time to answer when a wild shout from the crew caused him to start up and look round  a flare from the volcano had cast a red light over the bewildering scene and revealed the fact that the brig was no longer above the oceans bed but was passing in its wild career right through or rather over the demolished town of anjer  a few of the houses that had been left standing by the previous waves were being swepthurledaway by this one but the mass of rolling rushing spouting water was so deep that the vessel had as yet struck nothing save the tops of some palmtrees which bent their heads like straws before the flood  even in the midst of the amazement alarm and anxiety caused by the situation nigel could not help wondering that in this final and complete destruction of the town no sign of struggling human beings should be visible  he forgot at the moment what was terribly proved afterwards that the first waves had swallowed up men women and children by hundreds and that the few who survived had fled to the hills leaving nothing for the larger wave to do but complete the work of devastation on inanimate objects  ere the situation had been well realised the volcanic fires went down again and left the world for over a hundred surrounding miles in opaque darkness  only the humble flicker of the binnaclelight like a trusty sentinel on duty continued to shed its feeble rays on a few feet of the deck and showed that the compass at least was still faithful to the pole  then another volcanic outburst revealed the fact that the wave which carried them was thundering on in the direction of a considerable cliff or precipicenot indeed quite straight towards it but sufficiently so to render escape doubtful  at the same time a swarm of terrorstricken people were seen flying towards this cliff and clambering up its steep sides  they were probably some of the more courageous of the inhabitants who had summoned courage to return to their homes after the passage of the second wave their shrieks and cries could be heard above even the roaring of the water and the detonations of the volcano  god spare us exclaimed poor winnie whose trembling form was now partially supported by nigel  as she spoke darkness again obscured everything and they could do naught but listen to the terrible soundsand pray  onon went the sunshine in the midst of wreck and ruin on this strange voyage over land and water until a check was felt  it was not a crash as had been anticipated and as might have naturally been expected neither was it an abrupt stoppage  there was first a hissing scraping sound against the vessels sides then a steady checkingwe might almost say a hindrance to progressnot violent yet so very decided that the rigging could not bear the strain  one and another of the backstays parted the foretopsail burst with a cannonlike report after which a terrible rending sound followed by an indescribable crash told that both masts had gone by the board  then all was comparatively stillcomparatively we say for water still hissed and leaped beneath them like a rushing river though it no longer roared and the wind blew in unfamiliar strains and laden with unwonted odours  at that moment another outburst of krakatoa revealed the fact that the great wave had borne the brig inland for upwards of a mile and left her imbedded in a thick grove of cocoanut palms    chapter twenty nine  tells chiefly of the wonderful effects of this eruption on the world at large  the great explosions of that morning had done more damage and had achieved results more astounding than lies in the power of language adequately to describe or of history to parallel  let us take a glance at this subject in passing  an inhabitant of anjerowner of a hotel a shipchandlers store two houses and a dozen boatswent down to the beach about six on the morning of that fateful 27th of august  he had naturally been impressed by the night of the 26th though accustomed as he was to volcanic eruptions he felt no apprehensions as to the safety of the town  he went to look to the moorings of his boats leaving his family of seven behind him  while engaged in this work he observed a wave of immense size approaching  he leaped into one of his boats which was caught up by the wave and swept inland carrying its owner there in safety  but this was the wave that sealed the doom of the town and most of its inhabitants including the hotelkeepers family and all that he possessed  this is one only out of thousands of cases of bereavement and destruction  a lighthousekeeper was seated in his solitary watchtower speculating doubtless on the probable continuance of such a violent outbreak while his family and matesaccustomed to sleep in the midst of elemental warwere resting peacefully in the rooms below when one of the mighty waves suddenly appeared thundered past and swept the lighthouse with all its inhabitants away  this shows but one of the many disasters to lighthouses in sunda straits  a dutch manofwarthe berouwwas lying at anchor in lampong bay fifty miles from krakatoa  the great wave came tore it from its anchorage and carried itlike the vessel of our friend david roy nearly two miles inland  masses of coral of immense size and weight were carried four miles inland by the same wave  the river at anjer was choked up the conduit which used to carry water into the place was destroyed and the town itself was laid in ruins  but these are only a few of the incidents of the great catastrophe  who can conceive much less tell of those terrible details of sudden death and disaster to thousands of human beings resulting from an eruption which destroyed towns like telok betong anjer tyringin etcetera besides numerous villages and hamlets on the shores of java and sumatra and caused the destruction of more than 36000 souls  but it is to results of a very different kind and on a much more extended scale that we must turn if we would properly estimate the magnitude the widespreading and farreaching influences and the extraordinary character of the krakatoa outburst of 1883  in the first place it is a fact testified to by some of the bestknown men of science that the shock of the explosion extended appreciably right round the world and seventeen miles some say even higher up into the heavens  mr verbeek in his treatise on this subject estimates that a cubic mile of krakatoa was propelled in the form of the finest dust into the higher regions of the atmosphereprobably about thirty miles  the dust thus sent into the sky was of ultramicroscopic fineness and it travelled round and round the world in a westerly direction producing those extraordinary sunsets and gorgeous effects and afterglows which became visible in the british isles in the month of november following the eruption and the mighty waves which caused such destruction in the vicinity of sunda straits travellednot once but at leastsix times round the globe as was proved by trustworthy and independent observations of tidegauges and barometers made and recorded at the same time in nearly all landsincluding our own  other volcanoes it is said by those who have a right to speak in regard to such matters have ejected more stuff but not one has equalled krakatoa in the intensity of its explosions the appalling results of the seawaves the wonderful effects in the sky and the almost miraculous nature of the sounds  seated on a log under a palmtree in batavia on that momentous morning of the 27th was a sailor who had been left behind sick by captain roy when he went on his rather quixotic trip to the keeling islands  he was a somewhat delicate son of the sea  want of selfrestraint was his complaintleading to a surfeit of fruit and other things which terminated in a severe fit of indigestion and indisposition to life in general  he was smokingthat being a sovereign and infallible cure for indigestion and all other ills that flesh is heir to as every one knows  i say old man he inquired with that cheerful tone and air which usually accompanies incapacity for food  do it always rain ashes here  the old man whom he addressed was a veteran malay seaman  no replied the malay sometimes it rain mudhot mud  do it  oh wellanything for variety i spose returned the sailor with a growl which had reference to internal disarrangements  is it often as dark as this in the daytime an is the sun usually green he asked carelessly more for the sake of distracting the mind from other matters than for the desire of knowledge  sometime its more darker replied the old man  ive seed it so dark that you couldnt see how awful dark it was  as he spoke a sound that has been described by earwitnesses as deafening smote upon their tympanums the log on which they sat quivered the earth seemed to tremble and several dishes in a neighbouring hut were thrown down and broken  i say old man suthin busted there remarked the sailor taking the pipe from his mouth and quietly ramming its contents down with the end of his blunt forefinger  the malay looked grave  the gasometer suggested the sailor  no that never busts  a noo mountain come into action praps an blowd its top off  shouldnt wonder if thats itclose at hand too  wes used to that here  but thems bigger cracks than ornar  the old malay was right as to the cause but wrong as to distance instead of being a volcano close at hand it was krakatoa eviscerating itself a hundred miles off and the sound of its last grand effort extended over 50 degrees equal to about 3000 miles  on that day all the gas lights were extinguished in batavia and the pictures rattled on the walls as though from the action of an earthquake  but there was no earthquake  it was the airwave from krakatoa and the noise produced by the airwaves that followed was described as deafening  the effect of the sounds of the explosions on the straits settlements generally was not only striking but to some extent amusing  at carimon in java355 miles distant from krakatoait was supposed that a vessel in distress was firing guns and several native boats were sent off to render assistance but no distressed vessel was to be found  at acheen in sumatra1073 miles distantthey supposed that a fort was being attacked and the troops were turned out under arms  at singapore522 miles offthey fancied that the detonations came from a vessel in distress and two steamers were despatched to search for it  and here the effect on the telephone extending to ishore was remarkable  on raising the tubes a perfect roar as of a waterfall was heard  by shouting at the top of his voice the clerk at one end could make the clerk at the other end hear but he could not render a word intelligible  at perak770 miles offthe sounds were thought to be distant salvos of artillery and commander the honourable f vereker rn of hms magpie when 1227 miles distant in latitude 5 degrees 52 minutes north longitude 118 degrees 22 minutes east states that the detonations of krakatoa were distinctly heard by those on board his ship and by the inhabitants of the coast as far as banguey island on august 27th  he adds that they resembled distant heavy cannonading in a letter from saint lucia bay1116 miles distantit was stated that the eruption was plainly heard all over borneo  a government steamer was sent out from the island of timor1351 miles offto ascertain the cause of the disturbance  in south australia also at places 2250 miles away explosions were heard on the 26th and 27th which awakened people and were thought worthy of being recorded and reported  from tavoy in burmah1478 miles awaythe report cameall day on august 27th unusual sounds were heard resembling the boom of guns  thinking there might be a wreck or a ship in distress the tavoy superintendent sent out the police launch but they could see nothing  and so on far and near similar records were made the most distant spot where the sounds were reported to have been heard being rodriguez in the pacific nearly 3000 miles distant  one peculiar feature of the records is that some ships in the immediate neighbourhood of krakatoa did not experience the shock in proportionate severity  probably this was owing to their being so near that a great part of the concussion and sound flew over themsomewhat in the same way that the pieces of a bombshell fly over men who being too near to escape by running escape by flinging themselves flat on the ground  each airwave which conveyed these sounds commencing at krakatoa as a centre spread out in an everincreasing circle till it reached a distance of 180 degrees from its origin and encircled the earth at its widest part after which it continued to advance in a contracting form until it reached the antipodes of the volcano whence it was reflected or reproduced and travelled back again to krakatoa  here it was turned rightaboutface and again despatched on its long journey  in this way it oscillated backward and forward not fewer than six times before traces of it were lost  we say traces because these remarkable facts were ascertained tracked and corroborated by independent barometric observation in all parts of the earth  for instance the passage of the great airwave from krakatoa to its antipodes and from its antipodes back to krakatoa was registered six times by the automatic barometer at greenwich  the instrument at kew observatory confirmed the records of greenwich and so did the barometers of other places in the kingdom  everywhere in europe also this fact was corroborated and in some places even a seventh oscillation was recorded  the greenwich record shows that the airwaves took about thirtysix hours to travel from pole to pole thus proving that they travelled at about the rate of ordinary soundwaves which roughly speaking travel at the rate of between six and seven hundred miles an hour  the height of the seawaves that devastated the neighbouring shores being variously estimated at from 50 to 135 feet is sufficiently accounted for by the intervention of islands and headlands etcetera which of course tended to diminish the force height and volume of waves in varying degrees  these like the airwaves were also registeredby selfacting tidegauges and by personal observationall over the world and the observations coincided as to date with the great eruptions of the 26th and 27th of august  the influence of the seawaves was observed and noted in the java seawhich is shallow and where there are innumerable obstructionsas far as 450 miles but to the west they swept over the deep waters of the indian ocean on to cape horn and even it is said to the english channel  the unusual disturbance of ocean in various places was sufficiently striking  at galle in ceylon where the usual rise and fall of the tide is 2 feet the masterattendant reports that on the afternoon of the 27th four remarkable waves were noticed in the port  the last of these was preceded by an unusual recession of the sea to such an extent that small boats at their anchorage were left agrounda thing that had never been seen before  the period of recession was only oneandahalf minutes then the water paused as it were for a brief space and beginning to rise reached the level of the highest highwater mark in less than two minutes thus marking a difference of 8 feet 10 inches instead of the ordinary 2 feet  at one place there was an ebb and flood tide of unusual extent within halfanhour  at another a belt of land including a buryingground was washed away so that according to the observer it appeared as if the dead had sought shelter with the living in a neighbouring cocoanut garden  elsewhere the tides were seen to advance and recede ten or twelve timesin one case even twenty timeson the 27th  at trincomalee the sea receded three times and returned with singular force at one period leaving part of the shore suddenly bare with fish struggling in the mud  the utilitarian tendency of mankind was at once made manifest by some fishermen who seizing the opportunity dashed into the struggling mass and began to reap the accidental harvest whenalas for the poor fishermenthe sea rushed in again and drove them all away  in the mauritius however the fishers were more fortunate for when their beach was exposed in a similar manner they succeeded in capturing a good many fish before the water returned  even sharks were disturbed in their sinister and slimy habits of life by this outburst of krakatoaand no wonder when it is recorded that in some places the sea looked like water boiling heavily in a pot and that the boats which were afloat were swinging in all directions  at one place several of these monsters were flung out of their native home into pools where they were left struggling till their enemy man terminated their career  everywhere those great waves produced phenomena which were so striking as to attract the attention of all classes of people to ensure record in most parts of the world and to call for the earnest investigation of the scientific men of many landsand the conclusion to which such men have almost universally come is that the strange vagaries of the sea all over the earth the mysterious sounds heard in so many widely distant places and the wonderful effects in the skies of every quarter of the globe were all due to the eruption of the krakatoa volcano in 1883  with reference to these lastthe skyeffectsa few words may not be out of place here  the superfine ultramicroscopic dust which was blown by the volcano in quantities so enormous to such unusual heights was after dropping its heavier particles back to earth caught by the breezes which always blow in the higher regions from east to west and carried by them for many months round and round the world  the dust was thickly and not widely spread at first but as time went on it gradually extended itself on either side becoming visible to more and more of earths inhabitants and at the same time becoming necessarily less dense  through this medium the suns rays had to penetrate  in so far as the dustparticles were opaque they would obscure these rays where they were transparent or polished they would refract and reflect them  that the material of which those dustparticles was composed was very various has been ascertained proved and recorded by the krakatoa committee the attempt to expound this matter would probably overtax the endurance of the average reader yet it may interest all to know that this dustcloud travelled westward within the tropics at the rate of about double the speed of an express trainsay 120 miles an hour crossed the indian ocean and africa in three days the atlantic in two america in two and in short put a girdle round the world in thirteen days moreover the cloud of dust was so big that it took two or three days to pass any given point  during its second circumnavigation it was considerably spread and thinned and the third time still more so having expanded enough to include europe and the greater part of north america  it had thinned away altogether and disappeared in the spring of 1884  who has not seenat least read or heard ofthe gorgeous skies of the autumn of 1883  not only in britain but in all parts of the world these same skies were seen admired and commented on as marvellous and so they were  one of the chief peculiarities about them besides their splendour was the fact that they consisted chiefly of afterglowsthat is an increase of light and splendour after the setting of the sun when in an ordinary state of things the grey shadows of evening would have descended on the world  greenishblue suns pink clouds bright yellow orange and crimson afterglows gorgeous magnificent bloodred skiesthe commentators seemed unable to find language adequately to describe them  listen to a german observers remarks on the subject  the display of november 29th was the grandest and most manifold  i give a description as exactly as possible for its overwhelming magnificence still presents itself to me as if it had been yesterday when the sun had set about a quarter of an hour there was not much afterglow but i had observed a remarkably yellow bow in the south about 10 degrees above the horizon  in about ten minutes more this arc rose pretty quickly extended itself all over the east and up to and beyond the zenith  the sailors declared sir that is the northern lights  i thought i had never seen northern lights in greater splendour  after five minutes more the light had faded though not vanished in the east and south and the finest purplered rose up in the southwest one could imagine onesself in fairyland  all this and a great deal more was caused by the dust of krakatoa  but howhowwhy exclaims an impatient and puzzled reader  aytheres the rub  rubbing by the way may have had something to do with it  at all events we are safe to say that whatever there was of electricity in the matter resulted from friction  here is what the men of science sayas far as we can gather and condense  the fine dust blown out of krakatoa was found under the microscope to consist of excessively thin transparent plates or irregular specks of pumicewhich inconceivably minute fragments were caused by enormous steam pressure in the interior and the sudden expansion of the masses blown out into the atmosphere  of this glassy dust that which was blown into the regions beyond the clouds must have been much finer even than that which was examined  these glass fragments were said by dr flugel to contain either innumerable airbubbles or minute needlelike crystals or both  small though these vesicles were when ejected from the volcano they would become still smaller by bursting when they suddenly reached a much lower pressure of atmosphere at a great height some of them however owing to tenacity of material and other causes might have failed to burst and would remain floating in the upper air as perfect microscopic glass balloons  thus the dust was a mass of particles of every conceivable shape and so fine that no watches boxes or instruments were tight enough to exclude from their interior even that portion of the dust which was heavy enough to remain on earth  now to the unscientific reader it is useless to say more than that the innumerable and varied positions of these glassy particles some transparent others semitransparent or opaque reflecting the suns rays in different directions with a complex modification of colour and effect resulting from the blueness of the sky the condition of the atmosphere and many other causesall combined to produce the remarkable appearances of light and colour which aroused the admiration and wonder of the world in 1883  the more one thinks of these things and the deeper one dives into the mysteries of nature the more profoundly is one impressed at once with a humbling sense of the limited amount of ones knowledge and an aweinspiring appreciation of the illimitable fields suggested by that comprehensive expression the wonderful works of god    chapter thirty  coming events etceterawonderful changes among the islands  some days after the wreck of the sunshine as described in a previous chapter captain roy and his son stood on the coast of java not far from the ruins of anjer  a vessel was anchored in the offing and a little boat lay on the shore  all sign of elemental strife had passed though a cloud of smoke hanging over the remains of krakatoa told that the terrible giant below was not dead but only sleepingto awake perchance after a nap of another 200 years  well father said our hero with a modest look it may be as you suggest that winnie van der kemp does not care for me more than for a fathom of salt water  i did not say salt water lad i said bilgea fathom o bilge water interrupted the captain who although secretly rejoiced at the fact of his son having fallen over head and ears in love with the pretty little cocoskeeling islander deemed it his duty nevertheless as a sternly upright parent to make quite sure that the love was mutual as well as deep before giving his consent to anything like courtship  it matters not salt or bilge water makes little difference returned the son with a smile  but all i can say is that i care for winnie so much that her love is to me of as much importance as sunshine to the worldand we have had some experience lately of what the want of that means  nonsense nigel returned the captain severely  youre workin yourself into them upintheclouds reefpointpatterin regions againwhich by the way should be pretty well choked wi krakatoa dust by this time  come down out o that if ye want to hold ornary intercourse wi your old father  shes far too young yet my boy  you must just do as many a young fellow has done before you attend to your dooties and forget her  forget her returned the youth with that amused quiet expression which wise men sometimes assume when listening to foolish suggestions i could almost as easily forget my mother  a very proper sentiment nigel veryespecially the almost part of it  besides continued the son she is not so very youngand that difficulty remedies itself every hour  moreover i too am young  i can wait  the selfishness of youth is only equalled by its presumption said the captain  how dee know she will wait  i dont know father but i hope she willithink she will  nigel said the captain in a tone and with a look that were meant to imply intense solemnity have you ever spoken to her about love  no father  has she ever spoken to you  noat leastnot with her lips  come boy youre humbuggin your old father  her tongue couldnt well do it without the lips lendin a hand  well thenwith neither returned the son  she spoke with her eyes not intentionally of course for the eyes unlike the lips refuse to be under control  hm  i seereefpointpatterin poetics again  an what did she say with her eyes  really father you press me too hard it is difficult to translate eyelanguage but if youll only let memory have free play and revert to that time nigh quarter of a century ago when you first met with a certain real poetess perhaps  ah you dog you have me there  but how dare you sir venture to think of marryin on nothin  i dont think of doing so  am i not a first mate with a handsome salary  no lad youre not  youre nothin better than a seaman out o work with your late ship wrecked in a cocoanut grove  thats true returned nigel with a laugh  but is not the cargo of the said ship safe in batavia  has not its owner a good bank account in england  wont another ship be wanted and another first mate and would the owner dare to pass over his own son who is such a competent seamanaccording to your own showing  come father i turn the tables on you and ask you to aid rather than resist me in this matter  well i will my boy i will said the captain heartily as he laid his hand on his sons shoulder  but seriously you must haul off this little craft and clap a stopper on your tongueay and on your eyes tootill three points are considered an made quite clear  first you must find out whether the hermit would be agreeable  second you must look the matter straight in the face and make quite sure that you mean it  for better or for worse  no undoin that knot nigel once its fairly tied  and third you must make quite sure that winnie is sure of her own mind an thatthat  were all sure all round father  quite right  i agree with you all fair an aboveboard should be the sailing orders of every man in such matters especially of every seaman  but will you explain how i am to make sure of winnies state of mind without asking her about it  well i dont exactly see my way replied the captain slowly  what dee say to my soundin her on the subject  couldnt think of it  you may be firstrate at deepsea soundings father but you couldnt sound the depths of a young girls heart  i must reserve that for myself however long it may be delayed  so be it lad  the only embargo that i lay upon you ishaul off and mind you dont let your figurehead go by the board  meanwhile here comes the boat  now nigel none o your courtin till everything is settled and the wind fairdead aft my lad and blowin stiff  you and the hermit are goin off to krakatoa today i suppose  yes  i am just now waiting for him and moses returned nigel  is winnie going  dont know  i hope so  humph  well if we have a fair wind i shall soon be in batavia said the captain descending to business matters and i expect without trouble to dispose of the cargo that we landed there as well as that part o the return cargo which i had bought before i left for keeling at a loss no doubt but that dont matter much  then ill come back here by the first craft that offersarter which  ayay shove her in here  plenty o water  the last remark was made to the seaman who steered the boat sent from the vessel in the offing  a short time thereafter captain roy was sailing away for batavia while his son with van der kemp moses winnie and spinkie was making for krakatoa in a native boat  the hermit in spite of his injuries had recovered his wonted appearance if not his wonted vigour  winnie seemed to have suddenly developed into a mature woman under her recent experiences though she had lost none of her girlish grace and attractiveness  as for moses time and tide seemed to have no effect whatever on his ebony frame and still less if possible on his indomitable spirit  now you keep still he said in solemn tones and with warning looks to spinkie  if you keep fidgitin about youll capsize de boat  you hear  spinkie veiled his real affection for the negro under a look of supreme indifference while winnie went off into a sudden giggle at the idea of such a small creature capsizing the boat  mindful of his fathers warning nigel did his best to haul off and to prevent his figurehead from going by the board  but he found it uncommonly hard work for winnie looked so innocent so pretty so unconscious so sympathetic with everybody and everything so very young yet so wondrously wise and womanly that he felt an irresistible desire to prostrate himself at her feet in abject slavery  dear little thing said winnie putting her hand on spinkies little head and smoothing him down from eyes to tail  spinkie looked as if half inclined to withdraw his allegiance from moses and bestow it on winnie but evidently changed his mind after a moments reflection  o that i were a monkey thought nigel paraphrasing shakespeare that i might but it is not fair to our hero to reveal him in his weaker moments  there was something exasperating too in being obliged owing to the size of the boat to sit so close to winnie without having a right to touch her hand  who has not experienced this and felt himself to be a very hero of selfdenial in the circumstances  mos awrful hot remarked moses wiping his forehead with the sleeve of his shirt  you hot said nigel in surprise  i thought nothing on earth could be too hot for you  dats your ignerance returned moses calmly  us niggers you see ought to suffer more fro heat dan you whites  how so  why dont your flossiphers say dat black am better dan white for tractin heat an aint our skins black  i wish wed bin born white as chalk  i say massa nadgel seems to me dat deres not much left ob krakatoa  they had approached near enough to the island by that time to perceive that wonderful changes had indeed taken place and van der kemp who had been for some time silently absorbed in contemplation at last turned to his daughter and said  i had feared at first winnie that my old home had been blown entirely away but i see now that the peak of rakata still stands so perhaps i may yet show you the cave in which i have spent so many years  but why did you go to live in such a strange place dear father asked the girl laying her hand lovingly on the hermits arm  van der kemp did not reply at once  he gazed in his childs face with an increase of that absent air and faraway look which nigel ever since he met him had observed as one of his characteristics  at this time an anxious thought crossed himthat perhaps the blows which his friend had received on his head when he was thrown on the deck of the sunshine might have injured his brain  it is not easy to answer your question dear one he said after a time laying his strong hand on the girls head and smoothing her luxuriant hair which hung in the untrammelled freedom of nature over her shoulders  i have felt sometimes during the last few days as if i were awaking out of a long long dream or recovering from a severe illness in which delirium had played a prominent part  even now though i see and touch you i sometimes tremble lest i should really awake and find that it is all a dream  i have so oftenso very oftendreamed something like it in years gone by but never so vividly as now  i cannot doubtit is sin to doubtthat my prayers have been at last answered  god is good and wise  he knows what is best and does not fail in bringing the best to pass  yet i have doubted himagain and again  van der kemp paused here and drew his hand across his brow as if to clear away sad memories of the past while winnie drew closer to him and looked up tenderly in his face  when your mother died dear one he resumed it seemed to me as if the sun had left the heavens and when you were snatched from me it was as though my soul had fled and nought but animal life remained  i lived as if in a terrible dream  i cannot recall exactly what i did or where i went for a long long time  i know i wandered through the archipelago looking for you because i did not believe at first that you were dead  it was at this time i took up my abode in the cave of rakata and fell in with my good faithful friend moses  your sarvint massa interrupted the negro humbly  is proud to be call your frind but is only your sarvint massa  truly you have been my faithful servant moses said van der kemp but not the less have you been my trusted friend  he nursed me through a long and severe illness winnie  how long i am not quite sure after a time i nearly lost hope  then there came a very dark period when i was forced to believe that you must be dead  yet strange to say even during this dark time i did not cease to pray and to wander about in search of you  i suppose it was the force of habit for hope seemed to have died  then at last nigel found you  god used him as his instrument  and now praise to his name we are reunitedfor ever  darling father were the only words that winnie could utter as she laid her head on the hermits shoulder and wept for joy  two ideas which had not occurred to him before struck nigel with great force at that moment  the one was that whatever or wherever his future household should be established if winnie was to be its chief ornament her father must of necessity become a member of it  the other idea was that he was destined to possess a negro servant with a consequent and unavoidable monkey attendant  how strange the links of which the chain of human destiny is formed and how wonderful the powers of thought by which that chain is occasionally forecast  how to convey all these possessions to england and get them comfortably settled there was a problem which he did not care to tackle just then  see winnie said van der kemp pointing with interest to a mark on the side of rakata yonder is the mouth of my cave  i never saw it so clearly before because of the trees and bushes but everything seems now to have been burnt up  das so massa an what hasnt bin bunt up has bin blowd up remarked the negro  looks very like it moses unless that is a haze which enshrouds the rest of the island rejoined the other shading his eyes with his hands  it was no haze however for they found on drawing nearer that the greater part of krakatoa had as we have already said actually disappeared from the face of the earth  when the boat finally rounded the point which hid the northern part of the island from view a sight was presented which it is not often given to human eyes to look upon  the whole mountain named the peak of rakata 2623 feet high had been split from top to bottom and about onehalf of it with all that part of the island lying to the northward had been blown away leaving a wall or almost sheer precipice which presented a grand section of the volcano  pushing their boat into a creek at the base of this precipice the party landed and tried to reach a position from which a commanding view might be obtained  this was not an easy matter for there was not a spot for a foot to rest on which was not covered deeply with pumicedust and ashes  by dint of perseverance however they gained a ledge whence the surrounding district could be observed and then it was clearly seen how widespread and stupendous the effects of the explosion had been  where the greater part of the richly wooded island had formerly flourished the ocean now rippled in the sunshine and of the smaller islands around it lang island had been considerably increased in bulk as well as in height  verleden island had been enlarged to more than three times its former size and also much increased in height  the island named polish hat had disappeared altogether and two entirely new isletsafterwards named steers and calmeyer islandshad arisen to the northward  now friends said van der kemp after they had noted and commented on the vast and wonderful changes that had taken place we will pull round to our cave and see what has happened there  descending to the boat they rowed round the southern shores of rakata until they reached the little harbour where the boat and canoe had formerly been kept    chapter thirty one  ends with a struggle between inclination and duty  caves blowed away too was the first remark of moses as they rowed into the little port  a shock of disappointment was experienced by winnie for she fancied that the negro had referred to her fathers old home but he only meant the lower cave in which the canoe had formerly been kept  she was soon relieved as to this point however but when a landing was effected difficulties that seemed to her almost insurmountable presented themselves for the ground was covered kneedeep with pumicedust and the road to the upper cave was blocked by rugged masses of lava and ashes all heaped up in indescribable confusion  on careful investigation however it was found that after passing a certain point the footpath was almost unencumbered by volcanic debris this was owing to the protection afforded to it by the cone of rakata and the almost overhanging nature of some of the cliffs on that side of the mountain still the track was bad enough and in places so rugged that winnie vigorous and agile though she was found it both difficult and fatiguing to advance  seeing this her father proposed to carry her but she laughingly declined the proposal  whereupon nigel offered to lend her a hand over the rougher places but this she also declined  then moses stepping forward asserted his rights  its my business he said to carry tings when deys got to be carried  mrover as is bin obleeged to leabe spinkie in charge ob de boat i feels okard widout someting to carry an you aint much heavier dan spinkie miss winnieso come along  he stooped with the intention of grasping winnie as if she were a little child but with a light laugh the girl sprang away and left moses behind  smy opinion said moses looking after her with a grin dat if de purfesser was here hed net her in mistook for a bufferfly  darshes down he shouted springing forward but nigel was before him  winnie had tripped and fallen  are you hurt dearchild asked nigel raising her gently  oh no only a little shaken answered winnie with a little laugh that was half hysterical  i am strong enough to go on presently  nay my child you must suffer yourself to be carried at this part said van der kemp  take her up nigel you are stronger than i am now  i would not have asked you to do it before my accident  our hero did not need a second bidding  grasping winnie in his strong arms he raised her as if she had been a feather and strode away at a pace so rapid that he soon left van der kemp and moses far behind  put me down now said winnie after a little while in a low voice im quite recovered now and can walk  nay winnie you are mistaken  the path is very rough yet and the dust gets deeper as we ascend  do give me the pleasure of helping you a little longer  whatever winnie may have felt or thought she said nothing and nigel taking silence for consent bore her swiftly onward and upwardwith an excelsior spirit that would have thrown the alpine youth with the banner and the strange device considerably into the shadeuntil he placed her at the yawning black mouth of the hermits cave  but what a change was there  the trees and flowering shrubs and ferns were all gone lava pumice and ashes lay thick on everything around and only a few blackened and twisted stumps of the larger trees remained to tell that an umbrageous forest had once flourished there  the whole scene might be fittingly described in the two wordsgrey desolation  that is the entrance to your fathers old home said nigel as he set his fair burden down and pointed to the entrance  what a dreadful place said winnie peering into the black depths of the cavern  it was not dreadful when i first saw it winnie with rich verdure everywhere and inside you will find it surprisingly comfortable  but we must not enter until your father arrives to do the honours of the place himself  they had not to wait long  first moses arrived and shrewdly suspecting from the appearance of the young couple that they were engaged in conversation that would not brook interruption or perhaps judging from what might be his own wishes in similar circumstances he turned his back suddenly on them and stooping down addressed himself to an imaginary creature of the animal kingdom  what a bootiful bufferfly you is to be sure up on sitch a place too wid nuffin to eat cept krakatoa dust  i wonder what your moder would say if she knowd you was here  you should be ashamed ob yourself  hallo  moses what are you talking to over there  nuffin massa nadgel  i was ony habin a brief convsation wid a member ob de insect wurld in commemoration ob de purfesser  leastwise if it warnt a insect it must hab bin suffin else  wont you go in miss winnie  no id rather wait for father returned the girl looking a little flushed for some strange and totally unfamiliar ideas had recently floated into her brain and caused some incomprehensible flutterings of the heart to which hitherto she had been a stranger  mindful of his fathers injunctions however nigel had been particularly careful to avoid increasing these flutterings  in a few minutes the hermit came up  ah  winnie he said there has been dire devastation here  perhaps inside things may look better  come take my hand and dont be afraid the floor is level and your eyes will soon get accustomed to the dim light  is afeared massa remarked moses as they entered the cavern dat your sunlights wont be wuth much now  you are right lad  go on before us and light the lamps if they are not broken  it was found as they had expected that the only light which penetrated the cavern was that which entered by the caves mouth which of course was very feeble  presently to winnies surprise moses was seen issuing from the kitchen with a petroleum lamp in one hand the brilliant light of which not only glittered on his expressive black visage but sent a ruddy glare all over the cavern  van der kemp seemed to watch his daughter intently as she gazed in a bewildered way around  there was a puzzled look as well as mere surprise in her pretty face  father she said earnestly you have spoken more than once of living as if in a dream  perhaps you will wonder when i tell you that i experience something of that sort now  strange though this place seems i have an unaccountable feeling that it is not absolutely new to me that i have seen it before  i do not wonder dear one he replied for the drawings that surround this chamber were the handiwork of your dear mother and they decorated the walls of your own nursery when you were a little child at your mothers knee  for over ten long years they have surrounded me and kept your faces fresh in my memorythough truth to tell it needed no such reminders to do that  come let us examine them  it was pleasant to see the earnest face of winnie as she halfrecognised and strove to recall the memories of early childhood in that singular cavern  it was also a sight worth seeingthe countenance of nigel as well as that of the hermit while they watched and admired her eager puzzled play of feature and it was the most amazing sight of all to see the all but superhuman joy of moses as he held the lamp and listened to facts regarding the past of his beloved master which were quite new to himfor the hermit spoke as openly about his past domestic affairs as if he and winnie had been quite alone  he either forgets that we are present or counts us as part of his family thought nigel with a feeling of satisfaction  what a dear comoonicative man thought moses with unconcealed pleasure  come now let us ascend to the observatory said the hermit when all the things in the library had been examined  there has been damage done there i know besides there is a locket there which belonged to your mother  i left it by mistake one day when i went up to arrange the mirrors and in the hurry of leaving forgot to return for it  indeed one of my main objects in revisiting my old home was to fetch that locket away  it contains a lock of hair and one of those miniatures which men used to paint before photography drove such work off the field  winnie was nothing loth to follow for she had reached a romantic period of life and it seemed to her that to be led through mysterious caves and dark galleries in the very heart of a still active volcano by her own fatherthe hermit of rakatawas the very embodiment of romance itself  but a disappointment awaited them for they had not proceeded halfway through the dark passage when it was found that a large mass of rock had fallen from the roof and almost blocked it up  there is a space big enough for us to creep through at the righthand corner above i think said nigel taking the lantern from moses and examining the spot  jump up moses and try it said the hermit  if your bulky shoulders get through we can all manage it  the negro was about to obey the order when nigel let the lantern fall and the shock extinguished it  oh  massa nadgel das a pritty business  never mind said van der kemp  ive got matches i think in myno i havent  have you moses  no massa i forgit to remember him  no matter run backyou know the road well enough to follow it in the dark  we will wait here till you return  be smart now  moses started off at once and for some moments the sound of clattering along the passage was heard  i will try to clamber through in the dark  look after winnie nigel and dont leave the spot where you stand dear one for there are cracks and holes about that might sprain your little ankles  very well father  all right  ive got through nigel ill feel my way on for a little bit  remain where you are  winnie said nigel when they were alone doesnt it feel awesome and strange to be standing here in such intense darkness  it doesi dont quite like it  whereabouts are you said nigel  he carefully stretched out his hand to feel as he spoke and laid a finger on her brow  oh take care of my eyes exclaimed winnie with a little laugh  i wish you would turn your eyes towards me for im convinced they would give some lightto me at least  here do let me hold your hand  it will make you feel more confident  to one who is at all familiar with the human frame the way from the brow to the hand is comparatively simple  nigel soon possessed himself of the coveted article  like other things of great value the possession turned the poor youths head  he forgot his fathers warnings for the moment forgot the hermit and moses and spinkie and the thick darknessforgot almost everything in the light of that touch  winnie he exclaimed in a tone that quite alarmed her ii he hesitated  the solemn embargo of his father recurred to him  what is it  is there danger exclaimed the poor girl clasping his hand tighter and drawing nearer to him  this was too much  nigel felt himself to be contemptible  he was taking unfair advantage of her  winnie he began again in a voice of forced calmness there is no danger whatever  im an assa doltthats all  the fact is i made my father a sort of half promise that i would not ask your opinion on a certain subject untiluntil i found out exactly what you thought about it  now the thing is ridiculousimpossiblefor how can i know your opinion on any subject until i have asked you  quite true returned winnie simply so you better ask me  ha ha laughed nigel in a sort of desperate amusement iiyes i will ask you winnie  but first i must explain  hallo  nigel came at that moment from the other side of the obstruction are you thereall right  yes yesim herenot all right exactly but ill be all right some day you may depend upon that shouted the youth in a tone of indignant exasperation  what said you asked van der kemp putting his head through the hole  hi  is acomin look out dar hallooed moses in the opposite direction  just so said nigel resuming his quiet tone and demeanour well be all right when the light comes  here give us your hand van der kemp  the hermit accepted the proffered aid and leaped down amongst his friends just as moses arrived with the lantern  its of no use going further he said  the passage is completely blocked upso we must go round to where the mountain has been split off and try to clamber up  there will be daylight enough yet if we are quick  come    chapter thirty two  the last  descending to the boat they rowed round to the face of the great cliff which had been so suddenly laid bare when the peak of rakata was cleft from its summit to its foundations in the sea  it was a wonderful sighta magnificent section affording a marvellous view of the internal mechanism of a volcano  but there was no time to spend in contemplation of this extraordinary sight for evening approached and the hermits purpose had to be accomplished  high up near the top of the mighty cliff could be seen a small hole in the rock which was all that remained of the observatory  it will be impossible i fear to reach that spot said nigel there does not appear to be foothold for a goat  i will reach it said the hermit in a low voice as he scanned the precipice carefully  so will i said the negro  no moses i go alone  you will remain in the boat and watch  if i fall you can pick me up  pick you up echoed moses  if you tumbles a tousand feet into de water how much tink you will be lef to pick up  it was useless to attempt to dissuade van der kemp  being well aware of this they all held their peace while he landed on a spur of the riven cliff  the first part of the ascent was easy enough the ground having been irregularly broken so that the climber disappeared behind masses of rock at times while he kept as much as possible to the western edge of the mountain where the cleavage had occurred but as he ascended he was forced to come out upon narrow ledges that had been left here and there on the face of the cliff where he seemed to those who were watching far below like a mere black spot on the face of a gigantic wall  still upward he went slowly but steadily till he reached a spot nearly level with the observatory  here he had to go out on the sheer precipice where his footholds were invisible from below  winnie sat in the boat with blanched face and tightly clasped hands panting with anxiety as she gazed upwards  it looks much more dangerous from here than it is in reality said nigel to her in a reassuring tone  das true massa nadgel das bery true interposed moses endeavouring to comfort himself as well as the others by the intense earnestness of his manner  de only danger miss winnie lies in your fadder losin his head at sitch a triffic height an dars no fear at all ob dat for massa neber loses his headpooh you might as well talk ob him losin his heart  look look he git close to de hole nowhe put his footyesnext stepdar heve done it  with the perspiration of anxiety streaming down his face the negro relieved his feelings by a wild prolonged cheer  nigel obtained the same relief by means of a deep longdrawn sigh but winnie did not move she seemed to realise her fathers danger better than her companions and remembered that the descent would be much more difficult than the ascent  they were not kept long in suspense  in a few minutes the hermit reappeared and began to retrace his stepsslowly but steadily and the watchers breathed more freely  moses was right there was in reality little danger in the climb for the ledges which appeared to them like mere threads and the footholds that were almost invisible were in reality from a foot to three feet wide  the only danger lay in the hermits head being unable to stand the trial but as moses had remarked there was no fear of that  the watchers were therefore beginning to feel somewhat relieved from the tension of their anxiety when a huge mass of rock was seen to slip from the face of the cliff and descend with the thunderous roar of an avalanche  the incident gave those in the boat a shock for the landslip occurred not far from the spot which van der kemp had reached but as he still stood there in apparent safety there seemed no cause for alarm till it was observed that the climber remained quite still for a long time and seemed to have no intention of moving  god help him cried nigel in sudden alarm the ledge has been carried away and he cannot advance  stay by the boat moses i will run to help him  no massa nadgel returned the negro i go to die wid im  boat kin look arter itself  he sprang on shore as he spoke and dashed up the mountainside like a hunted hare  our hero looked at winnie for an instant in hesitation  go said the poor girl  you know i can manage a boatquick  another moment and nigel was following in the track of the negro  they gained the broken ledge together and then found that the space between the point which they had reached and the spot on which the hermit stood was a smooth face of perpendicular rockan absolutely impassable gulf  van der kemp was standing with his back flat against the precipice and his feet resting on a little piece of projecting rock not more than three inches wide  this was all that lay between him and the hideous depth below for nigel found on carefully drawing nearer that the avalanche had been more extensive than was apparent from below and that the ledge beyond the hermit had been also carried awaythus cutting off his retreat as well as his advance  i can make no effort to help myself said van der kemp in a low but calm voice when our heros foot rested on the last projecting point that he could gain and found that with the utmost reach of his arm he could not get within six inches of his friends outstretched hand besides nigel himself stood on so narrow a ledge and against so steep a cliff that he could not have acted with his wonted power even if the hand could have been grasped  moses stood immediately behind nigel where the ledge was broader and where a shallow recess in the rock enabled him to stand with comparative ease  the poor fellow seemed to realise the situation more fully than his companion for despair was written on every feature of his expressive face  what is to be done said nigel looking back  de boatrope suggested the negro  useless said van der kemp in a voice as calm and steady as if he were in perfect safety though the unusual pallor of his grave countenance showed that he was fully alive to the terrible situation i am resting on little more than my heels and the strain is almost too much for me even now  i could not hold on till you went to the boat and returned  no it seems to be gods willand added he humbly his will be done  o god send us help cried nigel in an agony of feeling that he could not master  if i had better foothold i might spring towards you and catch hold of you said the hermit but i cannot spring off my heels  besides i doubt if you could bear my weight  try try cried nigel eagerly extending his hand  dont fear for my strengthive got plenty of it thank god and see i have my right arm wedged into a crevice so firmly that nothing could haul it out  but van der kemp shook his head  i cannot even make the attempt he said  the slightest move would plunge me down  dear boy  i know that you and your father and moses will care for my winnie and  massa gasped moses who while the hermit was speaking had been working his body with mysterious and violent energy massa couldnt you fall dis way an nadgel could kitch your hand an is got my leg shoved into a hole as nuffin ll haul it out ob  deres a holler place here  if nadgel swings you into dat an i only once grab you by de hairyoure safe  it might be donetried at least said the hermit looking anxiously at his young friend  try it cried nigel i wont fail you  it is not possible for any except those who have gone through a somewhat similar ordeal to understand fully the test of cool courage which van der kemp had to undergo on that occasion  shutting his eyes for a moment in silent prayer he deliberately worked with his shoulders upon the cliff against which he leaned until he felt himself to be on the point of falling towards his friend and the two outstretched hands almost touched  now are you ready he asked  ready replied nigel while moses wound both his powerful arms round his comrades waist and held on  another moment and the hands clasped nigel uttered an irrepressible shout as the hermit swung off and coming round with great violence to the spot where the negro had fixed himself just succeeded in catching the edge of the cliff with his free hand  let go nigel he shoutedsafe  the poor youth was only too glad to obey for the tremendous pull had wrenched his arm out of the crevice in which he had fixed it and for a moment he swayed helplessly over the awful abyss  dont let me go moses he yelled as he made a frantic but futile effort to regain his holdfor he felt that the negro had loosened one of his arms though the other was still round him like a hoop of iron  no fear nadgel said moses is got you tightonly don wriggle now massa up you come  moses had grasped his masters hair with a grip that wellnigh scalped him and he held on until the hermit had got a secure hold of the ledge with both hands  then he let the hair go for he knew that to an athlete like his master the raising himself by his arms on to the ledge would be the work of a few seconds  van der kemp was thus able to assist in rescuing nigel from his position of danger  but the expressions of heartfelt thankfulness for this deliverance which naturally broke from them were abruptly checked when it was found that moses could by no means extract his leg out of the hole into which he had thrust it and that he was suffering great pain  after some time and a good deal of violent wrenching during which our sable hero mingled a few groans in strange fashion with his congratulations he was got free and then it was found that the strain had been too much for even his powerful bones and sinews for the leg was broken  my poor fellow murmured van der kemp as he went down on his knees to examine the limb  don care a buttin for dat massa  youre safe an nadgels safean it only cost a broken leg  pooh das nuffin said moses unable to repress a few tears in the excess of his joy and pain  with considerable difficulty they carried the poor negro down to the boat where they found winnie as might be supposed in a halffainting condition from the strain of prolonged anxiety and terror to which she had been subjected but the necessity of attending to the case of the injured moses was an antidote which speedily restored her  do you think good reader that nigel and winnie had much difficulty in coming to an understanding after that or that the hermit was disposed to throw any obstacles in the way of true love  if you do let us assure you that you are mistaken  surely this is information enough for any intelligent reader  still it may be interesting to add difficulties did not all at once disappear  the perplexities that had already assailed nigel more than once assailed him againperplexities about a negro manservant and a household monkey and a hermit fatherinlaw and a small incometo say nothing of a disconsolate motherpoetess in england and a father roving on the high seas  how to overcome these difficulties gave him much thought and trouble but they were overcome at last  that which seemed impossible to man proved to be childsplay in the hands of woman winnie solved the difficulty by suggesting that they should all return to the cocoskeeling islands and dwell together there for evermore    let us drop in on them good reader at a later period have a look at them and bid them all goodbye  on a green knoll by the margin of the lagoon stands a beautiful cottage with a garden around it and a pleasureboat resting on the white coral sand in front  from the windows of that cottage there is a most magnificent view of the lagoon with its numerous islets and its picturesque palmtrees  within that cottage dwell nigel and winnie and a browneyed brownhaired fairskinned baby girl who is the most extraordinary angel that ever was born  it has a nurse of its own but is chiefly waited on and attended to by an antique poetess who dwells in another cottage a stonescast off on the same green knoll  there she inspires an ancient mariner with poetical sentimentsnot your upintheclouds reefpointpattering nonsense observe but the real genuine article superior to that other fellows you knowwhen not actively engaged with the baby  the first cottage is named rakata in honour of our hermit who is one of its inhabitants  the second is named krakatoa by its eccentric owner captain roy  it must not be imagined however that our friends have settled down there to spend their lives in idleness  by no means  this probably would not be permitted by the king of the cocos islands even if they wished to do so  but they do not wish that  there is no such condition as idleness in the lives of good men and women  nigel has taken to general superintendence of the flourishing community in the midst of which he has cast his lot  he may be almost regarded as the prime minister of the islands in addition to which he has started an extensive boatbuilding business and a considerable trade in cocoanuts etcetera with the numerous islands of the java sea also a sawmill and a forge and a sundayschoolin which last the pretty humbleminded winnie lends most efficient aid  indeed it is said that she is the chief manager as well as the life and soul of that business though nigel gets all the credit  captain roy sometimes sails his sons vessels and sometimes looks after the secular education of the sundayschool childrenthe said education being conducted on the principle of unlimited storytelling with illimitable play of fancy  but his occupations are irregular undertaken by fits and starts and never to be counted on  his evenings he usually devotes to poetry and pipesfor the captain is obstinate and stickslike most of usto his failings as well as his fancies  there is a certain eccentric individual with an enthusiastic temperament and blue binoculars who pays frequent and prolonged visits to the keeling islands  it need scarcely be said that his name is verkimier there is no accounting for the tastes of human beings  notwithstanding all his escapes and experiences that indomitable man of science still ranges like a mad philosopher far and wide over the archipelago in pursuit of bootterflies ant ozer specimens of zee insect vorld  it is observed however even by the most obtuse among his friends that whereas in former times the professors flights were centrifugal they have now become centripetalthe keeling islands being the great centre towards which he flies  verkimier is and probably will always be a subject of wonder and of profound speculation to the youthful inhabitants of the islands  they dont understand him and he does not understand them  if they were insects he would take deep and intelligent interest in them  as they are merely human beings he regards them with that peculiar kind of interest with which men regard the unknown and unknowable  he is by no means indifferent to them  he is too kindly for that  he studies them deeply though hopelessly and when he enters the sundayschool with his binocularswhich he often does to listena degree of awe settles down on the little ones which it is impossible to evoke by the most solemn appeals to their spiritual natures  nigel and winnie have a gardener and that gardener is blackas black as the ace of spades or the king of ashantee  he dwells in a corner of the rakata cottage but is addicted to spending much of his spare time in the krakatoa one  he is as strong and powerful as ever but limps slightly on his right leghis game leg as he styles it  he is of course an immense favourite with the young peoplenot less than with the old  he has been known to say with a solemnity that might tickle the humorous and horrify the timid that he wouldnt hab dat game leg made straight agin no not for a hundred tousand pounds  cause whyit was an eberpresent visible reminder dat once upon a time he had de libes ob massa and nadgel in his arms ahangin on to his game leg an dat trough gracious goodness he sabe dem bof  ha  you may smile at moses if you will but he can return the smile with kindly interest for he is actuated by that grand principle which will sooner or later transform even the scoffers of earth and which is embodied in the wordslove is the fulfilling of the law  even the lower animals testify to this fact when the dog licks the hand that smites it and accords instant forgiveness on the slightest encouragement  does not spinkie prove it also when issuing at call from its own pagoda in the sunniest corner of the rakata garden it forsakes cocoanuts sugarcane fruits and other delights to lay its little head in joyful consecration on the black bosom of its benignant friend  and what of moses opinion of the new home  it may be shortly expressed in his own words  its heaben upon eart an de most happiest time as eber occurred to me was dat time when sunda straits went into cumbustin an krakatoa was blown to bits  the end
