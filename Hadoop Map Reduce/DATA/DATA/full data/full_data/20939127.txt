williwaw lay in the passage between the shorereef and the outerreef from the latter came the low murmur of a lazy surf but the sheltered stretch of water not more than a hundred yards across to the white beach of pounded coral sand was of glasslike smoothness narrow as was the passage and anchored as she was in the shoalest place that gave room to swing the williwaws chain rode upanddown a clean hundred feet its course could be traced over the bottom of living coral like some monstrous snake the rusty chains slack wandered over the ocean floor crossing and recrossing itself several times and fetching up finally at the idle anchor big rockcod dun and mottled played warily in and out of the coral other fish grotesque of form and colour were brazenly indifferent even when a big fishshark drifted sluggishly along and sent the rockcod scuttling for their favourite crevices  on deck forard a dozen blacks pottered clumsily at scraping the teak rail they were as inexpert at their work as so many monkeys in fact they looked very much like monkeys of some enlarged and prehistoric type their eyes had in them the querulous plaintiveness of the monkey their faces were even less symmetrical than the monkeys and hairless of body they were far more ungarmented than any monkey for clothes they had none decorated they were as no monkey ever was in holes in their ears they carried short clay pipes rings of turtle shell huge plugs of wood rusty wire nails and empty rifle cartridges the calibre of a winchester rifle was the smallest hole an ear bore some of the largest holes were inches in diameter and any single ear averaged from three to half a dozen holes spikes and bodkins of polished bone or petrified shell were thrust through their noses on the chest of one hung a white doorknob on the chest of another the handle of a china cup on the chest of a third the brass cogwheel of an alarm clock they chattered in queer falsetto voices and combined did no more work than a single white sailor  aft under an awning were two white men each was clad in a sixpenny undershirt and wrapped about the loins with a strip of cloth belted about the middle of each was a revolver and tobacco pouch the sweat stood out on their skin in myriads of globules here and there the globules coalesced in tiny streams that dripped to the heated deck and almost immediately evaporated the lean darkeyed man wiped his fingers wet with a stinging stream from his forehead and flung it from him with a weary curse wearily and without hope he gazed seaward across the outerreef and at the tops of the palms along the beach  eight oclock an hell dont get hot till noon he complained wisht to god for a breeze aint we never goin to get away  the other man a slender german of five and twenty with the massive forehead of a scholar and the tumblehome chin of a degenerate did not trouble to reply he was busy emptying powdered quinine into a cigarette paper rolling what was approximately fifty grains of the drug into a tight wad he tossed it into his mouth and gulped it down without the aid of water  wisht i had some whiskey the first man panted after a fifteenminute interval of silence  another equal period elapsed ere the german enounced relevant of nothing  im rotten with fever im going to quit you griffiths when we get to sydney no more tropics for me i ought to known better when i signed on with you  you aint been much of a mate griffiths replied too hot himself to speak heatedly when the beach at guvutu heard id shipped you they all laughed what jacobsen they said you cant hide a square face of trade gin or sulphuric acid that he wont smell out youve certainly lived up to your reputation i aint had a drink for a fortnight what of your snoopin my supply  if the fever was as rotten in you as me youd understand the mate whimpered  i aint kickin griffiths answered i only wisht godd send me a drink or a breeze of wind or something im ripe for my next chill tomorrow  the mate proffered him the quinine rolling a fiftygrain dose he popped the wad into his mouth and swallowed it dry  god god he moaned i dream of a land somewheres where they aint no quinine damned stuff of hell ive scoffed tons of it in my time  again he quested seaward for signs of wind the usual tradewind clouds were absent and the sun still low in its climb to meridian turned all the sky to heated brass one seemed to see as well as feel this heat and griffiths sought vain relief by gazing shoreward the white beach was a searing ache to his eyeballs the palm trees absolutely still outlined flatly against the unrefreshing green of the packed jungle seemed so much cardboard scenery the little black boys playing naked in the dazzle of sand and sun were an affront and a hurt to the sunsick man he felt a sort of relief when one running tripped and fell on allfours in the tepid seawater  an exclamation from the blacks forard sent both men glancing seaward around the near point of land a quarter of a mile away and skirting the reef a long black canoe paddled into sight  gooma boys from the next bight was the mates verdict  one of the blacks came aft treading the hot deck with the unconcern of one whose bare feet felt no heat this too was a hurt to griffiths and he closed his eyes but the next moment they were open wide  white fella marster stop along gooma boy the black said  both men were on their feet and gazing at the canoe aft could be seen the unmistakable sombrero of a white man quick alarm showed itself on the face of the mate  its grief he said  griffiths satisfied himself by a long look then ripped out a wrathful oath  whats he doing up here he demanded of the mate of the aching sea and sky of the merciless blaze of sun and of the whole superheated and implacable universe with which his fate was entangled  the mate began to chuckle  i told you you couldnt get away with it he said  but griffiths was not listening  with all his money coming around like a rent collector he chanted his outrage almost in an ecstasy of anger hes loaded with money hes stuffed with money hes busting with money i know for a fact he sold his yringa plantations for three hundred thousand pounds bell told me so himself last time we were drunk at guvutu worth millions and millions and shylocking me for what he wouldnt light his pipe with he whirled on the mate of course you told me so go on and say it and keep on saying it now just what was it you did tell me so  i told you you didnt know him if you thought you could clear the solomons without paying him that man grief is a devil but hes straight i know i told you hed throw a thousand quid away for the fun of it and for sixpence fight like a shark for a rusty tin i tell you i know didnt he give his balakula to the queensland mission when they lost their evening star on san cristobaland the balakula worth three thousand pounds if she was worth a penny and didnt he beat up strothers till he lay abed a fortnight all because of a difference of two pound ten in the account and because strothers got fresh and tried to make the gouge go through  god strike me blind griffiths cried in impotency of rage  the mate went on with his exposition  i tell you only a straight man can buck a straight man like him and the mans never hit the solomons that could do it men like you and me cant buck him were too rotten too rotten all the way through youve got plenty more than twelve hundred quid below pay him and get it over with  but griffiths gritted his teeth and drew his thin lips tightly across them  ill buck him he mutteredmore to himself and the brazen ball of sun than to the mate he turned and half started to go below then turned back again look here jacobsen he wont be here for quarter of an hour are you with me will you stand by me  of course ill stand by you ive drunk all your whiskey havent i what are you going to do  im not going to kill him if i can help it but im not going to pay take that flat  jacobsen shrugged his shoulders in calm acquiescence to fate and griffiths stepped to the companionway and went below     ii  jacobsen watched the canoe across the low reef as it came abreast and passed on to the entrance of the passage griffiths with inkmarks on right thumb and forefinger returned on deck fifteen minutes later the canoe came alongside the man with the sombrero stood up  hello griffiths he said hello jacobsen with his hand on the rail he turned to his dusky crew you fella boy stop along canoe altogether  as he swung over the rail and stepped on deck a hint of catlike litheness showed in the apparently heavy body like the other two he was scantily clad the cheap undershirt and white loincloth did not serve to hide the well put up body heavy muscled he was but he was not lumped and hummocked by muscles they were softly rounded and when they did move slid softly and silkily under the smooth tanned skin ardent suns had likewise tanned his face till it was swarthy as a spaniards the yellow mustache appeared incongruous in the midst of such swarthiness while the clear blue of the eyes produced a feeling of shock on the beholder it was difficult to realize that the skin of this man had once been fair  where did you blow in from griffiths asked as they shook hands i thought you were over in the santa cruz  i was the newcomer answered but we made a quick passage the wonders just around in the bight at gooma waiting for wind some of the bushmen reported a ketch here and i just dropped around to see well how goes it  nothing much copra sheds mostly empty and not half a dozen tons of ivory nuts the women all got rotten with fever and quit and the men cant chase them back into the swamps theyre a sick crowd id ask you to have a drink but the mate finished off my last bottle i wisht to god for a breeze of wind  grief glancing with keen carelessness from one to the other laughed  im glad the calm held he said it enabled me to get around to see you my supercargo dug up that little note of yours and i brought it along  the mate edged politely away leaving his skipper to face his trouble  im sorry grief damned sorry griffiths said but i aint got it youll have to give me a little more time  grief leaned up against the companionway surprise and pain depicted on his face  it does beat hell he communed how men learn to lie in the solomons the truths not in them now take captain jensen id sworn by his truthfulness why he told me only five days agodo you want to know what he told me  griffiths licked his lips  go on  why he told me that youd sold outsold out everything cleaned up and was pulling out for the new hebrides  hes a damned liar griffiths cried hotly  grief nodded  i should say so he even had the nerve to tell me that hed bought two of your stations from youmauri and kahula said he paid you seventeen hundred gold sovereigns lock stock and barrel good will tradegoods credit and copra  griffithss eyes narrowed and glinted the action was involuntary and grief noted it with a lazy sweep of his eyes  and parsons your trader at hickimavi told me that the fulcrum company had bought that station from you now what did he want to lie for  griffiths overwrought by sun and sickness exploded all his bitterness of spirit rose up in his face and twisted his mouth into a snarl  look here grief whats the good of playing with me that way you know and i know you know let it go at that i have sold out and i am getting away and what are you going to do about it  grief shrugged his shoulders and no hint of resolve shadowed itself in his own face his expression was as of one in a quandary  theres no law here griffiths pressed home his advantage tulagi is a hundred and fifty miles away ive got my clearance papers and im on my own boat theres nothing to stop me from sailing youve got no right to stop me just because i owe you a little money and by god you cant stop me put that in your pipe  the look of pained surprise on griefs face deepened  you mean youre going to cheat me out of that twelve hundred griffiths  thats just about the size of it old man and calling hard names wont help any theres the wind coming youd better get overside before i pull out or ill tow your canoe under  really griffiths you sound almost right i cant stop you grief fumbled in the pouch that hung on his revolverbelt and pulled out a crumpled officiallooking paper but maybe this will stop you and its something for your pipe smoke up  what is it  an admiralty warrant running to the new hebrides wont save you it can be served anywhere  griffiths hesitated and swallowed when he had finished glancing at the document with knit brows he pondered this new phase of the situation then abruptly as he looked up his face relaxed into all frankness  you were cleverer than i thought old man he said youve got me hip and thigh i ought to have known better than to try and beat you jacobsen told me i couldnt and i wouldnt listen to him but he was right and so are you ive got the money below come on down and well settle  he started to go down then stepped aside to let his visitor precede him at the same time glancing seaward to where the dark flaw of wind was quickening the water  heave short he told the mate get up sail and stand ready to break out  as grief sat down on the edge of the mates bunk close against and facing the tiny table he noticed the butt of a revolver just projecting from under the pillow on the table which hung on hinges from the forard bulkhead were pen and ink also a battered logbook  oh i dont mind being caught in a dirty trick griffiths was saying defiantly ive been in the tropics too long im a sick man a damn sick man and the whiskey and the sun and the fever have made me sick in morals too nothings too mean and low for me now and i can understand why the niggers eat each other and take heads and such things i could do it myself so i call trying to do you out of that small account a pretty mild trick wisht i could offer you a drink  grief made no reply and the other busied himself in attempting to unlock a large and muchdented cashbox from on deck came falsetto cries and the creak and rattle of blocks as the black crew swung up mainsail and driver grief watched a large cockroach crawling over the greasy paintwork griffiths with an oath of irritation carried the cashbox to the companionsteps for better light here on his feet and bending over the box his back to his visitor his hands shot out to the rifle that stood beside the steps and at the same moment he whirled about  now dont you move a muscle he commanded  grief smiled elevated his eyebrows quizzically and obeyed his left hand rested on the bunk beside him his right hand lay on the table  his revolver hung on his right hip in plain sight but in his mind was recollection of the other revolver under the pillow  huh griffiths sneered youve got everybody in the solomons hypnotized but let me tell you you aint got me now im going to throw you off my vessel along with your admiralty warrant but first youve got to do something lift up that logbook  the other glanced curiously at the logbook but did not move  i tell you im a sick man grief and id as soon shoot you as smash a cockroach lift up that logbook i say  sick he did look his lean face working nervously with the rage that possessed him grief lifted the book and set it aside beneath lay a written sheet of tablet paper  read it griffiths commanded read it aloud  grief obeyed but while he read the fingers of his left hand began an infinitely slow and patient crawl toward the butt of the weapon under the pillow  on board the ketch williwaw bombi bight island of anna solomon islands he read know all men by these presents that i do hereby sign off and release in full for due value received all debts whatsoever owing to me by harrison j griffiths who has this day paid to me twelve hundred pounds sterling  with that receipt in my hands griffiths grinned your admiralty warrants not worth the paper its written on sign it  it wont do any good griffiths grief said a document signed under compulsion wont hold before the law  in that case what objection have you to signing it then  oh none at all only that i might save you heaps of trouble by not signing it  griefs fingers had gained the revolver and while he talked with his right hand he played with the pen and with his left began slowly and imperceptibly drawing the weapon to his side as his hand finally closed upon it second finger on trigger and forefinger laid past the cylinder and along the barrel he wondered what luck he would have at lefthanded snapshooting  dont consider me griffiths gibed and just remember jacobsen will testify that he saw me pay the money over now sign sign in full at the bottom david grief and date it  from on deck came the jar of sheetblocks and the rattattat of the reefpoints against the canvas in the cabin they could feel the williwaw heel swing into the wind and right david grief still hesitated from forard came the jerking rattle of headsail halyards through the sheaves the little vessel heeled and through the cabin walls came the gurgle and wash of water  get a move on griffiths cried the anchors out  the muzzle of the rifle four feet away was bearing directly on him when grief resolved to act the rifle wavered as griffiths kept his balance in the uncertain puffs of the first of the wind grief took advantage of the wavering made as if to sign the paper and at the same instant like a cat exploded into swift and intricate action as he ducked low and leaped forward with his body his left hand flashed from under the screen of the table and so accuratelytimed was the single stiff pull on the selfcocking trigger that the cartridge discharged as the muzzle came forward not a whit behind was griffiths the muzzle of his weapon dropped to meet the ducking body and shot at snap direction rifle and revolver went off simultaneously  grief felt the sting and sear of a bullet across the skin of his shoulder and knew that his own shot had missed his forward rush carried him to griffiths before another shot could be fired both of whose arms still holding the rifle he locked with a low tackle about the body he shoved the revolver muzzle still in his left hand deep into the others abdomen under the press of his anger and the sting of his abraded skin griefs finger was lifting the hammer when the wave of anger passed and he recollected himself down the companionway came indignant cries from the gooma boys in his canoe  everything was happening in seconds there was apparently no pause in his actions as he gathered griffiths in his arms and carried him up the steep steps in a sweeping rush out into the blinding glare of sunshine he came a black stood grinning at the wheel and the williwaw heeled over from the wind was foaming along rapidly dropping astern was his gooma canoe grief turned his head from amidships revolver in hand the mate was springing toward him with two jumps still holding the helpless griffiths grief leaped to the rail and overboard  both men were grappled together as they went down but grief with a quick updraw of his knees to the others chest broke the grip and forced him down with both feet on griffithss shoulder he forced him still deeper at the same time driving himself to the surface scarcely had his head broken into the sunshine when two splashes of water in quick succession and within a foot of his face advertised that jacobsen knew how to handle a revolver there was a chance for no third shot for grief filling his lungs with air sank down under water he struck out nor did he come up till he saw the canoe and the bubbling paddles overhead as he climbed aboard the wlliwaw went into the wind to come about  washeewashee grief cried to his boys you fella makeum beach quick fella time  in all shamelessness he turned his back on the battle and ran for cover the williwaw compelled to deaden way in order to pick up its captain gave grief his chance for a lead the canoe struck the beach fulltilt with every paddle driving and they leaped out and ran across the sand for the trees but before they gained the shelter three times the sand kicked into puffs ahead of them then they dove into the green safety of the jungle  grief watched the williwaw haul up close go out the passage then slack its sheets as it headed south with the wind abeam as it went out of sight past the point he could see the topsail being broken out one of the gooma boys a black nearly fifty years of age hideously marred and scarred by skin diseases and old wounds looked up into his face and grinned  my word the boy commented that fella skipper too much cross along you  grief laughed and led the way back across the sand to the canoe     iii  how many millions david grief was worth no man in the solomons knew for his holdings and ventures were everywhere in the great south pacific from samoa to new guinea and even to the north of the line his plantations were scattered he possessed pearling concessions in the paumotus though his name did not appear he was in truth the german company that traded in the french marquesas his trading stations were in strings in all the groups and his vessels that operated them were many he owned atolls so remote and tiny that his smallest schooners and ketches visited the solitary agents but once a year  in sydney on castlereagh street his offices occupied three floors but he was rarely in those offices he preferred always to be on the go amongst the islands nosing out new investments inspecting and shaking up old ones and rubbing shoulders with fun and adventure in a thousand strange guises he bought the wreck of the great steamship gavonne for a song and in salving it achieved the impossible and cleaned up a quarter of a million in the louisiades he planted the first commercial rubber and in borabora he ripped out the south sea cotton and put the jolly islanders at the work of planting cacao it was he who took the deserted island of lalluka colonized it with polynesians from the ontongjava atoll and planted four thousand acres to cocoanuts and it was he who reconciled the warring chiefstocks of tahiti and swung the great deal of the phosphate island of hikihu  his own vessels recruited his contract labour they brought santa cruz boys to the new hebrides new hebrides boys to the banks and the headhunting cannibals of malaita to the plantations of new georgia from tonga to the gilberts and on to the far louisiades his recruiters combed the islands for labour his keels plowed all ocean stretches he owned three steamers on regular island runs though he rarely elected to travel in them preferring the wilder and more primitive way of wind and sail  at least forty years of age he looked no more than thirty yet beachcombers remembered his advent among the islands a score of years before at which time the yellow mustache was already budding silkily on his lip unlike other white men in the tropics he was there because he liked it his protective skin pigmentation was excellent he had been born to the sun one he was in ten thousand in the matter of sunresistance the invisible and highvelocity light waves failed to bore into him other white men were pervious the sun drove through their skins ripping and smashing tissues and nerves till they became sick in mind and body tossed most of the decalogue overboard descended to beastliness drank themselves into quick graves or survived so savagely that war vessels were sometimes sent to curb their license  but david grief was a true son of the sun and he flourished in all its ways he merely became browner with the passing of the years though in the brown was the hint of golden tint that glows in the skin of the polynesian yet his blue eyes retained their blue his mustache its yellow and the lines of his face were those which had persisted through the centuries in his english race english he was in blood yet those that thought they knew contended he was at least american born unlike them he had not come out to the south seas seeking hearth and saddle of his own in fact he had brought hearth and saddle with him his advent had been in the paumotus he arrived on board a tiny schooner yacht master and owner a youth questing romance and adventure along the sunwashed path of the tropics he also arrived in a hurricane the giant waves of which deposited him and yacht and all in the thick of a cocoanut grove three hundred yards beyond the surf six months later he was rescued by a pearling cutter but the sun had got into his blood at tahiti instead of taking a steamer home he bought a schooner outfitted her with tradegoods and divers and went for a cruise through the dangerous archipelago  as the golden tint burned into his face it poured molten out of the ends of his fingers his was the golden touch but he played the game not for the gold but for the games sake it was a mans game the rough contacts and fierce give and take of the adventurers of his own blood and of half the bloods of europe and the rest of the world and it was a good game but over and beyond was his love of all the other things that go to make up a south seas rovers lifethe smell of the reef the infinite exquisiteness of the shoals of living coral in the mirrorsurfaced lagoons the crashing sunrises of raw colours spread with lawless cunning the palmtufted islets set in turquoise deeps the tonic wine of the tradewinds the heave and send of the orderly crested seas the moving deck beneath his feet the straining canvas overhead the flowergarlanded goldenglowing men and maids of polynesia halfchildren and halfgods and even the howling savages of melanesia headhunters and maneaters halfdevil and all beast  and so favoured child of the sun out of munificence of energy and sheer joy of living he the man of many millions forbore on his far way to play the game with harrison j griffiths for a paltry sum it was his whim his desire his expression of self and of the sunwarmth that poured through him it was fun a joke a problem a bit of play on which life was lightly hazarded for the joy of the playing     iv  the early morning found the wonder laying closehauled along the coast of guadalcanal she moved lazily through the water under the dying breath of the land breeze to the east heavy masses of clouds promised a renewal of the southeast trades accompanied by sharp puffs and rain squalls ahead laying along the coast on the same course as the wonder and being slowly overtaken was a small ketch it was not the williwaw however and captain ward on the wonder putting down his glasses named it the kauri  grief just on deck from below sighed regretfully  if it had only been the williwaw he said  you do hate to be beaten denby the supercargo remarked sympathetically  i certainly do grief paused and laughed with genuine mirth its my firm conviction that griffiths is a rogue and that he treated me quite scurvily yesterday sign he says sign in full at the bottom and date it and jacobsen the little rat stood in with him it was rank piracy the days of bully hayes all over again  if you werent my employer mr grief id like to give you a piece of my mind captain ward broke in  go on and spit it out grief encouraged  well then the captain hesitated and cleared his throat with all the money youve got only a fool would take the risk you did with those two curs what do you do it for  honestly i dont know captain i just want to i suppose and can you give any better reason for anything you do  youll get your bally head shot off some fine day captain ward growled in answer as he stepped to the binnacle and took the bearing of a peak which had just thrust its head through the clouds that covered guadalcanar  the land breeze strengthened in a last effort and the wonder slipping swiftly through the water ranged alongside the kauri and began to go by greetings flew back and forth then david grief called out  seen anything of the williwaw  the captain slouchhatted and barelegged with a rolling twist hitched the faded blue lavalava tighter around his waist and spat tobacco juice overside  sure he answered griffiths lay at savo last night taking on pigs and yams and filling his watertanks looked like he was going for a long cruise but he said no why did you want to see him  yes but if you see him first dont tell him youve seen me  the captain nodded and considered and walked forard on his own deck to keep abreast of the faster vessel  say he called jacobsen told me they were coming down this afternoon to gabera said they were going to lay there tonight and take on sweet potatoes  gabera has the only leading lights in the solomons grief said when his schooner had drawn well ahead is that right captain ward  the captain nodded  and the little bight just around the point on this side its a rotten anchorage isnt it  no anchorage all coral patches and shoals and a bad surf thats where the molly went to pieces three years ago  grief stared straight before him with lustreless eyes for a full minute as if summoning some vision to his inner sight then the corners of his eyes wrinkled and the ends of his yellow mustache lifted in a smile  well anchor at gabera he said and run in close to the little bight this side i want you to drop me in a whaleboat as you go by also give me six boys and serve out rifles ill be back on board before morning  the captains face took on an expression of suspicion which swiftly slid into one of reproach  oh just a little fun skipper grief protested with the apologetic air of a schoolboy caught in mischief by an elder  captain ward grunted but denby was all alertness  id like to go along mr grief he said  grief nodded consent  bring some axes and bushknives he said and oh by the way a couple of bright lanterns see theyve got oil in them     v  an hour before sunset the wonder tore by the little bight the wind had freshened and a lively sea was beginning to make the shoals toward the beach were already white with the churn of water while those farther out as yet showed no more sign than of discoloured water as the schooner went into the wind and backed her jib and staysail the whaleboat was swung out into it leaped six breechclouted santa cruz boys each armed with a rifle denby carrying the lanterns dropped into the sternsheets grief following paused on the rail  pray for a dark night skipper he pleaded  youll get it captain ward answered theres no moon anyway and there wont be any sky shell be a bit squally too  the forecast sent a radiance into griefs face making more pronounced the golden tint of his sunburn he leaped down beside the supercargo  cast off captain ward ordered draw the headsails put your wheel over there steady take that course  the wonder filled away and ran on around the point for gabera while the whaleboat pulling six oars and steered by grief headed for the beach with superb boatmanship he threaded the narrow tortuous channel which no craft larger than a whaleboat could negotiate until the shoals and patches showed seaward and they grounded on the quiet rippling beach  the next hour was filled with work moving about among the wild cocoanuts and jungle brush grief selected the trees  chop this fella tree chop that fella tree he told his blacks no chop that other fella he said with a shake of head  in the end a wedgeshaped segment of jungle was cleared near to the beach remained one long palm at the apex of the wedge stood another darkness was falling as the lanterns were lighted carried up the two trees and made fast  that outer lantern is too high david grief studied it critically put it down about ten feet denby     vi  the williwaw was tearing through the water with a bone in her teeth for the breath of the passing squall was still strong the blacks were swinging up the big mainsail which had been lowered on the run when the puff was at its height jacobsen superintending the operation ordered them to throw the halyards down on deck and stand by then went forard on the leebow and joined griffiths both men stared with widestrained eyes at the blank wall of darkness through which they were flying their ears tense for the sound of surf on the invisible shore it was by this sound that they were for the moment steering  the wind fell lighter the scud of clouds thinned and broke and in the dim glimmer of starlight loomed the jungleclad coast ahead and well on the leebow appeared a jagged rockpoint both men strained to it  amboy point griffiths announced plenty of water close up take the wheel jacobsen till we set a course get a move on  running aft barefooted and barelegged the rainwater dripping from his scant clothing the mate displaced the black at the wheel  hows she heading griffiths called  southahalfwest  let her come up southbywest got it  right on it  griffiths considered the changed relation of amboy point to the williwaws course  and ahalfwest he cried  and ahalfwest came the answer right on it  steady thatll do  steady she is jacobsen turned the wheel over to the savage you steer good fella savve he warned no good fella i knock your damn black head off  again he went forard and joined the other and again the cloudscud thickened the starglimmer vanished and the wind rose and screamed in another squall  watch that mainsail griffiths yelled in the mates ear at the same time studying the ketchs behaviour  over she pressed and leerail under while he measured the weight of the wind and quested its easement the tepid seawater with here and there tiny globules of phosphorescence washed about his ankles and knees the wind screamed a higher note and every shroud and stay sharply chorused an answer as the williwaw pressed farther over and down  down mainsail griffiths yelled springing to the peakhalyards thrusting away the black who held on and casting off the turn  jacobsen at the throathalyards was performing the like office the big sail rattled down and the blacks with shouts and yells threw themselves on the battling canvas the mate finding one skulking in the darkness flung his bunched knuckles into the creatures face and drove him to his work  the squall held at its high pitch and under her small canvas the williwaw still foamed along again the two men stood forard and vainly watched in the horizontal drive of rain  were all right griffiths said this rain wont last we can hold this course till we pick up the lights anchor in thirteen fathoms youd better overhaul fortyfive on a night like this after that get the gaskets on the mainsail we wont need it  half an hour afterward his weary eyes were rewarded by a glimpse of two lights  there they are jacobsen ill take the wheel run down the forestaysail and stand by to let go make the niggers jump  aft the spokes of the wheel in his hands griffiths held the course till the two lights came in line when he abruptly altered and headed directly in for them he heard the tumble and roar of the surf but decided it was farther awayas it should be at gabera  he heard the frightened cry of the mate and was grinding the wheel down with all his might when the williwaw struck at the same instant her mainmast crashed over the bow five wild minutes followed all hands held on while the hull upheaved and smashed down on the brittle coral and the warm seas swept over them grinding and crunching the williwaw worked itself clear over the shoal patch and came solidly to rest in the comparatively smooth and shallow channel beyond  griffiths sat down on the edge of the cabin head bowed on chest in silent wrath and bitterness once he lifted his face to glare at the two white lights one above the other and perfectly in line  there they are he said and this isnt gabera then what the hell is it  though the surf still roared and across the shoal flung its spray and upper wash over them the wind died down and the stars came out shoreward came the sound of oars  what have you hadan earthquake griffiths called out the bottoms all changed ive anchored here a hundred times in thirteen fathoms is that you wilson  a whaleboat came alongside and a man climbed over the rail in the faint light griffiths found an automatic colts thrust into his face and looking up saw david grief  no you never anchored here before grief laughed gaberas just around the point where ill be as soon as ive collected that little sum of twelve hundred pounds we wont bother for the receipt ive your note here and ill just return it  you did this griffiths cried springing to his feet in a sudden gust of rage you faked those leading lights youve wrecked me and by  steady steady griefs voice was cool and menacing ill trouble you for that twelve hundred please  to griffiths a vast impotence seemed to descend upon him he was overwhelmed by a profound disgustdisgust for the sunlands and the sunsickness for the futility of all his endeavour for this blueeyed goldentinted superior man who defeated him on all his ways  jacobsen he said will you open the cashbox and pay thisthis bloodsuckertwelve hundred pounds      chapter twothe proud goat of aloysius pankburn     i  quick eye that he had for the promise of adventure prepared always for the unexpected to leap out at him from behind the nearest cocoanut tree nevertheless david grief received no warning when he laid eyes on aloysius pankburn it was on the little steamer berthe leaving his schooner to follow grief had taken passage for the short run across from raiatea to papeete when he first saw aloysius pankburn that somewhat fuddled gentleman was drinking a lonely cocktail at the tiny bar between decks next to the barber shop and when grief left the barbers hands half an hour later aloysius pankburn was still hanging over the bar still drinking by himself  now it is not good for man to drink alone and grief threw sharp scrutiny into his passing glance he saw a wellbuilt young man of thirty wellfeatured welldressed and evidently in the worlds catalogue a gentleman but in the faint hint of slovenliness in the shaking eager hand that spilled the liquor and in the nervous vacillating eyes grief read the unmistakable marks of the chronic alcoholic  after dinner he chanced upon pankburn again this time it was on deck and the young man clinging to the rail and peering into the distance at the dim forms of a man and woman in two steamer chairs drawn closely together was crying drunkenly grief noted that the mans arm was around the womans waist aloysius pankburn looked on and cried  nothing to weep about grief said genially  pankburn looked at him and gushed tears of profound selfpity  its hard he sobbed hard hard that mans my business manager i employ him i pay him a good screw and thats how he earns it  in that case why dont you put a stop to it grief advised  i cant shed shut off my whiskey shes my trained nurse  fire her then and drink your head off  i cant hes got all my money if i did he wouldnt give me sixpence to buy a drink with  this woful possibility brought a fresh wash of tears grief was interested of all unique situations he could never have imagined such a one as this  they were engaged to take care of me pankburn was blubbering to keep me away from the drink and thats the way they do it lollygagging all about the ship and letting me drink myself to death it isnt right i tell you it isnt right they were sent along with me for the express purpose of not letting me drink and they let me drink to swinishness as long as i leave them alone if i complain they threaten not to let me have another drop what can a poor devil do my death will be on their heads thats all come on down and join me  he released his clutch on the rail and would have fallen had grief not caught his arm he seemed to undergo a transformation to stiffen physically to thrust his chin forward aggressively and to glint harshly in his eyes  i wont let them kill me and theyll be sorry ive offered them fifty thousandlater on of course they laughed they dont know but i know he fumbled in his coat pocket and drew forth an object that flashed in the faint light they dont know the meaning of that but i do he looked at grief with abrupt suspicion what do you make out of it eh what do you make out of it  david grief caught a swift vision of an alcoholic degenerate putting a very loving young couple to death with a copper spike for a copper spike was what he held in his hand an evident oldfashioned shipfastening  my mother thinks im up here to get cured of the booze habit she doesnt know i bribed the doctor to prescribe a voyage when we get to papeete my manager is going to charter a schooner and away well sail but they dont dream they think its the booze i know i only know good night sir im going to bedunlesseryoull join me in a night cap one last drink you know     ii  in the week that followed at papeete grief caught numerous and bizarre glimpses of aloysius pankburn so did everybody else in the little island capital for neither the beach nor lavinas boarding house had been so scandalized in years in midday bareheaded clad only in swimming trunks aloysius pankburn ran down the main street from lavinas to the water front he put on the gloves with a fireman from the berthe in a scheduled fourround bout at the folies bergères and was knocked out in the second round he tried insanely to drown himself in a twofoot pool of water dived drunkenly and splendidly from fifty feet up in the rigging of the mariposa lying at the wharf and chartered the cutter toerau at more than her purchase price and was only saved by his managers refusal financially to ratify the agreement he bought out the old blind leper at the market and sold breadfruit plantains and sweet potatoes at such cutrates that the gendarmes were called out to break the rush of bargainhunting natives for that matter three times the gendarmes arrested him for riotous behaviour and three times his manager ceased from lovemaking long enough to pay the fines imposed by a needy colonial administration  then the mariposa sailed for san francisco and in the bridal suite were the manager and the trained nurse freshmarried before departing the manager had thoughtfully bestowed eight fivepound banknotes on aloysius with the foreseen result that aloysius awoke several days later to find himself broke and perilously near to delirium tremens lavina famed for her good heart even among the driftage of south pacific rogues and scamps nursed him around and never let it filter into his returning intelligence that there was neither manager nor money to pay his board  it was several evenings after this that david grief lounging under the after deck awning of the kittiwake and idly scanning the meagre columns of the papeete avantcoureur sat suddenly up and almost rubbed his eyes it was unbelievable but there it was the old south seas romance was not dead he read       wantedto exchange a half interest in buried treasure      worth five million francs for transportation for one to an      unknown island in the pacific and facilities for carrying      away the loot   ask for folly at lavinas  grief looked at his watch it was early yet only eight oclock  mr carlsen he called in the direction of a glowing pipe get the crew for the whaleboat im going ashore  the husky voice of the norwegian mate was raised forard and half a dozen strapping rapa islanders ceased their singing and manned the boat  i came to see folly mr folly i imagine david grief told lavina  he noted the quick interest in her eyes as she turned her head and flung a command in native across two open rooms to the outstanding kitchen a few minutes later a barefooted native girl padded in and shook her head  lavinas disappointment was evident  youre stopping aboard the kittiwake arent you she said ill tell him you called  then it is a he grief queried  lavina nodded  i hope you can do something for him captain grief im only a goodnatured woman i dont know but hes a likable man and he may be telling the truth i dont know youll know youre not a softhearted fool like me cant i mix you a cocktail     iii  back on board his schooner and dozing in a deck chair under a threemonthsold magazine david grief was aroused by a sobbing slubbering noise from overside he opened his eyes from the chilian cruiser a quarter of a mile away came the stroke of eight bells it was midnight from overside came a splash and another slubbering noise to him it seemed half amphibian half the sounds of a man crying to himself and querulously chanting his sorrows to the general universe  a jump took david grief to the low rail beneath centred about the slubbering noise was an area of agitated phosphorescence leaning over he locked his hand under the armpit of a man and with pull and heave and quickchanging grips he drew on deck the naked form of aloysius pankburn  i didnt have a soumarkee he complained i had to swim it and i couldnt find your gangway it was very miserable pardon me if you have a towel to put about my middle and a good stiff drink ill be more myself im mr folly and youre the captain grief i presume who called on me when i was out no im not drunk nor am i cold this isnt shivering lavina allowed me only two drinks today im on the edge of the horrors thats all and i was beginning to see things when i couldnt find the gangway if youll take me below ill be very grateful you are the only one that answered my advertisement  he was shaking pitiably in the warm night and down in the cabin before he got his towel grief saw to it that a halftumbler of whiskey was in his hand  now fire ahead grief said when he had got his guest into a shirt and a pair of duck trousers whats this advertisement of yours im listening  pankburn looked at the whiskey bottle but grief shook his head  all right captain though i tell you on whatever is left of my honour that i am not drunknot in the least also what i shall tell you is true and i shall tell it briefly for it is clear to me that you are a man of affairs and action likewise your chemistry is good to you alcohol has never been a million maggots gnawing at every cell of you youve never been to hell i am there now i am scorching now listen  my mother is alive she is english i was born in australia i was educated at york and yale i am a master of arts a doctor of philosophy and i am no good furthermore i am an alcoholic i have been an athlete i used to swandive a hundred and ten feet in the clear i hold several amateur records i am a fish i learned the crawlstroke from the first of the cavilles i have done thirty miles in a rough sea i have another record i have punished more whiskey than any man of my years i will steal sixpence from you for the price of a drink finally i will tell you the truth  my father was an americanan annapolis man he was a midshipman in the war of the rebellion in 66 he was a lieutenant on the suwanee her captain was paul shirley in 66 the suwanee coaled at an island in the pacific which i do not care to mention under a protectorate which did not exist then and which shall be nameless ashore behind the bar of a public house my father saw three copper spikesships spikes  david grief smiled quietly  and now i can tell you the name of the coaling station and of the protectorate that came afterward he said  and of the three spikes pankburn asked with equal quietness go ahead for they are in my possession now  certainly they were behind german oscars bar at peenoopeenee johnny black brought them there from off his schooner the night he died he was just back from a long cruise to the westward fishing bechedemer and sandalwood trading all the beach knows the tale  pankburn shook his head  go on he urged  it was before my time of course grief explained i only tell what ive heard next came the ecuadoran cruiser of all directions in from the westward and bound home her officers recognized the spikes johnny black was dead they got hold of his mate and logbook away to the westward went she six months after again bound home she dropped in at peenoopeenee she had failed and the tale leaked out  when the revolutionists were marching on guayaquil pankburn took it up the federal officers believing a defence of the city hopeless salted down the government treasure chest something like a million dollars gold but all in english coinage and put it on board the american schooner flirt they were going to run at daylight the american captain skinned out in the middle of the night go on  its an old story grief resumed there was no other vessel in the harbour the federal leaders couldnt run they put their backs to the wall and held the city rohjas salced making a forced march from quito raised the siege the revolution was broken and the one ancient steamer that constituted the ecuadoran navy was sent in pursuit of the flirt they caught her between the banks group and the new hebrides hove to and flying distress signals the captain had died the day beforeblackwater fever  and the mate pankburn challenged  the mate had been killed a week earlier by the natives on one of the banks when they sent a boat in for water there were no navigators left the men were put to the torture it was beyond international law they wanted to confess but couldnt they told of the three spikes in the trees on the beach but where the island was they did not know to the westward far to the westward was all they knew the tale now goes two ways one is that they all died under the torture the other is that the survivors were swung at the yardarm at any rate the ecuadoran cruiser went home without the treasure johnny black brought the three spikes to peenoopeenee and left them at german oscars but how and where he found them he never told  pankburn looked hard at the whiskey bottle  just two fingers he whimpered  grief considered and poured a meagre drink pankburns eyes sparkled and he took new lease of life  and this is where i come in with the missing details he said johnny black did tell he told my father wrote him from levuka before he came on to die at peenoopeenee my father had saved his life one roughhouse night in valparaiso a chink pearler out of thursday island prospecting for new grounds to the north of new guinea traded for the three spikes with a nigger johnny black bought them for copper weight he didnt dream any more than the chink but coming back he stopped for hawksbill turtle at the very beach where you say the mate of the flirt was killed only he wasnt killed the banks islanders held him prisoner and he was dying of necrosis of the jawbone caused by an arrow wound in the fight on the beach before he died he told the yarn to johnny black johnny black wrote my father from levuka he was at the end of his ropecancer my father ten years afterward when captain of the perry got the spikes from german oscar and from my father last will and testament you know came the spikes and the data i have the island the latitude and longitude of the beach where the three spikes were nailed in the trees the spikes are up at lavinas now the latitude and longitude are in my head now what do you think  fishy was griefs instant judgment why didnt your father go and get it himself  didnt need it an uncle died and left him a fortune he retired from the navy ran foul of an epidemic of trained nurses in boston and my mother got a divorce also she fell heir to an income of something like thirty thousand dollars and went to live in new zealand i was divided between them halftime new zealand halftime united states until my fathers death last year now my mother has me altogether he left me his moneyoh a couple of millionsbut my mother has had guardians appointed on account of the drink im worth all kinds of money but i cant touch a penny save what is doled out to me but the old man who had got the tip on my drinking left me the three spikes and the data thereunto pertaining did it through his lawyers unknown to my mother said it beat life insurance and that if i had the backbone to go and get it i could drink my back teeth awash until i died millions in the hands of my guardians slathers of shekels of my mothers thatll be mine if she beats me to the crematory another million waiting to be dug up and in the meantime im cadging on lavina for two drinks a day its hell isnt itwhen you consider my thirst  wheres the island  its a long way from here  name it  not on your life captain grief youre making an easy halfmillion out of this you will sail under my directions and when were well to sea and on our way ill tell you and not before  grief shrugged his shoulders dismissing the subject  when ive given you another drink ill send the boat ashore with you he said  pankburn was taken aback for at least five minutes he debated with himself then licked his lips and surrendered  if you promise to go ill tell you now  of course im willing to go thats why i asked you name the island  pankburn looked at the bottle  ill take that drink now captain  no you wont that drink was for you if you went ashore if you are going to tell me the island you must do it in your sober senses  francis island if you will have it bougainville named it barbour island  off there all by its lonely in the little coral sea grief said i know it lies between new ireland and new guinea a rotten hole now though it was all right when the flirt drove in the spikes and the chink pearler traded for them the steamship castor recruiting labour for the upolu plantations was cut off there with all hands two years ago i knew her captain well the germans sent a cruiser shelled the bush burned half a dozen villages killed a couple of niggers and a lot of pigs andand that was all the niggers always were bad there but they turned really bad forty years ago that was when they cut off a whaler let me see what was her name  he stepped to the bookshelf drew out the bulky south pacific directory and ran through its pages  yes here it is francis or barbour he skimmed natives warlike and treacherousmelanesiancannibals whaleship western cut offthat was her name shoalspointsanchoragesah redscar owen bay likikili bay thats more like it deep indentation mangrove swamps good holding in nine fathoms when white scar in bluff bears westsouthwest grief looked up thats your beach pankburn ill swear  will you go the other demanded eagerly  grief nodded  it sounds good to me now if the story had been of a hundred millions or some such crazy sum i wouldnt look at it for a moment well sail tomorrow but under one consideration you are to be absolutely under my orders  his visitor nodded emphatically and joyously  and that means no drink  thats pretty hard pankburn whined  its my terms im enough of a doctor to see you dont come to harm and you are to workhard work sailors work youll stand regular watches and everything though you eat and sleep aft with us  its a go pankburn put out his hand to ratify the agreement if it doesnt kill me he added  david grief poured a generous threefingers into the tumbler and extended it  then heres your last drink take it  pankburns hand went halfway out with a sudden spasm of resolution he hesitated threw back his shoulders and straightened up his head  i guess i wont he began then feebly surrendering to the gnaw of desire he reached hastily for the glass as if in fear that it would be withdrawn     iv  it is a long traverse from papeete in the societies to the little coral seafrom 100 west longitude to 150 east longitudeas the crow flies the equivalent to a voyage across the atlantic but the kittiwake did not go as the crow flies david griefs numerous interests diverted her course many times he stopped to take a lookin at uninhabited rose island with an eye to colonizing and planting cocoanuts next he paid his respects to tui manua of eastern samoa and opened an intrigue for a share of the trade monopoly of that dying kings three islands from apia he carried several relief agents and a load of trade goods to the gilberts he peeped in at ontongjava atoll inspected his plantations on ysabel and purchased lands from the saltwater chiefs of northwestern malaita and all along this devious way he made a man of aloysius pankburn  that thirster though he lived aft was compelled to do the work of a common sailor and not only did he take his wheel and lookout and heave on sheets and tackles but the dirtiest and most arduous tasks were appointed him swung aloft in a bosuns chair he scraped the masts and slushed down holystoning the deck or scrubbing it with fresh limes made his back ache and developed the wasted flabby muscles when the kittiwake lay at anchor and her copper bottom was scrubbed with cocoanut husks by the native crew who dived and did it under water pankburn was sent down on his shift and as many times as any on the shift  look at yourself grief said you are twice the man you were when you came on board you havent had one drink you didnt die and the poison is pretty well worked out of you its the work it beats trained nurses and business managers here if youre thirsty clap your lips to this  with several deft strokes of his heavybacked sheathknife grief clipped a triangular piece of shell from the end of a husked drinkingcocoanut the thin cool liquid slightly milky and effervescent bubbled to the brim with a bow pankburn took the natural cup threw his head back and held it back till the shell was empty he drank many of these nuts each day the black steward a new hebrides boy sixty years of age and his assistant a lark islander of eleven saw to it that he was continually supplied  pankburn did not object to the hard work he devoured work never shirking and always beating the native sailors in jumping to obey a command but his sufferings during the period of driving the alcohol out of his system were truly heroic even when the last shred of the poison was exuded the desire as an obsession remained in his head so it was when on his honour he went ashore at apia that he attempted to put the public houses out of business by drinking up their stocks in trade and so it was at two in the morning that david grief found him in front of the tivoli out of which he had been disorderly thrown by charley roberts aloysius as of old was chanting his sorrows to the stars also and more concretely he was punctuating the rhythm with cobbles of coral stone which he flung with amazing accuracy through charley robertss windows  david grief took him away but not till next morning did he take him in hand it was on the deck of the kittiwake and there was nothing kindergarten about it grief struck him with bare knuckles punched him and punished himgave him the worst thrashing he had ever received  for the good of your soul pankburn was the way he emphasized his blows for the good of your mother for the progeny that will come after for the good of the world and the universe and the whole race of man yet to be and now to hammer the lesson home well do it all over again that for the good of your soul and that for your mothers sake and that for the little children undreamed of and unborn whose mother youll love for their sakes and for loves sake in the lease of manhood that will be yours when i am done with you come on and take your medicine im not done with you yet ive only begun there are many other reasons which i shall now proceed to expound the brown sailors and the black stewards and cook looked on and grinned far from them was the questioning of any of the mysterious and incomprehensible ways of white men as for carlsen the mate he was grimly in accord with the treatment his employer was administering while albright the supercargo merely played with his mustache and smiled they were men of the sea they lived life in the rough and alcohol in themselves as well as in other men was a problem they had learned to handle in ways not taught in doctors schools  boy a bucket of fresh water and a towel grief ordered when he had finished two buckets and two towels he added as he surveyed his own hands  youre a pretty one he said to pankburn youve spoiled everything i had the poison completely out of you and now you are fairly reeking with it weve got to begin all over again mr albright you know that pile of old chain on the beach at the boatlanding find the owner buy it and fetch it on board there must be a hundred and fifty fathoms of it pankburn tomorrow morning you start in pounding the rust off of it when youve done that youll sandpaper it then youll paint it and nothing else will you do till that chain is as smooth as new  aloysius pankburn shook his head  i quit francis island can go to hell for all of me im done with your slavedriving kindly put me ashore at once im a white man you cant treat me this way  mr carlsen you will see that mr pankburn remains on board  ill have you broken for this aloysius screamed you cant stop me  i can give you another licking grief answered and let me tell you one thing you besotted whelp ill keep on licking you as long as my knuckles hold out or until you yearn to hammer chain rust ive taken you in hand and im going to make a man out of you if i have to kill you to do it now go below and change your clothes be ready to turn to with a hammer this afternoon mr albright get that chain aboard pronto mr carlsen send the boats ashore after it also keep your eye on pankburn if he shows signs of keeling over or going into the shakes give him a nipa small one he may need it after last night     v  for the rest of the time the kittiwake lay in apia aloysius pankburn pounded chain rust ten hours a day he pounded and on the long stretch across to the gilberts he still pounded  then came the sandpapering one hundred and fifty fathoms is nine hundred feet and every link of all that length was smoothed and polished as no link ever was before and when the last link had received its second coat of black paint he declared himself  come on with more dirty work he told grief ill overhaul the other chains if you say so and you neednt worry about me any more im not going to take another drop im going to train up you got my proud goat when you beat me but let me tell you you only got it temporarily train im going to train till im as hard all the way through and clean all the way through as that chain is and some day mister david grief somewhere somehow im going to be in such shape that ill lick you as you licked me im going to pulp your face till your own niggers wont know you  grief was jubilant  now youre talking like a man he cried the only way youll ever lick me is to become a man and then maybe  he paused in the hope that the other would catch the suggestion aloysius groped for it and abruptly something akin to illumination shone in his eyes  and then i wont want to you mean  grief nodded  and thats the curse of it aloysius lamented i really believe i wont want to i see the point but im going to go right on and shape myself up just the same  the warm sunburn glow in griefs face seemed to grow warmer his hand went out  pankburn i love you right now for that  aloysius grasped the hand and shook his head in sad sincerity  grief he mourned youve got my goat youve got my proud goat and youve got it permanently im afraid     vi  on a sultry tropic day when the last flicker of the far southeast trade was fading out and the seasonal change for the northwest monsoon was coming on the kittiwake lifted above the searim the jungleclad coast of francis island  grief with compass bearings and binoculars identified the volcano that marked redscar ran past owen bay and lost the last of the breeze at the entrance to likikili bay with the two whaleboats out and towing and with carlsen heaving the lead the kittiwake sluggishly entered a deep and narrow indentation there were no beaches the mangroves began at the waters edge and behind them rose steep jungle broken here and there by jagged peaks of rock at the end of a mile when the white scar on the bluff bore westsouthwest the lead vindicated the directory and the anchor rumbled down in nine fathoms  for the rest of that day and until the afternoon of the day following they remained on the kittiwake and waited no canoes appeared there were no signs of human life save for the occasional splash of a fish or the screaming of cockatoos there seemed no other life once however a huge butterfly twelve inches from tip to tip fluttered high over their mastheads and drifted across to the opposing jungle  theres no use in sending a boat in to be cut up grief said  pankburn was incredulous and volunteered to go in alone to swim it if he couldnt borrow the dingey  they havent forgotten the german cruiser grief explained and ill wager that bush is alive with men right now what do you think mr carlsen  that veteran adventurer of the islands was emphatic in his agreement  in the late afternoon of the second day grief ordered a whaleboat into the water he took his place in the bow a live cigarette in his mouth and a shortfused stick of dynamite in his hand for he was bent on shooting a mess of fish along the thwarts half a dozen winchesters were placed albright who took the steeringsweep had a mauser within reach of hand they pulled in and along the green wall of vegetation at times they rested on the oars in the midst of a profound silence  two to one the bush is swarming with themin quids albright whispered  pankburn listened a moment longer and took the bet five minutes later they sighted a school of mullet the brown rowers held their oars grief touched the short fuse to his cigarette and threw the stick so short was the fuse that the stick exploded in the instant after it struck the water and in that same instant the bush exploded into life there were wild yells of defiance and black and naked bodies leaped forward like apes through the mangroves  in the whaleboat every rifle was lifted then came the wait a hundred blacks some few armed with ancient sniders but the greater portion armed with tomahawks firehardened spears and bonetipped arrows clustered on the roots that rose out of the bay no word was spoken each party watched the other across twenty feet of water an old oneeyed black with a bristly face rested a snider on his hip the muzzle directed at albright who in turn covered him back with the mauser a couple of minutes of this tableau endured the stricken fish rose to the surface or struggled halfstunned in the clear depths  its all right boys grief said quietly put down your guns and over the side with you mr albright toss the tobacco to that oneeyed brute  while the rapa men dived for the fish albright threw a bundle of trade tobacco ashore the oneeyed man nodded his head and writhed his features in an attempt at amiability weapons were lowered bows unbent and arrows put back in their quivers  they know tobacco grief announced as they rowed back aboard well have visitors youll break out a case of tobacco mr albright and a few tradeknives theres a canoe now  old oneeye as befitted a chief and leader paddled out alone facing peril for the rest of the tribe as carlsen leaned over the rail to help the visitor up he turned his head and remarked casually  theyve dug up the money mr grief the old beggars loaded with it  oneeye floundered down on deck grinning appeasingly and failing to hide the fear he had overcome but which still possessed him he was lame of one leg and this was accounted for by a terrible scar inches deep which ran down the thigh from hip to knee no clothes he wore whatever not even a string but his nose perforated in a dozen places and each perforation the setting for a carved spine of bone bristled like a porcupine around his neck and hanging down on his dirty chest was a string of gold sovereigns his ears were hung with silver halfcrowns and from the cartilage separating his nostrils depended a big english penny tarnished and green but unmistakable  hold on grief pankburn said with perfectly assumed carelessness you say they know only beads and tobacco very well you follow my lead theyve found the treasure and weve got to trade them out of it get the whole crew aside and lecture them that they are to be interested only in the pennies savve gold coins must be beneath contempt and silver coins merely tolerated pennies are to be the only desirable things  pankburn took charge of the trading for the penny in oneeyes nose he gave ten sticks of tobacco since each stick cost david grief a cent the bargain was manifestly unfair but for the halfcrowns pankburn gave only one stick each the string of sovereigns he refused to consider the more he refused the more oneeye insisted on a trade at last with an appearance of irritation and anger and as a palpable concession pankburn gave two sticks for the string which was composed of ten sovereigns  i take my hat off to you grief said to pankburn that night at dinner the situation is patent youve reversed the scale of value theyll figure the pennies as priceless possessions and the sovereigns as beneath price result theyll hang on to the pennies and force us to trade for sovereigns pankburn i drink your health boyanother cup of tea for mr pankburn     vii  followed a golden week from dawn till dark a row of canoes rested on their paddles two hundred feet away this was the deadline rapa sailors armed with rifles maintained it but one canoe at a time was permitted alongside and but one black at a time was permitted to come over the rail here under the awning relieving one another in hourly shifts the four white men carried on the trade the rate of exchange was that established by pankburn with oneeye five sovereigns fetched a stick of tobacco a hundred sovereigns twenty sticks thus a craftyeyed cannibal would deposit on the table a thousand dollars in gold and go back over the rail hugelysatisfied with forty cents worth of tobacco in his hand  hope weve got enough tobacco to hold out carlsen muttered dubiously as another case was sawed in half  albright laughed  weve got fifty cases below he said and as i figure it three cases buy a hundred thousand dollars there was only a million dollars buried so thirty cases ought to get it though of course weve got to allow a margin for the silver and the pennies that ecuadoran bunch must have salted down all the coin in sight  very few pennies and shillings appeared though pankburn continually and anxiously inquired for them pennies were the one thing he seemed to desire and he made his eyes flash covetously whenever one was produced true to his theory the savages concluded that the gold being of slight value must be disposed of first a penny worth fifty times as much as a sovereign was something to retain and treasure doubtless in their junglelairs the wise old graybeards put their heads together and agreed to raise the price on pennies when the worthless gold was all worked off who could tell mayhap the strange white men could be made to give even twenty sticks for a priceless copper  by the end of the week the trade went slack there was only the slightest dribble of gold an occasional penny was reluctantly disposed of for ten sticks while several thousand dollars in silver came in  on the morning of the eighth day no trading was done the graybeards had matured their plan and were demanding twenty sticks for a penny oneeye delivered the new rate of exchange the white men appeared to take it with great seriousness for they stood together debating in low voices had oneeye understood english he would have been enlightened  weve got just a little over eight hundred thousand not counting the silver grief said and thats about all there is the bush tribes behind have most probably got the other two hundred thousand return in three months and the saltwater crowd will have traded back for it also they will be out of tobacco by that time  it would be a sin to buy pennies albright grinned it goes against the thrifty grain of my traders soul  theres a whiff of landbreeze stirring grief said looking at pankburn what do you say  pankburn nodded  very well grief measured the faintness and irregularity of the wind against his cheek  mr carlsen heave short and get off the gaskets and stand by with the whaleboats to tow this breeze is not dependable  he picked up a part case of tobacco containing six or seven hundred sticks put it in oneeyes hands and helped that bewildered savage over the rail as the foresail went up the mast a wail of consternation arose from the canoes lying along the deadline and as the anchor broke out and the kittiwakes head paid off in the light breeze old oneeye daring the rifles levelled on him paddled alongside and made frantic signs of his tribes willingness to trade pennies for ten sticks  boya drinking nut pankburn called  its sydney heads for you grief said and then what  im coming back with you for that two hundred thousand pankburn answered in the meantime im going to build an island schooner also im going to call those guardians of mine before the court to show cause why my fathers money should not be turned over to me show cause ill show them cause why it should  he swelled his biceps proudly under the thin sleeve reached for the two black stewards and put them above his head like a pair of dumbbells  come on swing out on that foreboomtackle carlsen shouted from aft where the mainsail was being winged out  pankburn dropped the stewards and raced for it beating a rapa sailor by two jumps to the hauling part     chapter threethe devils of fuatino     i  of his many schooners ketches and cutters that nosed about among the coral isles of the south seas david grief loved most the rattlera yachtlike schooner of ninety tons with so swift a pair of heels that she had made herself famous in the old days opiumsmuggling from san diego to puget sound raiding the sealrookeries of bering sea and running arms in the far east a stench and an abomination to government officials she had been the joy of all sailormen and the pride of the shipwrights who built her even now after forty years of driving she was still the same old rattler forereaching in the same marvellous manner that compelled sailors to see in order to believe and that punctuated many an angry discussion with words and blows on the beaches of all the ports from valparaiso to manila bay  on this night closehauled her big mainsail preposterously flattened down her luffs pulsing emptily on the lift of each smooth swell she was sliding an easy four knots through the water on the veriest whisper of a breeze for an hour david grief had been leaning on the rail at the lee forerigging gazing overside at the steady phosphorescence of her gait the faint backdraught from the headsails fanned his cheek and chest with a wine of coolness and he was in an ecstasy of appreciation of the schooners qualities  ehshes a beauty taute a beauty he said to the kanaka lookout at the same time stroking the teak of the rail with an affectionate hand  ay skipper the kanaka answered in the rich bigchested tones of polynesia thirty years i know ships but never like this on raiatea we call her fanauao  the dayborn grief translated the lovephrase who named her so  about to answer taute peered ahead with sudden intensity grief joined him in the gaze  land said taute  yes fuatino grief agreed his eyes still fixed on the spot where the starluminous horizon was gouged by a blot of blackness its all right ill tell the captain  the rattler slid along until the loom of the island could be seen as well as sensed until the sleepy roar of breakers and the blatting of goats could be heard until the wind off the land was flowerdrenched with perfume  if it wasnt a crevice she could run the passage a night like this captain glass remarked regretfully as he watched the wheel lashed hard down by the steersman  the rattler run off shore a mile had been hove to to wait until daylight ere she attempted the perilous entrance to fuatino it was a perfect tropic night with no hint of rain or squall forard wherever their tasks left them the raiatea sailors sank down to sleep on deck aft the captain and mate and grief spread their beds with similar languid unconcern they lay on their blankets smoking and murmuring sleepy conjectures about mataara the queen of fuatino and about the love affair between her daughter naumoo and motuaro  theyre certainly a romantic lot brown the mate said as romantic as we whites  as romantic as pilsach grief laughed and that is going some how long ago was it captain that he jumped you  eleven years captain glass grunted resentfully  tell me about it brown pleaded they say hes never left fuatino since is that right  right o the captain rumbled hes in love with his wifethe little hussy stole him from me and as good a sailorman as the trade has ever seenif he is a dutchman  german grief corrected  its all the same was the retort the sea was robbed of a good man that night he went ashore and notutu took one look at him i reckon they looked good to each other before you could say skat shed put a wreath of some kind of white flowers on his head and in five minutes they were off down the beach like a couple of kids holding hands and laughing i hope hes blown that big coral patch out of the channel i always start a sheet or two of copper warping past  go on with the story brown urged  thats all he was finished right there got married that night never came on board again i looked him up next day found him in a straw house in the bush barelegged a white savage all mixed up with flowers and things and playing a guitar looked like a bally ass told me to send his things ashore i told him id see him damned first and thats all youll see her tomorrow theyve got three kiddies nowwonderful little rascals ive a phonograph down below for him and about a million records  and then you made him trader the mate inquired of grief  what else could i do fuatino is a love island and filsach is a lover he knows the native tooone of the best traders ive got or ever had hes responsible youll see him tomorrow  look here young man captain glass rumbled threateningly at his mate are you romantic because if you are on board you stay fuatinos the island of romantic insanity everybodys in love with somebody they live on love its in the milk of the cocoanuts or the air or the sea the history of the island for the last ten thousand years is nothing but love affairs i know ive talked with the old men and if i catch you starting down the beach hand in hand  his sudden cessation caused both the other men to look at him they followed his gaze which passed across them to the main rigging and saw what he saw a brown hand and arm muscular and wet being joined from overside by a second brown hand and arm a head followed thatched with long elfin locks and then a face with roguish black eyes lined with the marks of wildwoods laughter  my god brown breathed its a fauna seafaun  its the goat man said glass  it is mauriri said grief he is my own blood brother by sacred plight of native custom his name is mine and mine is his  broad brown shoulders and a magnificent chest rose above the rail and with what seemed effortless ease the whole grand body followed over the rail and noiselessly trod the deck brown who might have been other things than the mate of an island schooner was enchanted all that he had ever gleaned from the books proclaimed indubitably the faunlikeness of this visitant of the deep but a sad faun was the young mans judgment as the goldenbrown woods god strode forward to where david grief sat up with outstretched hand  david said david grief  mauriri big brother said mauriri  and thereafter in the custom of men who have pledged blood brotherhood each called the other not by the others name but by his own also they talked in the polynesian tongue of fuatino and brown could only sit and guess  a long swim to say talofa grief said as the other sat and streamed water on the deck  many days and nights have i watched for your coming big brother mauriri replied i have sat on the big rock where the dynamite is kept of which i have been made keeper i saw you come up to the entrance and run back into darkness i knew you waited till morning and i followed great trouble has come upon us mataara has cried these many days for your coming she is an old woman and motauri is dead and she is sad  did he marry naumoo grief asked after he had shaken his head and sighed by the custom  yes in the end they ran to live with the goats till mataara forgave when they returned to live with her in the big house but he is now dead and naumoo soon will die great is our trouble big brother tori is dead and tatitori and petoo and nari and pilsach and others  pilsach too grief exclaimed has there been a sickness  there has been much killing listen big brother three weeks ago a strange schooner came from the big rock i saw her topsails above the sea she towed in with her boats but they did not warp by the big patch and she pounded many times she is now on the beach where they are strengthening the broken timbers there are eight white men on board they have women from some island far to the east the women talk a language in many ways like ours only different but we can understand they say they were stolen by the men on the schooner we do not know but they sing and dance and are happy  and the men grief interrupted  they talk french i know for there was a mate on your schooner who talked french long ago there are two chief men and they do not look like the others they have blue eyes like you and they are devils one is a bigger devil than the other the other six are also devils they do not pay us for our yams and taro and breadfruit they take everything from us and if we complain they kill us thus was killed tori and tatitori and petoo and others we cannot fight for we have no gunsonly two or three old guns  they illtreat our women thus was killed motuaro who made defence of naumoo whom they have now taken on board their schooner it was because of this that pilsach was killed him the chief of the two chief men the big devil shot once in his whaleboat and twice when he tried to crawl up the sand of the beach pilsach was a brave man and notutu now sits in the house and cries without end many of the people are afraid and have run to live with the goats but there is not food for all in the high mountains and the men will not go out and fish and they work no more in the gardens because of the devils who take all they have and we are ready to fight  big brother we need guns and much ammunition i sent word before i swam out to you and the men are waiting the strange white men do not know you are come give me a boat and the guns and i will go back before the sun and when you come tomorrow we will be ready for the word from you to kill the strange white men they must be killed big brother you have ever been of the blood with us and the men and women have prayed to many gods for your coming and you are come  i will go in the boat with you grief said  no big brother was mauriris reply you must be with the schooner the strange white men will fear the schooner not us we will have the guns and they will not know it is only when they see your schooner come that they will be alarmed send the young man there with the boat  so it was that brown thrilling with all the romance and adventure he had read and guessed and never lived took his place in the sternsheets of a whaleboat loaded with rifles and cartridges rowed by four baiatea sailors steered by a goldenbrown seaswimming faun and directed through the warm tropic darkness toward the halfmythical love island of fuatino which had been invaded by twentieth century pirates     ii  if a line be drawn between jaluit in the marshall group and bougainville in the solomons and if this line be bisected at two degrees south of the equator by a line drawn from ukuor in the carolines the high island of fuatino will be raised in that sunwashed stretch of lonely sea inhabited by a stock kindred to the hawaiian the samoan the tahitian and the maori fuatino becomes the apex of the wedge driven by polynesia far to the west and in between melanesia and micronesia and it was fuatino that david grief raised next morning two miles to the east and in direct line with the rising sun the same whisper of a breeze held and the rattler slid through the smooth sea at a rate that would have been eminently proper for an island schooner had the breeze been thrice as strong  fuatino was nothing else than an ancient crater thrust upward from the seabottom by some primordial cataclysm the western portion broken and crumbled to sea level was the entrance to the crater itself which constituted the harbour thus fuatino was like a rugged horseshoe the heel pointing to the west and into the opening at the heel the rattler steered captain glass binoculars in hand and peering at the chart made by himself which was spread on top the cabin straightened up with an expression on his face that was half alarm half resignation  its coming he said fever it wasnt due till tomorrow it always hits me hard mr grief in five minutes ill be off my head youll have to con the schooner in boy get my bunk ready plenty of blankets fill that hotwater bottle its so calm mr grief that i think you can pass the big patch without warping take the leading wind and shoot her shes the only craft in the south pacific that can do it and i know you know the trick you can scrape the big rock by just watching out for the main boom  he had talked rapidly almost like a drunken man as his reeling brain battled with the rising shock of the malarial stroke when he stumbled toward the companionway his face was purpling and mottling as if attacked by some monstrous inflammation or decay his eyes were setting in a glassy bulge his hands shaking his teeth clicking in the spasms of chill  two hours to get the sweat he chattered with a ghastly grin and a couple more and ill be all right i know the damned thing to the last minute it runs its course yyyou tttake chchchch  his voice faded away in a weak stutter as he collapsed down into the cabin and his employer took charge the rattler was just entering the passage the heels of the horseshoe island were two huge mountains of rock a thousand feet high each almost broken off from the mainland and connected with it by a low and narrow peninsula between the heels was a halfmile stretch all but blocked by a reef of coral extending across from the south heel the passage which captain glass had called a crevice twisted into this reef curved directly to the north heel and ran along the base of the perpendicular rock at this point with the mainboom almost grazing the rock on the port side grief peering down on the starboard side could see bottom less than two fathoms beneath and shoaling steeply with a whaleboat towing for steerage and as a precaution against backdraughts from the cliff and taking advantage of a fan of breeze he shook the rattler full into it and glided by the big coral patch without warping as it was he just scraped but so softly as not to start the copper  the harbour of fuatino opened before him it was a circular sheet of water five miles in diameter rimmed with white coral beaches from which the verdureclad slopes rose swiftly to the frowning crater walls the crests of the walls were sawtoothed volcanic peaks capped and halod with captive tradewind clouds every nook and crevice of the disintegrating lava gave foothold to creeping climbing vines and treesa green foam of vegetation thin streams of water that were mere films of mist swayed and undulated downward in sheer descents of hundreds of feet and to complete the magic of the place the warm moist air was heavy with the perfume of the yellowblossomed cassi  fanning along against light vagrant airs the rattler worked in calling the whaleboat on board grief searched out the shore with his binoculars there was no life in the hot blaze of tropic sun the place slept there was no sign of welcome up the beach on the north shore where the fringe of cocoanut palms concealed the village he could see the black bows of the canoes in the canoehouses on the beach on even keel rested the strange schooner nothing moved on board of her or around her not until the beach lay fifty yards away did grief let go the anchor in forty fathoms out in the middle long years before he had sounded three hundred fathoms without reaching bottom which was to be expected of a healthy craterpit like fuatino as the chain roared and surged through the hawsepipe he noticed a number of native women lusciously large as only those of polynesia are in flowing ahus flowercrowned stream out on the deck of the schooner on the beach also and what they did not see he saw from the galley the squat figure of a man steal forard drop to the sand and dive into the green screen of bush  while the sails were furled and gasketed awnings stretched and sheets and tackles coiled harbour fashion david grief paced the deck and looked vainly for a flutter of life elsewhere than on the strange schooner once beyond any doubt he heard the distant crack of a rifle in the direction of the big rock there were no further shots and he thought of it as some hunter shooting a wild goat  at the end of another hour captain glass under a mountain of blankets had ceased shivering and was in the inferno of a profound sweat  ill be all right in half an hour he said weakly  very well grief answered the place is dead and im going ashore to see mataara and find out the situation  its a tough bunch keep your eyes open the captain warned him if youre not back in an hour send word off  grief took the steeringsweep and four of his raiatea men bent to the oars as they landed on the beach he looked curiously at the women under the schooners awning he waved his hand tentatively and they after giggling waved back  talofa he called  they understood the greeting but replied iorana and he knew they came from the society group  huahine one of his sailors unhesitatingly named their island grief asked them whence they came and with giggles and laughter they replied huahine  it looks like old dupuys schooner grief said in tahitian speaking in a low voice dont look too hard what do you think eh isnt it the valetta  as the men climbed out and lifted the whaleboat slightly up the beach they stole careless glances at the vessel  it is the valetta taute said she carried her topmast away seven years ago at papeete they rigged a new one it was ten feet shorter that is the one  go over and talk with the women you boys you can almost see huahine from raiatea and youll be sure to know some of them find out all you can and if any of the white men show up dont start a row  an army of hermit crabs scuttled and rustled away before him as he advanced up the beach but under the palms no pigs rooted and grunted the cocoanuts lay where they had fallen and at the coprasheds there were no signs of curing industry and tidiness had vanished grass house after grass house he found deserted once he came upon an old man blind toothless prodigiously wrinkled who sat in the shade and babbled with fear when he spoke to him it was as if the place had been struck with the plague was griefs thought as he finally approached the big house all was desolation and disarray there were no flowercrowned men and maidens no brown babies rolling in the shade of the avocado trees in the doorway crouched and rocking back and forth sat mataara the old queen she wept afresh at sight of him divided between the tale of her woe and regret that no follower was left to dispense to him her hospitality  and so they have taken naumoo she finished motauri is dead my people have fled and are starving with the goats and there is no one to open for you even a drinking cocoanut o brother your white brothers be devils  they are no brothers of mine mataara grief consoled they are robbers and pigs and i shall clean the island of them  he broke off to whirl half around his hand flashing to his waist and back again the big colts levelled at the figure of a man bent double that rushed at him from out of the trees he did not pull the trigger nor did the man pause till he had flung himself headlong at griefs feet and begun to pour forth a stream of uncouth and awful noises he recognized the creature as the one he had seen steal from the valetta and dive into the bush but not until he raised him up and watched the contortions of the harelipped mouth could he understand what he uttered  save me master save me the man yammered in english though he was unmistakably a south sea native i know you save me  and thereat he broke into a wild outpour of incoherence that did not cease until grief seized him by the shoulders and shook him into silence  i know you grief said you were cook in the french hotel at papeete two years ago everybody called you harelip  the man nodded violently  i am now cook of the valetta he spat and spluttered his mouth writhing in a fearful struggle with its defect i know you i saw you at the hotel i saw you at lavinas i saw you on the kittiwake i saw you at the mariposa wharf you are captain grief and you will save me those men are devils they killed captain dupuy me they made kill half the crew two they shot from the crosstrees the rest they shot in the water i knew them all they stole the girls from huahine they added to their strength with jailmen from noumea they robbed the traders in the new hebrides they killed the trader at vanikori and stole two women there they  but grief no longer heard through the trees from the direction of the harbour came a rattle of rifles and he started on the run for the beach pirates from tahiti and convicts from new caledonia a pretty bunch of desperadoes that even now was attacking his schooner harelip followed still spluttering and spitting his tale of the white devils doings  the riflefiring ceased as abruptly as it had begun but grief ran on perplexed by ominous conjectures until in a turn of the path he encountered mauriri running toward him from the beach  big brother the goat man panted i was too late they have taken your schooner come for now they will seek for you  he started back up the path away from the beach  where is brown grief demanded  on the big rock i will tell you afterward come now  but my men in the whaleboat  mauriri was in an agony of apprehension  they are with the women on the strange schooner they will not be killed i tell you true the devils want sailors but you they will kill listen from the water in a cracked tenor voice came a french hunting song they are landing on the beach they have taken your schoonerthat i saw come     iii  careless of his own life and skin nevertheless david grief was possessed of no false hardihood he knew when to fight and when to run and that this was the time for running he had no doubt up the path past the old men sitting in the shade past mataara crouched in the doorway of the big house he followed at the heels of mauriri at his own heels doglike plodded harelip from behind came the cries of the hunters but the pace mauriri led them was heartbreaking the broad path narrowed swung to the right and pitched upward the last grass house was left and through high thickets of cassi and swarms of great golden wasps the way rose steeply until it became a goattrack pointing upward to a bare shoulder of volcanic rock mauriri indicated the trail across its face  past that we are safe big brother he said the white devils never dare it for there are rocks we roll down on their heads and there is no other path always do they stop here and shoot when we cross the rock come  a quarter of an hour later they paused where the trail went naked on the face of the rock  wait and when you come come quickly mauriri cautioned  he sprang into the blaze of sunlight and from below several rifles pumped rapidly bullets smacked about him and puffs of stonedust flew out but he won safely across grief followed and so near did one bullet come that the dust of its impact stung his cheek nor was harelip struck though he essayed the passage more slowly  for the rest of the day on the greater heights they lay in a lava glen where terraced taro and papaia grew and here grief made his plans and learned the fulness of the situation  it was ill luck mauriri said of all nights this one night was selected by the white devils to go fishing it was dark as we came through the passage they were in boats and canoes always do they have their rifles with them one raiatea man they shot brown was very brave we tried to get by to the top of the bay but they headed us off and we were driven in between the big rock and the village we saved the guns and all the ammunition but they got the boat thus they learned of your coming brown is now on this side of the big rock with the guns and the ammunition  but why didnt he go over the top of the big rock and give me warning as i came in from the sea grief criticised  they knew not the way only the goats and i know the way and this i forgot for i crept through the bush to gain the water and swim to you but the devils were in the bush shooting at brown and the raiatea men and me they hunted till daylight and through the morning they hunted me there in the lowlying land then you came in your schooner and they watched till you went ashore and i got away through the bush but you were already ashore  you fired that shot  yes to warn you but they were wise and would not shoot back and it was my last cartridge  now you harelip grief said to the valettas cook  his tale was long and painfully detailed for a year he had been sailing out of tahiti and through the paumotus on the valetta old dupuy was owner and captain on his last cruise he had shipped two strangers in tahiti as mate and supercargo also another stranger he carried to be his agent on fanriki raoul van asveld and carl lepsius were the names of the mate and supercargo  they are brothers i know for i have heard them talk in the dark on deck when they thought no one listened harelip explained  the valetta cruised through the low islands picking up shell and pearls at dupuys stations frans amundson the third stranger relieved pierre gollard at fanriki pierre gollard came on board to go back to tahiti the natives of fanriki said he had a quart of pearls to turn over to dupuy the first night out from fanriki there was shooting in the cabin then the bodies of dupuy and pierre gollard were thrown overboard the tahitian sailors fled to the forecastle for two days with nothing to eat and the valetta hove to they remained below then raoul van asveld put poison in the meal he made harelip cook and carry forard half the sailors died  he had a rifle pointed at me master what could i do harelip whimpered of the rest two went up the rigging and were shot fanriki was ten miles away the others went overboard to swim they were shot as they swam i only lived and the two devils for me they wanted to cook for them that day with the breeze they went back to fanrika and took on frans amundson for he was one of them  then followed harelips nightmare experiences as the schooner wandered on the long reaches to the westward he was the one living witness and knew they would have killed him had he not been the cook at noumea five convicts had joined them harelip was never permitted ashore at any of the islands and grief was the first outsider to whom he had spoken  and now they will kill me harelip spluttered for they will know i have told you yet am i not all a coward and i will stay with you master and die with you  the goat man shook his head and stood up  lie here and rest he said to grief it will be a long swim tonight as for this cookman i will take him now to the higher places where my brothers live with the goats     iv  it is well that you swim as a man should big brother mauriri whispered  from the lava glen they had descended to the head of the bay and taken to the water they swam softly without splash mauriri in the lead the black walls of the crater rose about them till it seemed they swam on the bottom of a great bowl above was the sky of faintly luminous stardust ahead they could see the light which marked the rattler and from her deck softened by distance came a gospel hymn played on the phonograph intended for pilsach  the two swimmers bore to the left away from the captured schooner laughter and song followed on board after the hymn then the phonograph started again grief grinned to himself at the appositeness of it as lead kindly light floated out over the dark water  we must take the passage and land on the big rock mauriri whispered the devils are holding the low land listen  half a dozen rifle shots at irregular intervals attested that brown still held the rock and that the pirates had invested the narrow peninsula  at the end of another hour they swam under the frowning loom of the big rock mauriri feeling his way led the landing in a crevice up which for a hundred feet they climbed to a narrow ledge  stay here said mauriri i go to brown in the morning i shall return  i will go with you brother grief said  mauriri laughed in the darkness  even you big brother cannot do this thing i am the goat man and i only of all fuatino can go over the big rock in the night furthermore it will be the first time that even i have done it put out your hand you feel it that is where pilsachs dynamite is kept lie close beside the wall and you may sleep without falling i go now  and high above the sounding surf on a narrow shelf beside a ton of dynamite david grief planned his campaign then rested his cheek on his arm and slept  in the morning when mauriri led him over the summit of the big rock david grief understood why he could not have done it in the night despite the accustomed nerve of a sailor for height and precarious clinging he marvelled that he was able to do it in the broad light of day there were places always under minute direction of mauriri that he leaned forward falling across hundredfootdeep crevices until his outstretched hands struck a grip on the opposing wall and his legs could then be drawn across after once there was a tenfoot leap above half a thousand feet of yawning emptiness and down a fathoms length to a meagre foothold and he despite his cool head lost it another time on a shelf a scant twelve inches wide where all handholds seemed to fail him and mauriri seeing him sway swung his own body far out and over the gulf and passed him at the same time striking him sharply on the back to brace his reeling brain then it was and forever after that he fully knew why mauriri had been named the goat man     v  the defence of the big rock had its good points and its defects impregnable to assault two men could hold it against ten thousand also it guarded the passage to open sea the two schooners raoul van asveld and his cutthroat following were bottled up grief with the ton of dynamite which he had removed higher up the rock was master this he demonstrated one morning when the schooners attempted to put to sea the valetta led the whaleboat towing her manned by captured fuatino men grief and the goat man peered straight down from a safe rockshelter three hundred feet above their rifles were beside them also a glowing firestick and a big bundle of dynamite sticks with fuses and decanators attached as the whaleboat came beneath mauriri shook his head  they are our brothers we cannot shoot  forard on the valetta were several of griefs own raiatea sailors aft stood another at the wheel the pirates were below or on the other schooner with the exception of one who stood rifle in hand amidships for protection he held naumoo the queens daughter close to him  that is the chief devil mauriri whispered and his eyes are blue like yours he is a terrible man see he holds naumoo that we may not shoot him  a light air and a slight tide were making into the passage and the schooners progress was slow  do you speak english grief called down  the man startled half lifted his rifle to the perpendicular and looked up there was something quick and catlike in his movements and in his burned blond face a fighting eagerness it was the face of a killer  yes he answered what do you want  turn back or ill blow your schooner up grief warned he blew on the firestick and whispered tell naumoo to break away from him and run aft  from the rattler close astern rifles cracked and bullets spatted against the rock van asveld laughed defiantly and mauriri called down in the native tongue to the woman when directly beneath grief watching saw her jerk away from the man on the instant grief touched the firestick to the matchhead in the split end of the short fuse sprang into view on the face of the rock and dropped the dynamite van asveld had managed to catch the girl and was struggling with her the goat man held a rifle on him and waited a chance the dynamite struck the deck in a compact package bounded and rolled into the port scupper van asveld saw it and hesitated then he and the girl ran aft for their lives the goat man fired but splintered the corner of the galley the spattering of bullets from the rattler increased and the two on the rock crouched low for shelter and waited mauriri tried to see what was happening below but grief held him back  the fuse was too long he said ill know better next time  it was half a minute before the explosion came what happened afterward for some little time they could not tell for the rattlers marksmen had got the range and were maintaining a steady fire once fanned by a couple of bullets grief risked a peep the valetta her port deck and rail torn away was listing and sinking as she drifted back into the harbour climbing on board the rattler were the men and the huahine women who had been hidden in the valettas cabin and who had swum for it under the protecting fire the fuatino men who had been towing in the whaleboat had cast off the line dashed back through the passage and were rowing wildly for the south shore  from the shore of the peninsula the discharges of four rifles announced that brown and his men had worked through the jungle to the beach and were taking a hand the bullets ceased coming and grief and mauriri joined in with their rifles but they could do no damage for the men of the rattler were firing from the shelter of the deckhouses while the wind and tide carried the schooner farther in  there was no sign of the valetta which had sunk in the deep water of the crater  two things raoul van asveld did that showed his keenness and coolness and that elicited griefs admiration under the rattlers rifle fire raoul compelled the fleeing fuatino men to come in and surrender and at the same time dispatching half his cutthroats in the rattlers boat he threw them ashore and across the peninsula preventing brown from getting away to the main part of the island and for the rest of the morning the intermittent shooting told to grief how brown was being driven in to the other side of the big rock the situation was unchanged with the exception of the loss of the valetta     vi  the defects of the position on the big rock were vital there was neither food nor water for several nights accompanied by one of the raiatea men mauriri swam to the head of the bay for supplies then came the night when lights flared on the water and shots were fired after that the waterside of the big rock was invested as well  its a funny situation brown remarked who was getting all the adventure he had been led to believe resided in the south seas weve got hold and cant let go and raoul has hold and cant let go he cant get away and were liable to starve to death holding him  if the rain came the rockbasins would fill said mauriri it was their first twentyfour hours without water big brother tonight you and i will get water it is the work of strong men  that night with cocoanut calabashes each of quart capacity and tightly stoppered he led grief down to the water from the peninsula side of the big rock they swam out not more than a hundred feet beyond they could hear the occasional click of an oar or the knock of a paddle against a canoe and sometimes they saw the flare of matches as the men in the guarding boats lighted cigarettes or pipes  wait here whispered mauriri and hold the calabashes  turning over he swam down grief face downward watched his phosphorescent track glimmer and dim and vanish a long minute afterward mauriri broke surface noiselessly at griefs side  here drink  the calabash was full and grief drank sweet fresh water which had come up from the depths of the salt  it flows out from the land said mauriri  on the bottom  no the bottom is as far below as the mountains are above fifty feet down it flows swim down until you feel its coolness  several times filling and emptying his lungs in diver fashion grief turned over and went down through the water salt it was to his lips and warm to his flesh but at last deep down it perceptibly chilled and tasted brackish then suddenly his body entered the cold subterranean stream he removed the small stopper from the calabash and as the sweet water gurgled into it he saw the phosphorescent glimmer of a big fish like a sea ghost drift sluggishly by  thereafter holding the growing weight of the calabashes he remained on the surface while mauriri took them down one by one and filled them  there are sharks grief said as they swam back to shore  pooh was the answer they are fish sharks we of fuatino are brothers to the fish sharks  but the tiger sharks i have seen them here  when they come big brother we will have no more water to drinkunless it rains     vii  a week later mauriri and a raiatea man swam back with empty calabashes the tiger sharks had arrived in the harbour the next day they thirsted on the big rock  we must take our chance said grief tonight i shall go after water with mautau tomorrow night brother you will go with tehaa  three quarts only did grief get when the tiger sharks appeared and drove them in there were six of them on the rock and a pint a day in the sweltering heat of the midtropics is not sufficient moisture for a mans body the next night mauriri and tehaa returned with no water and the day following brown learned the full connotation of thirst when the lips crack to bleeding the mouth is coated with granular slime and the swollen tongue finds the mouth too small for residence  grief swam out in the darkness with mautau turn by turn they went down through the salt to the cool sweet stream drinking their fill while the calabashes were filling it was mautaus turn to descend with the last calabash and grief peering down from the surface saw the glimmer of seaghosts and all the phosphorescent display of the struggle he swam back alone but without relinquishing the precious burden of full calabashes  of food they had little nothing grew on the rock and its sides covered with shellfish at sea level where the surf thundered in were too precipitous for access here and there where crevices permitted a few rank shellfish and sea urchins were gleaned sometimes frigate birds and other sea birds were snared once with a piece of frigate bird they succeeded in hooking a shark after that with jealously guarded sharkmeat for bait they managed on occasion to catch more sharks  but water remained their direst need mauriri prayed to the goat god for rain taute prayed to the missionary god and his two fellow islanders backsliding invoked the deities of their old heathen days grief grinned and considered but brown wildeyed with protruding blackened tongue cursed especially he cursed the phonograph that in the cool twilights ground out gospel hymns from the deck of the rattler one hymn in particular beyond the smiling and the weeping drove him to madness it seemed a favourite on board the schooner for it was played most of all brown hungry and thirsty half out of his head from weakness and suffering could lie among the rocks with equanimity and listen to the tinkling of ukuleles and guitars and the hulas and himines of the huahine women but when the voices of the trinity choir floated over the water he was beside himself one evening the cracked tenor took up the song with the machine       beyond the smiling and the weeping         i shall be soon      beyond the waking and the sleeping      beyond the sowing and the reaping         i shall be soon         i shall be soon  then it was that brown rose up again and again blindly he emptied his rifle at the schooner laughter floated up from the men and women and from the peninsula came a splattering of return bullets but the cracked tenor sang on and brown continued to fire until the hymn was played out  it was that night that grief and mauriri came back with but one calabash of water a patch of skin six inches long was missing from griefs shoulder in token of the scrape of the sandpaper hide of a shark whose dash he had eluded      viii  in the early morning of another day before the sunblaze had gained its full strength came an offer of a parley from raoul van asveld  brown brought the word in from the outpost among the rocks a hundred yards away grief was squatted over a small fire broiling a strip of sharkflesh the last twentyfour hours had been lucky seaweed and sea urchins had been gathered tehaa had caught a shark and mauriri had captured a fairsized octopus at the base of the crevice where the dynamite was stored then too in the darkness they had made two successful swims for water before the tiger sharks had nosed them out  said hed like to come in and talk with you brown said but i know what the brute is after wants to see how near starved to death we are  bring him in grief said  and then we will kill him the goat man cried joyously  grief shook his head  but he is a killer of men big brother a beast and a devil the goat man protested  he must not be killed brother it is our way not to break our word  it is a foolish way  still it is our way grief answered gravely turning the strip of sharkmeat over on the coals and noting the hungry sniff and look of tehaa dont do that tehaa when the big devil comes look as if you and hunger were strangers here cook those sea urchins you and you big brother cook the squid we will have the big devil to feast with us spare nothing cook all  and still broiling meat grief arose as raoul van asveld followed by a large irish terrier strode into camp raoul did not make the mistake of holding out his hand  hello he said ive heard of you  i wish id never heard of you grief answered  same here was the response at first before i knew who it was i thought i had to deal with an ordinary trading captain thats why youve got me bottled up  and i am ashamed to say that i underrated you grief smiled i took you for a thieving beachcomber and not for a really intelligent pirate and murderer hence the loss of my schooner honours are even i fancy on that score  raoul flushed angrily under his sunburn but he contained himself his eyes roved over the supply of food and the full watercalabashes though he concealed the incredulous surprise he felt his was a tall slender wellknit figure and grief studying him estimated his character from his face the eyes were keen and strong but a bit too close togethernot pinched however but just a trifle near to balance the broad forehead the strong chin and jaw and the cheekbones wide apart strength his face was filled with it and yet grief sensed in it the intangible something the man lacked  we are both strong men raoul said with a bow we might have been fighting for empires a hundred years ago  it was griefs turn to bow  as it is we are squalidly scrapping over the enforcement of the colonial laws of those empires whose destinies we might possibly have determined a hundred years ago  it all comes to dust raoul remarked sententiously sitting down go ahead with your meal dont let me interrupt  wont you join us was griefs invitation  the other looked at him with sharp steadiness then accepted  im sticky with sweat he said can i wash  grief nodded and ordered mauriri to bring a calabash raoul looked into the goat mans eyes but saw nothing save languid uninterest as the precious quart of water was wasted on the ground  the dog is thirsty raoul said  grief nodded and another calabash was presented to the animal  again raoul searched the eyes of the natives and learned nothing  sorry we have no coffee grief apologized youll have to drink plain water a calabash tehaa try some of this shark there is squid to follow and sea urchins and a seaweed salad im sorry we havent any frigate bird the boys were lazy yesterday and did not try to catch any  with an appetite that would not have stopped at wire nails dipped in lard grief ate perfunctorily and tossed the scraps to the dog  im afraid i havent got down to the primitive diet yet he sighed as he sat back the tinned goods on the rattler now i could make a hearty meal off of them but this muck he took a halfpound strip of broiled shark and flung it to the dog i suppose ill come to it if you dont surrender pretty soon  raoul laughed unpleasantly  i came to offer terms he said pointedly  grief shook his head  there arent any terms ive got you where the hair is short and im not going to let go  you think you can hold me in this hole raoul cried  youll never leave it alive except in double irons grief surveyed his guest with an air of consideration ive handled your kind before weve pretty well cleaned it out of the south seas but you are ahow shall i saya sort of an anachronism youre a throwback and weve got to get rid of you personally i would advise you to go back to the schooner and blow your brains out it is the only way to escape what youve got coming to you  the parley so far as raoul was concerned proved fruitless and he went back into his own lines convinced that the men on the big rock could hold out for years though he would have been swiftly unconvinced could he have observed tehaa and the raiateans the moment his back was turned and he was out of sight crawling over the rocks and sucking and crunching the scraps his dog had left uneaten     ix  we hunger now brother grief said but it is better than to hunger for many days to come the big devil after feasting and drinking good water with us in plenty will not stay long in fuatino even tomorrow may he try to leave tonight you and i sleep over the top of the rock and tehaa who shoots well will sleep with us if he can dare the rock  tehaa alone among the raiateans was cragsman enough to venture the perilous way and dawn found him in a rockbarricaded nook a hundred yards to the right of grief and mauriri  the first warning was the firing of rifles from the peninsula where brown and his two raiateans signalled the retreat and followed the besiegers through the jungle to the beach from the eyrie on the face of the rock grief could see nothing for another hour when the rattler appeared making for the passage as before the captive fuatino men towed in the whaleboat mauriri under direction of grief called down instructions to them as they passed slowly beneath by griefs side lay several bundles of dynamite sticks welllashed together and with extremely short fuses  the deck of the rattler was populous forard rifle in hand among the raiatean sailors stood a desperado whom mauriri announced was raouls brother aft by the helmsman stood another attached to him tied waist to waist with slack was mataara the old queen on the other side of the helmsman his arm in a sling was captain glass amidships as before was raoul and with him lashed waist to waist was naumoo  good morning mister david grief raoul called up  and yet i warned you that only in double irons would you leave the island grief murmured down with a sad inflection  you cant kill all your people i have on board was the answer  the schooner moving slowly jerk by jerk as the men pulled in the whaleboat was almost directly beneath the rowers without ceasing slacked on their oars and were immediately threatened with the rifle of the man who stood forard  throw big brother naumoo called up in the fuatino tongue i am filled with sorrow and am willed to die his knife is ready with which to cut the rope but i shall hold him tight be not afraid big brother throw and throw straight and goodbye  grief hesitated then lowered the firestick which he had been blowing bright  throw the goat man urged  still grief hesitated  if they get to sea big brother naumoo dies just the same and there are all the others what is her life against the many  if you drop any dynamite or fire a single shot well kill all on board raoul cried up to them ive got you david grief you cant kill these people and i can shut up you  this last was addressed to naumoo who was calling up in her native tongue and whom raoul seized by the neck with one hand to choke to silence in turn she locked both arms about him and looked up beseechingly to grief  throw it mr grief and be damned to them captain glass rumbled in his deep voice theyre bloody murderers and the cabins full of them  the desperado who was fastened to the old queen swung half about to menace captain glass with his rifle when tehaa from his position farther along the rock pulled trigger on him the rifle dropped from the mans hand and on his face was an expression of intense surprise as his legs crumpled under him and he sank down on deck dragging the queen with him  port hard a port grief cried  captain glass and the kanaka whirled the wheel over and the bow of the rattler headed in for the rock amidships raoul still struggled with naumoo his brother ran from forard to his aid being missed by the fusillade of quick shots from tehaa and the goat man as raouls brother placed the muzzle of his rifle to naumoos side grief touched the firestick to the matchhead in the split end of the fuse even as with both hands he tossed the big bundle of dynamite the rifle went off and naumoos fall to the deck was simultaneous with the fall of the dynamite this time the fuse was short enough the explosion occurred at the instant the deck was reached and that portion of the rattler along with raoul his brother and naumoo forever disappeared  the schooners side was shattered and she began immediately to settle forard every raiatean sailor dived overboard captain glass met the first man springing up the companionway from the cabin with a kick full in the face but was overborne and trampled on by the rush following the desperadoes came the huahine women and as they went overboard the rattler sank on an even keel close to the base of the rock her crosstrees still stuck out when she reached bottom  looking down grief could see all that occurred beneath the surface he saw mataara a fathom deep unfasten herself from the dead pirate and swim upward as her head emerged she saw captain glass who could not swim sinking several yards away the queen old woman that she was but an islander turned over swam down to him and held him up as she struck out for the unsubmerged crosstrees  five heads blond and brown were mingled with the dark heads of polynesia that dotted the surface grief rifle in hand watched for a chance to shoot the goat man after a minute was successful and they saw the body of one man sink sluggishly but to the raiatean sailors big and brawny half fish was the vengeance given swimming swiftly they singled out the blond heads and the brown those from above watched the four surviving desperadoes clutched and locked dragged far down beneath and drowned like curs  in ten minutes everything was over the huahine women laughing and giggling were holding on to the sides of the whaleboat which had done the towing the raiatean sailors waiting for orders were about the crosstree to which captain glass and mataara clung  the poor old rattler captain glass lamented  nothing of the sort grief answered in a week well have her raised new timbers amidships and well be on our way and to the queen how is it with you sister  naumoo is gone and motauri brother but fuatino is ours again the day is young word shall be sent to all my people in the high places with the goats and tonight once again and as never before we shall feast and rejoice in the big house  shes been needing new timbers abaft the beam there for years quoth captain glass but the chronometers will be out of commission for the rest of the cruise     chapter fourthe jokers of new gibbon     i  im almost afraid to take you in to new gibbon david grief said it wasnt until you and the british gave me a free hand and let the place alone that any results were accomplished  wallenstein the german resident commissioner from bougainville poured himself a long scotch and soda and smiled  we take off our hats to you mr grief he said in perfectly good english what you have done on the devil island is a miracle and we shall continue not to interfere it is a devil island and old koho is the big chief devil of them all we never could bring him to terms he is a liar and he is no fool he is a black napoleon a headhunting maneating talleyrand i remember six years ago when i landed there in the british cruiser the niggers cleared out for the bush of course but we found several who couldnt get away one was his latest wife she had been hung up by one arm in the sun for two days and nights we cut her down but she died just the same and staked out in the fresh running water up to their necks were three more women all their bones were broken and their joints crushed the process is supposed to make them tender for the eating they were still alive their vitality was remarkable one woman the oldest lingered nearly ten days well that was a sample of kohos diet no wonder hes a wild beast how you ever pacified him is our everlasting puzzlement  i wouldnt call him exactly pacified grief answered though he comes in once in a while and eats out of the hand  thats more than we accomplished with our cruisers neither the german nor the english ever laid eyes on him you were the first  no mctavish was the first grief disclaimed  ah yes i remember himthe little driedup scotchman wallenstein sipped his whiskey hes called the troublemender isnt he  grief nodded  and they say the screw you pay him is bigger than mine or the british residents  im afraid it is grief admitted you see and no offence hes really worth it he spends his time wherever the trouble is he is a wizard hes the one who got me my lodgment on new gibbon hes down on malaita now starting a plantation for me  the first  theres not even a trading station on all malaita the recruiters still use covering boats and carry the old barbed wire above their rails theres the plantation now well be in in half an hour he handed the binoculars to his guest those are the boatsheds to the left of the bungalow beyond are the barracks and to the right are the coprasheds we dry quite a bit already old kohos getting civilized enough to make his people bring in the nuts theres the mouth of the stream where you found the three women softening  the wonder wingandwing was headed directly in for the anchorage she rose and fell lazily over a glassy swell flawed here and there by catspaws from astern it was the tailend of the monsoon season and the air was heavy and sticky with tropic moisture the sky a florid leaden muss of formless clouds the rugged land was swathed with cloudbanks and squall wreaths through which headlands and interior peaks thrust darkly on one promontory a slant of sunshine blazed torridly on another scarcely a mile away a squall was bursting in furious downpour of driving rain  this was the dank fat savage island of new gibbon lying fifty miles to leeward of choiseul geographically it belonged to the solomon group politically the dividing line of german and british influence cut it in half hence the joint control by the two resident commissioners in the case of new gibbon this control existed only on paper in the colonial offices of the two countries there was no real control at all and never had been the bêche de mer fishermen of the old days had passed it by the sandalwood traders after stern experiences had given it up the blackbirders had never succeeded in recruiting one labourer on the island and after the schooner dorset had been cut off with all hands they left the place severely alone later a german company had attempted a cocoanut plantation which was abandoned after several managers and a number of contract labourers had lost their heads german cruisers and british cruisers had failed to get the savage blacks to listen to reason four times the missionary societies had essayed the peaceful conquest of the island and four times between sickness and massacre they had been driven away more cruisers more pacifications had followed and followed fruitlessly the cannibals had always retreated into the bush and laughed at the screaming shells when the warships left it was an easy matter to rebuild the burned grass houses and set up the ovens in the oldfashioned way  new gibbon was a large island fully one hundred and fifty miles long and half as broad  its windward coast was ironbound without anchorages or inlets and it was inhabited by scores of warring tribesat least it had been until koho had arisen like a kamehameha and by force of arms and considerable statecraft firmly welded the greater portion of the tribes into a confederation his policy of permitting no intercourse with white men had been eminently right so far as survival of his own people was concerned and after the visit of the last cruiser he had had his own way until david grief and mctavish the troublemender landed on the deserted beach where once had stood the german bungalow and barracks and the various english missionhouses  followed wars false peaces and more wars the weazened little scotchman could make trouble as well as mend it and not content with holding the beach he imported bushmen from malaita and invaded the wildpig runs of the interior jungle he burned villages until koho wearied of rebuilding them and when he captured kohos eldest son he compelled a conference with the old chief it was then that mctavish laid down the rate of headexchange for each head of his own people he promised to take ten of kohos after koho had learned that the scotchman was a man of his word the first true peace was made in the meantime mctavish had built the bungalow and barracks cleared the jungleland along the beach and laid out the plantation after that he had gone on his way to mend trouble on the atoll of tasman where a plague of black measles had broken out and been ascribed to griefs plantation by the devildevil doctors once a year later he had been called back again to straighten up new gibbon and koho after paying a forced fine of two hundred thousand cocoanuts decided it was cheaper to keep the peace and sell the nuts also the fires of his youth had burned down he was getting old and limped of one leg where a leeenfield bullet had perforated the calf     ii  i knew a chap in hawaii grief said superintendent of a sugar plantation who used a hammer and a tenpenny nail  they were sitting on the broad bungalow veranda and watching worth the manager of new gibbon doctoring the sick squad they were new georgia boys a dozen of them and the one with the aching tooth had been put back to the last worth had just failed in his first attempt he wiped the sweat from his forehead with one hand and waved the forceps with the other  and broke more than one jaw he asserted grimly  grief shook his head wallenstein smiled and elevated his brows  he said not at any rate grief qualified he assured me furthermore that he always succeeded on the first trial  i saw it done when i was second mate on a limejuicer captain ward spoke up the old man used a caulking mallet and a steel marlinspike he took the tooth out with the first stroke too clean as a whistle  me for the forceps worth muttered grimly inserting his own pair in the mouth of the black as he pulled the man groaned and rose in the air lend a hand somebody and hold him down the manager appealed  grief and wallenstein on either side gripped the black and held him and he in turn struggled against them and clenched his teeth on the forceps the group swayed back and forth such exertion in the stagnant heat brought the sweat out on all of them the black sweated too but his was the sweat of excruciating pain the chair on which he sat was overturned captain ward paused in the act of pouring himself a drink and called encouragement worth pleaded with his assistants to hang on and hung on himself twisting the tooth till it crackled and then attempting a straightaway pull  nor did any of them notice the little black man who limped up the steps and stood looking on koho was a conservative his fathers before him had worn no clothes and neither did he not even a geestring the many empty perforations in nose and lips and ears told of decorative passions long since dead the holes on both earlobes had been torn out but their size was attested by the strips of withered flesh that hung down and swept his shoulders he cared now only for utility and in one of the half dozen minor holes in his right ear he carried a short clay pipe around his waist was buckled a cheap tradebelt and between the imitation leather and the naked skin was thrust the naked blade of a long knife suspended from the belt was his bamboo betelnut and lime box in his hand was a shortbarrelled largebore snider rifle he was indescribably filthy and here and there marred by scars the worst being the one left by the leeenfield bullet which had withered the calf to half the size of its mate his shrunken mouth showed that few teeth were left to serve him face and body were shrunken and withered but his black beadlike eyes small and close together were very bright withal they were restless and querulous and more like a monkeys than a mans  he looked on grinning like a shrewd little ape his joy in the torment of the patient was natural for the world he lived in was a world of pain he had endured his share of it and inflicted far more than his share on others when the tooth parted from its locked hold in the jaw and the forceps raked across the other teeth and out of the mouth with a nerverasping sound old kohos eyes fairly sparkled and he looked with glee at the poor black collapsed on the veranda floor and groaning terribly as he held his head in both his hands  i think hes going to faint grief said bending over the victim captain ward give him a drink please youd better take one yourself worth youre shaking like a leaf  and i think ill take one said wallenstein wiping the sweat from his face his eye caught the shadow of koho on the floor and followed it up to the old chief himself hello whos this  hello koho grief said genially though he knew better than to offer to shake hands  it was one of kohos tambos given him by the devildevil doctors when he was born that never was his flesh to come in contact with the flesh of a white man worth and captain ward of the wonder greeted koho but worth frowned at sight of the snider for it was one of his tambos that no visiting bushman should carry a weapon on the plantation rifles had a nasty way of going off at the hip under such circumstances the manager clapped his hands and a black houseboy recruited from san cristobal came running at a sign from worth he took the rifle from the visitors hand and carried it inside the bungalow  koho grief said introducing the german resident this big fella marster belong bougainvillemy word big fella marster too much  koho remembering the visits of the various german cruisers smiled with a light of unpleasant reminiscence in his eyes  dont shake hands with him wallenstein grief warned tambo you know then to koho my word you get m too much fat stop along you bime by you marry along new fella mary eh  too old fella me koho answered with a weary shake of the head me no like m mary me no like m kaikai food close up me die along altogether he stole a significant glance at worth whose head was tilted back to a long glass me like m rum  grief shook his head  tambo along black fella  he black fella no tambo koho retorted nodding toward the groaning labourer  he fella sick grief explained  me fella sick  you fella big liar grief laughed rum tambo all the time tambo now koho we have big fella talk along this big fella marster  and he and wallenstein and the old chief sat down on the veranda to confer about affairs of state koho was complimented on the peace he had kept and he with many protestations of his aged decrepitude swore peace again and everlasting then was discussed the matter of starting a german plantation twenty miles down the coast the land of course was to be bought from koho and the price was arranged in terms of tobacco knives beads pipes hatchets porpoise teeth and shellmoneyin terms of everything except rum while the talk went on koho glancing through the window could see worth mixing medicines and placing bottles back in the medicine cupboard also he saw the manager complete his labours by taking a drink of scotch koho noted the bottle carefully and though he hung about for an hour after the conference was over there was never a moment when some one or another was not in the room when grief and worth sat down to a business talk koho gave it up  me go along schooner he announced then turned and limped out  how are the mighty fallen grief laughed to think that used to be koho the fiercest redhanded murderer in the solomons who defied all his life two of the greatest world powers and now hes going aboard to try and cadge denby for a drink     iii  for the last time in his life the supercargo of the wonder perpetrated a practical joke on a native he was in the main cabin checking off the list of goods being landed in the whaleboats when koho limped down the companionway and took a seat opposite him at the table  close up me die along altogether was the burden of the old chiefs plaint all the delights of the flesh had forsaken him me no like m mary me no like m kaikai me too much sick fella me close up finish a long sad pause in which his face expressed unutterable concern for his stomach which he patted gingerly and with an assumption of pain belly belong me too much sick another pause which was an invitation to denby to make suggestions then followed a long weary final sigh and a me like m rum  denby laughed heartlessly he had been cadged for drinks before by the old cannibal and the sternest tambo grief and mctavish had laid down was the one forbidding alcohol to the natives of new gibbon  the trouble was that koho had acquired the taste in his younger days he had learned the delights of drunkenness when he cut off the schooner dorset but unfortunately he had learned it along with all his tribesmen and the supply had not held out long later when he led his naked warriors down to the destruction of the german plantation he was wiser and he appropriated all the liquors for his sole use the result had been a gorgeous mixed drunk on a dozen different sorts of drink ranging from beer doctored with quinine to absinthe and apricot brandy the drunk had lasted for months and it had left him with a thirst that would remain with him until he died predisposed toward alcohol after the way of savages all the chemistry of his flesh clamoured for it this craving was to him expressed in terms of tingling and sensation of maggots crawling warmly and deliciously in his brain of good feeling and well being and high exultation and in his barren old age when women and feasting were a weariness and when old hates had smouldered down he desired more and more the revivifying fire that came liquid out of bottlesout of all sorts of bottlesfor he remembered them well he would sit in the sun for hours occasionally drooling in mournful contemplation of the great orgy which had been his when the german plantation was cleaned out  denby was sympathetic he sought out the old chiefs symptoms and offered him dyspeptic tablets from the medicine chest pills and a varied assortment of harmless tabloids and capsules but koho steadfastly declined once when he cut the dorset off he had bitten through a capsule of quinine in addition two of his warriors had partaken of a white powder and laid down and died very violently in a very short time no he did not believe in drugs but the liquids from bottles the coolflaming youthgivers and warmglowing dreammakers no wonder the white men valued them so highly and refused to dispense them  rum he good fella he repeated over and over plaintively and with the weary patience of age  and then denby made his mistake and played his joke stepping around behind koho he unlocked the medicine closet and took out a fourounce bottle labelled essence of mustard as he made believe to draw the cork and drink of the contents in the mirror on the forard bulkhead he glimpsed koho twisted half around intently watching him denby smacked his lips and cleared his throat appreciatively as he replaced the bottle neglecting to relock the medicine closet he returned to his chair and after a decent interval went on deck he stood beside the companionway and listened after several moments the silence below was broken by a fearful wheezing propulsive strangling cough he smiled to himself and returned leisurely down the companionway the bottle was back on the shelf where it belonged and the old man sat in the same position denby marvelled at his iron control mouth and lips and tongue and all sensitive membranes were a blaze of fire he gasped and nearly coughed several times while involuntary tears brimmed in his eyes and ran down his cheeks an ordinary man would have coughed and strangled for half an hour but old kohos face was grimly composed it dawned on him that a trick had been played and into his eyes came an expression of hatred and malignancy so primitive so abysmal that it sent the chills up and down denbys spine koho arose proudly  me go along he said you sing out one fella boat stop along me     iv  having seen grief and worth start for a ride over the plantation wallenstein sat down in the big livingroom and with gunoil and old rags proceeded to take apart and clean his automatic pistol on the table beside him stood the inevitable bottle of scotch and numerous soda bottles another bottle part full chanced to stand there it was also labelled scotch but its content was liniment which worth had mixed for the horses and neglected to put away  as wallenstein worked he glanced through the window and saw koho coming up the compound path he was limping very rapidly but when he came along the veranda and entered the room his gait was slow and dignified he sat down and watched the guncleaning though mouth and lips and tongue were afire he gave no sign at the end of five minutes he spoke  rum he good fella me like m rum wallenstein smiled and shook his head and then it was that his perverse imp suggested what was to be his last joke on a native the similarity of the two bottles was the real suggestion he laid his pistol parts on the table and mixed himself a long drink standing as he did between koho and the table he interchanged the two bottles drained his glass made as if to search for something and left the room from outside he heard the surprised splutter and cough but when he returned the old chief sat as before the liniment in the bottle however was lower and it still oscillated  koho stood up clapped his hands and when the houseboy answered signed that he desired his rifle the boy fetched the weapon and according to custom preceded the visitor down the pathway not until outside the gate did the boy turn the rifle over to its owner wallenstein chuckling to himself watched the old chief limp along the beach in the direction of the river  a few minutes later as he put his pistol together wallenstein heard the distant report of a gun for the instant he thought of koho then dismissed the conjecture from his mind worth and grief had taken shotguns with them and it was probably one of their shots at a pigeon wallenstein lounged back in his chair chuckled twisted his yellow mustache and dozed he was aroused by the excited voice of worth crying out  ring the big fella bell ring plenty too much ring like hell  wallenstein gained the veranda in time to see the manager jump his horse over the low fence of the compound and dash down the beach after grief who was riding madly ahead a loud crackling and smoke rising through the cocoanut trees told the story the boathouses and the barracks were on fire the big plantation bell was ringing wildly as the german resident ran down the beach and he could see whaleboats hastily putting off from the schooner  barracks and boathouses grassthatched and like tinder were wrapped in flames grief emerged from the kitchen carrying a naked black child by the leg its head was missing  the cooks in there he told worth her heads gone too she was too heavy and i had to clear out  it was my fault wallenstein said old koho did it but i let him take a drink of worths horse liniment  i guess hes headed for the bush worth said springing astride his horse and starting oliver is down there by the river hope he didnt get him  the manager galloped away through the trees a few minutes later as the charred wreck of the barracks crashed in they heard him calling and followed on the edge of the river bank they came upon him he still sat on his horse very whitefaced and gazed at something on the ground it was the body of oliver the young assistant manager though it was hard to realize it for the head was gone the black labourers breathless from their run in from the fields were now crowding around and under conches tonight and the wardrums all merry hell will break loose they wont rush us but keep all the boys close up to the house mr worth come on  as they returned along the path they came upon a black who whimpered and cried vociferously  shut up mouth belong you worth shouted what name you make m noise  him fella koho finish along two fella bullamacow the black answered drawing a forefinger significantly across his throat  hes knifed the cows grief said that means no more milk for some time for you worth ill see about sending a couple up from ugi  wallenstein proved inconsolable until denby coming ashore confessed to the dose of essence of mustard thereat the german resident became even cheerful though he twisted his yellow mustache up more fiercely and continued to curse the solomons with oaths culled from four languages  next morning visible from the masthead of the wonder the bush was alive with signalsmokes from promontory to promontory and back through the solid jungle the smokepillars curled and puffed and talked remote villages on the higher peaks beyond the farthest raids mctavish had ever driven joined in the troubled conversation from across the river persisted a bedlam of conches while from everywhere drifting for miles along the quiet air came the deep booming reverberations of the great wardrumshuge tree trunks hollowed by fire and carved with tools of stone and shell youre all right as long as you stay close grief told his manager ive got to get along to guvutu they wont come out in the open and attack you keep the workgangs close stop the clearing till this blows over theyll get any detached gangs you send out and whatever you do dont be fooled into going into the bush after koho if you do hell get you all youve got to do is wait for mctavish ill send him up with a bunch of his malaita bushmen hes the only man who can go inside also until he comes ill leave denby with you you dont mind do you mr denby ill send mctavish up with the wanda and you can go back on her and rejoin the wonder captain ward can manage without you for a trip  it was just what i was going to volunteer denby answered i never dreamed all this muss would be kicked up over a joke you see in a way i consider myself responsible for it  so am i responsible wallenstein broke in  but i started it the supercargo urged  maybe you did but i carried it along  and koho finished it grief said  at any rate i too shall remain said the german  i thought you were coming to guvutu with me grief protested  i was but this is my jurisdiction partly and i have made a fool of myself in it completely i shall remain and help get things straight again  at guvutu grief sent full instructions to mctavish by a recruiting ketch which was just starting for malaita captain ward sailed in the wonder for the santa cruz islands and grief borrowing a whaleboat and a crew of black prisoners from the british resident crossed the channel to guadalcanar to examine the grass lands back of penduffryn  three weeks later with a free sheet and a lusty breeze he threaded the coral patches and surged up the smooth water to guvutu anchorage the harbour was deserted save for a small ketch which lay close in to the shore reef grief recognized it as the wanda she had evidently just got in by the tulagi passage for her black crew was still at work furling the sails as he rounded alongside mctavish himself extended a hand to help him over the rail  whats the matter grief asked havent you started yet  mctavish nodded and got back everythings all right on board  hows new gibbon  all there the last i saw of it barrin a few inconsequential frills that a good eye could make out lacking from the landscape  he was a cold flame of a man small as koho and as dried up with a mahogany complexion and small expressionless blue eyes that were more like gimletpoints than the eyes of a scotchman without fear without enthusiasm impervious to disease and climate and sentiment he was lean and bitter and deadly as a snake that his present sour look boded ill news grief was well aware  spit it out he said whats happened  tis a thing severely to be condemned a damned shame this joking with heathen niggers was the reply also tis very expensive come below mr grief youll be better for the information with a long glass in your hand after you  how did you settle things his employer demanded as soon as they were seated in the cabin  the little scotchman shook his head there was nothing to settle it all depends how you look at it the other way would be to say it was settled entirely settled mind you before i got there  but the plantation man the plantation  no plantation all the years of our work have gone for naught tis back where we started where the missionaries started where the germans startedand where they finished not a stone stands on another at the landing pier the houses are black ashes every tree is hacked down and the wild pigs are rooting out the yams and sweet potatoes those boys from new georgia a fine bunch they were five score of them and they cost you a pretty penny not one is left to tell the tale  he paused and began fumbling in a large locker under the companionsteps  but worth and denby and wallenstein  thats what im telling you take a look  mctavish dragged out a sack made of rice matting and emptied its contents on the floor david grief pulled himself together with a jerk for he found himself gazing fascinated at the heads of the three men he had left at new gibbon the yellow mustache of wallenstein had lost its fierce curl and drooped and wilted on the upper lip  i dont know how it happened the scotchmans voice went on drearily but i surmise they went into the bush after the old devil  and where is koho grief asked  back in the bush and drunk as a lord thats how i was able to recover the heads he was too drunk to stand they lugged him on their backs out of the village when i rushed it and if youll relieve me of the heads ill be well obliged he paused and sighed i suppose theyll have regular funerals over them and put them in the ground but in my way of thinking theyd make excellent curios any respectable museum would pay a hundred quid apiece better have another drink youre looking a bit pale there put that down you and if youll take my advice mr grief i would say set your face sternly against any joking with the niggers it always makes trouble and it is a very expensive divertisement      chapter fivea little account with swithin hall     i  with a last long scrutiny at the unbroken circle of the sea david grief swung out of the crosstrees and slowly and dejectedly descended the ratlines to the deck  leuleu atoll is sunk mr snow he said to the anxiousfaced young mate if there is anything in navigation the atoll is surely under the sea for weve sailed clear over it twiceor the spot where it ought to be its either that or the chronometers gone wrong or ive forgotten my navigation  it must be the chronometer sir the mate reassured his owner you know i made separate sights and worked them up and that they agreed with yours  yes grief muttered nodding glumly and where your summer lines crossed and mine too was the dead centre of leuleu atoll it must be the chronometerslipped a cog or something  he made a short pace to the rail and back and cast a troubled eye at the uncle tobys wake the schooner with a fairly strong breeze on her quarter was logging nine or ten knots  better bring her up on the wind mr snow put her under easy sail and let her work to windward on twohour legs its thickening up and i dont imagine we can get a star observation tonight so well just hold our weather position get a latitude sight tomorrow and run leuleu down on her own latitude thats the way all the old navigators did  broad of beam heavily sparred with high freeboard and bluff dutchy bow the uncle toby was the slowest tubbiest safest and most foolproof schooner david grief possessed her run was in the banks and santa cruz groups and to the northwest among the several isolated atolls where his native traders collected copra hawksbill turtle and an occasional ton of pearl shell finding the skipper down with a particularly bad stroke of fever grief had relieved him and taken the uncle toby on her semiannual run to the atolls he had elected to make his first call at leuleu which lay farthest and now found himself lost at sea with a chronometer that played tricks     ii  no stars showed that night nor was the sun visible next day a stuffy sticky calm obtained broken by big windsqualls and heavy downpours from fear of working too far to windward the uncle toby was hove to and four days and nights of cloudhidden sky followed never did the sun appear and on the several occasions that stars broke through they were too dim and fleeting for identification by this time it was patent to the veriest tyro that the elements were preparing to break loose grief coming on deck from consulting the barometer which steadfastly remained at 2990 encountered jackiejackie whose face was as brooding and troublous as the sky and air jackiejackie a tongan sailor of experience served as a sort of bosun and semisecond mate over the mixed kanaka crew  big weather he come i think he said i see him just the same before maybe five six times  grief nodded hurricane weather all right jackiejackie pretty soon barometer go downbottom fall out  sure the tongan concurred he goin to blow like hell  ten minutes later snow came on deck  shes started he said 2985 going down and pumping at the same time its stinking hotdont you notice it he brushed his forehead with his hands its sickening i could lose my breakfast without trying  jackiejackie grinned just the same me everything inside walk about always this way before big blow but uncle toby all right he go through anything  better rig that stormtrysail on the main and a stormjib grief said to the mate and put all the reefs into the working canvas before you furl down no telling what we may need put on double gaskets while youre about it  in another hour the sultry oppressiveness steadily increasing and the stark calm still continuing the barometer had fallen to 2970 the mate being young lacked the patience of waiting for the portentous he ceased his restless pacing and waved his arms  if shes going to come let her come he cried theres no use shillyshallying this way whatever the worst is let us know it and have it a pretty picklelost with a crazy chronometer and a hurricane that wont blow  the cloudmussed sky turned to a vague copper colour and seemed to glow as the inside of a huge heated caldron nobody remained below the native sailors formed in anxious groups amidships and forard where they talked in low voices and gazed apprehensively at the ominous sky and the equally ominous sea that breathed in long low oily undulations  looks like petroleum mixed with castor oil the mate grumbled as he spat his disgust overside my mother used to dose me with messes like that when i was a kid lord shes getting black  the lurid coppery glow had vanished and the sky thickened and lowered until the darkness was as that of a late twilight david grief who well knew the hurricane rules nevertheless reread the laws of storms screwing his eyes in the faint light in order to see the print there was nothing to be done save wait for the wind so that he might know how he lay in relation to the fastflying and deadly centre that from somewhere was approaching out of the gloom  it was three in the afternoon and the glass had sunk to 2945 when the wind came they could see it on the water darkening the face of the sea crisping tiny whitecaps as it rushed along it was merely a stiff breeze and the uncle toby filling away under her storm canvas till the wind was abeam sloshed along at a fourknot gait  no weight to that snow sneered and after such grand preparation  pickaninny wind jackiejackie agreed he grow big man pretty quick you see  grief ordered the foresail put on retaining the reefs and the uncle toby mended her pace in the rising breeze the wind quickly grew to mans size but did not stop there it merely blew hard and harder and kept on blowing harder advertising each increase by lulls followed by fierce freshening gusts ever it grew until the uncle tobys rail was more often pressed under than not while her waist boiled with foaming water which the scuppers could not carry off grief studied the barometer still steadily falling  the centre is to the southward he told snow and were running across its path and into it now well turn about and run the other way that ought to bring the glass up take in the foresailits more than she can carry alreadyand stand by to wear her around  the maneuver was accomplished and through the gloom that was almost that of the first darkness of evening the uncle toby turned and raced madly north across the face of the storm  its nip and tuck grief confided to the mate a couple of hours later the storms swinging a big curvetheres no calculating that curveand we may win across or the centre may catch us thank the lord the glass is holding its own it all depends on how big the curve is the seas too big for us to keep on heave her to shell keep working along out anyway  i thought i knew what wind was snow shouted in his owners ear next morning this isnt wind its something unthinkable its impossible it must reach ninety or a hundred miles an hour in the gusts that dont mean anything how could i ever tell it to anybody i couldnt and look at that sea ive run my easting down but i never saw anything like that  day had come and the sun should have been up an hour yet the best it could produce was a sombre semitwilight the ocean was a stately procession of moving mountains a third of a mile across yawned the valleys between the great waves their long slopes shielded somewhat from the full fury of the wind were broken by systems of smaller whitecapping waves but from the high crests of the big waves themselves the wind tore the whitecaps in the forming this spume drove masthead high and higher horizontally above the surface of the sea  were through the worst was griefs judgment the glass is coming along all the time the sea will get bigger as the wind eases down im going to turn in watch for shifts in the wind theyll be sure to come call me at eight bells  by midafternoon in a huge sea with the wind after its last shift no more than a stiff breeze the tongan bosun sighted a schooner bottom up the uncle tobys drift took them across the bow and they could not make out the name but before night they picked up with a small roundbottom doubleender boat swamped but with white lettering visible on its bow through the binoculars gray made out emily l no 3  a sealing schooner grief said but what a sealers doing in these waters is beyond me  treasurehunters maybe snow speculated the sophie sutherland and the herman were sealers you remember chartered out of san francisco by the chaps with the maps who can always go right to the spot until they get there and dont     iii  after a giddy night of grand and lofty tumbling in which over a big and dying sea without a breath of wind to steady her the uncle toby rolled every person on board sick of soul a light breeze sprang up and the reefs were shaken out by midday on a smooth ocean floor the clouds thinned and cleared and sights of the sun were obtained two degrees and fifteen minutes south the observation gave them with a broken chronometer longitude was out of the question  were anywhere within five hundred and a thousand miles along that latitude line grief remarked as he and the mate bent over the chart  leuleu is to the southard somewhere and this section of ocean is all blank there is neither an island nor a reef by which we can regulate the chronometer the only thing to do  land ho skipper the tongan called down the companionway  grief took a quick glance at the empty blank of the chart whistled his surprise and sank back feebly in a chair  it gets me he said there cant be land around here we never drifted or ran like that the whole voyage has been crazy will you kindly go up mr snow and see whats ailing jackie  its land all right the mate called down a minute afterward you can see it from the decktops of cocoanutsan atoll of some sort maybe its leuleu after all  grief shook his head positively as he gazed at the fringe of palms only the tops visible apparently rising out of the sea  haul up on the wind mr snow closeandby and well take a look we can just reach past to the south and if it spreads off in that direction well hit the southwest corner  very near must palms be to be seen from the low deck of a schooner and slowly as the uncle toby sailed she quickly raised the low land above the sea while more palms increased the definition of the atoll circle  shes a beauty the mate remarked a perfect circle looks as if it might be eight or nine miles across wonder if theres an entrance to the lagoon who knows maybe its a brand new find  they coasted up the west side of the atoll making short tacks in to the surfpounded coral rock and out again from the masthead across the palmfringe a kanaka announced the lagoon and a small island in the middle  i know what youre thinking grief said to his mate  snow who had been muttering and shaking his head looked up with quick and challenging incredulity  youre thinking the entrance will be on the northwest grief went on as if reciting  two cable lengths wide marked on the north by three separated cocoanuts and on the south by pandanus trees eight miles in diameter a perfect circle with an island in the dead centre  i was thinking that snow acknowledged  and theres the entrance opening up just where it ought to be  and the three palms snow almost whispered and the pandanus trees if theres a windmill on the island its itswithin halls island but it cant be everybodys been looking for it for the last ten years  hall played you a dirty trick once didnt he grief queried  snow nodded thats why im working for you he broke me flat it was downright robbery i bought the wreck of the cascade down in sydney out of a first instalment of a legacy from home  she went on christmas island didnt she  yes full tilt high and dry in the night they saved the passengers and mails then i bought a little island schooner which took the rest of my money and i had to wait the final payment by the executors to fit her out what did swithin hall dohe was at honolulu at the timebut make a straightaway run for christmas island neither right nor title did he have when i got there the hull and engines were all that was left of the cascade she had had a fair shipment of silk on board too and it wasnt even damaged i got it afterward pretty straight from his supercargo he cleared something like sixty thousand dollars  snow shrugged his shoulders and gazed bleakly at the smooth surface of the lagoon where tiny wavelets danced in the afternoon sun  the wreck was mine i bought her at public auction id gambled big and id lost when i got back to sydney the crew and some of the tradesmen whod extended me credit libelled the schooner i pawned my watch and sextant and shovelled coal one spell and finally got a billet in the new hebrides on a screw of eight pounds a month then i tried my luck as independent trader went broke took a mates billet on a recruiter down to tanna and over to fiji got a job as overseer on a german plantation back of apia and finally settled down on the uncle toby  have you ever met swithin hall  snow shook his head  well youre likely to meet him now theres the windmill  in the centre of the lagoon as they emerged from the passage they opened a small densely wooded island among the trees of which a large dutch windmill showed plainly  nobody at home from the looks of it grief said or you might have a chance to collect  the mates face set vindictively and his fists clenched  cant touch him legally hes got too much money now but i can take sixty thousand dollars worth out of his hide i hope he is at home  then i hope he is too grief said with an appreciative smile you got the description of his island from bauoti i suppose  yes as pretty well everybody else has the trouble is that bauoti cant give latitude or longitude says they sailed a long way from the gilbertsthats all he knows i wonder what became of him  i saw him a year ago on the beach at tahiti said he was thinking about shipping for a cruise through the paumotus well here we are getting close in heave the lead jackiejackie stand by to let go mr snow according to bauoti anchorage three hundred yards off the west shore in nine fathoms coral patches to the southeast there are the patches what do you get jackie  nine fadom  let go mr snow  the uncle toby swung to her chain headsails ran down and the kanaka crew sprang to fore and mainhalyards and sheets     iv  the whaleboat laid alongside the small coralstone landingpier and david grief and his mate stepped ashore  youd think the place deserted grief said as they walked up a sanded path to the bungalow but i smell a smell that ive often smelled something doing or my nose is a liar the lagoon is carpeted with shell theyre rotting the meat out not a thousand miles away get that whiff  like no bungalow in the tropics was this bungalow of swithin hall of mission architecture when they had entered through the unlatched screen door they found decoration and furniture of the same mission style the floor of the big livingroom was covered with the finest samoan mats there were couches window seats cozy corners and a billiard table a sewing table and a sewingbasket spilling over with sheer linen in the french embroidery of which stuck a needle tokened a womans presence by screen and veranda the blinding sunshine was subdued to a cool dim radiance the sheen of pearl pushbuttons caught griefs eye  storage batteries by george run by the windmill he exclaimed as he pressed the buttons and concealed lighting  hidden bowls glowed and the room was filled with diffused golden light many shelves of books lined the walls grief fell to running over their titles a fairly wellread man himself for a seaadventurer he glimpsed a wideness of range and catholicity of taste that were beyond him old friends he met and others that he had heard of but never read there were complete sets of tolstoy turgenieff and gorky of cooper and mark twain of hugo and zola and sue and of flaubert de maupassant and paul de koch he glanced curiously at the pages of metchnikoff weininger and schopenhauer and wonderingly at those of ellis lydston krafftebbing and forel woodruffs expansion of races was in his hands when snow returned from further exploration of the house  enamelled bathtub separate room for a shower and a sitzbath he exclaimed fitted up for a king and i reckon some of my money went to pay for it the place must be occupied i found freshopened butter and milk tins in the pantry and fresh turtlemeat hanging up im going to see what else i can find  grief too departed through a door that led out of the opposite end of the livingroom he found himself in a selfevident womans bedroom across it he peered through a wiremesh door into a screened and darkened sleeping porch on a couch lay a woman asleep in the soft light she seemed remarkably beautiful in a dark spanish way by her side opened and face downward a novel lay on a chair from the colour in her cheeks grief concluded that she had not been long in the tropics after the one glimpse he stole softly back in time to see snow entering the livingroom through the other door by the naked arm he was clutching an agewrinkled black who grinned in fear and made signs of dumbness  i found him snoozing in a little kennel out back the mate said hes the cook i suppose cant get a word out of him what did you find  a sleeping princess ssh theres somebody now  if its hall snow muttered clenching his fist  grief shook his head no roughhouse theres a woman here and if it is hall before we go ill maneuver a chance for you to get action  the door opened and a large heavily built man entered in his belt was a heavy longbarrelled colts one quick anxious look he gave them then his face wreathed in a genial smile and his hand was extended  welcome strangers but if you dont mind my asking how by all thats sacred did you ever manage to find my island  because we were out of our course grief answered shaking hands  my names hall swithin hall the other said turning to shake snows hand and i dont mind telling you that youre the first visitors ive ever had  and this is your secret island thats had all the beaches talking for years grief answered well i know the formula now for finding it  hows that hall asked quickly  smash your chronometer get mixed up with a hurricane and then keep your eyes open for cocoanuts rising out of the sea  and what is your name hall asked after he had laughed perfunctorily  ansteyphil anstey grief answered promptly bound on the uncle toby from the gilberts to new guinea and trying to find my longitude this is my mate mr gray a better navigator than i but who has lost his goat just the same to the chronometer  grief did not know his reason for lying but he had felt the prompting and succumbed to it he vaguely divined that something was wrong but could not place his finger on it swithin hall was a fat roundfaced man with a laughing lip and laughterwrinkles in the corners of his eyes but grief in his early youth had learned how deceptive this type could prove as well as the deceptiveness of blue eyes that screened the surface with fun and hid what went on behind  what are you doing with my cooklost yours and trying to shanghai him hall was saying youd better let him go if youre going to have any supper my wifes here and shell be glad to meet youdinner she calls it and calls me down for misnaming it but im old fashioned my folks always ate dinner in the middle of the day cant get over early training dont you want to wash up i do look at me ive been working like a dogout with the diving crewshell you know but of course you smelt it     v  snow pleaded charge of the schooner and went on board in addition to his repugnance at breaking salt with the man who had robbed him it was necessary for him to impress the inviolableness of griefs lies on the kanaka crew by eleven oclock grief came on board to find his mate waiting up for him  theres something doing on swithin halls island grief said shaking his head i cant make out what it is but i get the feel of it what does swithin hall look like  snow shook his head  that man ashore there never bought the books on the shelves grief declared with conviction nor did he ever go in for concealed lighting hes got a surface flow of suavity but hes rough as a hoofrasp underneath hes an oily bluff and the bunch hes got with himwatson and gorman their names are they came in after you leftreal seadogs middleaged marred and battered tough as rusty wroughtiron nails and twice as dangerous real ugly customers with guns in their belts who dont strike me as just the right sort to be on such comradely terms with swithin hall and the woman shes a lady i mean it she knows a whole lot of south america and of china too im sure shes spanish though her english is natural shes travelled we talked bullfights shes seen them in guayaquil in mexico in seville she knows a lot about sealskins  now heres what bothers me she knows music i asked her if she played and hes fixed that place up like a palace that being so why hasnt he a piano for her another thing shes quick and lively and he watches her whenever she talks hes on pins and needles and continually breaking in and leading the conversation say did you ever hear that swithin hall was married  bless me i dont know the mate replied never entered my head to think about it  he introduced her as mrs hall and watson and gorman call him hall theyre a precious pair those two men i dont understand it at all  what are you going to do about it snow asked  oh hang around a while there are some books ashore there i want to read suppose you send that topmast down in the morning and generally overhaul weve been through a hurricane you know set up the rigging while youre about it get things pretty well adrift and take your time     vi  the next day griefs suspicions found further food ashore early he strolled across the little island to the barracks occupied by the divers  they were just boarding the boats when he arrived and it struck him that for kanakas they behaved more like chaingang prisoners the three white men were there and grief noted that each carried a rifle hall greeted him jovially enough but gorman and watson scowled as they grunted curt good mornings  a moment afterward one of the kanakas as he bent to place his oar favoured grief with a slow deliberate wink the mans face was familiar one of the thousands of native sailors and divers he had encountered drifting about in the island trade  dont tell them who i am grief said in tahitian did you ever sail for me  the mans head nodded and his mouth opened but before he could speak he was suppressed by a savage shut up from watson who was already in the sternsheets  i beg pardon grief said i ought to have known better  thats all right hall interposed the trouble is theyre too much talk and not enough work have to be severe with them or they wouldnt get enough shell to pay their grub  grief nodded sympathetically i know them got a crew of them myselfthe lazy swine got to drive them like niggers to get a halfdays work out of them  what was you sayin to him gorman blurted in bluntly  i was asking how the shell was and how deep they were diving  thick hall took over the answering were working now in about ten fathom its right out there not a hundred yards off want to come along  half the day grief spent with the boats and had lunch in the bungalow in the afternoon he loafed taking a siesta in the big livingroom reading some and talking for half an hour with mrs hall after dinner he played billiards with her husband it chanced that grief had never before encountered swithin hall yet the latters fame as an expert at billiards was the talk of the beaches from levuka to honolulu but the man grief played with this night proved most indifferent at the game his wife showed herself far cleverer with the cue  when he went on board the uncle toby grief routed jackiejackie out of bed he described the location of the barracks and told the tongan to swim softly around and have talk with the kanakas in two hours jackiejackie was back he shook his head as he stood dripping before grief  very funny ting he reported one white man stop all the time he has big rifle he lay in water and watch maybe twelve oclock other white man come and take rifle first white man go to bed other man stop now with rifle no good me cannot talk with kanakas me come back  by george grief said to snow after the tongan had gone back to his bunk i smell something more than shell those three men are standing watches over their kanakas that mans no more swithin hall than i am  snow whistled from the impact of a new idea  ive got it he cried  and ill name it grief retorted its in your mind that the emily l was their schooner  just that theyre raising and rotting the shell while shes gone for more divers or provisions or both  and i agree with you grief glanced at the cabin clock and evinced signs of bedgoing hes a sailor the three of them are but theyre not island men theyre new in these waters  again snow whistled  and the emily l is lost with all hands he said we know that theyre marooned here till swithin hall comes then hell catch them with all the shell  or theyll take possession of his schooner  hope they do snow muttered vindictively somebody ought to rob him wish i was in their boots id balance off that sixty thousand     vii  a week passed during which time the uncle toby was ready for sea while grief managed to allay any suspicion of him by the shore crowd  even gorman and watson accepted him at his selfdescription throughout the week grief begged and badgered them for the longitude of the island  you wouldnt have me leave here lost he finally urged i cant get a line on my chronometer without your longitude  hall laughingly refused  youre too good a navigator mr anstey not to fetch new guinea or some other high land  and youre too good a navigator mr hall grief replied not to know that i can fetch your island any time by running down its latitude  on the last evening ashore as usual to dinner grief got his first view of the pearls they had collected mrs hall waxing enthusiastic had asked her husband to bring forth the pretties and had spent half an hour showing them to grief his delight in them was genuine as well as was his surprise that they had made so rich a haul  the lagoon is virgin hall explained you saw yourself that most of the shell is large and old but its funny that we got most of the valuable pearls in one small patch in the course of a week it was a little treasure house every oyster seemed filledseed pearls by the quart of course but the perfect ones most of that bunch there came out of the small patch  grief ran his eye over them and knew their value ranged from one hundred to a thousand dollars each while the several selected large ones went far beyond  oh the pretties the pretties mrs hall cried bending forward suddenly and kissing them  a few minutes later she arose to say goodnight  its goodbye grief said as he took her hand we sail at daylight  so suddenly she cried while grief could not help seeing the quick light of satisfaction in her husbands eyes  yes grief continued all the repairs are finished i cant get the longitude of your island out of your husband though im still in hopes hell relent  hall laughed and shook his head and as his wife left the room proposed a last farewell nightcap they sat over it smoking and talking  what do you estimate theyre worth grief asked indicating the spread of pearls on the table i mean what the pearlbuyers would give you in open market  oh seventyfive or eighty thousand hall said carelessly  im afraid youre underestimating i know pearls a bit take that biggest one its perfect not a cent less than five thousand dollars some multimillionaire will pay double that some day when the dealers have taken their whack and never minding the seed pearls youve got quarts of baroques there and baroques are coming into fashion theyre picking up and doubling on themselves every year  hall gave the trove of pearls a closer and longer scrutiny estimating the different parcels and adding the sum aloud  youre right he admitted theyre worth a hundred thousand right now  and at what do you figure your working expenses grief went on your time and your two mens and the divers  five thousand would cover it  then they stand to net you ninetyfive thousand  something like that but why so curious  why i was just trying grief paused and drained his glass just trying to reach some sort of an equitable arrangement suppose i should give you and your people a passage to sydney and the five thousand dollarsor better seven thousand five hundred youve worked hard  without commotion or muscular movement the other man became alert and tense his roundfaced geniality went out like the flame of a snuffed candle no laughter clouded the surface of the eyes and in their depths showed the hard dangerous soul of the man he spoke in a low deliberate voice  now just what in hell do you mean by that  grief casually relighted his cigar  i dont know just how to begin he said the situation iseris embarrassing for you you see im trying to be fair as i say youve worked hard i dont want to confiscate the pearls i want to pay you for your time and trouble and expense  conviction instantaneous and absolute froze on the others face  and i thought you were in europe he muttered hope flickered for a moment look here youre joking me how do i know youre swithin hall  grief shrugged his shoulders such a joke would be in poor taste after your hospitality and it is equally in poor taste to have two swithin halls on the island  since youre swithin hall then who the deuce am i do you know that too  no grief answered airily but id like to know  well its none of your business  i grant it your identity is beside the point besides i know your schooner and i can find out who you are from that  whats her name  the emily l  correct im captain raffy owner and master  the sealpoacher ive heard of you what under the sun brought you down here on my preserves  needed the money the seal herds are about finished  and the outoftheway places of the world are better policed eh  pretty close to it and now about this present scrape mr hall i can put up a nasty fight what are you going to do about it  what i said even better whats the emily l worth  shes seen her day not above ten thousand which would be robbery every time shes in a rough sea im afraid shell jump her ballast through her planking  she has jumped it captain raffy i sighted her bottomup after the blow suppose we say she was worth seven thousand five hundred ill pay over to you fifteen thousand and give you a passage dont move your hands from your lap grief stood up went over to him and took his revolver just a necessary precaution captain now youll go on board with me ill break the news to mrs raffy afterward and fetch her out to join you  youre behaving handsomely mr hall i must say captain raffy volunteered as the whaleboat came alongside the uncle toby but watch out for gorman and watson theyre ugly customers and by the way i dont like to mention it but youve seen my wife ive given her four or five pearls watson and gorman were willing  say no more captain say no more they shall remain hers is that you mr snow heres a friend i want you to take charge ofcaptain raffy im going ashore for his wife     viii  david grief sat writing at the library table in the bungalow livingroom outside the first pale of dawn was showing he had had a busy night mrs raffy had taken two hysterical hours to pack her and captain raffys possessions gorman had been caught asleep but watson standing guard over the divers had shown fight matters did not reach the shooting stage but it was only after it had been demonstrated to him that the game was up that he consented to join his companions on board for temporary convenience he and gorman were shackled in the mates room mrs raffy was confined in griefs and captain raffy made fast to the cabin table  grief finished the document and read over what he had written    to

picked up the bundle of books carefully latched the front door and went down to the waiting whaleboat     chapter sixa goboto night     i  at goboto the traders come off their schooners and the planters drift in from far wild coasts and one and all they assume shoes white duck trousers and various other appearances of civilization at goboto mail is received bills are paid and newspapers rarely more than five weeks old are accessible for the little island belted with its coral reefs affords safe anchorage is the steamer port of call and serves as the distributing point for the whole widescattered group  life at goboto is heated unhealthy and lurid and for its size it asserts the distinction of more cases of acute alcoholism than any other spot in the world guvutu over in the solomons claims that it drinks between drinks goboto does not deny this it merely states in passing that in the goboton chronology no such interval of time is known it also points out its import statistics which show a far larger per capita consumption of spiritous liquors guvutu explains this on the basis that goboto does a larger business and has more visitors goboto retorts that its resident population is smaller and that its visitors are thirstier and the discussion goes on interminably principally because of the fact that the disputants do not live long enough to settle it  goboto is not large the island is only a quarter of a mile in diameter and on it are situated an admiralty coalshed where a few tons of coal have lain untouched for twenty years the barracks for a handful of black labourers a big store and warehouse with sheetiron roofs and a bungalow inhabited by the manager and his two clerks they are the white population an average of one man out of the three is always to be found down with fever the job at goboto is a hard one it is the policy of the company to treat its patrons well as invading companies have found out and it is the task of the manager and clerks to do the treating throughout the year traders and recruiters arrive from far dry cruises and planters from equally distant and dry shores bringing with them magnificent thirsts goboto is the mecca of sprees and when they have spread they go back to their schooners and plantations to recuperate  some of the less hardy require as much as six months between visits but for the manager and his assistants there are no such intervals they are on the spot and week by week blown in by monsoon or southeast trade the schooners come to anchor cargod with copra ivory nuts pearlshell hawksbill turtle and thirst  it is a very hard job at goboto that is why the pay is twice that on other stations and that is why the company selects only courageous and intrepid men for this particular station they last no more than a year or so when the wreckage of them is shipped back to australia or the remains of them are buried in the sand across on the windward side of the islet johnny bassett almost the legendary hero of goboto broke all records he was a remittance man with a remarkable constitution and he lasted seven years his dying request was duly observed by his clerks who pickled him in a cask of traderum paid for out of their own salaries and shipped him back to his people in england nevertheless at goboto they tried to be gentlemen for that matter though something was wrong with them they were gentlemen and had been gentlemen that was why the great unwritten rule of goboto was that visitors should put on pants and shoes breechclouts lavalavas and bare legs were not tolerated when captain jensen the wildest of the blackbirders though descended from old new york knickerbocker stock surged in clad in loincloth undershirt two belted revolvers and a sheathknife he was stopped at the beach this was in the days of johnny bassett ever a stickler in matters of etiquette captain jensen stood up in the sternsheets of his whaleboat and denied the existence of pants on his schooner also he affirmed his intention of coming ashore they of goboto nursed him back to health from a bullethole through his shoulder and in addition handsomely begged his pardon for no pants had they found on his schooner and finally on the first day he sat up johnny bassett kindly but firmly assisted his guest into a pair of pants of his own this was the great precedent in all the succeeding years it had never been violated white men and pants were undivorceable only niggers ran naked pants constituted caste     ii  on this night things were with one exception in nowise different from any other night seven of them with glimmering eyes and steady legs had capped a day of scotch with swivelsticked cocktails and sat down to dinner jacketed trousered and shod they were jerry mcmurtrey the manager eddy little and jack andrews clerks captain stapler of the recruiting ketch merry darby shryleton planter from titoito peter gee a halfcaste chinese pearlbuyer who ranged from ceylon to the paumotus and alfred deacon a visitor who had stopped off from the last steamer at first wine was served by the black servants to those that drank it though all quickly shifted back to scotch and soda pickling their food as they ate it ere it went into their calcined pickled stomachs  over their coffee they heard the rumble of an anchorchain through a hawsepipe tokening the arrival of a vessel  its david grief peter gee remarked  how do you know deacon demanded truculently and then went on to deny the halfcastes knowledge you chaps put on a lot of side over a new chum ive done some sailing myself and this naming a craft when its sail is only a blur or naming a man by the sound of his anchoritsits unadulterated poppycock  peter gee was engaged in lighting a cigarette and did not answer  some of the niggers do amazing things that way mcmurtrey interposed tactfully  as with the others this conduct of their visitor jarred on the manager from the moment of peter gees arrival that afternoon deacon had manifested a tendency to pick on him he had disputed his statements and been generally rude  maybe its because peters got chink blood in him had been andrews hypothesis deacons australian you know and theyre daffy down there on colour  i fancy thats it mcmurtrey had agreed but we cant permit any bullying especially of a man like peter gee whos whiter than most white men  in this the manager had been in nowise wrong peter gee was that rare creature a good as well as clever eurasian in fact it was the stolid integrity of the chinese blood that toned the recklessness and licentiousness of the english blood which had run in his fathers veins also he was better educated than any man there spoke better english as well as several other tongues and knew and lived more of their own ideals of gentlemanness than they did themselves and finally he was a gentle soul violence he deprecated though he had killed men in his time turbulence he abhorred  he always avoided it as he would the plague  captain stapler stepped in to help mcmurtrey  i remember when i changed schooners and came into altman the niggers knew right off the bat it was me i wasnt expected either much less to be in another craft they told the trader it was me he used the glasses and wouldnt believe them but they did know told me afterward they could see it sticking out all over the schooner that i was running her  deacon ignored him and returned to the attack on the pearlbuyer  how do you know from the sound of the anchor that it was this whateveryoucalledhim man he challenged  there are so many things that go to make up such a judgment peter gee answered its very hard to explain it would require almost a text book  i thought so deacon sneered explanation that doesnt explain is easy  whos for bridge eddy little the second clerk interrupted looking up expectantly and starting to shuffle youll play wont you peter  if he does hes a bluffer deacon cut back im getting tired of all this poppycock mr gee you will favour me and put yourself in a better light if you tell how you know who that man was that just dropped anchor after that ill play you piquet  id prefer bridge peter answered as for the other thing its something like this by the sound it was a small craftno squarerigger no whistle no siren was blownagain a small craft it anchored close instill again a small craft for steamers and big ships must drop hook outside the middle shoal now the entrance is tortuous there is no recruiting nor trading captain in the group who dares to run the passage after dark certainly no stranger would there were two exceptions the first was margonville but he was executed by the high court at fiji remains the other exception david grief night or day in any weather he runs the passage this is well known to all a possible factor in case grief were somewhere else would be some young daredevil of a skipper in this connection in the first place i dont know of any nor does anybody else in the second place david grief is in these waters cruising on the gunga which is shortly scheduled to leave here for karokaro i spoke to grief on the gunga in sandfly passage day before yesterday he was putting a trader ashore on a new station he said he was going to call in at babo and then come on to goboto he has had ample time to get here i have heard an anchor drop who else than david grief can it be captain donovan is skipper of the gunga and him i know too well to believe that hed run in to goboto after dark unless his owner were in charge in a few minutes david grief will enter through that door and say in guvutu they merely drink between drinks ill wager fifty pounds hes the man that enters and that his words will be in guvutu they merely drink between drinks  deacon was for the moment crushed the sullen blood rose darkly in his face  well hes answered you mcmurtrey laughed genially and ill back his bet myself for a couple of sovereigns  bridge whos going to take a hand eddy little cried impatiently come on peter  the rest of you play deacon said he and i are going to play piquet  id prefer bridge peter gee said mildly  dont you play piquet  the pearlbuyer nodded  then come on maybe i can show i know more about that than i do about anchors  oh i say mcmurtrey began  you can play bridge deacon shut him off we prefer piquet  reluctantly peter gee was bullied into a game that he knew would be unhappy  only a rubber he said as he cut for deal  for how much deacon asked  peter gee shrugged his shoulders as you please  hundred upfive pounds a game  peter gee agreed  with the lurch double of course ten pounds  all right said peter gee  at another table four of the others sat in at bridge captain stapler who was no cardplayer looked on and replenished the long glasses of scotch that stood at each mans right hand mcmurtrey with poorly concealed apprehension followed as well as he could what went on at the piquet table his fellow englishmen as well were shocked by the behaviour of the australian and all were troubled by fear of some untoward act on his part that he was working up his animosity against the halfcaste and that the explosion might come any time was apparent to all  i hope peter loses mcmurtrey said in an undertone  not if he has any luck andrews answered hes a wizard at piquet i know by experience  that peter gee was lucky was patent from the continual badgering of deacon who filled his glass frequently he had lost the first game and from his remarks was losing the second when the door opened and david grief entered  in guvutu they merely drink between drinks he remarked casually to the assembled company ere he gripped the managers hand hello mac say my skippers down in the whaleboat hes got a silk shirt a tie and tennis shoes all complete but he wants you to send a pair of pants down mine are too small but yours will fit him hello eddy hows that ngaringari you up jock the miracle has happened no one down with fever and no one remarkably drunk he sighed i suppose the night is young yet hello peter did you catch that big squall an hour after you left us we had to let go the second anchor  while he was being introduced to deacon mcmurtrey dispatched a houseboy with the pants and when captain donovan came in it was as a white man shouldat least in goboto  deacon lost the second game and an outburst heralded the fact peter gee devoted himself to lighting a cigarette and keeping quiet  whatare you quitting because youre ahead deacon demanded  grief raised his eyebrows questioningly to mcmurtrey who frowned back his own disgust  its the rubber peter gee answered  it takes three games to make a rubber its my deal come on  peter gee acquiesced and the third game was on  young whelphe needs a lacing mcmurtrey muttered to grief come on let us quit you chaps i want to keep an eye on him if he goes too far ill throw him out on the beach company instructions or no  who is he grief queried  a leftover from last steamer companys orders to treat him nice hes looking to invest in a plantation has a tenthousandpound letter of credit with the company hes got allwhite australia on the brain thinks because his skin is white and because his father was once attorneygeneral of the commonwealth that he can be a cur thats why hes picking on peter and you know peters the last man in the world to make trouble or incur trouble damn the company i didnt engage to wetnurse its infants with bank accounts come on fill your glass grief the mans a blighter a blithering blighter  maybe hes only young grief suggested  he cant contain his drinkthats clear the manager glared his disgust and wrath if he raises a hand to peter so help me ill give him a licking myself the little overgrown cad  the pearlbuyer pulled the pegs out of the cribbage board on which he was scoring and sat back he had won the third game he glanced across to eddy little saying  im ready for the bridge now  i wouldnt be a quitter deacon snarled  oh really im tired of the game peter gee assured him with his habitual quietness  come on and be game deacon bullied one more you cant take my money that way im out fifteen pounds double or quits  mcmurtrey was about to interpose but grief restrained him with his eyes  if it positively is the last all right said peter gee gathering up the cards its my deal i believe as i understand it this final is for fifteen pounds either you owe me thirty or we quit even  thats it chappie either we break even or i pay you thirty  getting blooded eh grief remarked drawing up a chair  the other men stood or sat around the table and deacon played again in bad luck that he was a good player was clear the cards were merely running against him that he could not take his ill luck with equanimity was equally clear he was guilty of sharp ugly curses and he snapped and growled at the imperturbable halfcaste in the end peter gee counted out while deacon had not even made his fifty points he glowered speechlessly at his opponent  looks like a lurch said grief  which is double said peter gee  theres no need your telling me deacon snarled ive studied arithmetic i owe you fortyfive pounds there take it  the way in which he flung the nine fivepound notes on the table was an insult in itself peter gee was even quieter and flew no signals of resentment  youve got fools luck but you cant play cards i can tell you that much deacon went on i could teach you cards  the halfcaste smiled and nodded acquiescence as he folded up the money  theres a little game called casinoi wonder if you ever heard of ita childs game  ive seen it played the halfcaste murmured gently  whats that snapped deacon maybe you think you can play it  oh no not for a moment im afraid i havent head enough for it  its a bully game casino grief broke in pleasantly i like it very much  deacon ignored him  ill play you ten quid a gamethirtyone points out was the challenge to peter gee and ill show you how little you know about cards come on wheres a full deck  no thanks the halfcaste answered they are waiting for me in order to make up a bridge set  yes come on eddy little begged eagerly come on peter lets get started  afraid of a little game like casino deacon girded maybe the stakes are too high ill play you for penniesor farthings if you say so  the mans conduct was a hurt and an affront to all of them mcmurtrey could stand it no longer  now hold on deacon he says he doesnt want to play let him alone  deacon turned raging upon his host but before he could blurt out his abuse grief had stepped into the breach  id like to play casino with you he said  what do you know about it  not much but im willing to learn  well im not teaching for pennies tonight  oh thats all right grief answered ill play for almost any sumwithin reason of course  deacon proceeded to dispose of this intruder with one stroke  ill play you a hundred pounds a game if that will do you any good  grief beamed his delight that will be all right very right let us begin do you count sweeps  deacon was taken aback he had not expected a goboton trader to be anything but crushed by such a proposition  do you count sweeps grief repeated  andrews had brought him a new deck and he was throwing out the joker  certainly not deacon answered thats a sissy game  im glad grief coincided i dont like sissy games either  you dont eh well then ill tell you what well do well play for five hundred pounds a game  again deacon was taken aback  im agreeable grief said beginning to shuffle cards and spades go out first of course and then big and little casino and the aces in the bridge order of value is that right  youre a lot of jokers down here deacon laughed but his laughter was strained how do i know youve got the money  by the same token i know youve got it mac hows my credit with the company  for all you want the manager answered  you personally guarantee that deacon demanded  i certainly do mcmurtrey said depend upon it the company will honour his paper up and past your letter of credit  low deals grief said placing the deck before deacon on the table  the latter hesitated in the midst of the cut and looked around with querulous misgiving at the faces of the others the clerks and captains nodded  youre all strangers to me deacon complained how am i to know money on paper isnt always the real thing  then it was that peter gee drawing a wallet from his pocket and borrowing a fountain pen from mcmurtrey went into action  i havent gone to buying yet the halfcaste explained so the account is intact ill just indorse it over to you grief its for fifteen thousand there look at it  deacon intercepted the letter of credit as it was being passed across the table he read it slowly then glanced up at mcmurtrey  is that right  yes its just the same as your own and just as good the companys paper is always good  deacon cut the cards won the deal and gave them a thorough shuffle but his luck was still against him and he lost the game  another game he said we didnt say how many and you cant quit with me a loser i want action  grief shuffled and passed the cards for the cut  lets play for a thousand deacon said when he had lost the second game and when the thousand had gone the way of the two five hundred bets he proposed to play for two thousand  thats progression mcmurtrey warned and was rewarded by a glare from deacon but the manager was insistent you dont have to play progression grief unless youre foolish  whos playing this game deacon flamed at his host and then to grief ive lost two thousand to you will you play for two thousand  grief nodded the fourth game began and deacon won the manifest unfairness of such betting was known to all of them though he had lost three games out of four deacon had lost no money by the childs device of doubling his wager with each loss he was bound with the first game he won no matter how long delayed to be even again  he now evinced an unspoken desire to stop but grief passed the deck to be cut  what deacon cried you want more  havent got anything yet grief murmured whimsically as he began the deal for the usual five hundred i suppose  the shame of what he had done must have tingled in deacon for he answered no well play for a thousand and say thirtyone points is too long why not twentyone points outif it isnt too rapid for you  that will make it a nice quick little game grief agreed  the former method of play was repeated deacon lost two games doubled the stake and was again even but grief was patient though the thing occurred several times in the next hours play then happened what he was waiting fora lengthening in the series of losing games for deacon the latter doubled to four thousand and lost doubled to eight thousand and lost and then proposed to double to sixteen thousand  grief shook his head you cant do that you know youre only ten thousand credit with the company  you mean you wont give me action deacon asked hoarsely you mean that with eight thousand of my money youre going to quit  grief smiled and shook his head  its robbery plain robbery deacon went on you take my money and wont give me action  no youre wrong im perfectly willing to give you what action youve got coming to you youve got two thousand pounds of action yet  well well play it deacon took him up you cut  the game was played in silence save for irritable remarks and curses from deacon silently the onlookers filled and sipped their long scotch glasses grief took no notice of his opponents outbursts but concentrated on the game he was really playing cards and there were fiftytwo in the deck to be kept track of and of which he did keep track two thirds of the way through the last deal he threw down his hand  cards put me out he said i have twentyseven  if youve made a mistake deacon threatened his face white and drawn  then i shall have lost count them  grief passed over his stack of takings and deacon with trembling fingers verified the count he half shoved his chair back from the table and emptied his glass he looked about him at unsympathetic faces  i fancy ill be catching the next steamer for sydney he said and for the first time his speech was quiet and without bluster  as grief told them afterward had he whined or raised a roar i wouldnt have given him that last chance as it was he took his medicine like a man and i had to do it  deacon glanced at his watch simulated a weary yawn and started to rise  wait grief said do you want further action  the other sank down in his chair strove to speak but could not licked his dry lips and nodded his head  captain donovan here sails at daylight in the gunga for karokaro grief began with seeming irrelevance karokaro is a ring of sand in the sea with a few thousand cocoanut trees pandanus grows there but they cant grow sweet potatoes nor taro there aremabout eight hundred natives a king and two prime ministers and the last three named are the only ones who wear any clothes its a sort of godforsaken little hole and once a year i send a schooner up from goboto the drinking water is brackish but old tom butler has survived on it for a dozen years hes the only white man there and he has a boats crew of five santa cruz boys who would run away or kill him if they could that is why they were sent there they cant run away he is always supplied with the hard cases from the plantations there are no missionaries two native samoan teachers were clubbed to death on the beach when they landed several years ago  naturally you are wondering what it is all about but have patience as i have said captain donovan sails on the annual trip to karokaro at daylight tomorrow tom butler is old and getting quite helpless ive tried to retire him to australia but he says he wants to remain and die on karokaro and he will in the next year or so hes a queer old codger now the time is due for me to send some white man up to take the work off his hands i wonder how youd like the job youd have to stay two years  hold on ive not finished youve talked frequently of action this evening theres no action in betting away what youve never sweated for the money youve lost to me was left you by your father or some other relative who did the sweating but two years of work as trader on karokaro would mean something ill bet the ten thousand ive won from you against two years of your time if you win the moneys yours if you lose you take the job at karokaro and sail at daylight now thats what might be called real action will you play  deacon could not speak his throat lumped and he nodded his head as he reached for the cards  one thing more grief said i can do even better if you lose two years of your time are minenaturally without wages nevertheless ill pay you wages if your work is satisfactory if you observe all instructions and rules ill pay you five thousand pounds a year for two years the money will be deposited with the company to be paid to you with interest when the time expires is that all right  too much so deacon stammered you are unfair to yourself a trader only gets ten or fifteen pounds a month  put it down to action then grief said with an air of dismissal and before we begin ill jot down several of the rules these you will repeat aloud every morning during the two yearsif you lose they are for the good of your soul when you have repeated them aloud seven hundred and thirty karokaro mornings i am confident they will be in your memory to stay lend me your pen mac now lets see  he wrote steadily and rapidly for some minutes then proceeded to read the matter aloud  i must always remember that one man is as good as another save and except when he thinks he is better  no matter how drunk i am i must not fail to be a gentleman a gentleman is a man who is gentle note it would be better not to get drunk  when i play a mans game with men i must play like a man  a good curse rightly used and rarely is an efficient thing too many curses spoil the cursing note a curse cannot change a card seguence nor cause the wind to blow  there is no license for a man to be less than a man ten thousand pounds cannot purchase such a license  at the beginning of the reading deacons face had gone white with anger then had arisen from neck to forehead a slow and terrible flush that deepened to the end of the reading  there that will be all grief said as he folded the paper and tossed it to the centre of the table are you still ready to play the game  i deserve it deacon muttered brokenly ive been an ass mr gee before i know whether i win or lose i want to apologize maybe it was the whiskey i dont know but im an ass a cad a boundereverything thats rotten  he held out his hand and the halfcaste took it beamingly  i say grief he blurted out the boys all right call the whole thing off and lets forget it in a final nightcap  grief showed signs of debating but deacon cried  no i wont permit it im not a quitter if its karokaro its karokaro theres nothing more to it  right said grief as he began the shuffle if hes the right stuff to go to karokaro karokaro wont do him any harm  the game was close and hard three times they divided the deck between them and cards was not scored at the beginning of the fifth and last deal deacon needed three points to go out and grief needed four cards alone would put deacon out and he played for cards he no longer muttered or cursed and played his best game of the evening incidentally he gathered in the two black aces and the ace of hearts  i suppose you can name the four cards i hold he challenged as the last of the deal was exhausted and he picked up his hand  grief nodded  then name them  the knave of spades the deuce of spades the tray of hearts and the ace of diamonds grief answered  those behind deacon and looking at his hand made no sign yet the naming had been correct  i fancy you play casino better than i deacon acknowledged i can name only three of yours a knave an ace and big casino  wrong there arent five aces in the deck youve taken in three and you hold the fourth in your hand now  by jove youre right deacon admitted i did scoop in three anyway ill make cards on you thats all i need  ill let you save little casino grief paused to calculate yes and the ace as well and still ill make cards and go out with big casino play  no cards and i win deacon exulted as the last of the hand was played i go out on little casino and the four aces big casino and spades only bring you to twenty  grief shook his head some mistake im afraid  no deacon declared positively i counted every card i took in thats the one thing i was correct on ive twentysix and youve twentysix  count again grief said  carefully and slowly with trembling fingers deacon counted the cards he had taken there were twentyfive he reached over to the corner of the table took up the rules grief had written folded them and put them in his pocket then he emptied his glass and stood up captain donovan looked at his watch yawned and also arose  going aboard captain deacon asked  yes was the answer what time shall i send the whaleboat for you  ill go with you now well pick up my luggage from the billy as we go by i was sailing on her for babo in the morning  deacon shook hands all around after receiving a final pledge of good luck on karokaro  does tom butler play cards he asked grief  solitaire was the answer  then ill teach him double solitaire deacon turned toward the door where captain donovan waited and added with a sigh and i fancy hell skin me too if he plays like the rest of you island men      chapter seventhe feathers of the sun     i  it was the island of fituivathe last independent polynesian stronghold in the south seas three factors conduced to fituivas independence the first and second were its isolation and the warlikeness of its population but these would not have saved it in the end had it not been for the fact that japan france great britain germany and the united states discovered its desirableness simultaneously it was like gamins scrambling for a penny they got in one anothers way the war vessels of the five powers cluttered fituivas one small harbour there were rumours of war and threats of war over its morning toast all the world read columns about fituiva as a yankee blue jacket epitomized it at the time they all got their feet in the trough at once  so it was that fituiva escaped even a joint protectorate and king tulifau otherwise tui tulifau continued to dispense the high justice and the low in the framehouse palace built for him by a sydney trader out of california redwood not only was tui tulifau every inch a king but he was every second a king when he had ruled fiftyeight years and five months he was only fiftyeight years and three months old that is to say he had ruled over five million seconds more than he had breathed having been crowned two months before he was born  he was a kingly king a royal figure of a man standing six feet and a half and without being excessively fat weighing three hundred and twenty pounds but this was not unusual for polynesian chief stock sepeli his queen was six feet three inches and weighed two hundred and sixty while her brother uiliami who commanded the army in the intervals of resignation from the premiership topped her by an inch and notched her an even halfhundredweight tui tulifau was a merry soul a great feaster and drinker so were all his people merry souls save in anger when on occasion they could be guilty even of throwing dead pigs at those who made them wroth nevertheless on occasion they could fight like maoris as piratical sandalwood traders and blackbirders in the old days learned to their cost     ii  griefs schooner the cantani had passed the pillar rocks at the entrance two hours before and crept up the harbour to the whispering flutters of a breeze that could not make up its mind to blow it was a cool starlight evening and they lolled about the poop waiting till their snails pace would bring them to the anchorage willie smee the supercargo emerged from the cabin conspicuous in his shore clothes the mate glanced at his shirt of the finest and whitest silk and giggled significantly  dance tonight i suppose grief observed  no said the mate its taitua willies stuck on her  catch me the supercargo disclaimed  then shes stuck on you and its all the same the mate went on you wont be ashore half an hour before youll have a flower behind your ear a wreath on your head and your arm around taitua  simple jealousy willie smee sniffed youd like to have her yourself only you cant  i cant find shirts like that thats why ill bet you half a crown you wont sail from fituiva with that shirt  and if taitua doesnt get it its an even break tui tulifau does grief warned better not let him spot that shirt or its all day with it  thats right captain boig agreed turning his head from watching the house lights on the shore last voyage he fined one of my kanakas out of a fancy belt and sheathknife he turned to the mate you can let go any time mr marsh dont give too much slack theres no sign of wind and in the morning we may shift opposite the coprasheds  a minute later the anchor rumbled down the whaleboat already hoisted out lay alongside and the shoregoing party dropped into it save for the kanakas who were all bent for shore only grief and the supercargo were in the boat at the head of the little coralstone pier willie smee with an apologetic gurgle separated from his employer and disappeared down an avenue of palms grief turned in the opposite direction past the front of the old mission church here among the graves on the beach lightly clad in ahus and lavalavas flowercrowned and garlanded with great phosphorescent hibiscus blossoms in their hair youths and maidens were dancing farther on grief passed the long grassbuilt himine house where a few score of the elders sat in long rows chanting the old hymns taught them by forgotten missionaries he passed also the palace of tui tulifau where by the lights and sounds he knew the customary revelry was going on for of the happy south sea isles fituiva was the happiest they feasted and frolicked at births and deaths and the dead and the unborn were likewise feasted  grief held steadily along the broom road which curved and twisted through a lush growth of flowers and fernlike algarobas the warm air was rich with perfume and overhead outlined against the stars were fruitburdened mangoes stately avocado trees and slendertufted palms every here and there were grass houses voices and laughter rippled through the darkness out on the water flickering lights and softvoiced choruses marked the fishers returning from the reef  at last grief stepped aside from the road stumbling over a pig that grunted indignantly looking through an open door he saw a stout and elderly native sitting on a heap of mats a dozen deep from time to time automatically he brushed his naked legs with a cocoanutfibre flyflicker he wore glasses and was reading methodically in what grief knew to be an english bible for this was ieremia his trader so named from the prophet jeremiah  ieremia was lighterskinned than the fituivans as was natural in a fullblooded samoan educated by the missionaries as lay teacher he had served their cause well over in the cannibal atolls to the westward as a reward he had been sent to the paradise of fituiva where all were or had been good converts to gather in the backsliders unfortunately ieremia had become too well educated a stray volume of darwin a nagging wife and a pretty fituivan widow had driven him into the ranks of the backsliders it was not a case of apostasy the effect of darwin had been one of intellectual fatigue what was the use of trying to understand this vastly complicated and enigmatical world especially when one was married to a nagging woman as ieremia slackened in his labours the mission board threatened louder and louder to send him back to the atolls while his wifes tongue grew correspondingly sharper tui tulifau was a sympathetic monarch whose queen on occasions when he was particularly drunk was known to beat him for political reasonsthe queen belonging to as royal stock as himself and her brother commanding the armytui tulifau could not divorce her but he could and did divorce ieremia who promptly took up with commercial life and the lady of his choice as an independent trader he had failed chiefly because of the disastrous patronage of tui tulifau to refuse credit to that merry monarch was to invite confiscation to grant him credit was certain bankruptcy after a years idleness on the beach leremia had become david griefs trader and for a dozen years his service had been honourable and efficient for grief had proven the first man who successfully refused credit to the king or who collected when it had been accorded  ieremia looked gravely over the rims of his glasses when his employer entered gravely marked the place in the bible and set it aside and gravely shook hands  i am glad you came in person he said  how else could i come grief laughed  but ieremia had no sense of humour and he ignored the remark  the commercial situation on the island is damn bad he said with great solemnity and an unctuous mouthing of the manysyllabled words my ledger account is shocking  trade bad  on the contrary it has been excellent the shelves are empty exceedingly empty but his eyes glistened proudly but there are many goods remaining in the storehouse i have kept it carefully locked  been allowing tui tulifau too much credit  on the contrary there has been no credit at all and every old account has been settled up  i dont follow you ieremia grief confessed whats the jokeshelves empty no credit old accounts all square storehouse carefully lockedwhats the answer  ieremia did not reply immediately reaching under the rear corner of the mats he drew forth a large cashbox grief noted and wondered that it was not locked the samoan had always been fastidiously cautious in guarding cash the box seemed filled with paper money he skinned off the top note and passed it over  there is the answer  grief glanced at a fairly well executed banknote the first royal bank of fituiva will pay to bearer on demand one pound sterling he read in the centre was the smudged likeness of a native face at the bottom was the signature of tui tulifau and the signature of fulualea with the printed information appended chancellor of the exchequer  who the deuce is fulualea grief demanded its fijian isnt itmeaning the feathers of the sun  just so it means the feathers of the sun thus does this base interloper caption himself he has come up from fiji to turn fituiva upside downthat is commercially  some one of those smart levuka boys i suppose  ieremia shook his head sadly no this low fellow is a white man and a scoundrel he has taken a noble and highsounding fijian name and dragged it in the dirt to suit his nefarious purposes he has made tui tulifau drunk he has made him very drunk he has kept him very drunk all the time in return he has been made chancellor of the exchequer and other things he has issued this false paper and compelled the people to receive it he has levied a store tax a copra tax and a tobacco tax there are harbour dues and regulations and other taxes but the people are not taxedonly the traders when the copra tax was levied i lowered the purchasing price accordingly then the people began to grumble and feathers of the sun passed a new law setting the old price back and forbidding any man to lower it me he fined two pounds and five pigs it being well known that i possessed five pigs you will find them entered in the ledger hawkins who is trader for the fulcrum company was fined first pigs then gin and because he continued to make loud conversation the army came and burned his store when i declined to sell this feathers of the sun fined me once more and promised to burn the store if again i offended so i sold all that was on the shelves and there is the box full of worthless paper i shall be chagrined if you pay me my salary in paper but it would be just no more than just now what is to be done  grief shrugged his shoulders i must first see this feathers of the sun and size up the situation  then you must see him soon ieremia advised else he will have an accumulation of many fines against you thus does he absorb all the coin of the realm he has it all now save what has been buried in the ground     iii  on his way back along the broom road under the lighted lamps that marked the entrance to the palace grounds grief encountered a short rotund gentleman in unstarched ducks smoothshaven and of florid complexion who was just emerging something about his tentative saturated gait was familiar grief knew it on the instant on the beaches of a dozen south sea ports had he seen it before  of all men cornelius deasy he cried  if it aint grief himself the old devil was the return greeting as they shook hands  if youll come on board ive some choice smoky irish grief invited  cornelius threw back his shoulders and stiffened  nothing doin mr grief tis fulualea i am now no blarneyin of old times for me also and by the leave of his gracious majesty king tulifau tis chancellor of the exchequer i am an chief justice i am save in moments of royal sport when the king himself chooses to toy with the wheels of justice  grief whistled his amazement so youre feathers of the sun  i prefer the native idiom was the correction fulualea an it please you not

risked for the savin of a pennyorth of oil did i ask have you any gin tis the harbour master that asks  youve taken a lot on your shoulders grief grinned  tis the white mans burden these rapscallion

here to see justice done much as i dislike the doin of it as harbour master tis my duty to find you guilty of breach of quarantine  quarantine  tis the rulin of the port doctor no intercourse with the shore till the ship is passed what dire calamity to the confidin native if chicken pox or whoopin cough was aboard of you who is there to protect the gentle confidin polynesian i fulualea the feathers of the sun on my high mission  who in hell is the port doctor grief queried  tis me fulualea your offence is serious consider yourself fined five cases of firstquality holland gin  grief laughed

present your ships papers as chief of the custom house you are fined five pounds and two more cases of gin  look here cornelius a jokes a joke but this one has gone far enough this is not levuka ive half a mind to pull your nose for you you cant buck me  the feathers of the sun retreated unsteadily and in alarm  lay no violence on me he threatened youre right this is not levuka and by the same token with tui tulifau and the royal army behind me buck you is just the thing i can and will youll pay them fines promptly or ill confiscate your vessel youre not the first what does that chink

workin overtime to supply him hes that amazin liberal with it the whole gang of hangeron chiefs is perpetually loaded to the guards its disgraceful are you goin to pay them fines mr grief or is it to harsher measures ill be forced  grief turned impatiently on his heel  cornelius youre drunk think it over and come to your senses the old rollicking south sea days are gone you cant play tricks like that now  if you think youre goin on board mr grief ill save you the trouble i know your kind i foresaw your stiffnecked stubbornness an its forestalled you are tis on the beach youll find your crew the vessels seized  grief turned back on him in the halfbelief still that he was joking fulualea again retreated in alarm the form of a large man loomed beside him in the darkness  is it you uiliami fulualea crooned here is another sea pirate stand by me with the strength of thy arm o herculean brother  greeting uiliami grief said since when has fituiva come to be run by a levuka beachcomber he says my schooner has been seized is it true  it is true uiliami boomed from his deep chest have you any more silk shirts like willie smees tui tulifau would like such a shirt he has heard of it  tis all the same fulualea interrupted shirts or schooners the king shall have them  rather highhanded cornelius grief murmured its rank piracy you seized my vessel without giving me a chance  a chance is

particular star at whose shining altar cornelius deasyor fulualea tis the same thingever worships get thee gone mr trader or ill set the palace guards on you uiliami tis a desperate character this trader man call the guards  uiliami blew the whistle suspended on his broad bare chest by a cord of cocoanut sennit grief reached out an angry hand for cornelius who titubated into safety behind uiliamis massive bulk a dozen strapping polynesians not one under six feet ran down the palace walk and ranged behind their commander  get thee gone mr trader cornelius ordered the interview is terminated well try your several cases in the mornin appear promptly at the palace at ten oclock to answer to the followin charges to wit breach of the peace seditious and treasonable utterance violent assault on the chief magistrate with intent to cut wound maim an bruise breach of quarantine violation of harbour regulations and gross breakage of custom house rules in the mornin fellow in the mornin justice shall be done while the breadfruit falls and the lord have mercy on your soul     iii  before the hour set for the trial grief accompanied by peter gee won access to tui tulifau the king surrounded by half a dozen chiefs lay on mats under the shade of the avocados in the palace compound early as was the hour palace maids were industriously serving squarefaces of gin the king was glad to see his old friend davida and regretful that he had run foul of the new regulations beyond that he steadfastly avoided discussion of the matter in hand all protests of the expropriated traders were washed away in proffers of gin have a drink was his invariable reply though once he unbosomed himself enough to say that feathers of the sun was a wonderful man never had palace affairs been so prosperous never had there been so much money in the treasury nor so much gin in circulation well pleased am i with fulualea he concluded have a drink  weve got to get out of this pronto grief whispered to peter gee a few minutes later or well be a pair of boiled owls also i am to be tried for arson or heresy or leprosy or something in a few minutes and i must control my wits  as they withdrew from the royal presence grief caught a glimpse of sepeli the queen she was peering out at her royal spouse and his fellow tipplers and the frown on her face gave grief his cue whatever was to be accomplished must be through her  in another shady corner of the big compound cornelius was holding court he had been at it early for when grief arrived the case of willie smee was being settled the entire royal army save that portion in charge of the seized vessels was in attendance  let the defendant stand up said cornelius and receive the just and merciful sentence of the court for licentious and disgraceful conduct unbecomin a supercargo the defendant says he has no money very well the court regrets it has no calaboose in lieu thereof and in view of the impoverished condition of the defendant the court fines said defendant one white silk shirt of the same kind make and quality at present worn by defendant  cornelius nodded to several of the soldiers who led the supercargo away behind an avocado tree a minute later he emerged minus the garment in question and sat down beside grief  what have you been up to grief asked  blessed if i know what crimes have you committed  next case said cornelius in his most extralegal tones david grief defendant stand up the court has considered the evidence in the case or cases and renders the following judgment to witshut up he thundered at grief who had attempted to interrupt i tell you the evidence has been considered deeply considered it is no wish of the court to lay additional hardship on the defendant and the court takes this opportunity to warn the defendant that he is liable for contempt for open and wanton violation of harbour rules and regulations breach of quarantine and disregard of shipping laws his schooner the cantani is hereby declared confiscated to the government of fituiva to be sold at public auction ten days from date with all appurtenances fittings and cargo thereunto pertaining for the personal crimes of the defendant consisting of violent and turbulent conduct and notorious disregard of the laws of the realm he is fined in the sum of one hundred pounds sterling and fifteen cases of gin i will not ask you if you have anything to say but will you pay that is the question  grief shook his head  in the meantime cornelius went on consider yourself a prisoner at large there is no calaboose in which to confine you and finally it has come to the knowledge of the court that at an early hour of this morning the defendant did wilfully and deliberately send kanakas in his employ out on the reef to catch fish for breakfast this is distinctly an infringement of the rights of the fisherfolk of fituiva home industries must be protected this conduct of the defendant is severely reprehended by the court and on any repetition of the offence the offender and offenders all and sundry shall be immediately put to hard labour on the improvement of the broom road the court is dismissed  as they left the compound peter gee nudged grief to look where tui tulifau reclined on the mats the supercargos shirt stretched and bulged already encased the royal fat     iv  the thing is clear said peter gee at a conference in ieremias house deasy has about gathered in all the coin in the meantime he keeps the king going on the gin hes captured on our vessels as soon as he can maneuver it hell take the cash and skin out on your craft or mine  he is a low fellow ieremia declared pausing in the polishing of his spectacles he is a scoundrel and a blackguard he should be struck by a dead pig by a particularly dead pig  the very thing said grief he shall be struck by a dead pig ieremia i should not be surprised if you were the man to strike him with the dead pig be sure and select a particularly dead one tui tulifau is down at the boat house broaching a case of my scotch im going up to the palace to work kitchen politics with the queen in the meantime you get a few things on your shelves from the storeroom ill lend you some hawkins and you peter see the german store start in all of you selling for paper remember ill back the losses if im not mistaken in three days well have a national council or a revolution you ieremia start messengers around the island to the fishers and farmers everywhere even to the mountain goathunters tell them to assemble at the palace three days from now  but the soldiers ieremia objected  ill take care of them they havent been paid for two months besides uiliami is the queens brother dont have too much on your shelves at a time as soon as the soldiers show up with paper stop selling  then will they burn the stores said ieremia  let them king tulifau will pay for it if they do  will he pay for my shirt willie smee demanded  that is purely a personal and private matter between you and tui tulifau grief answered  its beginning to split up the back the supercargo lamented i noticed that much this morning when he hadnt had it on ten minutes it cost me thirty shillings and i only wore it once  where shall i get a dead pig ieremia asked  kill one of course said grief kill a small one  a small one is worth ten shillings  then enter it in your ledger under operating expenses grief paused a moment if you want it particularly dead it would be well to kill it at once     v  you have spoken well davida said queen sepeli this fulualea has brought a madness with him and tui tulifau is drowned in gin if he does not grant the big council i shall give him a beating he is easy to beat when he is in drink  she doubled up her fist and such were her amazonian proportions and the determination in her face that grief knew the council would be called so akin was the fituivan tongue to the samoan that he spoke it like a native  and you uiliami he said have pointed out that the soldiers have demanded coin and refused the paper fulualea has offered them tell them to take the paper and see that they be paid tomorrow  why trouble uiliami objected the king remains happily drunk there is much money in the treasury and i am content in my house are two cases of gin and much goods from hawkinss store  excellent pig o my brother sepeli erupted has not davida spoken have you no ears when the gin and the goods in your house are gone and no more traders come with gin and goods and feathers of the sun has run away to levuka with all the cash money of fituiva what then will you do cash money is silver and gold but paper is only paper i tell you the people are grumbling there is no fish in the palace yams and sweet potatoes seem to have fled from the soil for they come not the mountain dwellers have sent no wild goat in a week though feathers of the sun compels the traders to buy copra at the old price the people sell not for they will have none of the paper money only today have i sent messengers to twenty houses there are no eggs has feathers of the sun put a blight upon the hens i do not know all i know is that there are no eggs well it is that those who drink much eat little else would there be a palace famine tell your soldiers to receive their pay let it be in his paper money  and remember grief warned though there be selling in the stores when the soldiers come with their paper it will be refused and in three days will be the council and feathers of the sun will be as dead as a dead pig     vi  the day of the council found the population of the island crowded into the capital by canoe and whaleboat on foot and donkeyback the five thousand inhabitants of fituiva had trooped in the three intervening days had had their share of excitement at first there had been much selling from the sparse shelves of the traders but when the soldiers appeared their patronage was declined and they were told to go to fulualea for coin says it not so on the face of the paper the traders demanded that for the asking the coin will be given in exchange  only the strong authority of uiliami had prevented the burning of the traders houses as it was one of griefs coprasheds went up in smoke and was duly charged by ieremia to the kings account ieremia himself had been abused and mocked and his spectacles broken the skin was off willie smees knuckles this had been caused by three boisterous soldiers who violently struck their jaws thereon in quick succession captain boig was similarly injured peter gee had come off undamaged because it chanced that it was breadbaskets and not jaws that struck him on the fists  tui tulifau with sepeli at his side and surrounded by his convivial chiefs sat at the head of the council in the big compound his right eye and jaw were swollen as if he too had engaged in assaulting somebodys fist it was palace gossip that morning that sepeli had administered a conjugal beating at any rate her spouse was sober and his fat bulged spiritlessly through the rips in willie smees silk shirt his thirst was prodigious and he was continually served with young drinking nuts outside the compound held back by the army was the mass of the common people only the lesser chiefs village maids village beaux and talking men with their staffs of office were permitted inside cornelius deasy as befitted a high and favoured official sat near to the right hand of the king on the left of the queen opposite cornelius and surrounded by the white traders he was to represent sat ieremia bereft of his spectacles he peered shortsightedly across at the chancellor of the exchequer  in turn the talking man of the windward coast the talking man of the leeward coast and the talking man of the mountain villages each backed by his group of lesser talking men and chiefs arose and made oration what they said was much the same they grumbled about the paper money affairs were not prosperous no more copra was being smoked the people were suspicious to such a pass had things come that all people wanted to pay their debts and no one wanted to be paid creditors made a practice of running away from debtors the money was cheap prices were going up and commodities were getting scarce it cost three times the ordinary price to buy a fowl and then it was tough and like to die of old age if not immediately sold the outlook was gloomy there were signs and omens there was a plague of rats in some districts the crops were bad the custard apples were small the bestbearing avocado on the windward coast had mysteriously shed all its leaves the taste had gone from the mangoes the plantains were eaten by a worm the fish had forsaken the ocean and vast numbers of tigersharks appeared the wild goats had fled to inaccessible summits the poi in the poipits had turned bitter there were rumblings in the mountains nightwalking of spirits a woman of puntapuna had been struck speechless and a fivelegged shegoat had been born in the village of eiho and that all was due to the strange money of fulualea was the firm conviction of the elders in the village councils assembled  uiliami spoke for the army his men were discontented and mutinous though by royal decree the traders were bidden accept the money yet did they refuse it he would not say but it looked as if the strange money of fulualea had something to do with it  ieremia as talking man of the traders next spoke when he arose it was noticeable that he stood with legs spraddled over a large grass basket he dwelt upon the cloth of the traders its variety and beauty and durability which so exceeded the fituivan wetpounded tapa fragile and coarse no one wore tapa any more yet all had worn tapa and nothing but tapa before the traders came there was the mosquitonetting sold for a song that the cleverest fituivan netweaver could not duplicate in a thousand years he enlarged on the incomparable virtues of rifles axes and steel fishhooks down through needles thread and cotton fishlines to white flour and kerosene oil  he expounded at length with firstlies and secondlies and all minor subdivisions of argument on organization and order and civilization he contended that the trader was the bearer of civilization and that the trader must be protected in his trade else he would not come over to the westward were islands which would not protect the traders what was the result the traders would not come and the people were like wild animals they wore no clothes no silk shirts here he peered and blinked significantly at the king and they ate one another  the queer paper of the feathers of the sun was not money the traders knew what money was and they would not receive it if fituiva persisted in trying to make them receive it they would go away and never come back and then the fituivans who had forgotten how to make tapa would run around naked and eat one another  much more he said talking a solid hour and always coming back to what their dire condition would be when the traders came no more and in that day he perorated how will the fituivan be known in the great world kaikanak will men call him kiakanak kaikanak        maneater  tui tulifau spoke briefly the case had been presented he said for the people the army and the traders it was now time for feathers of the sun to present his side it could not be denied that he had wrought wonders with his financial system many times has he explained to me the working of his system tui tulif au concluded it is very simple and now he will explain it to you  it was a conspiracy of the white traders cornelius contended ieremia was right so far as concerned the manifold blessings of white flour and kerosene oil fituiva did not want to become kaikanak fituiva wanted civilization it wanted more and more civilization now that was the very point and they must follow him closely paper money was an earmark of higher civilization that was why he the feathers of the sun had introduced it and that was why the traders opposed it they did not want to see fituiva civilized why did they come across the far ocean stretches with their goods to fituiva he the feathers of the sun would tell them why to their faces in grand council assembled in their own countries men were too civilized to let the traders make the immense profits that they made out of the fituivans if the fituivans became properly civilized the trade of the traders would be gone in that day every fituivan could become a trader if he pleased  that was why the white traders fought the system of paper money that he the feathers of the sun had brought why was he called the feathers of the sun because he was the lightbringer from the world beyond the sky the paper money was the light the robbing white traders could not flourish in the light therefore they fought the light  he would prove it to the good people of fituiva and he would prove it out of the mouths of his enemies it was a wellknown fact that all highly civilized countries had papermoney systems he would ask ieremia if this was not so  ieremia did not answer  you see cornelius went on he makes no answer he cannot deny what is true england france germany america all the great papalangi countries have the papermoney system it works from century to century it works i challenge you ieremia as an honest man as one who was once a zealous worker in the lords vineyard i challenge you to deny that in the great papalangi countries the system works  ieremia could not deny and his fingers played nervously with the fastening of the basket on his knees  you see it is as i have said cornelius continued ieremia agrees that it is so therefore i ask you all good people of fituiva if a system is good for the papalangi countries why is it not good for fituiva  it is not the same ieremia cried the paper of the feathers of the sun is different from the paper of the great countries  that cornelius had been prepared for this was evident he held up a fituivan note that was recognized by all  what is that he demanded  paper mere paper was ieremias reply  and that  this time cornelius held up a bank of england note  it is the paper money of the english he explained to the council at the same time extending it for ieremia to examine is it not true ieremia that it is paper money of the english  ieremia nodded reluctantly  you have said that the paper money of fituiva was paper now how about this of the english what is it you must answer like a true man all wait for your answer ieremia  it isit is the puzzled ieremia began then spluttered helplessly the fallacy beyond his penetration  paper mere paper cornelius concluded for him imitating his halting utterance  conviction sat on the faces of all the king clapped his hands admiringly and murmured it is most clear very clear  you see he himself acknowledges it assured triumph was in deasys voice and bearing he knows of no difference there is no difference tis the very image of money tis money itself  in the meantime grief was whispering in ieremias ear who nodded and began to speak  but it is well known to all the papalangi that the english government will pay coin money for the paper  deasys victory was now absolute he held aloft a fituivan note  is it not so written on this paper as well  again grief whispered  that fituiva will pay coin money asked ieremia  it is so written  a third time grief prompted  on demand asked ieremia  on demand cornelius assured him  then i demand coin money now said ieremia drawing a small package of notes from the pouch at his girdle  cornelius scanned the package with a quick estimating eye  very well he agreed i shall give you the coin money now how much  and we will see the system work the king proclaimed partaking in his chancellors triumph  you have heardhe will give coin money now ieremia cried in a loud voice to the assemblage  at the same time he plunged both hands in the basket and drew forth many packages of fituivan notes it was noticed that a peculiar odour was adrift about the council  i have here ieremia announced one thousand and twentyeight pounds twelve shillings and sixpence here is a sack to put the coin money in  cornelius recoiled he had not expected such a sum and everywhere about the council his uneasy eyes showed him chiefs and talking men drawing out bundles of notes the army its two months pay in its hands pressed forward to the edge of the council while behind it the populace with more money invaded the compound  tis a run on the bank youve precipitated he said reproachfully to grief  here is the sack to put the coin money in ieremia urged  it must be postponed cornelius said desperately tis not in banking hours  ieremia flourished a package of money nothing of banking hours is written here it says on demand and i now demand  let them come tomorrow o tui tulifau cornelius appealed to the king they shall be paid tomorrow  tui tulifau hesitated but his spouse glared at him her brawny arm tensing as the fist doubled into a redoubtable knot tui tulifau tried to look away but failed he cleared his throat nervously  we will see the system work he decreed the people have come far  tis good money youre asking me to pay out deasy muttered in a low voice to the king  sepeli caught what he said and grunted so savagely as to startle the king who involuntarily shrank away from her  forget not the pig grief whispered to ieremia who immediately stood up  with a sweeping gesture he stilled the babel of voices that was beginning to rise  it was an ancient and honourable custom of fituiva he said that when a man was proved a notorious evildoer his joints were broken with a club and he was staked out at low water to be fed upon alive by the sharks unfortunately that day is past nevertheless another ancient and honourable custom remains with us you all know what it is when a man is a proven thief and liar he shall be struck with a dead pig  his right hand went into the basket and despite the lack of his spectacles the dead pig that came into view landed accurately on deasys neck with such force was it thrown that the chancellor in his sitting position toppled over sidewise before he could recover sepeli with an agility unexpected of a woman who weighed two hundred and sixty pounds had sprung across to him one hand clutched his shirt collar the other hand brandished the pig and amid the vast uproar of a delighted kingdom she royally swatted him  there remained nothing for tui tulifau but to put a good face on his favourites disgrace and his mountainous fat lay back on the mats and shook in a gale of gargantuan laughter  when sepeli dropped both pig and chancellor a talking man from the windward coast picked up the carcass cornelius was on his feet and running when the pig caught him on the legs and tripped him the people and the army with shouts and laughter joined in the sport  twist and dodge as he would everywhere the exchancellor of the exchequer was met or overtaken by the flying pig he scuttled like a frightened rabbit in and out among the avocados and the palms no hand was laid upon him and his tormentors made way before him but ever they pursued and ever the pig flew as fast as hands could pick it up  as the chase died away down the broom road grief led the traders to the royal treasury and the day was well over ere the last fituivan bank note had been redeemed with coin     vii  through the mellow cool of twilight a man paddled out from a clump of jungle to the cantani it was a leaky and abandoned dugout and he paddled slowly desisting from time to time in order to bale the kanaka sailors giggled gleefully as he came alongside and painfully drew himself over the rail he was bedraggled and filthy and seemed halfdazed  could i speak a word with you mr grief he asked sadly and humbly  sit to leeward and farther away grief answered a little farther away thats better  cornelius sat down on the rail and held his head in both his hands  tis right he said im as fragrant as a recent battlefield my head aches to burstin my neck is fair broken the teeth are loose in my jaws theres nests of hornets buzzin in my ears my medulla oblongata is dislocated ive been through earthquake and pestilence and the heavens have rained pigs he paused with a sigh that ended in a groan tis a vision of terrible death one that the poets never dreamed to be eaten by rats or boiled in oil or pulled apart by wild horsesthat would be unpleasant but to be beaten to death with a dead pig he shuddered at the awfulness of it sure it transcends the human imagination  captain boig sniffed audibly moved his canvas chair farther to windward and sat down again  i hear youre runnin over to yap mr grief cornelius went on an two things im wantin to beg of you a passage an the nip of the old smoky i refused the night you landed  grief clapped his hands for the black steward and ordered soap and towels  go forard cornelius and take a scrub first he said the boy will bring you a pair of dungarees and a shirt and by the way before you go how was it we found more coin in the treasury than paper you had issued  twas the stake of my own id brought with me for the adventure  weve decided to charge the demurrage and other expenses and loss to tui tulifau grief said so the balance we found will be turned over to you but ten shillings must be deducted  for what  do you think dead pigs grow on trees the sum of ten shillings for that pig is entered in the accounts  cornelius bowed his assent with a shudder  sure its grateful i am it wasnt a fifteenshilling pig or a twentyshilling one      chapter eightthe pearls of parlay     i  the kanaka helmsman put the wheel down and the malahini slipped into the eye of the wind and righted to an even keel her headsails emptied there was a rattat of reefpoints and quick shifting of boomtackles and she was heeled over and filled away on the other tack though it was early morning and the wind brisk the five white men who lounged on the poopdeck were scantily clad david grief and his guest gregory mulhall an englishman were still in pajamas their naked feet thrust into chinese slippers the captain and mate were in thin undershirts and unstarched duck pants while the supercargo still held in his hands the undershirt he was reluctant to put on the sweat stood out on his forehead and he seemed to thrust his bare chest thirstily into the wind that did not cool  pretty muggy for a breeze like this he complained  and whats it doing around in the west thats what i want to know was griefs contribution to the general plaint  it wont last and it aint been there long said hermann the holland mate she is been chop around all nightfive minutes here ten minutes there one hour somewhere other quarter  something makin  something makin  captain warfield croaked spreading his bushy beard with the fingers of both hands and shoving the thatch of his chin into the breeze in a vain search for coolness weathers been crazy for a fortnight havent had the proper trades in three weeks everythings mixed up barometer was pumping at sunset last night and its pumping now though the weather sharps say it dont mean anything all the same ive got a prejudice against seeing it pump gets on my nerves sort of you know she was pumping that way the time we lost the lancaster i was only an apprentice but i can remember that well enough brand new fourmasted steel ship first voyage broke the old mans heart hed been forty years in the company just faded way and died the next year  despite the wind and the early hour the heat was suffocating the wind whispered coolness but did not deliver coolness it might have blown off the sahara save for the extreme humidity with which it was laden there was no fog nor mist nor hint of fog or mist yet the dimness of distance produced the impression there were no defined clouds yet so thickly were the heavens covered by a messy cloudpall that the sun failed to shine through  ready about captain warfield ordered with slow sharpness  the brown breechclouted kanaka sailors moved languidly but quickly to headsheets and boomtackles  hard alee  the helmsman ran the spokes over with no hint of gentling and the malahini darted prettily into the wind and about  jove shes a witch was mulhalls appreciation i didnt know you south sea traders sailed yachts  she was a gloucester fisherman originally grief explained and the gloucester boats are all yachts when it comes to build rig and sailing  but youre heading right inwhy dont you make it came the englishmans criticism  try it captain warfield grief suggested show him what a lagoon entrance is on a strong ebb  closeandby the captain ordered  closeandby the kanaka repeated easing half a spoke  the malahini laid squarely into the narrow passage which was the lagoon entrance of a large long and narrow oval of an atoll the atoll was shaped as if three atolls in the course of building had collided and coalesced and failed to rear the partition walls cocoanut palms grew in spots on the circle of sand and there were many gaps where the sand was too low to the sea for cocoanuts and through which could be seen the protected lagoon where the water lay flat like the ruffled surface of a mirror many square miles of water were in the irregular lagoon all of which surged out on the ebb through the one narrow channel so narrow was the channel so large the outflow of water that the passage was more like the rapids of a river than the mere tidal entrance to an atoll the water boiled and whirled and swirled and drove outward in a white foam of stiff serrated waves each heave and blow on her bows of the upstanding waves of the current swung the malahini off the straight lead and wedged her as with wedges of steel toward the side of the passage part way in she was when her closeness to the coral edge compelled her to go about on the opposite tack broadside to the current she swept seaward with the currents speed  nows the time for that new and expensive engine of yours grief jeered goodnaturedly  that the engine was a sore point with captain warfield was patent he had begged and badgered for it until in the end grief had given his consent  it will pay for itself yet the captain retorted you wait and see it beats insurance and you know the underwriters wont stand for insurance in the paumotus  grief pointed to a small cutter beating up astern of them on the same course  ill wager a fivefranc piece the little nuhiva beats us in  sure captain warfield agreed shes overpowered were like a liner alongside of her and weve only got forty horsepower shes got ten horse and shes a little skimming dish she could skate across the froth of hell but just the same she cant buck this current its running ten knots right now  and at the rate of ten knots buffeted and jerkily rolled the malahini went out to sea with the tide  shell slacken in half an hourthen well make headway captain warfield said with an irritation explained by his next words he has no right to call it parlay its down on the admiralty charts and the french charts too as hikihoho bougainville discovered it and named it from the natives  whats the name matter the supercargo demanded taking advantage of speech to pause with arms shoved into the sleeves of the undershirt there it is right under our nose and old parlay is there with the pearls  who see them pearl hermann queried looking from one to another  its well known was the supercargos reply he turned to the steersman taihotauri what about old parlays pearls  the kanaka pleased and selfconscious took and gave a spoke  my brother dive for parlay three four month and he make much talk about pearl hikihoho very good place for pearl  and the pearlbuyers have never got him to part with a pearl the captain broke in  and they say he had a hatful for armande when he sailed for tahiti the supercargo carried on the tale thats fifteen years ago and hes been adding to it ever sincestored the shell as well everybodys seen thathundreds of tons of it they say the lagoons fished clean now maybe thats why hes announced the auction  if he really sells this will be the biggest years output of pearls in the paumotus grief said  i say now look here mulhall burst forth harried by the humid heat as much as the rest of them whats it all about whos the old beachcomber anyway what are all these pearls why so secretious about it  hikihoho belongs to old parlay the supercargo answered hes got a fortune in pearls saved up for years and years and he sent the word out weeks ago that hed auction them off to the buyers tomorrow see those schooners masts sticking up inside the lagoon  eight so i see said hermann  what are they doing in a dinky atoll like this the supercargo went on there isnt a schoonerload of copra a year in the place theyve come for the auction thats why were here thats why the little nuhivas bumping along astern there though what she can buy is beyond me narii herringhes an english jew halfcasteowns and runs her and his only assets are his nerve his debts and his whiskey bills hes a genius in such things he owes so much that there isnt a merchant in papeete who isnt interested in his welfare they go out of their way to throw work in his way theyve got to and a dandy stunt it is for narii now i owe nobody whats the result if i fell down in a fit on the beach theyd let me lie there and die they wouldnt lose anything but narii herringwhat wouldnt they do if he fell in a fit their best wouldnt be too good for him theyve got too much money tied up in him to let him lie theyd take him into their homes and handnurse him like a brother let me tell you honesty in paying bills aint what its cracked up to be  whats this narii chap got to do with it was the englishmans shorttempered demand and turning to grief he said whats all this pearl nonsense begin at the beginning  youll have to help me out grief warned the others as he began old parlay is a character from what ive seen of him i believe hes partly and mildly insane anyway heres the story parlays a fullblooded frenchman he told me once that he came from paris his accent is the true parisian he arrived down here in the old days went to trading and all the rest thats how he got in on hikihoho came in trading when trading was the real thing about a hundred miserable paumotans lived on the island he married the queennative fashion when she died everything was his measles came through and there werent more than a dozen survivors he fed them and worked them and was king now before the queen died she gave birth to a girl thats armande when she was three he sent her to the convent at papeete when she was seven or eight he sent her to france you begin to glimpse the situation the best and most aristocratic convent in france was none too good for the only daughter of a paumotan island king and capitalist and you know the old country french draw no colour line she was educated like a princess and she accepted herself in much the same way also she thought she was allwhite and never dreamed of a bar sinister  now comes the tragedy the old man had always been cranky and erratic and hed played the despot on hikihoho so long that hed got the idea in his head that there was nothing wrong with the kingor the princess either when armande was eighteen he sent for her he had slews and slathers of money as yankee bill would say hed built the big house on hikihoho and a whacking fine bungalow in papeete she was to arrive on the mail boat from new zealand and he sailed in his schooner to meet her at papeete and he might have carried the situation off despite the hens and bullbeasts of papeete if it hadnt been for the hurricane that was the year wasnt it when manuhuhi was swept and eleven hundred drowned  the others nodded and captain warfield said i was in the magpie that blow and we went ashore all hands and the cook magpie and all a quarter of a mile into the cocoanuts at the head of taiohae bayand it a supposedly hurricaneproof harbour  well grief continued old parlay got caught in the same blow and arrived in papeete with his hatful of pearls three weeks too late hed had to jack up his schooner and build half a mile of ways before he could get her back into the sea  and in the meantime there was armande at papeete nobody called on her she did french fashion make the initial calls on the governor and the port doctor they saw her but neither of their henwives was at home to her nor returned the call she was out of caste without caste though she had never dreamed it and that was the gentle way they broke the information to her there was a gay young lieutenant on the french cruiser he lost his heart to her but not his head you can imagine the shock to this young woman refined beautiful raised like an aristocrat pampered with the best of old france that money could buy and you can guess the end he shrugged his shoulders there was a japanese servant in the bungalow he saw it said she did it with the proper spirit of the samurai took a stilettono thrust no drive no wild rush for annihilationtook the stiletto placed the point carefully against her heart and with both hands slowly and steadily pressed home  old parlay arrived after that with his pearls there was one single one of them they say worth sixty thousand francs peter gee saw it and has told me he offered that much for it the old man went clean off for a while they had him straitjacketed in the colonial club two days  his wifes uncle an old paumotan cut him out of the jacket and turned him loose the supercargo corroborated  and then old parlay proceeded to eat things up grief went on pumped three bullets into the scalawag of a lieutenant  who lay in sick bay for three months captain warfield contributed  flung a glass of wine in the governors face fought a duel with the port doctor beat up his native servants wrecked the hospital broke two ribs and the collarbone of a man nurse and escaped and went down to his schooner a gun in each hand daring the chief of police and all the gendarmes to arrest him and sailed for hikihoho and they say hes never left the island since  the supercargo nodded that was fifteen years ago and hes never budged  and added to his pearls said the captain hes a blithering old lunatic makes my flesh creep hes a regular finn  whats that mulhall inquired  bosses the weatherthats what the natives believe at any rate ask taihotauri there hey taihotauri what you think old parlay do along weather  just the same one big weather devil came the kanakas answer i know he want big blow he make big blow he want no wind no wind come  a regular old warlock said mulhall  no good luck them pearl taihotauri blurted out rolling his head ominously he say he sell plenty schooner come then he make big hurricane everybody finish you see all native men say so  its hurricane season now captain warfield laughed morosely theyre not far wrong its making for something right now and id feel better if the malahini was a thousand miles away from here  he is a bit mad grief concluded ive tried to get his point of view itswell its mixed for eighteen years hed centred everything on armande half the time he believes shes still alive not yet come back from france thats one of the reasons he held on to the pearls and all the time he hates white men he never forgets they killed her though a great deal of the time he forgets shes dead hello wheres your wind  the sails bellied emptily overhead and captain warfield grunted his disgust intolerable as the heat had been in the absence of wind it was almost overpowering the sweat oozed out on all their faces and now one and again another drew deep breaths involuntarily questing for more air  here she comes againan eight point haul boomtackles across jump  the kanakas sprang to the captains orders and for five minutes the schooner laid directly into the passage and even gained on the current again the breeze fell flat then puffed from the old quarter compelling a shift back of sheets and tackles  here comes the nuhiva grief said shes got her engine on look at her skim  all ready the captain asked the engineer a portuguese halfcaste whose head and shoulders protruded from the small hatch just forard of the cabin and who wiped the sweat from his face with a bunch of greasy waste  sure he replied  then let her go  the engineer disappeared into his den and a moment later the exhaust muffler coughed and spluttered overside but the schooner could not hold her lead the little cutter made three feet to her two and was quickly alongside and forging ahead only natives were on her deck and the man steering waved his hand in derisive greeting and farewell  thats narii herring grief told mulhall the big fellow at the wheelthe nerviest and most conscienceless scoundrel in the paumotus  five minutes later a cry of joy from their own kanakas centred all eyes on the nuhiva her engine had broken down and they were overtaking her the malahinis sailors sprang into the rigging and jeered as they went by the little cutter heeled over by the wind with a bone in her teeth going backward on the tide  some engine that of ours grief approved as the lagoon opened before them and the course was changed across it to the anchorage  captain warfield was visibly cheered though he merely grunted itll pay for itself never fear  the malahini ran well into the centre of the little fleet ere she found swinging room to anchor  theres isaacs on the dolly grief observed with a hand wave of greeting and peter gees on the roberta couldnt keep him away from a pearl sale like this and theres francini on the cactus theyre all here all the buyers old parlay will surely get a price  they havent repaired the engine yet captain warfield grumbled gleefully  he was looking across the lagoon to where the nuhivas sails showed through the sparse cocoanuts     ii  the house of parlay was a big twostory frame affair built of california lumber with a galvanized iron roof so disproportionate was it to the slender ring of the atoll that it showed out upon the sandstrip and above it like some monstrous excrescence they of the malahini paid the courtesy visit ashore immediately after anchoring other captains and buyers were in the big room examining the pearls that were to be auctioned next day paumotan servants natives of hikihoho and relatives of the owner moved about dispensing whiskey and absinthe and through the curious company moved parlay himself cackling and sneering the withered wreck of what had once been a tall and powerful man his eyes were deep sunken and feverish his cheeks fallen in and cavernous the hair of his head seemed to have come out in patches and his mustache and imperial had shed in the same lopsided way  jove mulhall muttered under his breath a longlegged napoleon the third but burnt out baked and firecrackled and mangy no wonder he crooks his head to one side hes got to keep the balance  goin to have a blow was the old mans greeting to grief you must think a lot of pearls to come a day like this  theyre worth going to inferno for grief laughed genially back running his eyes over the surface of the table covered by the display  other men have already made that journey for them old parlay cackled see this one he pointed to a large perfect pearl the size of a small walnut that lay apart on a piece of chamois they offered me sixty thousand francs for it in tahiti theyll bid as much and more for it tomorrow if they arent blown away well that pearl it was found by my cousin my cousin by marriage he was a native you see also he was a thief he hid it it was mine his cousin who was also my cousinwere all related herekilled him for it and fled away in a cutter to noonau i pursued but the chief of noonau had killed him for it before i got there oh yes there are many dead men represented on the table there have a drink captain your face is not familiar you are new in the islands  its captain robinson of the roberta grief said introducing them  in the meantime mulhall had shaken hands with peter gee  i never fancied there were so many pearls in the world mulhall said  nor have i ever seen so many together at one time peter gee admitted  what ought they to be worth  fifty or sixty thousand poundsand thats to us buyers in paris he shrugged his shoulders and lifted his eyebrows at the incommunicableness of the sum  mulhall wiped the sweat from his eyes all were sweating profusely and breathing hard there was no ice in the drink that was served and whiskey and absinthe went down lukewarm  yes yes parlay was cackling many dead men lie on the table there i know those pearls all of them you see those three perfectly matched arent they a diver from easter island got them for me inside a week next week a shark got him took his arm off and blood poison did the business and that big baroque therenothing muchif im offered twenty francs for it tomorrow ill be in luck it came out of twentytwo fathoms of water the man was from raratonga he broke all diving records he got it out of twentytwo fathoms i saw him and he burst his lungs at the same time or got the bends for he died in two hours he died screaming they could hear him for miles he was the most powerful native i ever saw half a dozen of my divers have died of the bends and more men will die more men will die  oh hush your croaking parlay chided one of the captains it aint going to blow  if i was a strong man i couldnt get up hook and get out fast enough the old man retorted in the falsetto of age not if i was a strong man with the taste for wine yet in my mouth but not you youll all stay i wouldnt advise you if i thought youd go you cant drive buzzards away from the carrion have another drink my brave sailormen well well what men will dare for a few little oyster drops there they are the beauties auction tomorrow at ten sharp old parlays selling out and the buzzards are gatheringold parlay who was a stronger man in his day than any of them and who will see most of them dead yet  if he isnt a vile old beast the supercargo of the malahini whispered to peter gee  what if she does blow said the captain of the dolly hikihohos never been swept  the more reason she will be then captain warfield answered back i wouldnt trust her  whos croaking now grief reproved  id hate to lose that new engine before it paid for itself captain warfield replied gloomily  parlay skipped with astonishing nimbleness across the crowded room to the barometer on the wall  take a look my brave sailormen he cried exultantly  the man nearest read the glass the sobering effect showed plainly on his face  its dropped ten was all he said yet every face went anxious and there was a look as if every man desired immediately to start for the door  listen parlay commanded  in the silence the outer surf seemed to have become unusually loud there was a great rumbling roar  a big sea is beginning to set some one said and there was a movement to the windows where all gathered  through the sparse cocoanuts they gazed seaward an orderly succession of huge smooth seas was rolling down upon the coral shore for some minutes they gazed on the strange sight and talked in low voices and in those few minutes it was manifest to all that the waves were increasing in size it was uncanny this rising sea in a dead calm and their voices unconsciously sank lower old parlay shocked them with his abrupt cackle  there is yet time to get away to sea brave gentlemen you can tow across the lagoon with your whaleboats  its all right old man said darling the mate of the cactus a stalwart youngster of twentyfive the blows to the southward and passing on well not get a whiff of it  an air of relief went through the room conversations were started and the voices became louder several of the buyers even went back to the table to continue the examination of the pearls  parlays shrill cackle rose higher  thats right he encouraged if the world was coming to an end youd go on buying  well buy these tomorrow just the same isaacs assured him  then youll be doing your buying in hell  the chorus of incredulous laughter incensed the old man he turned fiercely on darling  since when have children like you come to the knowledge of storms and who is the man who has plotted the hurricanecourses of the paumotus what books will you find it in i sailed the paumotus before the oldest of you drew breath i know to the eastward the paths of the hurricanes are on so wide a circle they make a straight line to the westward here they make a sharp curve remember your chart how did it happen the hurricane of 91 swept auri and hiolau the curve my brave boy the curve in an hour or two or three at most will come the wind listen to that  a vast rumbling crash shook the coral foundations of the atoll the house quivered to it the native servants with bottles of whiskey and absinthe in their hands shrank together as if for protection and stared with fear through the windows at the mighty wash of the wave lapping far up the beach to the corner of a coprashed  parlay looked at the barometer giggled and leered around at his guests captain warfield strode across to see  2975 he read shes gone down five more by god the old devils right shes acoming and its me for one for aboard  its growing dark isaacs half whispered  jove its like a stage mulhall said to grief looking at his watch ten oclock in the morning and its like twilight down go the lights for the tragedy wheres the slow music  in answer another rumbling crash shook the atoll and the house almost in a panic the company started for the door in the dim light their sweaty faces appeared ghastly isaacs panted asthmatically in the suffocating heat  whats your haste parlay chuckled and girded at his departing guests a last drink brave gentlemen no one noticed him as they took the shellbordered path to the beach he stuck his head out the door and called dont forget gentlemen at ten tomorrow old parlay sells his pearls     iii  on the beach a curious scene took place whaleboat after whaleboat was being hurriedly manned and shoved off it had grown still darker the stagnant calm continued and the sand shook under their feet with each buffet of the sea on the outer shore narii herring walked leisurely along the sand he grinned at the very evident haste of the captains and buyers with him were three of his kanakas and also taihotauri  get into the boat and take an oar captain warfield ordered the latter  taihotauri came over jauntily while narii herring and his three kanakas paused and looked on from forty feet away  i work no more for you skipper taihotauri said insolently and loudly but his face belied his words for he was guilty of a prodigious wink fire me skipper he huskily whispered with a second significant wink  captain warfield took the cue and proceeded to do some acting himself he raised his fist and his voice  get into that boat he thundered or ill knock seven bells out of you  the kanaka drew back truculently and grief stepped between to placate his captain  i go to work on the nuhiva taihotauri said rejoining the other group  come back here the captain threatened  hes a free man skipper narii herring spoke up hes sailed with me in the past and hes sailing again thats all  come on we must get on board grief urged look how dark its getting  captain warfield gave in but as the boat shoved off he stood up in the sternsheets and shook his fist ashore  ill settle with you yet narii he cried youre the only skipper in the group that steals other mens sailors he sat down and in lowered voice queried now whats taihotauri up to hes on to something but what is it     iv  as the boat came alongside the malahini hermanns anxious face greeted them over the rail  bottom out fall from barometer he announced shes goin to blow i got starboard anchor overhaul  overhaul the big one too captain warfield ordered taking charge and here some of you hoist in this boat lower her down to the deck and lash her bottom up  men were busy at work on the decks of all the schooners there was a great clanking of chains being overhauled and now one craft and now another hove in veered and dropped a second anchor like the malahini those that had third anchors were preparing to drop them when the wind showed what quarter it was to blow from  the roar of the big surf continually grew though the lagoon lay in the mirrorlike calm  there was no sign of life where parlays big house perched on the sand boat and coprasheds and the sheds where the shell was stored were deserted  for two cents id up anchors and get out grief said id do it anyway if it were open sea but those chains of atolls to the north and east have us pocketed weve a better chance right here what do you think captain warfield  i agree with you though a lagoon is no millpond for riding it out i wonder where shes going to start from hello there goes one of parlays coprasheds  they could see the grassthatched shed lift and collapse while a froth of foam cleared the crest of the sand and ran down to the lagoon  breached across mulhall exclaimed thats something for a starter there she comes again  the wreck of the shed was now flung up and left on the sandcrest a third wave buffeted it into fragments which washed down the slope toward the lagoon  if she blow i would as be cooler yet hermann grunted no longer can i breathe it is damn hot i am dry like a stove  he chopped open a drinking cocoanut with his heavy sheathknife and drained the contents the rest of them followed his example pausing once to watch one of parlays shell sheds go down in ruin the barometer now registered 2950  must be pretty close to the centre of the area of low pressure grief remarked cheerfully i was never through the eye of a hurricane before it will be an experience for you too mulhall from the speed the barometers dropped its going to be a big one  captain warfield groaned and all eyes drew to him he was looking through the glasses down the length of the lagoon to the southeast  there she comes he said quietly  they did not need glasses to see a flying film strangely marked seemed drawing over the surface of the lagoon abreast of it along the atoll travelling with equal speed was a stiff bending of the cocoanut palms and a blur of flying leaves the front of the wind on the water was a solid sharply defined strip of darkcoloured windvexed water in advance of this strip like skirmishers were flashes of windflaws behind this strip a quarter of a mile in width was a strip of what seemed glassy calm next came another dark strip of wind and behind that the lagoon was all crisping boiling whiteness  what is that calm streak mulhall asked  calm warfield answered  but it travels as fast as the wind was the others objection  it has to or it would be overtaken and it wouldnt be any calm its a doubleheader i saw a big squall like that off savaii once a regular doubleheader smash it hit us then it lulled to nothing and smashed us a second time stand by and hold on here she is on top of us look at the roberta  the roberta lying nearest to the wind at slack chains was swept off broadside like a straw then her chains brought her up bow on to the wind with an astonishing jerk schooner after schooner the malahini with them was now sweeping away with the first gust and fetching up on taut chains mulhall and several of the kanakas were taken off their feet when the malahini jerked to her anchors  and then there was no wind the flying calm streak had reached them grief lighted a match and the unshielded flame burned without flickering in the still air a very dim twilight prevailed the cloudsky lowering as it had been for hours seemed now to have descended quite down upon the sea  the roberta tightened to her chains when the second head of the hurricane hit as did schooner after schooner in swift succession the sea white with fury boiled in tiny spitting wavelets the deck of the malahini vibrated under the mens feet the tautstretched halyards beat a tattoo against the masts and all the rigging as if smote by some mighty hand set up a wild thrumming it was impossible to face the wind and breathe mulhall crouching with the others behind the shelter of the cabin discovered this and his lungs were filled in an instant with so great a volume of driven air which he could not expel that he nearly strangled ere he could turn his head away  its incredible he gasped but no one heard him  hermann and several kanakas were crawling forard on hands and knees to let go the third anchor grief touched captain warfield and pointed to the roberta she was dragging down upon them warfield put his mouth to griefs ear and shouted  were dragging too  grief sprang to the wheel and put it hard over veering the mahhini to port the third anchor took hold and the roberta went by sternfirst a dozen yards away they waved their hands to peter gee and captain robinson who with a number of sailors were at work on the bow  hes knocking out the shackles grief shouted going to chance the passage got to anchors skating  were holding now came the answering shout there goes the cactus down on the misi that settles them  the misi had been holding but the added windage of the cactus was too much and the entangled schooners slid away across the boiling white their men could be seen chopping and fighting to get them apart the roberta cleared of her anchors with a patch of tarpaulin set forard was heading for the passage at the northwestern end of the lagoon they saw her make it and drive out to sea but the misi and cactus unable to get clear of each other went ashore on the atoll half a mile from the passage the wind merely increased on itself and continued to increase to face the full blast of it required all ones strength and several minutes of crawling on deck against it tired a man to exhaustion hermann with his kanakas plodded steadily lashing and making secure putting ever more gaskets on the sails the wind ripped and tore their thin undershirts from their backs they moved slowly as if their bodies weighed tons never releasing a handhold until another had been secured loose ends of rope stood out stiffly horizontal and when a whipping gave the loose end frazzled and blew away  mulhall touched one and then another and pointed to the shore the grasssheds had disappeared and parlays house rocked drunkenly because the wind blew lengthwise along the atoll the house had been sheltered by the miles of cocoanut trees but the big seas breaking across from outside were undermining it and hammering it to pieces already tilted down the slope of sand its end was imminent here and there in the cocoanut trees people had lashed themselves the trees did not sway or thresh about bent over rigidly from the wind they remained in that position and vibrated monstrously underneath across the sand surged the white spume of the breakers a big sea was likewise making down the length of the lagoon it had plenty of room to kick up in the tenmile stretch from the windward rim of the atoll and all the schooners were bucking and plunging into it the malahini had begun shoving her bow and focsle head under the bigger ones and at times her waist was filled railhigh with water  nows the time for your engine grief bellowed and captain warfield crawling over to where the engineer lay shouted emphatic commands  under the engine going full speed ahead the malahini behaved better while she continued to ship seas over her bow she was not jerked down so fiercely by her anchors on the other hand she was unable to get any slack in the chains the best her forty horsepower could do was to ease the strain  still the wind increased the little nuhiva lying abreast of the malahini and closer in to the beach her engine still unrepaired and her captain ashore was having a bad time of it she buried herself so frequently and so deeply that they wondered each time if she could clear herself of the water at three in the afternoon buried by a second sea before she could free herself of the preceding one she did not come up  mulhall looked at grief  burst in her hatches was the bellowed answer  captain warfield pointed to the winifred a little schooner plunging and burying outside of them and shouted in griefs ear his voice came in patches of dim words with intervals of silence when whisked away by the roaring wind  rotten little tub anchors hold but how she holds together old as the ark  an hour later hermann pointed to her her forard bitts foremast and most of her bow were gone having been jerked out of her by her anchors she swung broadside rolling in the trough and settling by the head and in this plight was swept away to leeward  five vessels now remained and of them the malahini was the only one with an engine fearing either the nuhivas or the winifdreds fate two of them followed the robertas example knocking out the chainshackles and running for the passage the dolly was the first but her tarpaulin was carried away and she went to destruction on the leerim of the atoll near the misi and the cactus undeterred by this the moana let go and followed with the same result  pretty good engine that eh captain warfield yelled to his owner  grief put out his hand and shook shes paying for herself he yelled back the winds shifting around to the southward and we ought to lie easier  slowly and steadily but with everincreasing velocity the wind veered around to the south and the southwest till the three schooners that were left pointed directly in toward the beach the wreck of parlays house was picked up hurled into the lagoon and blown out upon them passing the malahini it crashed into the papara lying a quarter of a mile astern there was wild work forard on her and in a quarter of an hour the house went clear but it had taken the paparas foremast and bowsprit with it  inshore on their port bow lay the tahaa slim and yachtlike but excessively oversparred her anchors still held but her captain finding no abatement in the wind proceeded to reduce windage by chopping down his masts  pretty good engine that grief congratulated his skipper it will save our sticks for us yet  captain warfield shook his head dubiously  the sea on the lagoon went swiftly down with the change of wind but they were beginning to feel the heave and lift of the outer sea breaking across the atoll there were not so many trees remaining some had been broken short off others uprooted one tree they saw snap off halfway up three persons clinging to it and whirl away by the wind into the lagoon two detached themselves from it and swam to the tahaa not long after just before darkness they saw one jump overboard from that schooners stern and strike out strongly for the malahini through the white spitting wavelets  its taihotauri was griefs judgment now well have the news  the kanaka caught the bobstay climbed over the bow and crawled aft time was given him to breathe and then behind the part shelter of the cabin in broken snatches and largely by signs he told his story  narii damn robber he want steal pearls kill parlay one man kill parlay no man know what man three kanakas narii me five beans hat narii say one bean black nobody know kill parlay narii damn liar all beans black five black coprashed dark every man get black bean big wind come no chance everybody get up tree no good luck them pearls i tell you before no good luck  wheres parlay grief shouted  up tree three of his kanakas same tree narii and one kanakanother tree my tree blow to hell then i come on board  wheres the pearls  up tree along parlay mebbe narii get them pearl yet  in the ear of one after another grief passed on taihotauris story captain warfield was particularly incensed and they could see him grinding his teeth  hermann went below and returned with a riding light but the moment it was lifted above the level of the cabin wall the wind blew it out he had better success with the binnacle lamp which was lighted only after many collective attempts  a fine night of wind grief yelled in mulhalls ear and blowing harder all the time  how hard  a hundred miles an hour two hundred i dont know harder than ive ever seen it  the lagoon grew more and more troubled by the sea that swept across the atoll hundreds of leagues of ocean was being backed up by the hurricane which more than overcame the lowering effect of the ebb tide immediately the tide began to rise the increase in the size of the seas was noticeable moon and wind were heaping the south pacific on hikihoho atoll  captain warfield returned from one of his periodical trips to the engine room with the word that the engineer lay in a faint  cant let that engine stop he concluded helplessly  all right grief said bring him on deck ill spell him  the hatch to the engine room was battened down access being gained through a narrow passage from the cabin the heat and gas fumes were stifling grief took one hasty comprehensive examination of the engine and the fittings of the tiny room then blew out the oillamp after that he worked in darkness save for the glow from endless cigars which he went into the cabin to light eventempered as he was he soon began to give evidences of the strain of being pent in with a mechanical monster that toiled and sobbed and slubbered in the shouting dark naked to the waist covered with grease and oil bruised and skinned from being knocked about by the plunging jumping vessel his head swimming from the mixture of gas and air he was compelled to breathe he laboured on hour after hour in turns petting blessing nursing and cursing the engine and all its parts the ignition began to go bad the feed grew worse and worst of all the cylinders began to heat in a consultation held in the cabin the halfcaste engineer begged and pleaded to stop the engine for half an hour in order to cool it and to attend to the water circulation captain warfield was against any stopping the halfcaste swore that the engine would ruin itself and stop anyway and for good grief with glaring eyes greasy and battered yelled and cursed them both down and issued commands mulhall the supercargo and hermann were set to work in the cabin at doublestraining and triplestraining the gasoline a hole was chopped through the engine room floor and a kanaka heaved bilgewater over the cylinders while grief continued to souse running parts in oil  didnt know you were a gasoline expert captain warfield admired when grief came into the cabin to catch a breath of little less impure air  i bathe in gasoline he grated savagely through his teeth i eat it  what other uses he might have found for it were never given for at that moment all the men in the cabin as well as the gasoline being strained were smashed forward against the bulkhead as the malahini took an abrupt deep dive for the space of several minutes unable to gain their feet they rolled back and forth and pounded and hammered from wall to wall the schooner swept by three big seas creaked and groaned and quivered and from the weight of water on her decks behaved logily grief crept to the engine while captain warfield waited his chance to get through the companionway and out on deck  it was half an hour before he came back  whaleboats gone he reported galleys gone everything gone except the deck and hatches and if that engine hadnt been going wed be gone keep up the good work  by midnight the engineers lungs and head had been sufficiently cleared of gas fumes to let him relieve grief who went on deck to get his own head and lungs clear he joined the others who crouched behind the cabin holding on with their hands and made doubly secure by ropelashings it was a complicated huddle for it was the only place of refuge for the kanakas some of them had accepted the skippers invitation into the cabin but had been driven out by the fumes the malahini was being plunged down and swept frequently and what they breathed was air and spray and water commingled  making heavy weather of it mulhall grief shouted to his guest between immersions  mulhall strangling and choking could only nod the scuppers could not carry off the burden of water on the schooners deck she rolled it out and took it in over one rail and the other and at times nose thrown skyward sitting down on her heel she avalanched it aft it surged along the poop gangways poured over the top of the cabin submerging and bruising those that clung on and went out over the sternrail  mulhall saw him first and drew griefs attention it was narii herring crouching and holding on where the dim binnacle light shone upon him he was quite naked save for a belt and a barebladed knife thrust between it and the skin  captain warfield untied his lashings and made his way over the bodies of the others when his face became visible in the light from the binnacle it was working with anger they could see him speak but the wind tore the sound away he would not put his lips to nariis ear instead he pointed over the side narii herring understood his white teeth showed in an amused and sneering smile and he stood up a magnificent figure of a man  its murder mulhall yelled to grief  hed have murdered old parlay grief yelled back  for the moment the poop was clear of water and the malahini on an even keel narii made a bravado attempt to walk to the rail but was flung down by the wind thereafter he crawled disappearing in the darkness though there was certitude in all of them that he had gone over the side the malahini dived deep and when they emerged from the flood that swept aft grief got mulhalls ear  cant lose him hes the fish man of tahiti hell cross the lagoon and land on the other rim of the atoll if theres any atoll left  five minutes afterward in another submergence a mess of bodies poured down on them over the top of the cabin these they seized and held till the water cleared when they carried them below and learned their identity old parlay lay oh his back on the floor with closed eyes and without movement the other two were his kanaka cousins all three were naked and bloody the arm of one kanaka hung helpless and broken at his side the other man bled freely from a hideous scalp wound  narii did that mulhall demanded  grief shook his head no its from being smashed along the deck and over the house  something suddenly ceased leaving them in dizzying uncertainty for the moment it was hard to realize there was no wind with the absolute abruptness of a sword slash the wind had been chopped off the schooner rolled and plunged fetching up on her anchors with a crash which for the first time they could hear also for the first time they could hear the water washing about on deck the engineer threw off the propeller and eased the engine down  were in the dead centre grief said now for the shift it will come as hard as ever he looked at the barometer 2932 he read  not in a moment could he tone down the voice which for hours had battled against the wind and so loudly did he speak that in the quiet it hurt the others ears  all his ribs are smashed the supercargo said feeling along parlays side hes still breathing but hes a goner  old parlay groaned moved one arm impotently and opened his eyes in them was the light of recognition  my brave gentlemen he whispered haltingly dont forget the auction at ten oclock in hell  his eyes dropped shut and the lower jaw threatened to drop but he mastered the qualms of dissolution long enough to omit one final loud derisive cackle  above and below pandemonium broke out  the old familiar roar of the wind was with them the malahini caught broadside was pressed down almost on her beam ends as she swung the arc compelled by her anchors they rounded her into the wind where she jerked to an even keel the propeller was thrown on and the engine took up its work again  northwest captain warfield shouted to grief when he came on deck hauled eight points like a shot  nariill never get across the lagoon now grief observed  then hell blow back to our side worse luck     v  after the passing of the centre the barometer began to rise equally rapid was the fall of the wind when it was no more than a howling gale the engine lifted up in the air parted its bedplates with a last convulsive effort of its forty horsepower and lay down on its side a wash of water from the bilge sizzled over it and the steam arose in clouds the engineer wailed his dismay but grief glanced over the wreck affectionately and went into the cabin to swab the grease off his chest and arms with bunches of cotton waste  the sun was up and the gentlest of summer breezes blowing when he came on deck after sewing up the scalp of one kanaka and setting the others arm the malahini lay close in to the beach forard hermann and the crew were heaving in and straightening out the tangle of anchors the papara and the tahaa were gone and captain warfield through the glasses was searching the opposite rim of the atoll  not a stick left of them he said thats what comes of not having engines they must have dragged across before the big shift came  ashore where parlays house had been was no vestige of any house for the space of three hundred yards where the sea had breached no tree or even stump was left here and there farther along stood an occasional palm and there were numbers which had been snapped off above the ground in the crown of one surviving palm taihotauri asserted he saw something move there were no boats left to the malahini and they watched him swim ashore and climb the tree  when he came back they helped over the rail a young native girl of parleys household but first she passed up to them a battered basket in it was a litter of blind kittensall dead save one that feebly mewed and staggered on awkward legs  hello said mulhall whos that  along the beach they saw a man walking he moved casually as if out for a morning stroll captain warfield gritted his teeth it was narii herring  hello skipper narii called when he was abreast of them can i come aboard and get some breakfast  captain warfields face and neck began to swell and turn purple he tried to speak but choked  for two centsfor two cents was all he could manage to articulate   the end
