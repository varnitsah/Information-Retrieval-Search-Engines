phantasmagoria   canto i  the trystyng    one winter night at halfpast nine       cold tired and cross and muddy   i had come home too late to dine   and supper with cigars and wine       was waiting in the study    there was a strangeness in the room       and something white and wavy   was standing near me in the gloom   i took it for the carpetbroom       left by that careless slavey  illustration    but presently the thing began       to shiver and to sneeze   on which i said come come my man   thats a most inconsiderate plan       less noise there if you please    ive caught a cold the thing replies       out there upon the landing   i turned to look in some surprise   and there before my very eyes       a little ghost was standing    he trembled when he caught my eye       and got behind a chair   how came you here i said and why   i never saw a thing so shy       come out dont shiver there    he said id gladly tell you how       and also tell you why   but here he gave a little bow   youre in so bad a temper now       youd think it all a lie    and as to being in a fright       allow me to remark   that ghosts have just as good a right   in every way to fear the light       as men to fear the dark    no plea said i can well excuse       such cowardice in you   for ghosts can visit when they choose   whereas we humans cant refuse       to grant the interview    he said a flutter of alarm       is not unnatural is it   i really feared you meant some harm   but now i see that you are calm       let me explain my visit    houses are classed i beg to state       according to the number   of ghosts that they accommodate   the tenant merely counts as weight       with coals and other lumber    this is a oneghost house and you       when you arrived last summer   may have remarked a spectre who   was doing all that ghosts can do       to welcome the newcomer    in villas this is always done       however cheaply rented   for though of course theres less of fun   when there is only room for one       ghosts have to be contented    that spectre left you on the third       since then youve not been haunted   for as he never sent us word   twas quite by accident we heard       that any one was wanted    a spectre has first choice by right       in filling up a vacancy   then phantom goblin elf and sprite   if all these fail them they invite       the nicest ghoul that they can see    the spectres said the place was low       and that you kept bad wine   so as a phantom had to go   and i was first of course you know       i couldnt well decline    no doubt said i they settled who       was fittest to be sent   yet still to choose a brat like you   to haunt a man of fortytwo       was no great compliment    im not so young sir he replied       as you might think the fact is   in caverns by the waterside   and other places that ive tried       ive had a lot of practice    but i have never taken yet       a strict domestic part   and in my flurry i forget   the five good rules of etiquette       we have to know by heart    my sympathies were warming fast       towards the little fellow   he was so utterly aghast   at having found a man at last       and looked so scared and yellow  illustration in caverns by the waterside    at least i said im glad to find       a ghost is not a dumb thing   but pray sit down youll feel inclined   if like myself you have not dined       to take a snack of something    though certainly you dont appear       a thing to offer food to   and then i shall be glad to hear   if you will say them loud and clear       the rules that you allude to    thanks you shall hear them by and by       this is a piece of luck   what may i offer you said i   well since you are so kind ill try       a little bit of duck    one slice and may i ask you for       another drop of gravy   i sat and looked at him in awe   for certainly i never saw       a thing so white and wavy  illustration    and still he seemed to grow more white       more vapoury and wavier   seen in the dim and flickering light   as he proceeded to recite       his maxims of behaviour   canto ii  hys fyve rules    my firstbut dont suppose he said       im setting you a riddle   isif your victim be in bed   dont touch the curtains at his head       but take them in the middle    and wave them slowly in and out       while drawing them asunder   and in a minutes time no doubt   hell raise his head and look about       with eyes of wrath and wonder    and here you must on no pretence       make the first observation   wait for the victim to commence   no ghost of any common sense       begins a conversation  illustration    if he should say how came you here       the way that you began sir   in such a case your course is clear   on the bats back my little dear       is the appropriate answer    if after this he says no more       youd best perhaps curtail your   exertionsgo and shake the door   and then if he begins to snore       youll know the things a failure    by day if he should be alone       at home or on a walk   you merely give a hollow groan   to indicate the kind of tone       in which you mean to talk    but if you find him with his friends       the thing is rather harder   in such a case success depends   on picking up some candleends       or butter in the larder    with this you make a kind of slide       it answers best with suet   on which you must contrive to glide   and swing yourself from side to side       one soon learns how to do it    the second tells us what is right       in ceremonious calls   first burn a blue or crimson light   a thing i quite forgot tonight       then scratch the door or walls  illustration and swing yourself from side to side    i said youll visit here no more       if you attempt the guy   ill have no bonfires on my floor   and as for scratching at the door       id like to see you try    the third was written to protect       the interests of the victim   and tells us as i recollect   to treat him with a grave respect       and not to contradict him    thats plain said i as tare and tret       to any comprehension   i only wish some ghosts ive met   would not so constantly forget       the maxim that you mention    perhaps he said you first transgressed       the laws of hospitality   all ghosts instinctively detest   the man that fails to treat his guest       with proper cordiality  illustration    if you address a ghost as thing       or strike him with a hatchet   he is permitted by the king   to drop all formal parleying       and then youre sure to catch it    the fourth prohibits trespassing       where other ghosts are quartered   and those convicted of the thing   unless when pardoned by the king       must instantly be slaughtered    that simply means be cut up small       ghosts soon unite anew   the process scarcely hurts at all   not more than when youre what you call       cut up by a review    the fifth is one you may prefer       that i should quote entire   the king must be addressed as sir   this from a simple courtier       is all the laws require    but should you wish to do the thing       with outandout politeness   accost him as my goblin king   and always use in answering       the phrase your royal whiteness    im getting rather hoarse i fear       after so much reciting   so if you dont object my dear   well try a glass of bitter beer       i think it looks inviting  illustration   canto iii  scarmoges    and did you really walk said i       on such a wretched night   i always fancied ghosts could fly   if not exactly in the sky       yet at a fairish height    its very well said he for kings       to soar above the earth   but phantoms often find that wings   like many other pleasant things       cost more than they are worth    spectres of course are rich and so       can buy them from the elves   but we prefer to keep below   theyre stupid company you know       for any but themselves  illustration    for though they claim to be exempt       from pride they treat a phantom   as something quite beneath contempt   just as no turkey ever dreamt       of noticing a bantam    they seem too proud said i to go       to houses such as mine   pray how did they contrive to know   so quickly that the place was low       and that i kept bad wine    inspector kobold came to you       the little ghost began   here i broke ininspector who   inspecting ghosts is something new       explain yourself my man    his name is kobold said my guest       one of the spectre order   youll very often see him dressed   in a yellow gown a crimson vest       and a nightcap with a border    he tried the brocken business first       but caught a sort of chill   so came to england to be nursed   and here it took the form of thirst       which he complains of still  illustration and here it took the form of thirst    portwine he says when rich and sound       warms his old bones like nectar   and as the inns where it is found   are his especial huntingground       we call him the innspectre    i bore itbore it like a man       this agonizing witticism   and nothing could be sweeter than   my temper till the ghost began       some most provoking criticism    cooks need not be indulged in waste       yet still youd better teach them   dishes should have some sort of taste   pray why are all the cruets placed       where nobody can reach them    that man of yours will never earn       his living as a waiter   is that queer thing supposed to burn   its far too dismal a concern       to call a moderator    the duck was tender but the peas       were very much too old   and just remember if you please   the next time you have toasted cheese       dont let them send it cold    youd find the bread improved i think       by getting better flour   and have you anything to drink   that looks a little less like ink       and isnt quite so sour    then peering round with curious eyes       he muttered goodness gracious   and so went on to criticise   your rooms an inconvenient size       its neither snug nor spacious    that narrow window i expect       serves but to let the dusk in   but please said i to recollect   twas fashioned by an architect       who pinned his faith on ruskin    i dont care who he was sir or       on whom he pinned his faith   constructed by whatever law   so poor a job i never saw       as im a living wraith    what a remarkable cigar       how much are they a dozen   i growled no matter what they are   youre getting as familiar       as if you were my cousin    now thats a thing i will not stand       and so i tell you flat   aha said he were getting grand   taking a bottle in his hand       ill soon arrange for that    and here he took a careful aim       and gaily cried here goes   i tried to dodge it as it came   but somehow caught it all the same       exactly on my nose    and i remember nothing more       that i can clearly fix   till i was sitting on the floor   repeating two and five are four       but five and two are six    what really passed i never learned       nor guessed i only know   that when at last my sense returned   the lamp neglected dimly burned       the fire was getting low    through driving mists i seemed to see       a thing that smirked and smiled   and found that he was giving me   a lesson in biography       as if i were a child  illustration   canto iv  hys nouryture    oh when i was a little ghost       a merry time had we   each seated on his favourite post   we chumped and chawed the buttered toast       they gave us for our tea    that story is in print i cried       dont say its not because   its known as well as bradshaws guide   the ghost uneasily replied       he hardly thought it was    its not in nursery rhymes and yet       i almost think it is   three little ghosteses were set   on posteses you know and ate       their buttered toasteses    i have the book so if you doubt it       i turned to search the shelf   dont stir he cried well do without it   i now remember all about it       i wrote the thing myself    it came out in a monthly or       at least my agent said it did   some literary swell who saw   it thought it seemed adapted for       the magazine he edited    my father was a brownie sir       my mother was a fairy   the notion had occurred to her   the children would be happier       if they were taught to vary    the notion soon became a craze       and when it once began she   brought us all out in different ways   one was a pixy two were fays       another was a banshee    the fetch and kelpie went to school       and gave a lot of trouble   next came a poltergeist and ghoul   and then two trolls which broke the rule       a goblin and a double    if thats a snuffbox on the shelf       he added with a yawn   ill take a pinchnext came an elf   and then a phantom thats myself       and last a leprechaun    one day some spectres chanced to call       dressed in the usual white   i stood and watched them in the hall   and couldnt make them out at all       they seemed so strange a sight  illustration    i wondered what on earth they were       that looked all head and sack   but mother told me not to stare   and then she twitched me by the hair       and punched me in the back    since then ive often wished that i       had been a spectre born   but whats the use he heaved a sigh   they are the ghostnobility       and look on us with scorn    my phantomlife was soon begun       when i was barely six   i went out with an older one   and just at first i thought it fun       and learned a lot of tricks    ive haunted dungeons castles towers       wherever i was sent   ive often sat and howled for hours   drenched to the skin with driving showers       upon a battlement    its quite oldfashioned now to groan       when you begin to speak   this is the newest thing in tone   and here it chilled me to the bone       he gave an awful squeak    perhaps he added to your ear       that sounds an easy thing   try it yourself my little dear   it took me something like a year       with constant practising    and when youve learned to squeak my man       and caught the double sob   youre pretty much where you began   just try and gibber if you can       thats something like a job    ive tried it and can only say       im sure you couldnt do it e   ven if you practised night and day   unless you have a turn that way       and natural ingenuity    shakspeare i think it is who treats       of ghosts in days of old   who gibbered in the roman streets   dressed if you recollect in sheets       they must have found it cold    ive often spent ten pounds on stuff       in dressing as a double   but though it answers as a puff   it never has effect enough       to make it worth the trouble    long bills soon quenched the little thirst       i had for being funny   the settingup is always worst   such heaps of things you want at first       one must be made of money  illustration    for instance take a haunted tower       with skull crossbones and sheet   blue lights to burn say two an hour   condensing lens of extra power       and set of chains complete    what with the things you have to hire       the fitting on the robe   and testing all the coloured fire   the outfit of itself would tire       the patience of a job    and then theyre so fastidious       the hauntedhouse committee   ive often known them make a fuss   because a ghost was french or russ       or even from the city    some dialects are objected to       for one the irish brogue is   and then for all you have to do   one pound a week they offer you       and find yourself in bogies   canto v  byckerment    dont they consult the victims though       i said they should by rights   give them a chancebecause you know   the tastes of people differ so       especially in sprites    the phantom shook his head and smiled       consult them not a bit   twould be a job to drive one wild   to satisfy one single child       thered be no end to it    of course you cant leave children free       said i to pick and choose   but in the case of men like me   i think mine host might fairly be       allowed to state his views    he said it really wouldnt pay       folk are so full of fancies   we visit for a single day   and whether then we go or stay       depends on circumstances    and though we dont consult mine host       before the things arranged   still if he often quits his post   or is not a wellmannered ghost       then you can have him changed    but if the hosts a man like you       i mean a man of sense   and if the house is not too new   why what has that said i to do       with ghosts convenience    a new house does not suit you know       its such a job to trim it   but after twenty years or so   the wainscotings begin to go       so twenty is the limit    to trim was not a phrase i could       remember having heard   perhaps i said youll be so good   as tell me what is understood       exactly by that word  illustration    it means the loosening all the doors       the ghost replied and laughed   it means the drilling holes by scores   in all the skirtingboards and floors       to make a thorough draught    youll sometimes find that one or two       are all you really need   to let the wind come whistling through   but here therell be a lot to do       i faintly gasped indeed    if id been rather later ill       be bound i added trying   most unsuccessfully to smile   youd have been busy all this while       trimming and beautifying    why no said he perhaps i should       have stayed another minute   but still no ghost thats any good   without an introduction would       have ventured to begin it    the proper thing as you were late       was certainly to go   but with the roads in such a state   i got the knightmayors leave to wait       for half an hour or so    whos the knightmayor i cried instead       of answering my question   well if you dont know that he said   either you never go to bed       or youve a grand digestion    he goes about and sits on folk       that eat too much at night   his duties are to pinch and poke   and squeeze them till they nearly choke       i said it serves them right    and folk that sup on things like these       he muttered eggs and bacon   lobsterand duckand toasted cheese   if they dont get an awful squeeze       im very much mistaken    he is immensely fat and so       well suits the occupation   in point of fact if you must know   we used to call him years ago       the mayor and corporation  illustration he goes about and sits on folk    the day he was elected mayor       i know that every sprite meant   to vote for me but did not dare   he was so frantic with despair       and furious with excitement  illustration    when it was over for a whim       he ran to tell the king   and being the reverse of slim   a twomile trot was not for him       a very easy thing    so to reward him for his run       as it was baking hot   and he was over twenty stone   the king proceeded half in fun       to knight him on the spot    twas a great liberty to take       i fired up like a rocket   he did it just for punnings sake   the man says johnson that would make       a pun would pick a pocket    a man said he is not a king       i argued for a while   and did my best to prove the thing   the phantom merely listening       with a contemptuous

keeps his eye   on one small hut against the sky       wherein he hopes to rest    who climbs till nerve and force are spent       with many a puff and pant   who still as rises the ascent   in language grows more violent       although in breath more scant  illustration    who climbing gains at length the place       that crowns the upward track   and entering with unsteady pace   receives

keeping still the end in view       to which i hoped to come   i strove to prove the matter true   by putting everything i knew       into an axiom    commencing every single phrase       with therefore or because   i blindly reeled a hundred ways   about the syllogistic maze       unconscious where i was    quoth he thats regular claptrap       dont bluster any more   now do be cool and

the asses    to walk four miles through mud and rain       to spend the night in smoking   and then to find that its in vain   and ive to do it all again       its really too provoking  illustration    dont talk he cried as i began       to mutter some excuse   who can have patience with a man   thats got no more discretion than       an idiotic goose    to keep me waiting here instead       of telling me at once   that this was not the house he said   there thatll dobe off to bed       dont gape like that you dunce    its very fine to throw the blame       on me in such a fashion   why didnt you enquire my name   the very minute that you came       i answered in a passion    of course it worries you a bit       to come so far on foot   but how was i to blame for it   well well said

goodnight       when i am gone perhaps   theyll send you some inferior sprite   wholl keep you in a constant fright       and spoil your soundest naps    tell him youll stand no sort of trick       then if he leers and chuckles   you just be handy with a stick   mind that its pretty hard and thick       and rap him on the knuckles    then carelessly remark old coon       perhaps youre not aware   that if you dont behave youll soon   be chuckling to another tune       and so youd best take care    thats the right way to cure a sprite       of suchlike goingson   but gracious me its getting

but soon a gentler feeling crept   upon me and i sat and wept       an hour or so like winking    no need for bones to hurry so       i sobbed in fact i doubt   if it was worth his while to go   and who is tibbs id like to know       to make such work about    if tibbs is anything like me       its possible i said   he wont be overpleased to be   dropped in upon at halfpast three       after hes

but after such a splendid word   i felt that it would be absurd       to try it any farther    so with a yawn i went my way       to seek the welcome downy   and slept and dreamed till break of day   of poltergeist and fetch and fay       and leprechaun and brownie    for years ive not been visited       by any kind of sprite   yet still they echo in my head   those parting words so kindly said

sea    beat a dog till it howls outright     cruel but all very well for a spree   suppose that he did so day and night         that would be like the sea    i had a vision of nurserymaids     tens of thousands passed by me   all leading children with wooden spades         and this was by the sea    who invented those spades of wood     who was it cut them out of the tree   none i think but an idiot could         or one that loved the sea    it is pleasant and dreamy no doubt to float     with thoughts as boundless and souls as free   but suppose you are very unwell in the boat         how do you like the sea  illustration and this was by the sea    there is an insect that people avoid     whence is derived the verb to flee   where have you been by it most annoyed         in lodgings by the sea    if you like your coffee with sand for dregs     a decided hint of salt in your tea   and a fishy taste in the very eggs         by all means choose the sea    and if with these dainties to drink and eat     you prefer not a vestige of grass or tree   and a chronic state of wet in your feet       theni recommend the sea    for i have friends who dwell by the coast     pleasant friends they are to me   it is when i am with them i wonder most         that any one likes the sea    they take me a walk though tired and stiff     to climb the heights i madly agree   and after a tumble or so from the cliff         they kindly suggest the sea    i try the rocks and i think it cool     that they laugh with such an excess of glee   as i heavily slip into every pool         that skirts the

what is known to be so easy any fairly practised writer with the slightest ear for rhythm could compose for hours together in the easy running metre of the song of hiawatha having then distinctly stated that i challenge no attention in the following little poem to its merely verbal jingle i must beg the candid reader to confine his criticism to its treatment of the subject     from his shoulder hiawatha   took the camera of rosewood   made of sliding folding rosewood   neatly put it all together   in its case it lay compactly   folded into nearly nothing   but he opened out the hinges   pushed and pulled the joints and hinges   till it looked all squares and oblongs   like a complicated figure   in the second book of euclid  illustration      this he perched upon a tripod   crouched beneath its dusky cover   stretched his hand enforcing silence   said be motionless i beg you   mystic awful was the process     all the family in order   sat before him for their pictures   each in turn as he was taken   volunteered his own suggestions   his ingenious suggestions     first the governor the father   he suggested velvet curtains   looped about a massy pillar   and the corner of a table   of a rosewood diningtable   he would hold a scroll of something   hold it firmly in his lefthand   he would keep his righthand buried   like napoleon in his waistcoat   he would contemplate the distance   with a look of pensive meaning   as of ducks that die in tempests     grand heroic was the notion   yet the picture failed entirely   failed because he moved a little   moved because he couldnt help it     next his better half took courage   she would have her picture taken   she came dressed beyond description   dressed in jewels and in satin   far too gorgeous for an empress  illustration first the governor the father    gracefully she sat down sideways   with a simper scarcely human   holding in her hand a bouquet   rather larger than a cabbage   all the while that she was sitting   still the lady chattered chattered   like a monkey in the forest   am i sitting still she asked him   is my face enough in profile   shall i hold the bouquet higher   will it come into the picture   and the picture failed completely     next the son the stunningcantab   he suggested curves of beauty   curves pervading all his figure   which the eye might follow onward   till they centered in the breastpin   centered in the golden breastpin   he had learnt it all from ruskin   author of the stones of venice   seven lamps of architecture   modern painters and some others   and perhaps he had not fully   understood his authors meaning   but whatever was the reason   all was fruitless as the picture   ended in an utter failure  illustration next the son the stunningcantab      next to him the eldest daughter   she suggested very little   only asked if he would take her   with her look of passive beauty     her idea of passive beauty   was a squinting of the lefteye   was a drooping of the righteye   was a smile that went up sideways   to the corner of the nostrils     hiawatha when she asked him   took no notice of the question   looked as if he hadnt heard it   but when pointedly appealed to   smiled in his peculiar manner   coughed and said it didnt matter   bit his lip and changed the subject     nor in this was he mistaken   as the picture failed completely     so in turn the other sisters  illustration next to him the eldest daughter      last the youngest son was taken   very rough and thick his hair was   very round and red his face was   very dusty was his jacket   very fidgety his manner   and his overbearing sisters   called him names he disapproved of   called him johnny daddys darling   called him jacky scrubby schoolboy   and so awful was the picture   in comparison the others   seemed to ones bewildered fancy   to have partially succeeded     finally my hiawatha   tumbled all the tribe together   grouped is not the right expression   and as happy chance would have it   did at last obtain a picture   where the faces all succeeded   each came out a perfect likeness  illustration last the youngest son was taken      then they joined and all abused it   unrestrainedly abused it   as the worst and ugliest picture   they could possibly have dreamed of   giving one such strange expressions   sullen stupid pert expressions   really any one would take us   any one that did not know us   for the most unpleasant people   hiawatha seemed to think so   seemed to think it not unlikely   all together rang their voices   angry loud discordant voices   as of dogs that howl in concert   as of cats that wail in chorus     but my hiawathas patience   his politeness and his patience   unaccountably had vanished   and he left that happy party   neither did he leave them slowly   with the calm deliberation   the intense deliberation   of a photographic artist   but he left them in a hurry   left them in a mighty hurry   stating that he would not stand it   stating in emphatic language   what hed be before hed stand it   hurriedly he packed his boxes   hurriedly the porter trundled   on a barrow all his boxes   hurriedly he took his ticket   hurriedly the train received him   thus departed hiawatha  illustration     melancholetta     with saddest music all day long     she soothed her secret sorrow   at night she sighed i fear twas wrong     such cheerful words to borrow   dearest a sweeter sadder song     ill sing to thee tomorrow    i thanked her but i could not say     that i was glad to hear it   i left the house at break of day     and did not venture near it   till time i hoped had worn away     her grief for nought could cheer it  illustration at night she sighed    my dismal sister couldst thou know     the wretched home thou keepest   thy brother drowned in daily woe     is thankful when thou sleepest   for if i laugh however low     when thourt awake thou weepest    i took my sister tother day     excuse the slang expression   to sadlers wells to see the play     in hopes the new impression   might in her thoughts from grave to gay     effect some slight digression    i asked three gay young dogs from town     to join us in our folly   whose mirth i thought might serve to drown     my sisters melancholy   the lively jones the sportive brown     and robinson the jolly    the maid announced the meal in tones     that i myself had taught her   meant to allay my sisters moans     like oil on troubled water   i rushed to jones the lively jones     and begged him to escort her    vainly he strove with ready wit     to joke about the weather   to ventilate the last on dit     to quote the price of leather   she groaned here i and sorrow sit     let us lament together    i urged youre wasting time you know     delay will spoil the venison   my heart is wasted with my woe     there is no restin venice on   the bridge of sighs she quoted low     from byron and from tennyson    i need not tell of soup and fish     in solemn silence swallowed   the sobs that ushered in each dish     and its departure followed   nor yet my suicidal wish     to be the cheese i hollowed    some desperate attempts were made     to start a conversation   madam the sportive brown essayed     which kind of recreation   hunting or fishing have you made     your special occupation    her lips curved downwards instantly     as if of indiarubber   hounds in full cry i like said she     oh how i longed to snub her   of fish a whales the one for me     it is so full of blubber    the nights performance was king john     its dull she wept and soso   a while i let her tears flow on     she said they soothed her woe so   at length the curtain rose upon     bombastes furioso    in vain we roared in vain we tried     to rouse her into laughter   her pensive glances wandered wide     from orchestra to rafter   tier upon tier she said and sighed     and silence followed after  illustration     a valentine  sent to a friend who had complained that i was glad enough to see him when he came but didnt seem to miss him if he stayed away     and cannot pleasures while they last   be actual unless when past   they leave us shuddering and aghast           with anguish smarting   and cannot friends be firm and fast           and yet bear parting    and must i then at friendships call   calmly resign the little all   trifling i grant it is and small           i have of gladness   and lend my being to the thrall           of gloom and sadness    and think

for certain days   his fair one be denied his gaze   sinks not in grief and wild amaze           but wiser wooer   he spends the time in writing lays           and posts them to her    and if the

three voices   the first voice  illustration    he trilled a carol fresh and free   he laughed aloud for very glee   there came a breeze from off the sea    it passed athwart the glooming flat   it fanned his forehead as he sat   it lightly bore away his hat    all to the feet of one who stood   like maid enchanted in a wood   frowning as darkly as she could    with huge umbrella lank and brown   unerringly she pinned it down   right through the centre of the crown    then with an aspect cold and grim   regardless of its battered rim   she took it up and gave it him    a while like one in dreams he stood   then faltered forth his gratitude   in words just short of being rude    for it had lost its shape and shine   and it had cost him fourandnine   and he was going out to dine  illustration unerringly she pinned it down    to dine she sneered in acid tone   to bend thy being to a bone   clothed in a radiance not its own    the teardrop trickled to his chin   there was a meaning in her grin   that made him feel on fire within    term it not radiance said he   tis solid nutriment to me   dinner is dinner tea is tea    and she yea so yet wherefore cease   let thy scant knowledge find increase   say men are men and geese are geese    he moaned he knew not what to say   the thought that i could get away   strove with the thought but i must stay    to dine she shrieked in dragonwrath   to swallow wines all foam and froth   to simper at a tablecloth    say can thy noble spirit stoop   to join the gormandising troop   who find a solace in the soup    canst thou desire or pie or puff   thy wellbred manners were enough   without such gross material stuff    yet wellbred men he faintly said   are not unwilling to be fed   nor are they well without the bread    her visage scorched him ere she spoke   there are she said a kind of folk   who have no horror of a joke    such wretches live they take their share   of common earth and common air   we come across them here and there    we grant themthere is no escape   a sort of semihuman shape   suggestive of the manlike ape    in all such theories said he   one fixed exception there must be   that is the present company    baffled she gave a wolfish bark   he aiming blindly in the dark   with random shaft had pierced the mark    she felt that her defeat was plain   yet madly strove with might and main   to get the upper hand again    fixing her eyes upon the beach   as though unconscious of his speech   she said each gives to more than each    he could not answer yea or nay   he faltered gifts may pass away   yet knew not what he meant to say    if that be so she straight replied   each heart with each doth coincide   what boots it for the world is wide  illustration he faltered gifts may pass away    the world is but a thought said he   the vast unfathomable sea   is but a notionunto me    and darkly fell her answer dread   upon his unresisting head   like half a hundredweight of lead    the good and great must ever shun   that reckless and abandoned one   who stoops to perpetrate a pun    the man that smokesthat reads the times   that goes to christmas pantomimes   is capable of any crimes    he felt it was his turn to speak   and with a shamed and crimson cheek   moaned this is harder than bezique    but when she asked him wherefore so   he felt his very whiskers glow   and frankly owned i do not know  illustration this is harder than bezique    while like broad waves of golden grain   or sunlit hues on cloistered pane   his colour came and went again    pitying his obvious distress   yet with a tinge of bitterness   she said the more exceeds the less    a truth of such undoubted weight   he urged and so extreme in date   it were superfluous to state    roused into sudden passion she   in tone of cold malignity   to others yea but not to thee    but when she saw him quail and quake   and when he urged for pitys sake   once more in gentle tone she spake    thought in the mind doth still abide   that is by intellect supplied   and within that idea doth hide    and he that yearns the truth to know   still further inwardly may go   and find idea from notion flow    and thus the chain that sages sought   is to a glorious circle wrought   for notion hath its source in thought    so passed they on with even pace   yet gradually one might trace   a shadow growing on his face  illustration   the second voice  illustration    they walked beside the waveworn beach   her tongue was very apt to teach   and now and then he did beseech    she would abate her dulcet tone   because the talk was all her own   and he was dull as any drone    she urged no cheese is made of chalk   and ceaseless flowed her dreary talk   tuned to the footfall of a walk    her voice was very full and rich   and when at length she asked him which   it mounted to its highest pitch    he a bewildered answer gave   drowned in the sullen moaning wave   lost in the echoes of the cave    he answered her he knew not what   like shaft from bow at random shot   he spoke but she regarded not    she waited not for his reply   but with a downward leaden eye   went on as if he were not by    sound argument and grave defence   strange questions raised on why and whence   and wildly tangled evidence    when he with racked and whirling brain   feebly implored her to explain   she simply said it all again    wrenched with an agony intense   he spake neglecting sound and sense   and careless of all consequence    mindi believeis essenceent   abstractthat isan accident   which wethat is to sayi meant    when with quick breath and cheeks all flushed   at length his speech was somewhat hushed   she looked at him and he was crushed    it needed not her calm reply   she fixed him with a stony eye   and he could neither fight nor fly    while she dissected word by word   his speech half guessed at and half heard   as might a cat a little bird  illustration he spake neglecting sound and sense    then having wholly overthrown   his views and stripped them to the bone   proceeded to unfold her own    shall man be man and shall he miss   of other thoughts no thought but this   harmonious dews of sober bliss    what boots it shall his fevered eye   through towering nothingness descry   the grisly phantom hurry by    and hear dumb shrieks that fill the air   see mouths that gape and eyes that stare   and redden in the dusky glare    the meadows breathing amber light   the darkness toppling from the height   the feathery train of granite night    shall he grown gray among his peers   through the thick curtain of his tears   catch glimpses of his earlier years  illustration shall man be man    and hear the sounds he knew of yore   old shufflings on the sanded floor   old knuckles tapping at the door    yet still before him as he flies   one pallid form shall ever rise   and bodying forth in glassy eyes    the vision of a vanished good   low peering through the tangled wood   shall freeze the current of his blood    still from each fact with skill uncouth   and savage rapture like a tooth   she wrenched some slow reluctant truth    till like a silent watermill   when summer suns have dried the rill   she reached a full stop and was still    dead calm succeeded to the fuss   as when the loaded omnibus   has reached the railway terminus    when for the tumult of the street   is heard the engines stifled beat   the velvet tread of porters feet    with glance that ever sought the ground   she moved her lips without a sound   and every now and then she frowned    he gazed upon the sleeping sea   and joyed in its tranquillity   and in that silence dead but she    to muse a little space did seem   then like the echo of a dream   harped back upon her threadbare theme    still an attentive ear he lent   but could not fathom what she meant   she was not deep nor eloquent    he marked the ripple on the sand   the even swaying of her hand   was all that he could understand    he saw in dreams a drawingroom   where thirteen wretches sat in gloom   waitinghe thought he knew for whom    he saw them drooping here and there   each feebly huddled on a chair   in attitudes of blank despair    oysters were not more mute than they   for all their brains were pumped away   and they had nothing more to say    save one who groaned three hours are gone   who shrieked well wait no longer john   tell them to set the dinner on    the vision passed the ghosts were fled   he saw once more that woman dread   he heard once more the words she said    he left her and he turned aside   he sat and watched the coming tide   across the shores so newly dried  illustration he sat and watched the coming tide    he wondered at the waters clear   the breeze that whispered in his ear   the billows heaving far and near    and why he had so long preferred   to hang upon her every word   in truth he said it was absurd  illustration   the third voice  illustration    not long this transport held its place   within a little moments space   quick tears were raining down his face    his heart stood still aghast with fear   a wordless

some wellknown air then a dozen bars of his own then a few more notes of the air and so on alternately thus saving the listener if not from all risk of recognising the melody at all at least from the

brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem it would be based i feel convinced on the line in p 144    then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes  in view of this painful possibility i will not as i might appeal indignantly to my other writings as a proof that i am incapable of such a deed i will not as i might point to the strong moral purpose of this poem itself to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in it or to its noble teachings in natural historyi will take the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened  the bellman who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances used to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished and it more than once happened when the time came for replacing it that no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged to they knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the bellman about ithe would only refer to his naval code and read out in pathetic tones admiralty instructions which none of them had ever been able to understandso it generally ended in its being fastened on anyhow across the rudder the helmsman1 used to stand by with tears in his eyes he knew it was all wrong but alas rule 42 of the code no one shall speak to the man at the helm had been completed by the bellman himself with the words and the man at the helm shall speak to no one so remonstrance was impossible and no steering could be done till the next varnishing day during these bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed backwards  as this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the jabberwock let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me how to pronounce slithy toves the i in slithy is long as in writhe and toves is pronounced so as to rhyme with groves again the first o in borogoves is pronounced like the o in borrow i have heard people try to give it the sound of the o in worry such is human perversity       1 this office was usually undertaken by the boots who found in it      a refuge from the bakers constant complaints about the insufficient      blacking of his three pair of boots  this also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in that poem humptydumptys theory of two meanings packed into one word like a portmanteau seems to me the right explanation for all  for instance take the two words fuming and furious make up your mind that you will say both words but leave it unsettled which you will say first now open your mouth and speak if your thoughts incline ever so little towards fuming you will say fumingfurious if they turn by even a hairs breadth towards furious you will say furiousfuming but if you have that rarest of gifts a perfectly balanced mind you will say frumious  supposing that when pistol uttered the wellknown words    under which king bezonian speak or die  justice shallow had felt certain that it was either william or richard but had not been able to settle which so that he could not possibly say either name before the other can it be doubted that rather than die he would have gasped out rilchiam   fit the first  the landing    just the place for a snark the bellman cried     as he landed his crew with care   supporting each man on the top of the tide     by a finger entwined in his hair    just the place for a snark i have said it twice     that alone should encourage the crew   just the place for a snark i have said it thrice     what i tell you three times is true    the crew was complete it included a boots     a maker of bonnets and hoods   a barrister brought to arrange their disputes     and a broker to value their goods  illustration supporting each man on the top of the tide    a billiardmarker whose skill was immense     might perhaps have won more than his share   but a banker engaged at enormous expense     had the whole of their cash in his care    there was also a beaver that paced on the deck     or would sit making lace in the bow   and had often the bellman said saved them from wreck     though none of the sailors knew how    there was one who was famed for the number of things     he forgot when he entered the ship   his umbrella his watch all his jewels and rings     and the clothes he had bought for the trip    he had fortytwo boxes all carefully packed     with his name painted clearly on each   but since he omitted to mention the fact     they were all left behind on the beach    the loss of his clothes hardly mattered because     he had seven coats on when he came   with three pair of bootsbut the worst of it was     he had wholly forgotten his name  illustration he had wholly forgotten his name    he would answer to hi or to any loud cry     such as fry me or fritter my wig   to whatyoumaycallum or whatwashisname     but especially thinguma jig    while for those who preferred a more forcible word     he had different names from these   his intimate friends called him candleends     and his enemies toastedcheese    his form is ungainlyhis intellect small     so the bellman would often remark   but his courage is perfect and that after all     is the thing that one needs with a snark    he would joke with hyænas returning their stare     with an impudent wag of the head   and he once went a walk pawinpaw with a bear     just to keep up its spirits he said    he came as a baker but owned when too late     and it drove the poor bellman halfmad   he could only bake bridecakefor which i may state     no materials were to be had    the last of the crew needs especial remark     though he looked an incredible dunce   he had just one ideabut that one being snark     the good bellman engaged him at once    he came as a butcher but gravely declared     when the ship had been sailing a week   he could only kill beavers the bellman looked scared     and was almost too frightened to speak    but at length he explained in a tremulous tone     there was only one beaver on board   and that was a tame one he had of his own     whose death would be deeply deplored    the beaver who happened to hear the remark     protested with tears in its eyes   that not even the rapture of hunting the snark     could atone for that dismal surprise    it strongly advised that the butcher should be     conveyed in a separate ship   but the bellman declared that would never agree     with the plans he had made for the trip  illustration the beaver kept looking the opposite way    navigation was always a difficult art     though with only one ship and one bell   and he feared he must really decline for his part     undertaking another as well    the beavers best course was no doubt to procure     a secondhand daggerproof coat   so the baker advised itand next to insure     its life in some office of note    this the banker suggested and offered for hire     on moderate terms or for sale   two excellent policies one against fire     and one against damage from hail    yet still ever after that sorrowful day     whenever the butcher was by   the beaver kept looking the opposite way     and appeared unaccountably shy   fit the second  the bellmans speech    the bellman himself they all praised to the skies     such a carriage such ease and such grace   such solemnity too one could see he was wise     the moment one looked in his face    he had bought a large map representing the sea     without the least vestige of land   and the crew were much pleased when they found it to be     a map they could all understand    whats the good of mercators north poles and equators     tropics zones and meridian lines   so the bellman would cry and the crew would reply     they are merely conventional signs  illustration oceanchart    other maps are such shapes with their islands and capes     but weve got our brave captain to thank   so the crew would protest that hes bought us the best     a perfect and absolute blank    this was charming no doubt but they shortly found out     that the captain they trusted so well   had only one notion for crossing the ocean     and that was to tingle his bell    he was thoughtful and gravebut the orders he gave     were enough to bewilder a crew   when he cried steer to starboard but keep her head larboard     what on earth was the helmsman to do    then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes     a thing as the bellman remarked   that frequently happens in tropical climes     when a vessel is so to speak snarked    but the principal failing occurred in the sailing     and the bellman perplexed and distressed   said he had hoped at least when the wind blew due east     that the ship would not travel due west    but the danger was pastthey had landed at last     with their boxes portmanteaus and bags   yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view     which consisted of chasms and crags    the bellman perceived that their spirits were low     and repeated in musical tone   some jokes he had kept for a season of woe     but the crew would do nothing but groan    he served out some grog with a liberal hand     and bade them sit down on the beach   and they could not but own that their captain looked grand     as he stood and delivered his speech    friends romans and countrymen lend me your ears     they were all of them fond of quotations   so they drank to his health and they gave him three cheers     while he served out additional rations    we have sailed many months we have sailed many weeks     four weeks to the month you may mark   but never as yet tis your captain who speaks     have we caught the least glimpse of a snark    we have sailed many weeks we have sailed many days     seven days to the week i allow   but a snark on the which we might lovingly gaze     we have never beheld till now    come listen my men while i tell you again     the five unmistakable marks   by which you may know wheresoever you go     the warranted genuine snarks    let us take them in order the first is the taste     which is meagre and hollow but crisp   like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist     with a flavour of willothe wisp    its habit of getting up late youll agree     that it carries too far when i say   that it frequently breakfasts at five oclock tea     and dines on the following day    the third is its slowness in taking a jest     should you happen to venture on one   it will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed     and it always looks grave at a pun    the fourth is its fondness for bathingmachines     which it constantly carries about   and believes that they add to the beauty of scenes     a sentiment open to doubt    the fifth is ambition it next will be right     to describe each particular batch   distinguishing those that have feathers and bite     from those that have whiskers and scratch    for although common snarks do no manner of harm     yet i feel it my duty to say   some are boojums the bellman broke off in alarm     for the baker had fainted away   fit the third  the bakers tale    they roused him with muffinsthey roused him with ice     they roused him with mustard and cress   they roused him with jam and judicious advice     they set him conundrums to guess    when at length he sat up and was able to speak     his sad story he offered to tell   and the bellman cried silence not even a shriek     and excitedly tingled his bell    there was silence supreme not a shriek not a scream     scarcely even a howl or a groan   as the man they called ho told his story of woe     in an antediluvian tone    my father and mother were honest though poor     skip all that cried the bellman in haste   if it once becomes dark theres no chance of a snark     we have hardly a minute to waste    i skip forty years said the baker in tears     and proceed without further remark   to the day when you took me aboard of your ship     to help you in hunting the snark    a dear uncle of mine after whom i was named     remarked when i bade him farewell   oh skip your dear uncle the bellman exclaimed     as he angrily tingled his bell    he remarked to me then said that mildest of men     if your snark be a snark that is right   fetch it home by all meansyou may serve it with greens     and its handy for striking a light    you may seek it with thimblesand seek it with care     you may hunt it with forks and hope   you may threaten its life with a railwayshare     you may charm it with smiles and soap    thats exactly the method the bellman bold     in a hasty parenthesis cried   thats exactly the way i have always been told     that the capture of snarks should be tried    but oh beamish nephew beware of the day     if your snark be a boojum for then   you will softly and suddenly vanish away     and never be met with again    it is this it is this that oppresses my soul     when i think of my uncles last words   and my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl     brimming over with quivering curds    it is this it is this we have had that before     the bellman indignantly said   and the baker replied let me say it once more     it is this it is this that i dread    i engage with the snarkevery night after dark     in a dreamy delirious fight   i serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes     and i use it for striking a light  illustration but oh beamish nephew beware of the day    but if ever i meet with a boojum that day     in a moment of this i am sure   i shall softly and suddenly vanish away     and the notion i cannot endure   fit the fourth  the hunting    the bellman looked uffish and wrinkled his brow     if only youd spoken before   its excessively awkward to mention it now     with the snark so to speak at the door    we should all of us grieve as you well may believe     if you never were met with again   but surely my man when the voyage began     you might have suggested it then    its excessively awkward to mention it now     as i think ive already remarked   and the man they called hi replied with a sigh     i informed you the day we embarked    you may charge me with murderor want of sense     we are all of us weak at times   but the slightest approach to a false pretence     was never among my crimes    i said it in hebrewi said it in dutch     i said it in german and greek   but i wholly forgot and it vexes me much     that english is what you speak    tis a pitiful tale said the bellman whose face     had grown longer at every word   but now that youve stated the whole of your case     more debate would be simply absurd    the rest of my speech he explained to his men     you shall hear when ive leisure to speak it   but the snark is at hand let me tell you again     tis your glorious duty to seek it    to seek it with thimbles to seek it with care     to pursue it with forks and hope   to threaten its life with a railwayshare     to charm it with smiles and soap  illustration to pursue it with forks and hope    for the snarks a peculiar creature that wont     be caught in a commonplace way   do all that you know and try all that you dont     not a chance must be wasted today    for england expectsi forbear to proceed     tis a maxim tremendous but trite   and youd best be unpacking the things that you need     to rig yourselves out for the fight    then the banker endorsed a blank cheque which he crossed     and changed his loose silver for notes   the baker with care combed his whiskers and hair     and shook the dust out of his coats    the boots and the broker were sharpening a spade     each working the grindstone in turn   but the beaver went on making lace and displayed     no interest in the concern    though the barrister tried to appeal to its pride     and vainly proceeded to cite   a number of cases in which making laces     had been proved an infringement of right    the maker of bonnets ferociously planned     a novel arrangement of bows   while the billiardmarker with quivering hand     was chalking the tip of his nose    but the butcher turned nervous and dressed himself fine     with yellow kid gloves and a ruff   said he felt it exactly like going to dine     which the bellman declared was all stuff    introduce me now theres a good fellow he said     if we happen to meet it together   and the bellman sagaciously nodding his head     said that must depend on the weather    the beaver went simply galumphing about     at seeing the butcher so shy   and even the baker though stupid and stout     made an effort to wink with one eye    be a man cried the bellman in wrath as he heard     the butcher beginning to sob   should we meet with a jubjub that desperate bird     we shall need all our strength for the job   fit the fifth  the beavers lesson    they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care     they pursued it with forks and hope   they threatened its life with a railwayshare     they charmed it with smiles and soap    then the butcher contrived an ingenious plan     for making a separate sally   and had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man     a dismal and desolate valley    but the very same plan to the beaver occurred     it had chosen the very same place   yet neither betrayed by a sign or a word     the disgust that appeared in his face    each thought he was thinking of nothing but snark     and the glorious work of the day   and each tried to pretend that he did not remark     that the other was going that way    but the valley grew narrow and narrower still     and the evening got darker and colder   till merely from nervousness not from good will     they marched along shoulder to shoulder    then a scream shrill and high rent the shuddering sky     and they knew that some danger was near   the beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail     and even the butcher felt queer    he thought of his childhood left far far behind     that blissful and innocent state   the sound so exactly recalled to his mind     a pencil that squeaks on a slate    tis the voice of the jubjub he suddenly cried     this man that they used to call dunce   as the bellman would tell you he added with pride     i have uttered that sentiment once    tis the note of the jubjub keep count i entreat     you will find i have told it you twice   tis the song of the jubjub the proof is complete     if only ive stated it thrice    the beaver had counted with scrupulous care     attending to every word   but it fairly lost heart and outgrabe in despair     when the third repetition occurred    it felt that in spite of all possible pains     it had somehow contrived to lose count   and the only thing now was to rack its poor brains     by reckoning up the amount    two added to oneif that could but be done     it said with ones fingers and thumbs   recollecting with tears how in earlier years     it had taken no pains with its sums    the thing can be done said the butcher i think     the thing must be done i am sure   the thing shall be done bring me paper and ink     the best there is time to procure    the beaver brought paper portfolio pens     and ink in unfailing supplies   while strange creepy creatures came out of their dens     and watched them with wondering eyes    so engrossed was the butcher he heeded them not     as he wrote with a pen in each hand   and explained all the while in a popular style     which the beaver could well understand    taking three as the subject to reason about     a convenient number to state   we add seven and ten and then multiply out     by one thousand diminished by eight    the result we proceed to divide as you see     by ninehundredandninetyandtwo   then subtract seventeen and the answer must be     exactly and perfectly true    the method employed i would gladly explain     while i have it so clear in my head   if i had but the time and you had but the brain     but much yet remains to be said  illustration the beaver brought paper portfolio pens    in one moment ive seen what has hitherto been     enveloped in absolute mystery   and without extra charge i will give you at large     a lesson in natural history    in his genial way he proceeded to say     forgetting all laws of propriety   and that giving instruction without introduction     would have caused quite a thrill in society    as to temper the jubjubs a desperate bird     since it lives in perpetual passion   its taste in costume is entirely absurd     it is ages ahead of the fashion    but it knows any friend it has met once before     it never will look at a bribe   and in charitymeetings it stands at the door     and collectsthough it does not subscribe    its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far     than mutton or oysters or eggs   some think it keeps best in an ivory jar     and some in mahogany kegs    you boil it in sawdust you salt it in glue     you condense it with locusts and tape   still keeping one principal object in view     to preserve its symmetrical shape    the butcher would gladly have talked till next day     but he felt that the lesson must end   and he wept with delight in attempting to say     he considered the beaver his friend    while the beaver confessed with affectionate looks     more eloquent even than tears   it had learned in ten minutes far more than all books     would have taught it in seventy years    they returned handinhand and the bellman unmanned     for a moment with noble emotion   said this amply repays all the wearisome days     we have spent on the billowy ocean    such friends as the beaver and butcher became     have seldom if ever been known   in winter or summer twas always the same     you could never meet either alone    and when quarrels aroseas one frequently finds     quarrels will spite of every endeavour   the song of the jubjub recurred to their minds     and cemented their friendship for ever   fit the sixth  the barristers dream    they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care     they pursued it with forks and hope   they threatened its life with a railwayshare     they charmed it with smiles and soap    but the barrister weary of proving in vain     that the beavers lacemaking was wrong   fell asleep and in dreams saw the creature quite plain     that his fancy had dwelt on so long    he dreamed that he stood in a shadowy court     where the snark with a glass in its eye   dressed in gown bands and wig was defending a pig     on the charge of deserting its sty  illustration you must know said the judge but the snark exclaimed fudge    the witnesses proved without error or flaw     that the sty was deserted when found   and the judge kept explaining the state of the law     in a soft undercurrent of sound    the indictment had never been clearly expressed     and it seemed that the snark had begun   and had spoken three hours before any one guessed     what the pig was supposed to have done    the jury had each formed a different view     long before the indictment was read   and they all spoke at once so that none of them knew     one word that the others had said    you must know said the judge but the snark exclaimed fudge     that statute is obsolete quite   let me tell you my friends the whole question depends     on an ancient manorial right    in the matter of treason the pig would appear     to have aided but scarcely abetted   while the charge of insolvency fails it is clear     if you grant the plea never indebted    the fact of desertion i will not dispute     but its guilt as i trust is removed   so far as relates to the costs of this suit     by the alibi which has been proved    my poor clients fate now depends on your votes     here the speaker sat down in his place   and directed the judge to refer to his notes     and briefly to sum up the case    but the judge said he never had summed up before     so the snark undertook it instead   and summed it so well that it came to far more     than the witnesses ever had said    when the verdict was called for the jury declined     as the word was so puzzling to spell   but they ventured to hope that the snark wouldnt mind     undertaking that duty as well    so the snark found the verdict although as it owned     it was spent with the toils of the day   when it said the word guilty the jury all groaned     and some of them fainted away    then the snark pronounced sentence the judge being quite     too nervous to utter a word   when it rose to its feet there was silence like night     and the fall of a pin might be heard    transportation for life was the sentence it gave     and then to be fined forty pound   the jury all cheered though the judge said he feared     that the phrase was not legally sound    but their wild exultation was suddenly checked     when the jailer informed them with tears   such a sentence would have not the slightest effect     as the pig had been dead for some years    the judge left the court looking deeply disgusted     but the snark though a little aghast   as the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted     went bellowing on to the last    thus the barrister dreamed while the bellowing seemed     to grow every moment more clear   till he woke to the knell of a furious bell     which the bellman rang close at his ear   fit the seventh  the bankers fate    they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care     they pursued it with forks and hope   they threatened its life with a railwayshare     they charmed it with smiles and soap    and the banker inspired with a courage so new     it was matter for general remark   rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view     in his zeal to discover the snark    but while he was seeking with thimbles and care     a bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh   and grabbed at the banker who shrieked in despair     for he knew it was useless to fly    he offered large discounthe offered a cheque     drawn to bearer for sevenpoundsten   but the bandersnatch merely extended its neck     and grabbed at the banker again    without rest or pausewhile those frumious jaws     went savagely snapping around   he skipped and he hopped and he floundered and flopped     till fainting he fell to the ground    the bandersnatch fled as the others appeared     led on by that fearstricken yell   and the bellman remarked it is just as i feared     and solemnly tolled on his bell    he was black in the face and they scarcely could trace     the least likeness to what he had been   while so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white     a wonderful thing to be seen  illustration so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white    to the horror of all who were present that day     he uprose in full evening dress   and with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say     what his tongue could no longer express    down he sank in a chairran his hands through his hair     and chanted in mimsiest tones   words whose utter inanity proved his insanity     while he rattled a couple of bones    leave him here to his fateit is getting so late     the bellman exclaimed in a fright   we have lost half the day any further delay     and we shant catch a snark before night   fit the eighth  the vanishing    they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care     they pursued it with forks and hope   they threatened its life with a railwayshare     they charmed it with smiles and soap    they shuddered to think that the chase might fail     and the beaver excited at last   went bounding along on the tip of its tail     for the daylight was nearly past    there is thingumbob shouting the bellman said     he is shouting like mad only hark   he is waving his hands he is wagging his head     he has certainly found a snark    they gazed in delight while the butcher exclaimed     he was always a desperate wag   they beheld himtheir bakertheir hero unnamed     on the top of a neighbouring crag    erect and sublime for one moment of time     in the next that wild figure they saw   as if stung by a spasm plunge into a chasm     while they waited and listened in awe    its a snark was the sound that first came to their ears     and seemed almost too good to be true   then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers     then the ominous words its a boo    then silence some fancied they heard in the air     a weary and wandering sigh   that sounded like jum but the others declare     it was only a breeze that went by  illustration then silence    they hunted till darkness came on but they found     not a button or feather or mark   by which they could tell that they stood on the ground     where the baker had met with the snark    in the midst of the word he was trying to say     in the midst of his laughter and glee   he had softly and suddenly vanished away     for the snark was a boojum you see     size and tears  illustration     when on the sandy shore i sit     beside the

declared she was weary   that the place was so crowded and hot and she couldnt abide that     dundreary              then i thought tis for me               that she whines and she whimpers
