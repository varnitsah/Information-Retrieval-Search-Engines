3413913	volcanic islands  by  charles darwin   editorial note  although in some respects more technical in their subjects and style than darwins journal the books here reprinted will never lose their value and interest for the originality of the observations they contain  many parts of them are admirably adapted for giving an insight into problems regarding the structure and changes of the earths surface and in fact they form a charming introduction to physical geology and physiography in their application to special domains  the books themselves cannot be obtained for many times the price of the present volume and both the general reader who desires to know more of darwins work and the student of geology who naturally wishes to know how a master mind reasoned on most important geological subjects will be glad of the opportunity of possessing them in a convenient and cheap form  the three introductions which my friend professor judd has kindly furnished give critical and historical

geology of the voyage of the beagle occupied a great part of darwins time during the ten years that followed his return to england the second volume of the series entitled geological observations on volcanic islands with brief notices on the geology of australia and the cape of good hope made its appearance in 1844 the materials for this volume were collected in part during the outward voyage when the beagle called at st jago in the cape de verde islands and st pauls rocks and at fernando noronha but mainly during the homeward cruise then it was that the galapagos islands were surveyed the low archipelago passed through and tahiti visited after making calls at the bay of islands in new zealand and also at sydney hobart town and king georges sound in australia the beagle sailed across the indian ocean to the little group of the keeling or cocos islands which darwin has rendered famous by his observations and thence to mauritius calling at the cape of good hope on her way the ship then proceeded successively to st helena and ascension and revisited the cape de verde islands before finally reaching england  although darwin was thus able to gratify his curiosity by visits to a great number of very interesting volcanic districts the voyage opened for him with a bitter disappointment he had been reading humboldts personal narrative during his last years residence in cambridge and had copied out from it long passages about teneriffe he was actually making inquiries as to the best means of visiting that island when the offer was made to him to accompany captain fitzroy in the beagle  his friend henslow too on parting with him had given him the advice to procure and read the recently published first volume of the principles of geology though he warned him against accepting the views advocated by its author during the time the beagle was beating backwards and forwards when the voyage commenced darwin although hardly ever able to leave his berth was employing all the opportunities which the terrible seasickness left him in studying humboldt and lyell we may therefore form an idea of his feelings when on the ship reaching santa cruz and the peak of teneriffe making its appearance among the clouds they were suddenly informed that an outbreak of cholera would prevent any landing  ample compensation for this disappointment was found however when the ship reached porta praya in st jago the largest of the cape de verde islands here he spent three most delightful weeks and really commenced his work as a geologist and naturalist writing to his father he says geologising in a volcanic country is most delightful besides the interest attached to itself it leads you into most beautiful and retired spots nobody but a person fond of natural history can imagine the pleasure of strolling under cocoanuts in a thicket of bananas and coffeeplants and an endless number of wild flowers and this island that has given me so much instruction and delight is reckoned the most uninteresting place that we perhaps shall touch at during our voyage it certainly is generally very barren but the valleys are more exquisitely beautiful from the very contrast it is utterly useless to say anything about the scenery it would be as profitable to explain to a blind man colours as to a person who has not been out of europe the total dissimilarity of a tropical view whenever i enjoy anything i always look forward to writing it down either in my logbook which increases in bulk or in a letter so you must excuse raptures and those raptures badly expressed i find my collections are increasing wonderfully and from rio i think i shall be obliged to send a cargo home  the indelible impression made on darwins mind by this first visit to a volcanic island is borne witness to by a remarkable passage in the autobiography written by him in 1876 the geology of st jago is very striking yet simple a stream of lava formerly flowed over the bed of the sea formed of triturated recent shells and corals which it has baked into a hard white rock since then the whole island has been upheaved but the line of white rock revealed to me a new and important fact namely that there had been afterwards subsidence round the craters which had since been in action and had poured forth lava it then first dawned on me that i might perhaps write a book on the geology of the various countries visited and this made me thrill with delight that was a memorable hour to me and how distinctly i can call to mind the low cliff of lava beneath which i rested with the sun glaring hot a few strange desert plants growing near and with living corals in the tidal pools at my feet  only five years before when listening to poor professor jamesons lectures on the effete wernerianism which at that time did duty for geological teaching darwin had found them incredibly dull and he declared that the sole effect they produced on me was a determination never so long as i lived to read a book on geology or in any way to study the science  what a contrast we find in the expressions which he makes use of in referring to geological science in his letters written home from the beagle after alluding to the delight of collecting and studying marine animals he exclaims but geology carries the day writing to henslow he says i am quite charmed with geology but like the wise animal between two bundles of hay i do not know which to like best the old crystalline group of rocks or the softer and more fossiliferous beds and just as the long voyage is about to come to a close he again writes i find in geology a neverfailing interest as it has been remarked it creates the same grand ideas respecting this world which astronomy does for the universe in this passage darwin doubtless refers to a remark of sir john herschels in his admirable preliminary discourse on the study of natural philosophya book which exercised a most remarkable and beneficial influence on the mind of the young naturalist  if there cannot be any doubt as to the strong predilection in darwins mind for geological studies both during and after the memorable voyage there is equally little difficulty in perceiving the school of geological thought which in spite of the warnings of sedgwick and henslow had obtained complete ascendancy over his mind he writes in 1876 the very first place which i examined namely st jago in the cape de verde islands showed me clearly the wonderful superiority of lyells manner of treating geology compared with that of any other author whose works i had with me or ever afterwards read and again the science of geology is enormously indebted to lyellmore so as i believe than to any other man who ever livedi am proud to remember that the first place namely st jago in the cape de verde archipelago in which i geologised convinced me of the infinite superiority of lyells views over those advocated in any other work known to me  the passages i have cited will serve to show the spirit in which darwin entered upon his geological studies and the perusal of the following pages will furnish abundant proofs of the enthusiasm acumen and caution with which his researches were pursued  large collections of rocks and minerals were made by darwin during his researches and sent home to cambridge to be kept under the care of his faithful friend henslow after visiting his relations and friends darwins first care on his return to england was to unpack and examine these collections he accordingly at the end of 1836 took lodgings for three months in fitzwilliam street cambridge so as to be near henslow and in studying and determining his geological specimens received much valuable aid from the eminent crystallographer and mineralogist professor william hallows miller  the actual writing of the volume upon volcanic islands was not commenced till 1843 when darwin had settled in the spot which became his home for the rest of his lifethe famous house at down in kent writing to his friend mr fox on march 28th 1843 he says i am very slowly progressing with a volume or rather pamphlet on the volcanic islands which we visited i manage only a couple of hours per day and that not very regularly it is uphill work writing books which cost money in publishing and which are not read even by geologists  the work occupied darwin during the whole of the year 1843 and was issued in the spring of the following year the actual time engaged in preparing it being recorded in his diary as from the summer of 1842 to january 1844 but the author does not appear to have been by any means satisfied with the result when the book was finished he wrote to lyell you have pleased me much by saying that you intend looking through my volcanic islands it cost me eighteen months and i have heard of very few who have read it now i shall feel whatever little and little it is there is confirmatory of old work or new will work its effect and not be lost to sir joseph hooker he wrote i have just finished a little volume on the volcanic islands which we visited i do not know how far you care for dry simple geology but i hope you will let me send you a copy  every geologist knows how full of interest and suggestiveness is this book of darwins on volcanic islands probably the scant satisfaction which its author seemed to find in it may be traced to the effect of a contrast which he felt between the memory of glowing delights he had experienced when hammer in hand he roamed over new and interesting scenes and the slow laborious and less congenial task of rewriting and arranging his notes in bookform  in 1874 in writing an account of the ancient volcanoes of the hebrides i had frequent occasion to quote mr darwins observations on the atlantic volcanoes in illustration of the phenomena exhibited by the relics of still older volcanoes in our own islands darwin in writing to his old friend sir charles lyell upon the subject says i was not a little pleased to see my volcanic book quoted for i thought it was completely dead and forgotten  two years later the original publishers of this book and of that on south america proposed to reissue them darwin at first hesitated for he seemed to think there could be little of abiding interest in them he consulted me upon the subject in one of the conversations which i used to have with him at that time and i strongly urged upon him the reprint of the works i was much gratified when he gave way upon the point and consented to their appearing just as originally issued in his preface he says owing to the great progress which geology has made in recent times my views on some few points may be somewhat antiquated but i have thought it best to leave them as they originally appeared  it may be interesting to indicate as briefly as possible the chief geological problem upon which the publication of darwins volcanic islands threw new and important light the merit of the work consisted in supplying interesting observations which in some cases have proved of crucial value in exploding prevalent fallacies in calling attention to phenomena and considerations that had been quite overlooked by geologists but have since exercised an important influence in moulding geological speculation and lastly in showing the importance which attaches to small and seemingly insignificant causes some of which afford a key to the explanation of very curious geological problems  visiting as he did the districts in which von buch and others had found what they thought to be evidence of the truth of elevationcraters darwin was able to show that the facts were capable of a totally different interpretation the views originally put forward by the old german geologist and traveller and almost universally accepted by his countrymen had met with much support from elie de beaumont and dufrenoy the leaders of geological thought in france they were however stoutly opposed by scrope and lyell in this country and by constant prevost and virlet on the other side of the channel darwin in the work before us shows how little ground there is for the assumption that the great ringcraters of the atlantic islands have originated in gigantic blisters of the earths surface which opening at the top have given origin to the craters admitting the influence of the injection of lava into the structure of the volcanic cones in increasing their bulk and elevation he shows that in the main the volcanoes are built up by repeated ejections causing an accumulation of materials around the vent  while however agreeing on the whole with scrope and lyell as to the explosive origin of ordinary volcanic craters darwin clearly saw that in some cases great craters might be formed or enlarged by the subsidence of the floors after eruptions the importance of this agency to which too little attention has been directed by geologists has recently been shown by professor dana in his admirable work on kilauea and the other great volcanoes of the hawaiian archipelago  the effects of subsidence at a volcanic centre in producing a downward dip of the strata around it was first pointed out by darwin as the result of his earliest work in the cape de verde islands striking illustrations of the same principle have since been pointed out by m robert and others in iceland by mr heaphy in new zealand and by myself in the western isles of scotland  darwin again and again called attention to the evidence that volcanic vents exhibit relations to one another which can only be explained by assuming the existence of lines of fissure in the earths crust along which the lavas have made their way to the surface but he at the same time clearly saw that there was no evidence of the occurrence of great deluges of lava along such fissures he showed how the most remarkable plateaux composed of successive lava sheets might be built up by repeated and moderate ejections from numerous isolated vents and he expressly insists upon the rapidity with which the cindercones around the orifices of ejection and the evidences of successive outflows of lava would be obliterated by denudation  one of the most striking parts of the book is that in which he deals with the effects of denudation in producing basal wrecks or worn down stumps of volcanoes he was enabled to examine a series of cases in which could be traced every gradation from perfect volcanic cones down to the solidified plugs which had consolidated in the vents from which ejections had taken place darwins observations on these points have been of the greatest value and assistance to all who have essayed to study the effects of volcanic action during earlier periods of the earths history like lyell he was firmly persuaded of the continuity of geological history and ever delighted in finding indications in the present order of nature that the phenomena of the past could be accounted for by means of causes which are still in operation lyells last work in the field was carried on about his home in forfarshire and only a few months before his death he wrote to darwin all the work which i have done has confirmed me in the belief that the only difference between palaeozoic and recent volcanic rocks is no more than we must allow for by the enormous time to which the products of the oldest volcanoes have been subjected to chemical changes  darwin was greatly impressed as the result of his studies of volcanic phenomena followed by an examination of the great granitemasses of the andes with the relations between the socalled plutonic rocks and those of undoubtedly volcanic origin it was indeed a fortunate circumstance that after studying some excellent examples of recent volcanic rocks he proceeded to examine in south america many fine illustrations of the older igneous rockmasses and especially of the most highly crystalline types of the same and then on his way home had opportunities of reviving the impression made upon him by the fresh and unaltered volcanic rocks some of the general considerations suggested by these observations were discussed in a paper read by him before the geological society on march 7th 1838 under the title on the connection of certain volcanic phenomena and on the formation of mountainchains and the effect of continental elevations the exact bearing of these two classes of facts upon one another are more fully discussed in his book on south american geology  the proofs of recent elevation around many of the volcanic islands led darwin to conclude that volcanic areas were as a rule regions in which upward movements were taking place and he was naturally led to contrast them with the areas in which as he showed the occurrence of atolls encircling reefs and barrierreefs afford indication of subsidence in this way he was able to map out the oceanic areas in different zones along which opposite kinds of movement were taking place his conclusions on this subject were full of novelty and suggestiveness  very clearly did darwin recognise the importance of the fact that most of the oceanic islands appear to be of volcanic origin though he was careful to point out the remarkable exceptions which somewhat invalidate the generalisation in his origin of species he has elaborated the idea and suggested the theory of the permanence of oceanbasins a suggestion which has been adopted and pushed farther by subsequent authors than we think its originator would have approved his caution and fairness of mind on this and similar speculative questions was wellknown to all who were in the habit of discussing them with him  some years before the voyage of the beagle mr poulett scrope had pointed out the remarkable analogies that exist between certain igneous rocks of banded structure as seen in the ponza islands and the foliated crystalline schists it does not appear that darwin was acquainted with this remarkable memoir but quite independently he called attention to the same phenomena when he came to study some very similar rocks which occur in the island of ascension coming fresh from the study of the great masses of crystalline schist in the south american continent he was struck by the circumstance that in the undoubtedly igneous rocks of ascension we find a similar separation of the constituent minerals along parallel folia these observations led darwin to the same conclusion as that arrived at some time before by scropenamely that when crystallisation takes place in rock masses under the influence of great deforming stresses a separation and parallel arrangement of the constituent minerals will result this is a process which is now fully recognised as having been a potent factor in the production of the metamorphic rock and has been called by more recent writers dynamometamorphism  in this and in many similar discussions in which exact mineralogical knowledge was required it is remarkable how successful darwin was in making out the true facts with regard to the rocks he studied by the simple aid of a penknife and pocketlens supplemented by a few chemical tests and the constant use of the blowpipe since his day the method of study of rocks by thin sections under the microscope has been devised and has become a most efficient aid in all petrographical inquiries during the voyage of hms challenger many of the islands studied by darwin have been revisited and their rocks collected the results of their study by one of the greatest masters of the science of micropetrographyprofessor renard of brusselshave been recently published in one of the volumes of reports on the challenger expedition while much that is new and valuable has been contributed to geological science by these more recent investigations and many changes have been made in nomenclature and other points of detail it is interesting to find that all the chief facts described by darwin and his friend professor miller have stood the test of time and further study and remain as a monument of the acumen and accuracy in minute observation of these pioneers in geological research  john w judd    chapter ist jago

cape de verde islands  the island of st jago extends in a nnw and sse direction thirty miles in length by about twelve in breadth my observations made during two visits were confined to the southern portion within the distance of a few leagues from porto praya the country viewed from the sea presents a varied outline smooth conical hills of a reddish colour like red hill in figure 1 map 1 the

thousand feet in height traverses the interior of the island there is no active volcano in st jago and only one in the group namely at fogo the island since being inhabited has not suffered from destructive earthquakes  the lowest rocks exposed on the coast near porto praya are highly crystalline and compact they appear to be of ancient submarine volcanic origin they are unconformably covered by a thin irregular calcareous deposit abounding with shells of a late tertiary period and this again is capped by a wide sheet of basaltic lava which has flowed in successive streams from the interior of the island between the squaretopped hills marked a b c etc still more recent streams of lava have been erupted from the scattered cones such as red and signal post hills the upper strata of the squaretopped hills are intimately related in mineralogical composition and in other respects with the lowest series of the coast rocks with which they seem to be continuous  mineralogical description of the rocks of the lowest series   these rocks possess an extremely varying character they consist of black brown and grey compact basaltic bases with numerous crystals of augite hornblende olivine mica and sometimes glassy feldspar a common variety is almost entirely composed of crystals of augite with olivine mica it is known seldom occurs where augite abounds nor probably does the present case offer a real exception for the mica at least in my best characterised specimen in which one nodule of this mineral is nearly half an inch in length is as perfectly rounded as a pebble in a conglomerate and evidently has not been crystallised in the base in which it is now enclosed but has proceeded from the fusion of some preexisting rock these compact lavas alternate with tuffs amygdaloids and wacke and in some places with coarse conglomerate some of the argillaceous wackes are of a dark green colour others pale yellowishgreen and others nearly white i was surprised to find that some of the latter varieties even where whitest fused into a jet black enamel whilst some of the green varieties afforded only a pale gray bead numerous dikes consisting chiefly of highly compact augitic rocks and of gray amygdaloidal varieties intersect the strata which have in several places been dislocated with considerable violence and thrown into highly inclined positions one line of disturbance crosses the northern end of quail island an islet in the bay of porto praya and can be followed to the mainland these disturbances took place before the deposition of the recent sedimentary bed and the surface also had previously been denuded to a great extent as is shown by many truncated dikes   description of the calcareous deposit overlying the foregoing volcanic rocks   this stratum is very conspicuous from its white colour and from the extreme regularity with which it ranges in a horizontal line for some miles along the coast its average height above the sea measured from the upper line of junction with the superincumbent basaltic lava is about sixty feet and its thickness although varying much from the inequalities of the underlying formation may be estimated at about twenty feet it consists of quite white calcareous matter partly composed of organic debris and partly of a substance which may be aptly compared in appearance with mortar fragments of rock and pebbles are scattered throughout this bed often forming especially in the lower part a conglomerate many of the fragments of rock are whitewashed with a thin coating of calcareous matter at quail island the calcareous deposit is replaced in its lowest part by a soft brown earthy tuff full of turritellae this is covered by a bed of pebbles passing into sandstone and mixed with fragments of echini claws of crabs and shells the oystershells still adhering to the rock on which they grew numerous white balls appearing like pisolitic concretions from the size of a walnut to that of an apple are embedded in this deposit they usually have a small pebble in their centres although so like concretions a close examination convinced me that they were nulliporae retaining their proper forms but with their surfaces slightly abraded these bodies plants as they are now generally considered to be exhibit under a microscope of ordinary power no traces of organisation in their internal structure mr george r sowerby has been so good as to examine the shells which i collected there are fourteen species in a sufficiently perfect condition for their characters to be made out with some degree of certainty and four which can be referred only to their genera of the fourteen shells of which a list is given in the appendix eleven are recent species one though undescribed is perhaps identical with a species which i found living in the harbour of porto praya the two remaining species are unknown and have been described by mr sowerby until the shells of this archipelago and of the neighbouring coasts are better known it would be rash to assert that even these two latter shells are extinct the number of species which certainly belong to existing kinds although few in number are sufficient to show that the deposit belongs to a late tertiary period from its mineralogical character from the number and size of the embedded fragments and from the abundance of patellae and other littoral shells it is evident that the whole was accumulated in a shallow sea near an ancient coastline  effects produced by the flowing of the superincumbent basaltic lava over the calcareous deposit  these effects are very curious the calcareous matter is altered to the depth of about a foot beneath the line of junction and a most perfect gradation can be traced from loosely aggregated small particles of shells corallines and nulliporae into a rock in which not a trace of mechanical origin can be discovered even with a microscope where the metamorphic change has been greatest two varieties occur the first is a hard compact white finegrained rock striped with a few parallel lines of black volcanic particles and resembling a sandstone but which upon close examination is seen to be crystallised throughout with the cleavages so perfect that they can be readily measured by the reflecting goniometer in specimens where the change has been less complete when moistened and examined under a strong lens the most interesting gradation can be traced some of the rounded particles retaining their proper forms and others insensibly melting into the granulocrystalline paste the weathered surface of this stone as is so frequently the case with ordinary limestones assumes a brickred colour  the second metamorphosed variety is likewise a hard rock but without any crystalline structure it consists of a white opaque compact calcareous stone thickly mottled with rounded though regular spots of a soft earthy ochraceous substance this earthy matter is of a pale yellowish brown colour and appears to be a mixture of carbonate of lime with iron it effervesces with acids is infusible but blackens under the blowpipe and becomes magnetic the rounded form of the minute patches of earthy substance and the steps in the progress of their perfect formation which can be followed in a suit of specimens clearly show that they are due either to some power of aggregation in the earthy particles amongst themselves or more probably to a strong attraction between the atoms of the carbonate of line and consequently to the segregation of the earthy extraneous matter i was much interested by this fact because i have often seen quartz rocks for instance in the falkland islands and in the lower silurian strata of the stiperstones in shropshire mottled in a precisely analogous manner with little spots of a white earthy substance earthy feldspar and these rocks there was good reason to suppose had undergone the action of heata view which thus receives confirmation this spotted structure may possibly afford some indication in distinguishing those formations of quartz which owe their present structure to igneous action from those produced by the agency of water alone a source of doubt which i should think from my own experience that most geologists when examining arenaceoquartzose districts must have experienced  the lowest and most scoriaceous part of the lava in rolling over the sedimentary deposit at the bottom of the sea has caught up large quantities of calcareous matter which now forms a snowwhite highly crystalline basis to a breccia including small pieces of black glossy scoriae a little above this where the lime is less abundant and the lava more compact numerous little balls composed of spicula of calcareous spar radiating from common centres occupy the interstices in one part of quail island the lime has thus been crystallised by the heat of the superincumbent lava where it is only thirteen feet in thickness nor had the lava been originally thicker and since reduced by degradation as could be told from the degree of cellularity of its surface i have already observed that the sea must have been shallow in which the calcareous deposit was accumulated in this case therefore the carbonic acid gas has been retained under a pressure insignificant compared with that a column of water 1708 feet in height originally supposed by sir james hall to be requisite for this end but since his experiments it has been discovered that pressure has less to do with the retention of carbonic acid gas than the nature of the circumjacent atmosphere and hence as is stated to be the case by mr faraday masses of limestone are sometimes fused and crystallised even in common limekilns i am much indebted to mr ew brayley in having given me the following references to papers on this subject faraday in the edinburgh new philosophical journal volume 15 page 398 gaylussac in annales de chem et phys tome 63 page 219 translated in the london and edinburgh philosophical magazine volume 10 page 496 carbonate of lime can be heated to almost any degree according to faraday in an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas without being decomposed and gaylussac found that fragments of limestone placed in a tube and heated to a degree not sufficient by itself to cause their decomposition yet immediately evolved their carbonic acid when a stream of common air or steam was passed over them gaylussac attributes this to the mechanical displacement of the nascent carbonic acid gas the calcareous matter beneath the lava and especially that forming the crystalline spicula between the interstices of the scoriae although heated in an atmosphere probably composed chiefly of steam could not have been subjected to the effects of a passing stream and hence it is perhaps that they have retained their carbonic acid under a small amount of pressure  the fragments of scoriae embedded in the crystalline calcareous basis are of a jet black colour with a glossy fracture like pitchstone their surfaces however are coated with a layer of a reddishorange translucent substance which can easily be scratched with a knife hence they appear as if overlaid by a thin layer of rosin some of the smaller fragments are partially changed throughout into this substance a change which appears quite different from ordinary decomposition at the galapagos archipelago as will be described in a future chapter great beds are formed of volcanic ashes and particles of scoriae which have undergone a closely similar change   the extent and horizontality of the calcareous stratum   figure 2 signal post hill section with a low and c high  aancient volcanic rocks  bcalcareous stratum  cupper basaltic lava  the upper line of surface of the calcareous stratum which is so conspicuous from being quite white and so nearly horizontal ranges for miles along the coast at the height of about sixty feet above the sea the sheet of basalt by which it is capped is on an average eighty feet in thickness westward of porto praya beyond red hill the white stratum with the superincumbent basalt is covered up by more recent streams northward of signal post hill i could follow it with my eye trending away for several miles along the sea cliffs the distance thus observed is about seven miles but i cannot doubt from its regularity that it extends much farther in some ravines at right angles to the coast it is seen gently dipping towards the sea probably with the same inclination as when deposited round the ancient shores of the island i found only one inland section namely at the base of the hill marked a where at the height of some hundred feet this bed was exposed it here rested on the usual compact augitic rock associated with wacke and was covered by the widespread sheet of modern basaltic lava some exceptions occur to the horizontality of the white stratum at quail island its upper surface is only forty feet above the level of the sea here also the capping of lava is only between twelve and fifteen feet in thickness on the other hand at the northeast side of porto praya harbour the calcareous stratum as well as the rock on which it rests attain a height above the average level the inequality of level in these two cases is not as i believe owing to unequal elevation but to original irregularities at the bottom of the sea of this fact at quail island there was clear evidence in the calcareous deposit being in one part of much greater than the average thickness and in another part being entirely absent in this latter case the modern basaltic lavas rested directly on those of more ancient origin   under signal post hill the white stratum dips into the sea in a remarkable manner this hill is conical 450 feet in height and retains some traces of having had a crateriform structure it is composed chiefly of matter erupted posteriorly to the elevation of the great basaltic plain but partly of lava of apparently submarine origin and of considerable antiquity the surrounding plain as well as the eastern flank of this hill has been worn into steep precipices overhanging the sea in these precipices the white calcareous stratum may be seen at the height of about seventy feet above the beach running for some miles both northward and southward of the hill in a line appearing to be perfectly horizontal but for a space of a quarter of a mile directly under the hill it dips into the sea and disappears on the south side the dip is gradual on the north side it is more abrupt as is shown in figure 2 as neither the calcareous stratum nor the superincumbent basaltic lava as far as the latter can be distinguished from the more modern ejections appears to thicken as it dips i infer that these strata were not originally accumulated in a trough the centre of which afterwards became a point of eruption but that they have subsequently been disturbed and bent we may suppose either that signal post hill subsided after its elevation with the surrounding country or that it never was uplifted to the same height with it this latter seems to me the most probable alternative for during the slow and equable elevation of this portion of the island the subterranean motive power from expending part of its force in repeatedly erupting volcanic matter from beneath this point would it is likely have less force to uplift it something of the same kind seems to have occurred near red hill for when tracing upwards the naked streams of lava from near porto praya towards the interior of the island i was strongly induced to suspect that since the lava had flowed the slope of the land had been slightly modified either by a small subsidence near red hill or by that portion of the plain having been uplifted to a less height during the elevation of the whole area  the basaltic lava superincumbent on the calcareous deposit  this lava is of a pale grey colour fusing into a black enamel its fracture is rather earthy and concretionary it contains olivine in small grains the central parts of the mass are compact or at most crenulated with a few minute cavities and are often columnar at quail island this structure was assumed in a striking manner the lava in one part being divided into horizontal laminae which became in another part split by vertical fissures into fivesided plates and these again being piled on each other insensibly became soldered together forming fine symmetrical columns the lower surface of the lava is vesicular but sometimes only to the thickness of a few inches the upper surface which is likewise vesicular is divided into balls frequently as much as three feet in diameter made up of concentric layers the mass is composed of more than one stream its total thickness being on an average about eighty feet the lower portion has certainly flowed beneath the sea and probably likewise the upper portion the chief part of this lava has flowed from the central districts between the hills marked a b c etc in the woodcut map the surface of the country near the coast is level and barren towards the interior the land rises by successive terraces of which four when viewed from a distance could be distinctly counted   volcanic eruptions subsequent to the elevation of the coastland the ejected matter associated with earthy lime  these recent lavas have proceeded from those scattered conical reddish coloured hills which rise abruptly from the plaincountry near the coast i ascended some of them but will describe only one namely red hill which may serve as a type of its class and is remarkable in some especial respects its height is about six hundred feet it is composed of bright red highly scoriaceous rock of a basaltic nature on one side of its summit there is a hollow probably the last remnant of a crater several of the other hills of this class judging from their external forms are surmounted by much more perfect craters when sailing along the coast it was evident that a considerable body of lava had flowed from red hill over a line of cliff about one hundred and twenty feet in height into the sea this line of cliff is continuous with that forming the coast and bounding the plain on both sides of this hill these streams therefore were erupted after the formation of the coastcliffs from red hill when it must have stood as it now does above the level of the sea this conclusion accords with the highly scoriaceous condition of all the rock on it appearing to be of subaerial formation and this is important as there are some beds of calcareous matter near its summit which might at a hasty glance have been mistaken for a submarine deposit these beds consist of white earthy carbonate of lime extremely friable so as to be crushed with the least pressure the most compact specimens not resisting the strength of the fingers some of the masses are as white as quicklime and appear absolutely pure but on examining them with a lens minute particles of scoriae can always be seen and i could find none which when dissolved in acids did not leave a residue of this nature it is moreover difficult to find a particle of the lime which does not change colour under the blowpipe most of them even becoming glazed the scoriaceous fragments and the calcareous matter are associated in the most irregular manner sometimes in obscure beds but more generally as a confused breccia the lime in some parts and the scoriae in others being most abundant sir h de la beche has been so kind as to have some of the purest specimens analysed with a view to discover considering their volcanic origin whether they contained much magnesia but only a small portion was found such as is present in most limestones  fragments of the scoriae embedded in the calcareous mass when broken exhibit many of their cells lined and partly filled with a white delicate excessively fragile mosslike or rather confervalike reticulation of carbonate of lime these fibres examined under a lens of onetenth of an inch focal distance appear cylindrical they are rather above one thousandth of an inch in diameter they are either simply branched or more commonly united into an irregular mass of network with the meshes of very unequal sizes and of unequal numbers of sides some of the fibres are thickly covered with extremely minute spicula occasionally aggregated into little tuffs and hence they have a hairy appearance these spicula are of the same diameter throughout their length they are easily detached so that the objectglass of the microscope soon becomes scattered over with them within the cells of many fragments of the scoria the lime exhibits this fibrous structure but generally in a less perfect degree these cells do not appear to be connected with one another there can be no doubt as will presently be shown that the lime was erupted mingled with the lava in its fluid state and therefore i have thought it worth while to describe minutely this curious fibrous structure of which i know nothing analogous from the earthy condition of the fibres this structure does not appear to be related to crystallisation  other fragments of the scoriaceous rock from this hill when broken are often seen marked with short and irregular white streaks which are owing to a row of separate cells being partly or quite filled with white calcareous powder this structure immediately reminded me of the appearance in badly kneaded dough of balls and drawnout streaks of flour which have remained unmixed with the paste and i cannot doubt that small masses of the lime in the same manner remaining unmixed with the fluid lava have been drawn out when the whole was in motion i carefully examined by trituration and solution in acids pieces of the scoriae taken from within halfaninch of those cells which were filled with the calcareous powder and they did not contain an atom of free lime it is obvious that the lava and lime have on a large scale been very imperfectly mingled and where small portions of the lime have been entangled within a piece of the viscid lava the cause of their now occupying in the form of a powder or of a fibrous reticulation the vesicular cavities is i think evidently due to the confined gases having most readily expanded at the points where the incoherent lime rendered the lava less adhesive  a mile eastward of the town of praya there is a steepsided gorge about one hundred and fifty yards in width cutting through the basaltic plain and underlying beds but since filled up by a stream of more modern lava this lava is dark grey and in most parts compact and rudely columnar but at a little distance from the coast it includes in an irregular manner a brecciated mass of red scoriae mingled with a considerable quantity of white friable and in some parts nearly pure earthy lime like that on the summit of red hill this lava with its entangled lime has certainly flowed in the form of a regular stream and judging from the shape of the gorge towards which the drainage of the country feeble though it now be still is directed and from the appearance of the bed of loose waterworn blocks with their interstices unfilled like those in the bed of a torrent on which the lava rests we may conclude that the stream was of subaerial origin i was unable to trace it to its source but from its direction it seemed to have come from signal post hill distant one mile and a quarter which like red hill has been a point of eruption subsequent to the elevation of the great basaltic plain it accords with this view that i found on signal post hill a mass of earthy calcareous matter of the same nature mingled with scoriae i may here observe that part of the calcareous matter forming the horizontal sedimentary bed especially the finer matter with which the embedded fragments of rock are whitewashed has probably been derived from similar volcanic eruptions as well as from triturated organic remains the underlying ancient crystalline rocks also are associated with much carbonate of lime filling amygdaloidal cavities and forming irregular masses the nature of which latter i was unable to understand  considering the abundance of earthy lime near the summit of red hill a volcanic cone six hundred feet in height of subaerial growthconsidering the intimate manner in which minute particles and large masses of scoriae are embedded in the masses of nearly pure lime and on the other hand the manner in which small kernels and streaks of the calcareous powder are included in solid pieces of the scoriaeconsidering also the similar occurrence of lime and scoriae within a stream of lava also supposed with good reason to have been of modern subaerial origin and to have flowed from a hill where earthy lime also occurs i think considering these facts there can be no doubt that the lime has been erupted mingled with the molten lava i am not aware that any similar case has been described it appears to me an interesting one inasmuch as most geologists must have speculated on the probable effects of a volcanic focus bursting through deepseated beds of different mineralogical composition the great abundance of free silex in the trachytes of some countries as described by beudant in hungary and by p scrope in the panza islands perhaps solves the inquiry with respect to deepseated beds of quartz and we probably here see it answered where the volcanic action has invaded subjacent masses of limestone one is naturally led to conjecture in what state the now earthy carbonate of lime existed when ejected with the intensely heated lava from the extreme cellularity of the scoriae on red hill the pressure cannot have been great and as most volcanic eruptions are accompanied by the emission of large quantities of steam and other gases we here have the most favourable conditions according to the views at present entertained by chemists for the expulsion of the carbonic acid whilst deep beneath the surface the carbonate of lime was i presume in a fluid state hutton it is known thought that all amygdaloids were produced by drops of molten limestone floating in the trap like oil in water this no doubt is erroneous but if the matter forming the summit of red hill had been cooled under the pressure of a moderately deep sea or within the walls of a dike we should in all probability have had a trap rock associated with large masses of compact crystalline calcareous spar which according to the views entertained by many geologists would have been wrongly attributed to subsequent infiltration has the slow re absorption of this gas it may be asked given to the lime in the cells of the lava that peculiar fibrous structure like that of an efflorescing salt finally i may remark on the great contrast in appearance between this earthy lime which must have been heated in a free atmosphere of steam and other gases while the white crystalline calcareous spar produced by a single thin sheet of lava as at quail island rolling over similar earthy lime and the debris of organic remains at the bottom of a shallow sea  signal post hill  this hill has already been several times mentioned especially with reference to the remarkable manner in which the white calcareous stratum in other parts so horizontal figure 2 dips under it into the sea it has a broad summit with obscure traces of a crateriform structure and is composed of basaltic rocks of these one common variety is remarkable for being full of small fragments of a dark jasperred earthy mineral which when examined carefully shows an indistinct cleavage the little fragments are elongated in form are soft are magnetic before and after being heated and fuse with difficulty into a dull enamel this mineral is evidently closely related to the oxides of iron but i cannot ascertain what it exactly is the rock containing this mineral is crenulated with small angular cavities which are lined and filled with yellowish crystals of carbonate of lime some compact others highly cellular with inclined beds of loose scoriae of which some are associated with earthy lime like red hill it has been the source of eruptions subsequently to the elevation of the surrounding basaltic plain but unlike that hill it has undergone considerable denudation and has been the seat of volcanic action at a remote period when beneath the sea i judge of this latter circumstance from finding on its inland flank the last remains of three small points of eruption these points are composed of glossy scoriae cemented by crystalline calcareous spar exactly like the great submarine calcareous deposit where the heated lava has rolled over it their demolished state can i think be explained only by the denuding action of the waves of the sea i was guided to the first orifice by observing a sheet of lava about two hundred yards square with steepish sides superimposed on the basaltic plain with no adjoining hillock whence it could have been erupted and the only trace of a crater which i was able to discover consisted of some inclined beds of scoriae at one of its corners at the distance of fifty yards from a second leveltopped patch of lava but of much smaller size i found an irregular circular group of masses of cemented scoriaceous breccia about six feet in height which doubtless had once formed the point of eruption the third orifice is now marked only by an irregular circle of cemented scoriae about four yards in diameter and rising in its highest point scarcely three feet above the level of the plain the surface of which close all round exhibits its usual appearance here we have a horizontal basal section of a volcanic spiracle which together with all its ejected matter has been almost totally obliterated  the stream of lava which fills the narrow gorge eastward of the town of praya judging from its course seems as before remarked to have come from signal post hill and to have flowed over the plain after its elevation the sides of this gorge where the upper basaltic stratum is intersected are almost perpendicular the lava which has since filled it up is attached to these sides almost as firmly as a dike is to its walls in most cases where a stream of lava has flowed down a valley it is bounded on each side by loose scoriaceous masses the same observation applies to a stream possibly part of the same one capping the sea cliffs a little eastward of the gorge when i endeavoured to follow these streams over the stony level plain which is almost destitute of soil and vegetation i was much surprised to find that although composed of hard basaltic matter and not having been exposed to marine denudation all distant traces of them soon became utterly lost but i have since observed at the galapagos archipelago that it is often impossible to follow even great deluges of quite recent lava across older streams except by the size of the bushes growing on them or by the comparative states of glossiness of their surfacescharacters which a short lapse of time would be sufficient quite to obscure i may remark that in a level country with a dry climate and with the wind blowing always in one direction as at the cape de verde archipelago the effects of atmospheric degradation are probably much greater than would at first be expected for soil in this case accumulates only in a few protected hollows and being blown in one direction it is always travelling towards the sea in the form of the finest dust leaving the surface of the rocks bare and exposed to the full effects of renewed meteoric action  inland hills of more ancient volcanic rocks  these hills are laid down by eye and marked as a b c etc in map 1 they are related in mineralogical composition and are probably directly continuous with the lowest rocks exposed on the coast these hills viewed from a distance appear as if they had once formed part of an irregular tableland and from their corresponding structure and composition this probably has been the case they have flat slightly inclined summits and are on an average about six hundred feet in height they present their steepest slope towards the interior of the island from which point they radiate outwards and are separated from each other by broad and deep valleys through which the great streams of lava forming the coastplains have descended their inner and steeper escarpments are ranged in an irregular curve which rudely follows the line of the shore two or three miles inland from it i ascended a few of these hills and from others which i was able to examine with a telescope i obtained specimens through the kindness of mr kent the assistantsurgeon of the beagle although by these means i am acquainted with only a part of the range five or six miles in length yet i scarcely hesitate from their uniform structure to affirm that they are parts of one great formation stretching round much of the circumference of the island  the upper and lower strata of these hills differ greatly in composition the upper are basaltic generally compact but sometimes scoriaceous and amygdaloidal with associated masses of wacke where the basalt is compact it is either finegrained or very coarsely crystallised in the latter case it passes into an augitic rock containing much olivine the olivine is either colourless or of the usual yellow and dull reddish shades on some of the hills beds of calcareous matter both in an earthy and in a crystalline form including fragments of glossy scoriae are associated with the basaltic strata these strata differ from the streams of basaltic lava forming the coastplains only in being more compact and in the crystals of augite and in the grains of olivine being of much greater sizecharacters which together with the appearance of the associated calcareous beds induce me to believe that they are of submarine formation  some considerable masses of wacke which are associated with these basaltic strata and which likewise occur in the basal series on the coast especially at quail island are curious they consist of a pale yellowish green argillaceous substance of a crumbling texture when dry but unctuous when moist in its purest form it is of a beautiful green tint with translucent edges and occasionally with obscure traces of an original cleavage under the blowpipe it fuses very readily into a dark grey and sometimes even black bead which is slightly magnetic from these characters i naturally thought that it was one of the pale species decomposed of the genus augitea conclusion supported by the unaltered rock being full of large separate crystals of black augite and of balls and irregular streaks of dark grey augitic rock as the basalt ordinarily consists of augite and of olivine often tarnished and of a dull red colour i was led to examine the stages of decomposition of this latter mineral and i found to my surprise that i could trace a nearly perfect gradation from unaltered olivine to the green wacke part of the same grain under the blowpipe would in some instances behave like olivine its colour being only slightly changed and part would give a black magnetic bead hence i can have no doubt that the greenish wacke originally existed as olivine but great chemical changes must have been effected during the act of decomposition thus to have altered a very hard transparent infusible mineral into a soft unctuous easily melted argillaceous substance daubuisson traite de geognosie tome 2 page 569 mentions on the authority of m marcel de serres masses of green earth near montpellier which are supposed to be due to the decomposition of olivine i do not however find that the action of this mineral under the blowpipe being entirely altered as it becomes decomposed has been noticed and the knowledge of this fact is important as at first it appears highly improbable that a hard transparent refractory mineral should be changed into a soft easily fused clay like this of st jago i shall hereafter describe a green substance forming threads within the cells of some vesicular basaltic rocks in van diemens land which behave under the blowpipe like the green wacke of st jago but its occurrence in cylindrical threads shows it cannot have resulted from the decomposition of olivine a mineral always existing in the form of grains or crystals  the basal strata of these hills as well as some neighbouring separate bare rounded hillocks consist of compact finegrained noncrystalline or so slightly as scarcely to be perceptible ferruginous feldspathic rocks and generally in a state of semidecomposition their fracture is exceedingly irregular and splintery yet small fragments are often very tough they contain much ferruginous matter either in the form of minute grains with a metallic lustre or of brown hairlike threads the rock in this latter case assuming a pseudobrecciated structure these rocks sometimes contain mica and veins of agate their rusty brown or yellowish colour is partly due to the oxides of iron but chiefly to innumerable microscopically minute black specks which when a fragment is heated are easily fused and evidently are either hornblende or augite these rocks therefore although at first appearing like baked clay or some altered sedimentary deposit contain all the essential ingredients of trachyte from which they differ only in not being harsh and in not containing crystals of glassy feldspar as is so often the case with trachytic formation no stratification is here apparent a person would not readily believe that these rocks could have flowed as lava yet at st helena there are wellcharacterised streams as will be described in an ensuing chapter of nearly similar composition amidst the hillocks composed of these rocks i found in three places smooth conical hills of phonolite abounding with fine crystals of glassy feldspar and with needles of hornblende these cones of phonolite i believe bear the same relation to the surrounding feldspathic strata which some masses of coarsely crystallised augitic rock in another part of the island bear to the surrounding basalt namely that both have been injected the rocks of a feldspathic nature being anterior in origin to the basaltic strata which cap them as well as to the basaltic streams of the coastplains accords with the usual order of succession of these two grand divisions of the volcanic series  the strata of most of these hills in the upper part where alone the planes of division are distinguishable are inclined at a small angle from the interior of the island towards the seacoast the inclination is not the same in each hill in that marked a it is less than in b d or e in c the strata are scarcely deflected from a horizontal plane and in f as far as i could judge without ascending it they are slightly inclined in a reverse direction that is inwards and towards the centre of the island notwithstanding these differences of inclination their correspondence in external form and in the composition both of their upper and lower parts their relative position in one curved line with their steepest sides turned inwardsall seem to show that they originally formed parts of one platform which platform as before remarked probably extended round a considerable portion of the circumference of the island the upper strata certainly flowed as lava and probably beneath the sea as perhaps did the lower feldspathic masses how then come these strata to hold their present position and whence were they erupted  in the centre of the island there are lofty mountains but they are separated from the steep inland flanks of these hills by a wide space of lower country the interior mountains moreover seem to have been the source of those great streams of basaltic lava which contracting as they pass between the bases of the hills in question expand into the coast plains i saw very little of the inland parts of the island near the village of st domingo there are magnificent cliffs of rather coarsely crystallised basaltic lava following the little stream in this valley about a mile above the village the base of the great cliff was formed of a compact finegrained basalt conformably covered by a bed of pebbles near fuentes i met with papformed hills of the compact feldspathic series of rocks round the shores of st helena there is a rudely formed ring of basaltic rocks and at mauritius there are remnants of another such a ring round part if not round the whole of the island here again the same question immediately occurs how came these masses to hold their present position and whence were they erupted the same answer whatever it may be probably applies in these three cases and in a future chapter we shall recur to this subject  valleys near the coast  these are broad very flat and generally bounded by low cliffformed sides portions of the basaltic plain are sometimes nearly or quite isolated by them of which fact the space on which the town of praya stands offers an instance the great valley west of the town has its bottom filled up to a depth of more than twenty feet by wellrounded pebbles which in some parts are firmly cemented together by white calcareous matter there can be no doubt from the form of these valleys that they were scooped out by the waves of the sea during that equable elevation of the land of which the horizontal calcareous deposit with its existing species of marine remains gives evidence considering how well shells have been preserved in this stratum it is singular that i could not find even a single small fragment of shell in the conglomerate at the bottom of the valleys the bed of pebbles in the valley west of the town is intersected by a second valley joining it as a tributary but even this valley appears much too wide and flatbottomed to have been formed by the small quantity of water which falls only during one short wet season for at other times of the year these valleys are absolutely dry  recent conglomerate  on the shores of quail island i found fragments of brick bolts of iron pebbles and large fragments of basalt united by a scanty base of impure calcareous matter into a firm conglomerate to show how exceedingly firm this recent conglomerate is i may mention that i endeavoured with a heavy geological hammer to knock out a thick bolt of iron which was embedded a little above lowwater mark but was quite unable to succeed   chapter iifernando noronha terceira tahiti etc  fernando

composition   fernando noronha  during our short visit at this and the four following islands i observed very little worthy of description fernando noronha is situated in the atlantic ocean in latitude 3 degrees 50 minutes s and 230 miles distant from the coast of south america it consists of several islets together nine miles in length by three in breadth the whole seems to be of volcanic origin although there is no appearance of any crater or of any one central eminence the most remarkable feature is a hill 1000 feet high of which the upper 400 feet consist of a precipitous singularly shaped pinnacle formed of columnar phonolite containing numerous crystals of glassy feldspar and a few needles of hornblende from the highest accessible point of this hill i could distinguish in different parts of the group several other conical hills apparently of the same nature at st helena there are similar great conical protuberant masses of phonolite nearly one thousand feet in height which have been formed by the injection of fluid feldspathic lava into yielding strata if this hill has had as is probable a similar origin denudation has been here effected on an enormous scale near the base of this hill i observed beds of white tuff intersected by numerous dikes some of amygdaloidal basalt and others of trachyte and beds of slaty phonolite with the planes of cleavage directed nw and se parts of this rock where the crystals were scanty closely resembled common clayslate altered by the contact of a trapdike the lamination of rocks which undoubtedly have once been fluid appears to me a subject well deserving attention on the beach there were numerous fragments of compact basalt of which rock a distant facade of columns seemed to be formed  terceira in the azores  the central parts of this island consist of irregularly rounded mountains of no great elevation composed of trachyte which closely resembles in general character the trachyte of ascension presently to be described this formation is in many parts overlaid in the usual order of superposition by streams of basaltic lava which near the coast compose nearly the whole surface the course which these streams have followed from their craters can often be followed by the eye the town of angra is overlooked by a crateriform hill mount brazil entirely built of thin strata of finegrained harsh browncoloured tuff the upper beds are seen to overlap the basaltic streams on which the town stands this hill is almost identical in structure and composition with numerous crateriformed hills in the galapagos archipelago  effects of steam on the trachytic rocks  in the central part of the island there is a spot where steam is constantly issuing in jets from the bottom of a small ravinelike hollow which has no exit and which abuts against a range of trachytic mountains the steam is emitted from several irregular fissures it is scentless soon blackens iron and is of much too high temperature to be endured by the hand the manner in which the solid trachyte is changed on the borders of these orifices is curious first the base becomes earthy with red freckles evidently due to the oxidation of particles of iron then it becomes soft and lastly even the crystals of glassy feldspar yield to the dissolving agent after the mass is converted into clay the oxide of iron seems to be entirely removed from some parts which are left perfectly white whilst in other neighbouring parts which are of the brightest red colour it seems to be deposited in greater quantity some other masses are marbled with two distinct colours portions of the white clay now that they are dry cannot be distinguished by the eye from the finest prepared chalk and when placed between the teeth they feel equally softgrained the inhabitants use this substance for whitewashing their houses the cause of the iron being dissolved in one part and close by being again deposited is obscure but the fact has been observed in several other places spallanzani dolomieu and hoffman have described similar cases in the italian volcanic islands dolomieu says the iron at the panza islands is redeposited in the form of veins page 86 memoire sur les isles ponces these authors likewise believe that the steam deposits silica it is now experimentally known that vapour of a high temperature is able to dissolve silica in some halfdecayed specimens i found small globular aggregations of yellow hyalite resembling gumarabic which no doubt had been deposited by the steam  as there is no escape for the rainwater which trickles down the sides of the ravinelike hollow whence the steam issues it must all percolate downwards through the fissures at its bottom some of the inhabitants informed me that it was on record that flames some luminous appearance had originally proceeded from these cracks and that the flames had been succeeded by the steam but i was not able to ascertain how long this was ago or anything certain on the subject when viewing the spot i imagined that the injection of a large mass of rock like the cone of phonolite at fernando noronha in a semifluid state by arching the surface might have caused a wedgeshaped hollow with cracks at the bottom and that the rain water percolating to the neighbourhood of the heated mass would during many succeeding years be driven back in the form of steam  tahiti otaheite  i visited only a part of the northwestern side of this island and this part is entirely composed of volcanic rocks near the coast there are several varieties of basalt some abounding with large crystals of augite and tarnished olivine others compact and earthysome slightly vesicular and others occasionally amygdaloidal these rocks are generally much decomposed and to my surprise i found in several sections that it was impossible to distinguish even approximately the line of separation between the decayed lava and the alternating beds of tuff since the specimens have become dry it is rather more easy to distinguish the decomposed igneous rocks from the sedimentary tuffs this gradation in character between rocks having such widely different origins may i think be explained by the yielding under pressure of the softened sides of the vesicular cavities which in many volcanic rocks occupy a large proportion of their bulk as the vesicles generally increase in size and number in the upper parts of a stream of lava so would the effects of their compression increase the yielding moreover of each lower vesicle must tend to disturb all the softened matter above it hence we might expect to trace a perfect gradation from an unaltered crystalline rock to one in which all the particles although originally forming part of the same solid mass had undergone mechanical displacement and such particles could hardly be distinguished from others of similar composition which had been deposited as sediment as lavas are sometimes laminated in their upper parts even horizontal lines appearing like those of aqueous deposition could not in all cases be relied on as a criterion of sedimentary origin from these considerations it is not surprising that formerly many geologists believed in real transitions from aqueous deposits through wacke into igneous traps  in the valley of tiaauru the commonest rocks are basalts with much olivine and in some cases almost composed of large crystals of augite i picked up some specimens with much glassy feldspar approaching in character to trachyte there were also many large blocks of vesicular basalt with the cavities beautifully lined with chabasie  and radiating bundles of mesotype some of these specimens presented a curious appearance owing to a number of the vesicles being half filled up with a white soft earthy mesotypic mineral which intumesced under the blowpipe in a remarkable manner as the upper surfaces in all the halffilled cells are exactly parallel it is evident that this substance has sunk to the bottom of each cell from its weight sometimes however it entirely fills the cells other cells are either quite filled or lined with small crystals apparently of chabasie these crystals also frequently line the upper half of the cells partly filled with the earthy mineral as well as the upper surface of this substance itself in which case the two minerals appear to blend into each other i have never seen any other amygdaloid with the cells half filled in the manner here described and it is difficult to imagine the causes which determined the earthy mineral to sink from its gravity to the bottom of the cells and the crystalline mineral to adhere in a coating of equal thickness round the sides of the cells macculloch however has described and given a plate of geolog trans 1st series volume 4 page 225 a trap rock with cavities filled up horizontally with quartz and chalcedony the upper halves of these cavities are often filled by layers which follow each irregularity of the surface and by little depending stalactites of the same siliceous substances  the basic strata on the sides of the valley are gently inclined seaward and i nowhere observed any sign of disturbance the strata are separated from each other by thick compact beds of conglomerate in which the fragments are large some being rounded but most angular from the character of these beds from the compact and crystalline condition of most of the lavas and from the nature of the infiltrated minerals i was led to conjecture that they had originally flowed beneath the sea this conclusion agrees with the fact that the rev w ellis found marine remains at a considerable height which he believes were interstratified with volcanic matter as is likewise described to be the case by messrs tyerman and bennett at huaheine an island in this same archipelago mr stutchbury also discovered near the summit of one of the loftiest mountains of tahiti at the height of several thousand feet a stratum of semifossil coral none of these remains have been specifically examined on the coast where masses of coralrock would have afforded the clearest evidence i looked in vain for any signs of recent elevation for references to the above authorities and for more detailed reasons for not believing that tahiti has been recently elevated i must refer to the structure and distribution of coralreefs  mauritius  approaching this island on the northern or northwestern side a curved chain of bold mountains surmounted by rugged pinnacles is seen to rise from a smooth border of cultivated land which gently slopes down to the coast at the first glance one is tempted to believe that the sea lately reached the base of these mountains and upon examination this view at least with respect to the inferior parts of the border is found to be perfectly correct several authors have described masses of upraised coral rock round the greater part of the circumference of the island captain carmichael in hookers bot misc volume 2 page 301 captain lloyd has lately in the proceedings of the geological society volume 3 page 317 described carefully some of these masses in the voyage a lisle de france par un officier du roi many interesting facts are given on this subject consult also voyage aux quatre isles dafrique par m bory st vincent between tamarin bay and the great black river i observed in company with captain lloyd two hillocks of coralrock formed in their lower part of hard calcareous sandstone and in their upper of great blocks slightly aggregated of astraea and madrepora and of fragments of basalt they were divided into beds dipping seaward in one case at an angle of 8 degrees and in the other at 18 degrees they had a waterworn appearance and they rose abruptly from a smooth surface strewed with rolled debris of organic remains to a height of about twenty feet the officier du roi in his most interesting tour in 1768 round the island has described masses of upraised coralrocks still retaining that moatlike structure see my coral reefs which is characteristic of the living reefs on the coast northward of port louis i found the lava concealed for a considerable space inland by a conglomerate of corals and shells like those on the beach but in parts consolidated by red ferruginous matter m bory st vincent has described similar calcareous beds over nearly the whole of the plain of pamplemousses near port louis when turning over some large stones which lay in the bed of a stream at the head of a protected creek and at the height of some yards above the level of spring tides i found several shells of serpula still adhering to their under sides  the jagged mountains near port louis rise to a height of between two and three thousand feet they consist of strata of basalt obscurely separated from each other by firmly aggregated beds of fragmentary matter and they are intersected by a few vertical dikes the basalt in some parts abounds with large crystals of augite and olivine and is generally compact the interior of the island forms a plain raised probably about a thousand feet above the level of the sea and composed of streams of lava which have flowed round and between the rugged basaltic mountains these more recent lavas are also basaltic but less compact and some of them abound with feldspar so that they even fuse into a pale coloured glass on the banks of the great river a section is exposed nearly five hundred feet deep worn through numerous thin sheets of the lava of this series which are separated from each other by beds of scoriae they seem to have been of subaerial formation and to have flowed from several points of eruption on the central platform of which the piton du milieu is said to be the principal one there are also several volcanic cones apparently of this modern period round the circumference of the island especially at the northern end where they form separate islets  the mountains composed of the more compact and crystalline basalt form the main skeleton of the island m bailly voyage aux terres australes tome 1 page 54 states that they all se developpent autour delle comme une ceinture dimmenses remparts toutes affectant une pente plus ou moins enclinee vers le rivage de la mer tandis au contraire que vers le centre de lile elles presentent une coupe abrupte et souvent taillee a pic toutes ces montagnes sont formees de couches paralleles inclinees du centre de lile vers la mer these statements have been disputed though not in detail by m quoy in the voyage of freycinet as far as my limited means of observation went i found them perfectly correct m lesson in his account of this island in the voyage of the coquille seems to follow m baillys views the mountains on the nw side of the island which i examined namely la pouce peter botts corps de garde les mamelles and apparently another farther southward have precisely the external shape and stratification described by m bailly they form about a quarter of his girdle of ramparts although these mountains now stand quite detached being separated from each other by breaches even several miles in width through which deluges of lava have flowed from the interior of the island nevertheless seeing their close general similarity one must feel convinced that they originally formed parts of one continuous mass judging from the beautiful map of the mauritius published by the admiralty from a french ms there is a range of mountains m bamboo on the opposite side of the island which correspond in height relative position and external form with those just described whether the girdle was ever complete may well be doubted but from m baillys statements and my own observations it may be safely concluded that mountains with precipitous inland flanks and composed of strata dipping outwards once extended round a considerable portion of the circumference of the island the ring appears to have been oval and of vast size its shorter axis measured across from the inner sides of the mountains near port louis and those near grand port being no less than thirteen geographical miles in length m bailly boldly supposes that this enormous gulf which has since been filled up to a great extent by streams of modern lava was formed by the sinking in of the whole upper part of one great volcano  it is singular in how many respects those portions of st jago and of mauritius which i visited agree in their geological history at both islands mountains of similar external form stratification and at least in their upper beds composition follow in a curved chain the coastline these mountains in each case appear originally to have formed parts of one continuous mass the basaltic strata of which they are composed from their compact and crystalline structure seem when contrasted with the neighbouring basaltic streams of subaerial formation to have flowed beneath the pressure of the sea and to have been subsequently elevated we may suppose that the wide breaches between the mountains were in both cases worn by the waves during their gradual elevationof which process within recent times there is abundant evidence on the coastland of both islands at both vast streams of more recent basaltic lavas have flowed from the interior of the island round and between the ancient basaltic hills at both moreover recent cones of eruption are scattered around the circumference of the island but at neither have eruptions taken place within the period of history as remarked in the last chapter it is probable that these ancient basaltic mountains which resemble at least in many respects the basal and disturbed remnants of two gigantic volcanoes owe their present form structure and position to the action of similar causes  st pauls rocks  this small island is situated in the atlantic ocean nearly one degree north of the equator and 540 miles distant from south america in 29 degrees 15 minutes west longitude its highest point is scarcely fifty feet above the level of the sea its outline is irregular and its entire circumference barely threequarters of a mile this little point of rock rises abruptly out of the ocean and except on its western side soundings were not obtained even at the short distance of a quarter of a mile from its shore it is not of volcanic origin and this circumstance which is the most remarkable point in its history as will hereafter be referred to properly ought to exclude it from the present volume it is composed of rocks unlike any which i have met with and which i cannot characterise by any name and must therefore describe  the simplest and one of the most abundant kinds is a very compact heavy greenishblack rock having an angular irregular fracture with some points just hard enough to scratch glass and infusible this variety passes into others of paler green tints less hard but with a more crystalline fracture and translucent on their edges and these are fusible into a green enamel several other varieties are chiefly characterised by containing innumerable threads of darkgreen serpentine and by having calcareous matter in their interstices these rocks have an obscure concretionary structure and are full of variously coloured angular pseudo fragments these angular pseudo fragments consist of the firstdescribed dark green rock of a brown softer kind of serpentine and of a yellowish harsh stone which perhaps is related to serpentine rock there are other vesicular calcareoferruginous soft stones there is no distinct stratification but parts are imperfectly laminated and the whole abounds with innumerable veins and veinlike masses both small and large of these veinlike masses some calcareous ones which contain minute fragments of shells are clearly of subsequent origin to the others  a glossy incrustation  extensive portions of these rocks are coated by a layer of a glossy polished substance with a pearly lustre and of a greyish white colour it follows all the inequalities of the surface to which it is firmly attached when examined with a lens it is found to consist of numerous exceedingly thin layers their aggregate thickness being about the tenth of an inch it is considerably harder than calcareous spar but can be scratched with a knife under the blowpipe it scales off decrepitates slightly blackens emits a fetid odour and becomes strongly alkaline it does not effervesce in acids in my journal i have described this substance i then believed that it was an impure phosphate of lime i presume this substance has been deposited by water draining from the birds dung with which the rocks are covered at ascension near a cavity in the rocks which was filled with a laminated mass of infiltrated birds dung i found some irregularly formed stalactitical masses of apparently the same nature these masses when broken had an earthy texture but on their outsides and especially at their extremities they were formed of a pearly substance generally in little globules like the enamel of teeth but more translucent and so hard as just to scratch plateglass this substance slightly blackens under the blowpipe emits a bad smell then becomes quite white swelling a little and fuses into a dull white enamel it does not become alkaline nor does it effervesce in acids the whole mass had a collapsed appearance as if in the formation of the hard glossy crust the whole had shrunk much at the abrolhos islands on the coast of brazil where also there is much birds dung i found a great quantity of a brown arborescent substance adhering to some traprock in its arborescent form this substance singularly resembles some of the branched species of nullipora under the blowpipe it behaves like the specimens from ascension but it is less hard and glossy and the surface has not the shrunk appearance   chapter iiiascension  basaltic lavas numerous craters truncated on the same side singular structure of volcanic

ocean in latitude 8 degrees s longitude 14 degrees w it has the form of an irregular triangle see map 2 each side being about six miles in length its highest point is 2870 feet geographical journal volume 5 page 243 above the level of the sea the whole is volcanic and from the absence of proofs to the contrary i believe of subaerial origin the fundamental rock is everywhere of a pale colour generally compact and of a feldspathic nature in the se portion of the island where the highest land is situated well characterised trachyte and other congenerous rocks of that varying family occur nearly the entire circumference is covered up by black and rugged streams of basaltic lava with here and there a hill or single point of rock one of which near the seacoast north of the fort is only two or three yards across of the trachyte still remaining exposed  basaltic rocks  the overlying basaltic lava is in some parts extremely vesicular in others little so it is of a black colour but sometimes contains crystals of glassy feldspar and seldom much olivine these streams appear to have possessed singularly little fluidity their side walls and lower ends being very steep and even as much as between twenty and thirty feet in height their surface is extraordinarily rugged and from a short distance appears as if studded with small craters these projections consist of broad irregularly conical hillocks traversed by fissures and composed of the same unequally scoriaceous basalt with the surrounding streams but having an obscure tendency to a columnar structure they rise to a height between ten and thirty feet above the general surface and have been formed as i presume by the heaping up of the viscid lava at points of greater resistance at the base of several of these hillocks and occasionally likewise on more level parts solid ribs composed of anguloglobular masses of basalt resembling in size and outline arched sewers or gutters of brickwork but not being hollow project between two or three feet above the surface of the streams what their origin may have been i do not know many of the superficial fragments from these basaltic streams present singularly convoluted forms and some specimens could hardly be distinguished from logs of darkcoloured wood without their bark  many of the basaltic streams can be traced either to points of eruption at the base of the great central mass of trachyte or to separate conical redcoloured hills which are scattered over the northern and western borders of the island standing on the central eminence i counted between twenty and thirty of these cones of eruption the greater number of them had their truncated summits cut off obliquely and they all sloped towards the se whence the tradewind blows m lesson in the zoology of the voyage of the coquille page 490 has observed this fact mr hennah geolog proceedings 1835 page 189 further remarks that the most extensive beds of ashes at ascension invariably occur on the leeward side of the island this structure no doubt has been caused by the ejected fragments and ashes being always blown during eruptions in greater quantity towards one side than towards the other m moreau de jonnes has made a similar observation with respect to the volcanic orifices in the west indian islands  volcanic bombs  figure 3 fragment of a spherical volcanic bomb with the interior parts coarsely cellular coated by a concentric layer of compact lava and this again by a crust of finely cellular rock  figure 4 volcanic bomb of obsidian from australia the upper figure gives a front view the lower a side view of the same object  these occur in great numbers strewed on the ground and some of them lie at considerable distances from any points of eruption they vary in size from that of an apple to that of a mans body they are either spherical or pearshaped or with the hinder part corresponding to the tail of a comet irregular studded with projecting points and even concave their surfaces are rough and fissured with branching cracks their internal structure is either irregularly scoriaceous and compact or it presents a symmetrical and very curious appearance an irregular segment of a bomb of this latter kind of which i found several is accurately represented in figure 3 its size was about that of a mans head the whole interior is coarsely cellular the cells averaging in diameter about the tenth of an inch but nearer the outside they gradually decrease in size this part is succeeded by a welldefined shell of compact lava having a nearly uniform thickness of about the third of an inch and the shell is overlaid by a somewhat thicker coating of finely cellular lava the cells varying from the fiftieth to the hundredth of an inch in diameter which forms the external surface the line separating the shell of compact lava from the outer scoriaceous crust is distinctly defined this structure is very simply explained if we suppose a mass of viscid scoriaceous matter to be projected with a rapid rotatory motion through the air for whilst the external crust from cooling became solidified in the state we now see it the centrifugal force by relieving the pressure in the interior parts of the bomb would allow the heated vapours to expand their cells but these being driven by the same force against the alreadyhardened crust would become the nearer they were to this part smaller and smaller or less expanded until they became packed into a solid concentric shell as we know that chips from a grindstone nichol architecture of the heavens can be flirted off when made to revolve with sufficient velocity we need not doubt that the centrifugal force would have power to modify the structure of a softened bomb in the manner here supposed geologists have remarked that the external form of a bomb at once bespeaks the history of its aerial course and few now see that the internal structure can speak with almost equal plainness of its rotatory movement  m bory st vincent voyage aux quatre isles dafrique tome 1 page 222 has described some balls of lava from the isle of bourbon which have a closely similar structure his explanation however if i understand it rightly is very different from that which i have given for he supposes that they have rolled like snowballs down the sides of the crater m beudant voyage en hongrie tome 2 page 214 also has described some singular little balls of obsidian never more than six or eight inches in diameter which he found strewed on the surface of the ground their form is always oval sometimes they are much swollen in the middle and even spindleshaped their surface is regularly marked with concentric ridges and furrows all of which on the same ball are at right angles to one axis their interior is compact and glassy m beudant supposes that masses of lava when soft were shot into the air with a rotatory movement round the same axis and that the form and superficial ridges of the bombs were thus produced sir thomas mitchell has given me what at first appears to be the half of a much flattened oval ball of obsidian it has a singular artificiallike appearance which is well represented of the natural size in figure 4 it was found in its present state on a great sandy plain between the rivers darling and murray in australia and at the distance of several hundred miles from any known volcanic region it seems to have been embedded in some reddish tufaceous matter and may have been transported either by the aborigines or by natural means the external saucer consists of compact obsidian of a bottlegreen colour and is filled with finely cellular black lava much less transparent and glassy than the obsidian the external surface is marked with four or five not quite perfect ridges which are represented rather too distinctly in figure 4 here then we have the external structure described by m beudant and the internal cellular condition of the bombs from ascension the lip of the saucer is slightly concave exactly like the margin of a soupplate and its inner edge overlaps a little the central cellular lava this structure is so symmetrical round the entire circumference that one is forced to suppose that the bomb burst during its rotatory course before being quite solidified and that the lip and edges were thus slightly modified and turned inwards it may be remarked that the superficial ridges are in planes at right angles to an axis transverse to the longer axis of the flattened oval to explain this circumstance we may suppose that when the bomb burst the axis of rotation changed  aeriform explosions  the flanks of green mountain and the surrounding country are covered by a great mass some hundred feet in thickness of loose fragments the lower beds generally consist of finegrained slightly consolidated tuffs some of this peperino or tuff is sufficiently hard not to be broken by the greatest force of the fingers and the upper beds of great loose fragments with alternating finer beds on the northern side of the green mountain a thin seam about an inch in thickness of compact oxide of iron extends over a considerable area it lies conformably in the lower part of the stratified mass of ashes and fragments this substance is of a reddish brown colour with an almost metallic lustre it is not magnetic but becomes so after having been heated under the blowpipe by which it is blackened and partly fused this seam of compact stone by intercepting the little rainwater which falls on the island gives rise to a small dripping spring first discovered by dampier it is the only fresh water on the island so that the possibility of its being inhabited has entirely depended on the occurrence of this ferruginous layer one white ribbon like layer of decomposed pumiceous breccia was curiously bent into deep unbroken curves beneath each of the large fragments in the superincumbent stratum from the relative position of these beds i presume that a narrow mouthed crater standing nearly in the position of green mountain like a great airgun shot forth before its final extinction this vast accumulation of loose matter subsequently to this event considerable dislocations have taken place and an oval circus has been formed by subsidence this sunken space lies at the northeastern foot of green mountain and is well represented in map 2 its longer axis which is connected with a ne and sw line of fissure is threefifths of a nautical mile in length its sides are nearly perpendicular except in one spot and about four hundred feet in height they consist in the lower part of a pale basalt with feldspar and in the upper part of the tuff and loose ejected fragments the bottom is smooth and level and under almost any other climate a deep lake would have been formed here from the thickness of the bed of loose fragments with which the surrounding country is covered the amount of aeriform matter necessary for their projection must have been enormous hence we may suppose it probable that after the explosions vast subterranean caverns were left and that the falling in of the roof of one of these produced the hollow here described at the galapagos archipelago pits of a similar character but of a much smaller size frequently occur at the bases of small cones of eruption  ejected granitic fragments  in the neighbourhood of green mountain fragments of extraneous rock are not unfrequently found embedded in the midst of masses of scoriae lieutenant evans to whose kindness i am indebted for much information gave me several specimens and i found others myself they nearly all have a granitic structure are brittle harsh to the touch and apparently of altered colours  first a white syenite streaked and mottled with red it consists of well crystallised feldspar numerous grains of quartz and brilliant though small crystals of hornblende the feldspar and hornblende in this and the succeeding cases have been determined by the reflecting goniometer and the quartz by its action under the blowpipe the feldspar in these ejected fragments like the glassy kind in the trachyte is from its cleavage a potashfeldspar  secondly a brickred mass of feldspar quartz and small dark patches of a decayed mineral one minute particle of which i was able to ascertain by its cleavage to be hornblende  thirdly a mass of confusedly crystallised white feldspar with little nests of a darkcoloured mineral often carious externally rounded having a glossy fracture but no distinct cleavage from comparison with the second specimen i have no doubt that it is fused hornblende  fourthly a rock which at first appears a simple aggregation of distinct and largesized crystals of dustycoloured labrador feldspar professor miller has been so kind as to examine this mineral he obtained two good cleavages of 86 degrees 30 minutes and 86 degrees 50 minutes the mean of several which i made was 86 degrees 30 minutes professor miller states that these crystals when reduced to a fine powder are soluble in hydrochloric acid leaving some undissolved silex behind the addition of oxalate of ammonia gives a copious precipitate of lime he further remarks that according to von kobell anorthite a mineral occurring in the ejected fragments at mount somma is always white and transparent so that if this be the case these crystals from ascension must be considered as labrador feldspar professor miller adds that he has seen an account in erdmanns journal fur tecnische chemie of a mineral ejected from a volcano which had the external characters of labrador feldspar but differed in the analysis from that given by mineralogists of this mineral the author attributed this difference to an error in the analysis of labrador feldspar which is very old but in their interstices there is some white granular feldspar abundant scales of mica a little altered hornblende and as i believe no quartz i have described these fragments in detail because it is rare to find granitic rocks ejected from volcanoes with their minerals unchanged as is the case with the first specimen and partially with the second daubeny in his work on volcanoes page 386 remarks that this is the case and humboldt in his personal narrative volume 1 page 236 says in general the masses of known primitive rocks i mean those which perfectly resemble our granites gneiss and micaslate are very rare in lavas the substances we generally denote by the name of granite thrown out by vesuvius are mixtures of nepheline mica and pyroxene one other large fragment found in another spot is deserving of notice it is a conglomerate containing small fragments of granitic cellular and jaspery rocks and of hornstone porphyries embedded in a base of wacke threaded by numerous thin layers of a concretionary pitchstone passing into obsidian these layers are parallel slightly tortuous and short they thin out at their ends and resemble in form the layers of quartz in gneiss it is probable that these small embedded fragments were not separately ejected but were entangled in a fluid volcanic rock allied to obsidian and we shall presently see that several varieties of this latter series of rock assume a laminated structure  trachytic series of rocks   those occupy the more elevated and central and likewise the southeastern parts of the island the trachyte is generally of a pale brown colour stained with small darker patches it contains broken and bent crystals of glassy feldspar grains of specular iron and black microscopical points which latter from being easily fused and then becoming magnetic i presume are hornblende the greater number of the hills however are composed of a quite white friable stone appearing like a trachytic tuff obsidian hornstone and several kinds of laminated feldspathic rocks are associated with the trachyte there is no distinct stratification nor could i distinguish a crateriform structure in any of the hills of this series considerable dislocations have taken place and many fissures in these rocks are yet left open or are only partially filled with loose fragments within the space this space is nearly included by a line sweeping round green mountain and joining the hills called the weather port signal holyhead and that denominated improperly in a geological sense the crater of an old volcano mainly formed of trachyte some basaltic streams have burst forth and not far from the summit of green mountain there is one stream of quite black vesicular basalt containing minute crystals of glassy feldspar which have a rounded appearance  the soft white stone above mentioned is remarkable from its singular resemblance when viewed in mass to a sedimentary tuff it was long before i could persuade myself that such was not its origin and other geologists have been perplexed by closely similar formations in trachytic regions in two cases this white earthy stone formed isolated hills in a third it was associated with columnar and laminated trachyte but i was unable to trace an actual junction it contains numerous crystals of glassy feldspar and black microscopical specks and is marked with small darker patches exactly as in the surrounding trachyte its basis however when viewed under the microscope is generally quite earthy but sometimes it exhibits a decidedly crystalline structure on the hill marked crater of an old volcano it passes into a pale greenishgrey variety differing only in its colour and in not being so earthy the passage was in one case effected insensibly in another it was formed by numerous rounded and angular masses of the greenish variety being embedded in the white varietyin this latter case the appearance was very much like that of a sedimentary deposit torn up and abraded during the deposition of a subsequent stratum both these varieties are traversed by innumerable tortuous veins presently to be described which are totally unlike injected dikes or indeed any other veins which i have ever seen both varieties include a few scattered fragments large and small of dark coloured scoriaceous rocks the cells of some of which are partially filled with the white earthy stone they likewise include some huge blocks of a cellular porphyry the porphyry is dark coloured it contains numerous often fractured crystals of white opaque feldspar also decomposing crystals of oxide of iron its vesicles include masses of delicate hair like crystals apparently of analcime these fragments project from the weathered surface and perfectly resemble fragments embedded in a true sedimentary tuff but as it is known that extraneous fragments of cellular rock are sometimes included in columnar trachyte in phonolite daubuisson traite de geognosie tome 2 page 548 and in other compact lavas this circumstance is not any real argument for the sedimentary origin of the white earthy stone dr daubeny on volcanoes page 180 seems to have been led to believe that certain trachytic formations of ischia and of the puy de dome which closely resemble these of ascension were of sedimentary origin chiefly from the frequent presence in them of scoriform portions different in colour from the matrix dr daubeny adds that on the other hand brocchi and other eminent geologists have considered these beds as earthy varieties of trachyte he considers the subject deserving of further attention the insensible passage of the greenish variety into the white one and likewise the more abrupt passage by fragments of the former being embedded in the latter might result from slight differences in the composition of the same mass of molten stone and from the abrading action of one such part still fluid on another part already solidified the curiously formed veins have i believe been formed by siliceous matter being subsequently segregated but my chief reason for believing that these soft earthy stones with their extraneous fragments are not of sedimentary origin is the extreme improbability of crystals of feldspar black microscopical specks and small stains of a darker colour occurring in the same proportional numbers in an aqueous deposit and in masses of solid trachyte moreover as i have remarked the microscope occasionally reveals a crystalline structure in the apparently earthy basis on the other hand the partial decomposition of such great masses of trachyte forming whole mountains is undoubtedly a circumstance of not easy explanation  veins in the earthy trachytic masses  these veins are extraordinarily numerous intersecting in the most complicated manner both coloured varieties of the earthy trachyte they are best seen on the flanks of the crater of the old volcano they contain crystals of glassy feldspar black microscopical specks and little dark stains precisely as in the surrounding rock but the basis is very different being exceedingly hard compact somewhat brittle and of rather less easy fusibility the veins vary much and suddenly from the tenth of an inch to one inch in thickness they often thin out not only on their edges but in their central parts thus leaving round irregular apertures their surfaces are rugged they are inclined at every possible angle with the horizon or are horizontal they are generally curvilinear and often interbranch one with another from their hardness they withstand weathering and projecting two or three feet above the ground they occasionally extend some yards in length these platelike veins when struck emit a sound almost like that of a drum and they may be distinctly seen to vibrate their fragments which are strewed on the ground clatter like pieces of iron when knocked against each other they often assume the most singular forms i saw a pedestal of the earthy trachyte covered by a hemispherical portion of a vein like a great umbrella sufficiently large to shelter two persons i have never met with or seen described any veins like these but in form they resemble the ferruginous seams due to some process of segregation occurring not uncommonly in sandstonesfor instance in the new red sandstone of england numerous veins of jasper and of siliceous sinter occurring on the summit of this same hill show that there has been some abundant source of silica and as these platelike veins differ from the trachyte only in their greater hardness brittleness and less easy fusibility it appears probable that their origin is due to the segregation or infiltration of siliceous matter in the same manner as happens with the oxides of iron in many sedimentary rocks  siliceous sinter and jasper  the siliceous sinter is either quite white of little specific gravity and with a somewhat pearly fracture passing into pinkish pearl quartz or it is yellowish white with a harsh fracture and it then contains an earthy powder in small cavities both varieties occur either in large irregular masses in the altered trachyte or in seams included in broad vertical tortuous irregular veins of a compact harsh stone of a dull red colour appearing like a sandstone this stone however is only altered trachyte and a nearly similar variety but often honeycombed sometimes adheres to the projecting platelike veins described in the last paragraph the jasper is of an ochre yellow or red colour it occurs in large irregular masses and sometimes in veins both in the altered trachyte and in an associated mass of scoriaceous basalt the cells of the scoriaceous basalt are lined or filled with fine concentric layers of chalcedony coated and studded with brightred oxide of iron in this rock especially in the rather more compact parts irregular angular patches of the red jasper are included the edges of which insensibly blend into the surrounding mass other patches occur having an intermediate character between perfect jasper and the ferruginous decomposed basaltic base in these patches and likewise in the large veinlike masses of jasper there occur little rounded cavities of exactly the same size and form with the aircells which in the scoriaceous basalt are filled and lined with layers of chalcedony small fragments of the jasper examined under the microscope seem to resemble the chalcedony with its colouring matter not separated into layers but mingled in the siliceous paste together with some impurities i can understand these factsnamely the blending of the jasper into the semidecomposed basaltits occurrence in angular patches which clearly do not occupy preexisting hollows in the rockand its containing little vesicles filled with chalcedony like those in the scoriaceous lavaonly on the supposition that a fluid probably the same fluid which deposited the chalcedony in the aircells removed in those parts where there were no cavities the ingredients of the basaltic rock and left in their place silica and iron and thus produced the jasper in some specimens of silicified wood i have observed that in the same manner as in the basalt the solid parts were converted into a darkcoloured homogeneous stone whereas the cavities formed by the larger sapvessels which may be compared with the airvesicles in the basaltic lava and other irregular hollows apparently produced by decay were filled with concentric layers of chalcedony in this case there can be little doubt that the same fluid deposited the homogeneous base and the chalcedonic layers after these considerations i cannot doubt but that the jasper of ascension may be viewed as a volcanic rock silicified in precisely the same sense as this term is applied to wood when silicified we are equally ignorant of the means by which every atom of wood whilst in a perfect state is removed and replaced by atoms of silica as we are of the means by which the constituent parts of a volcanic rock could be thus acted on beudant voyage en hongrie tome 3 pages 502 504 describes kidneyshaped masses of jasperopal which either blend into the surrounding trachytic conglomerate or are embedded in it like chalkflints and he compares them with the fragments of opalised wood which are abundant in this same formation beudant however appears to have viewed the process of their formation rather as one of simple infiltration than of molecular exchange but the presence of a concretion wholly different from the surrounding matter if not formed in a preexisting hollow clearly seems to me to require either a molecular or mechanical displacement of the atoms which occupied the space afterwards filled by it the jasperopal of hungary passes into chalcedony and therefore in this case as in that of ascension jasper seems to be intimately related in origin with chalcedony i was led to the careful examination of these rocks and to the conclusion here given from having heard the rev professor henslow express a similar opinion regarding the origin in traprocks of many chalcedonies and agates siliceous deposits seem to be very general if not of universal occurrence in partially decomposed trachytic tuffs beudant voyage min tome 3 page 507 enumerates cases in hungary germany central france italy greece and mexico and as these hills according to the view above given consist of trachyte softened and altered in situ the presence of free silica in this case may be added as one more instance to the list  concretions in pumiceous tuff  the hill marked in map 2 crater of an old volcano has no claims to this appellation which i could discover except in being surmounted by a circular very shallow saucerlike summit nearly half a mile in diameter this hollow has been nearly filled up with many successive sheets of ashes and scoriae of different colours and slightly consolidated each successive saucershaped layer crops out all round the margin forming so many rings of various colours and giving to the hill a fantastic appearance the outer ring is broad and of a white colour hence it resembles a course round which horses have been exercised and has received the name of the devils riding school by which it is most generally known these successive layers of ashes must have fallen over the whole surrounding country but they have all been blown away except in this one hollow in which probably moisture accumulated either during an extraordinary year when rain fell or during the storms often accompanying volcanic eruptions one of the layers of a pinkish colour and chiefly derived from small decomposed fragments of pumice is remarkable from containing numerous concretions these are generally spherical from half an inch to three inches in diameter but they are occasionally cylindrical like those of ironpyrites in the chalk of europe they consist of a very tough compact palebrown stone with a smooth and even fracture they are divided into concentric layers by thin white partitions resembling the external superficies six or eight of such layers are distinctly defined near the outside but those towards the inside generally become indistinct and blend into a homogeneous mass i presume that these concentric layers were formed by the shrinking of the concretion as it became compact the interior part is generally fissured by minute cracks or septaria which are lined both by black metallic and by other white and crystalline specks the nature of which i was unable to ascertain some of the larger concretions consist of a mere spherical shell filled with slightly consolidated ashes the concretions contain a small proportion of carbonate of lime a fragment placed under the blowpipe decrepitates then whitens and fuses into a blebby enamel but does not become caustic the surrounding ashes do not contain any carbonate of lime hence the concretions have probably been formed as is so often the case by the aggregation of this substance i have not met with any account of similar concretions and considering their great toughness and compactness their occurrence in a bed which probably has been subjected only to atmospheric moisture is remarkable  formation of calcareous rocks on the seacoast  on several of the seabeaches there are immense accumulations of small wellrounded particles of shells and corals of white yellowish and pink colours interspersed with a few volcanic particles at the depth of a few feet these are found cemented together into stone of which the softer varieties are used for building there are other varieties both coarse and finegrained too hard for this purpose and i saw one mass divided into even layers half an inch in thickness which were so compact that when struck with a hammer they rang like flint it is believed by the inhabitants that the particles become united in the course of a single year the union is effected by calcareous matter and in the most compact varieties each rounded particle of shell and volcanic rock can be distinctly seen to be enveloped in a husk of pellucid carbonate of lime extremely few perfect shells are embedded in these agglutinated masses and i have examined even a large fragment under a microscope without being able to discover the least vestige of striae or other marks of external form this shows how long each particle must have been rolled about before its turn came to be embedded and cemented the eggs of the turtle being buried by the parent sometimes become enclosed in the solid rock mr lyell has given a figure principles of geology book 3 chapter 17 of some eggs containing the bones of young turtles found thus entombed one of the most compact varieties when placed in acid was entirely dissolved with the exception of some flocculent animal matter its specific gravity was 263 the specific gravity of ordinary limestone varies from 26 to 275 pure carrara marble was found by sir h de la beche to be 27 researches in theoretical geology page 12 it is remarkable that these rocks of ascension formed close to the surface should be nearly as compact as marble which has undergone the action of heat and pressure in the plutonic regions  the great accumulation of loose calcareous particles lying on the beach near the settlement commences in the month of october moving towards the sw which as i was informed by lieutenant evans is caused by a change in the prevailing direction of the currents at this period the tidal rocks at the sw end of the beach where the calcareous sand is accumulating and round which the currents sweep become gradually coated with a calcareous incrustation half an inch in thickness it is quite white compact with some parts slightly spathose and is firmly attached to the rock after a short time it gradually disappears being either redissolved when the water is less charged with lime or more probably is mechanically abraded lieutenant evans has observed these facts during the six years he has resided at ascension the incrustation varies in thickness in different years in 1831 it was unusually thick when i was there in july there was no remnant of the incrustation but on a point of basalt from which the quarrymen had lately removed a mass of the calcareous freestone the incrustation was perfectly preserved considering the position of the tidalrocks and the period at which they become coated there can be no doubt that the movement and disturbance of the vast accumulation of calcareous particles many of them being partially agglutinated together cause the waves of the sea to be so highly charged with carbonate of lime that they deposit it on the first objects against which they impinge i have been informed by lieutenant holland rn that this incrustation is formed on many parts of the coast on most of which i believe there are likewise great masses of comminuted shells  a frondescent calcareous incrustation  figure 5 an incrustation of calcareous and animal matter coating the tidalrocks at ascension  in many respects this is a singular deposit it coats throughout the year the tidal volcanic rocks that project from the beaches composed of broken shells its general appearance is well represented in figure 5 but the fronds or discs of which it is composed are generally so closely crowded together as to touch these fronds have their sinuous edges finely crenulated and they project over their pedestals or supports their upper surfaces are either slightly concave or slightly convex they are highly polished and of a dark grey or jet black colour their form is irregular generally circular and from the tenth of an inch to one inch and a half in diameter their thickness or amount of their projection from the rock on which they stand varies much about a quarter of an inch being perhaps most usual the fronds occasionally become more and more convex until they pass into botryoidal masses with their summits fissured when in this state they are glossy and of an intense black so as to resemble some fused metallic substance i have shown the incrustation both in this latter and in its ordinary state to several geologists but not one could conjecture its origin except that perhaps it was of volcanic nature  the substance forming the fronds has a very compact and often almost crystalline fracture the edges being translucent and hard enough easily to scratch calcareous spar under the blowpipe it immediately becomes white and emits a strong animal odour like that from fresh shells it is chiefly composed of carbonate of lime when placed in muriatic acid it froths much leaving a residue of sulphate of lime and of an oxide of iron together with a black powder which is not soluble in heated acids this latter substance seems to be carbonaceous and is evidently the colouring matter the sulphate of lime is extraneous and occurs in distinct excessively minute lamellar plates studded on the surface of the fronds and embedded between the fine layers of which they are composed when a fragment is heated in the blowpipe these lamellae are immediately rendered visible the original outline of the fronds may often be traced either to a minute particle of shell fixed in a crevice of the rock or to several cemented together these first become deeply corroded by the dissolving power of the waves into sharp ridges and then are coated with successive layers of the glossy grey calcareous incrustation the inequalities of the primary support affect the outline of every successive layer in the same manner as may often be seen in bezoarstones when an object like a nail forms the centre of aggregation the crenulated edges however of the frond appear to be due to the corroding power of the surf on its own deposit alternating with fresh depositions on some smooth basaltic rocks on the coast of st jago i found an exceedingly thin layer of brown calcareous matter which under a lens presented a miniature likeness of the crenulated and polished fronds of ascension in this case a basis was not afforded by any projecting extraneous particles although the incrustation at ascension is persistent throughout the year yet from the abraded appearance of some parts and from the fresh appearance of other parts the whole seems to undergo a round of decay and renovation due probably to changes in the form of the shifting beach and consequently in the action of the breakers hence probably it is that the incrustation never acquires a great thickness considering the position of the encrusted rocks in the midst of the calcareous beach together with its composition i think there can be no doubt that its origin is due to the dissolution and subsequent deposition of the matter composing the rounded particles of shells and corals the selenite as i have remarked is extraneous and must have been derived from the seawater it is an interesting circumstance thus to find the waves of the ocean sufficiently charged with sulphate of lime to deposit it on the rocks against which they dash every tide dr webster has described voyage of the chanticleer volume 2 page 319 beds of gypsum and salt as much as two feet in thickness left by the evaporation of the spray on the rocks on the windward coast beautiful stalactites of selenite resembling in form those of carbonate of lime are formed near these beds amorphous masses of gypsum also occur in caverns in the interior of the island and at cross hill an old crater i saw a considerable quantity of salt oozing from a pile of scoriae in these latter cases the salt and gypsum appear to be volcanic products from this source it derives its animal matter which is evidently the colouring principle the nature of the deposit in its incipient stage can often be well seen upon a fragment of white shell when jammed between two of the fronds it then appears exactly like the thinnest wash of a pale grey varnish its darkness varies a little but the jet blackness of some of the fronds and of the botryoidal masses seems due to the translucency of the successive grey layers there is however this singular circumstance that when deposited on the under side of ledges of rock or in fissures it appears always to be of a pale pearly grey colour even when of considerable thickness hence one is led to suppose that an abundance of light is necessary to the development of the dark colour in the same manner as seems to be the case with the upper and exposed surfaces of the shells of living mollusca which are always dark compared with their under surfaces and with the parts habitually covered by the mantle of the animal in this circumstancein the immediate loss of colour and in the odour emitted under the blowpipein the degree of hardness and translucency of the edgesand in the beautiful polish of the surface from the fact described in my journal of researches of a coating of oxide of iron deposited by a streamlet on the rocks in its bed like a nearly similar coating at the great cataracts of the orinoco and nile becoming finely polished where the surf acts i presume that the surf in this instance also is the polishing agent rivalling when in a fresh state that of the finest oliva there is a striking analogy between this inorganic incrustation and the shells of living molluscous animals in the section descriptive of st pauls rocks i have described a glossy pearly substance which coats the rocks and an allied stalactitical incrustation from ascension the crust of which resembles the enamel of teeth but is hard enough to scratch plateglass both these substances contain animal matter and seem to have been derived from water in filtering through birds dung this appears to me to be an interesting physiological fact mr horner and sir david brewster have described philosophical transactions 1836 page 65 a singular artificial substance resembling shell it is deposited in fine transparent highly polished brown coloured laminae possessing peculiar optical properties on the inside of a vessel in which cloth first prepared with glue and then with lime is made to revolve rapidly in water it is much softer more transparent and contains more animal matter than the natural incrustation at ascension but we here again see the strong tendency which carbonate of lime and animal matter evince to form a solid substance allied to shell  singular laminated beds alternating with and passing into obsidian  these beds occur within the trachytic district at the western base of green mountain under which they dip at a high inclination they are only partially exposed being covered up by modern ejections from this cause i was unable to trace their junction with the trachyte or to discover whether they had flowed as a stream of lava or had been injected amidst the overlying strata there are three principal beds of obsidian of which the thickest forms the base of the section the alternating stony layers appear to me eminently curious and shall be first described and afterwards their passage into the obsidian they have an extremely diversified appearance five principal varieties may be noticed but these insensibly blend into each other by endless gradations  first  a pale grey irregularly and coarsely laminated this term is open to some misinterpretation as it may be applied both to rocks divided into laminae of exactly the same composition and to layers firmly attached to each other with no fissile tendency but composed of different minerals or of different shades of colour the term laminated in this chapter is applied in these latter senses where a homogeneous rock splits as in the former sense in a given direction like clayslate i have used the term fissile harshfeeling rock resembling clayslate which has been in contact with a trapdike and with a fracture of about the same degree of crystalline structure this rock as well as the following varieties easily fuses into a pale glass the greater part is honeycombed with irregular angular cavities so that the whole has a curious appearance and some fragments resemble in a remarkable manner silicified logs of decayed wood this variety especially where more compact is often marked with thin whitish streaks which are either straight or wrap round one behind the other the elongated carious hollows  secondly  a bluish grey or pale brown compact heavy homogeneous stone with an angular uneven earthy fracture viewed however under a lens of high power the fracture is seen to be distinctly crystalline and even separate minerals can be distinguished  thirdly  a stone of the same kind with the last but streaked with numerous parallel slightly tortuous white lines of the thickness of hairs these white lines are more crystalline than the parts between them and the stone splits along them they frequently expand into exceedingly thin cavities which are often only just perceptible with a lens the matter forming the white lines becomes better crystallised in these cavities and professor miller was fortunate enough after several trials to ascertain that the white crystals which are the largest were of quartz professor miller informs me that the crystals which he measured had the faces p z m of the figure 147 given by haidinger in his translation of mohs and he adds that it is remarkable that none of them had the slightest trace of faces r of the regular sixsided prism and that the minute green transparent needles were augite or as they would more generally be called diopside besides these crystals there are some minute dark specks without a trace of crystalline and some fine white granular crystalline matter which is probably feldspar minute fragments of this rock are easily fusible   fourthly  a compact crystalline rock banded in straight lines with innumerable layers of white and grey shades of colour varying in width from the thirtieth to the twohundredth of an inch these layers seem to be composed chiefly of feldspar and they contain numerous perfect crystals of glassy feldspar which are placed lengthways they are also thickly studded with microscopically minute amorphous black specks which are placed in rows either standing separately or more frequently united two or three or several together into black lines thinner than a hair when a small fragment is heated in the blowpipe the black specks are easily fused into black brilliant beads which become magneticcharacters that apply to no common mineral except hornblende or augite with the black specks there are mingled some others of a red colour which are magnetic before being heated and no doubt are oxide of iron round two little cavities in a specimen of this variety i found the black specks aggregated into minute crystals appearing like those of augite or hornblende but too dull and small to be measured by the goniometer in the specimen also i could distinguish amidst the crystalline feldspar grains which had the aspect of quartz by trying with a parallel ruler i found that the thin grey layers and the black hairlike lines were absolutely straight and parallel to each other it is impossible to trace the gradation from the homogeneous grey rocks to these striped varieties or indeed the character of the different layers in the same specimen without feeling convinced that the more or less perfect whiteness of the crystalline feldspathic matter depends on the more or less perfect aggregation of diffused matter into the black and red specks of hornblende and oxide of iron  fifthly  a compact heavy rock not laminated with an irregular angular highly crystalline fracture it abounds with distinct crystals of glassy feldspar and the crystalline feldspathic base is mottled with a black mineral which on the weathered surface is seen to be aggregated into small crystals some perfect but the greater number imperfect i showed this specimen to an experienced geologist and asked him what it was he answered as i think every one else would have done that it was a primitive greenstone the weathered surface also of the banded variety in figure 4 strikingly resembles a worn fragment of finely laminated gneiss  these five varieties with many intermediate ones pass and repass into each other as the compact varieties are quite subordinate to the others the whole may be considered as laminated or striped the laminae to sum up their characteristics are either quite straight or slightly tortuous or convoluted they are all parallel to each other and to the intercalating strata of obsidian they are generally of extreme thinness they consist either of an apparently homogeneous compact rock striped with different shades of grey and brown colours or of crystalline feldspathic layers in a more or less perfect state of purity and of different thicknesses with distinct crystals of glassy feldspar placed lengthways or of very thin layers chiefly composed of minute crystals of quartz and augite or composed of black and red specks of an augitic mineral and of an oxide of iron either not crystallised or imperfectly so after having fully described the obsidian i shall return to the subject of the lamination of rocks of the trachytic series  the passage of the foregoing beds into the strata of glassy obsidian is effected in several ways first angulomodular masses of obsidian both large and small abruptly appear disseminated in a slaty or in an amorphous palecoloured feldspathic rock with a somewhat pearly fracture secondly small irregular nodules of the obsidian either standing separately or united into thin layers seldom more than the tenth of an inch in thickness alternate repeatedly with very thin layers of a feldspathic rock which is striped with the finest parallel zones of colour like an agate and which sometimes passes into the nature of pitchstone the interstices between the nodules of obsidian are generally filled by soft white matter resembling pumiceous ashes thirdly the whole substance of the bounding rock suddenly passes into an anguloconcretionary mass of obsidian such masses as well as the small nodules of obsidian are of a pale green colour and are generally streaked with different shades of colour parallel to the laminae of the surrounding rock they likewise generally contain minute white sphaerulites of which half is sometimes embedded in a zone of one shade of colour and half in a zone of another shade the obsidian assumes its jet black colour and perfectly conchoidal fracture only when in large masses but even in these on careful examination and on holding the specimens in different lights i could generally distinguish parallel streaks of different shades of darkness  figure 6 opaque brown sphaerulites drawn on an enlarged scale the upper ones are externally marked with parallel ridges the internal radiating structure of the lower ones is much too plainly represented  figure 7 a layer formed by the union of minute brown sphaerulites intersecting two other similar layers the whole represented of nearly the natural size  one of the commonest transitional rocks deserves in several respects a further description it is of a very complicated nature and consists of numerous thin slightly tortuous layers of a palecoloured feldspathic stone often passing into an imperfect pitchstone alternating with layers formed of numberless little globules of two varieties of obsidian and of two kinds of sphaerulites embedded in a soft or in a hard pearly base the sphaerulites are either white and translucent or dark brown and opaque the former are quite spherical of small size and distinctly radiated from their centre the dark brown sphaerulites are less perfectly round and vary in diameter from the twentieth to the thirtieth of an inch when broken they exhibit towards their centres which are whitish an obscure radiating structure two of them when united sometimes have only one central point of radiation there is occasionally a trace of or a hollow crevice in their centres they stand either separately or are united two or three or many together into irregular groups or more commonly into layers parallel to the stratification of the mass this union in many cases is so perfect that the two sides of the layer thus formed are quite even and these layers as they become less brown and opaque cannot be distinguished from the alternating layers of the palecoloured feldspathic stone the sphaerulites when not united are generally compressed in the plane of the lamination of the mass and in this same plane they are often marked internally by zones of different shades of colour and externally by small ridges and furrows in the upper part of figure 6 the sphaerulites with the parallel ridges and furrows are represented on an enlarged scale but they are not well executed and in the lower part their usual manner of grouping is shown in another specimen a thin layer formed of the brown sphaerulites closely united together intersects as represented in figure 7 a layer of similar composition and after running for a short space in a slightly curved line again intersects it and likewise a second layer lying a little way beneath that first intersected the small nodules also of obsidian are sometimes externally marked with ridges and furrows parallel to the lamination of the mass but always less plainly than the sphaerulites these obsidian nodules are generally angular with their edges blunted they are often impressed with the form of the adjoining sphaerulites than which they are always larger the separate nodules seldom appear to have drawn each other out by exerting a mutually attractive force had i not found in some cases a distinct centre of attraction in these nodules of obsidian i should have been led to have considered them as residuary matter left during the formation of the pearlstone in which they are embedded and of the sphaerulitic globules  the sphaerulites and the little nodules of obsidian in these rocks so closely resemble in general form and structure concretions in sedimentary deposits that one is at once tempted to attribute to them an analogous origin they resemble ordinary concretions in the following respects in their external formin the union of two or three or of several into an irregular mass or into an evensided layerin the occasional intersection of one such layer by another as in the case of chalkflints in the presence of two or three kinds of nodules often close together in the same basisin their fibrous radiating structure with occasional hollows in their centresin the coexistence of a laminary concretionary and radiating structure as is so well developed in the concretions of magnesian limestone described by professor sedgwick geological transactions volume 3 part 1 page 37 concretions in sedimentary deposits it is known are due to the separation from the surrounding mass of the whole or part of some mineral substance and its aggregation round certain points of attraction guided by this fact i have endeavoured to discover whether obsidian and the sphaerulites to which may be added marekanite and pearlstone both of them occurring in nodular concretions in the trachytic series differ in their constituent parts from the minerals generally composing trachytic rocks it appears from three analyses that obsidian contains on an average 76 per cent of silica from one analysis that sphaerulites contain 7912 from two that marekanite contains 7925 and from two other analyses that pearlstone contains 7562 of silica the foregoing analyses are taken from beudant traite de mineralogie tome 2 page 113 and one analysis of obsidian from phillips mineralogy now the constituent parts of trachyte as far as they can be distinguished consist of feldspar containing 6521 of silica or of albite containing 6909 of hornblende containing 5527 these analyses are taken from von kobell grundzuge der mineralogie 1838 and of oxide of iron so that the foregoing glassy concretionary substances all contain a larger proportion of silica than that occurring in ordinary feldspathic or trachytic rocks daubuisson traite de geogn tome 2 page 535 also has remarked on the large proportion of silica compared with alumina in six analyses of obsidian and pearlstone given in brongniarts mineralogy hence i conclude that the foregoing concretions have been formed by a process of aggregation strictly analogous to that which takes place in aqueous deposits acting chiefly on the silica but likewise on some of the other elements of the surrounding mass and thus producing the different concretionary varieties from the wellknown effects of rapid cooling this is seen in the manufacture of common glass and in gregory wattss experiments on molten trap also on the natural surfaces of lava streams and on the sidewalls of dikes in giving glassiness of texture it is probably necessary that the entire mass in cases like that of ascension should have cooled at a certain rate but considering the repeated and complicated alterations of nodules and thin layers of a glassy texture with other layers quite stony or crystalline all within the space of a few feet or even inches it is hardly possible that they could have cooled at different rates and thus have acquired their different textures  the natural sphaerulites in these rocks very closely resemble those produced in glass when slowly cooled i do not know whether it is generally known that bodies having exactly the same appearance as sphaerulites sometimes occur in agates mr robert brown showed me in an agate formed within a cavity in a piece of silicified wood some little specks which were only just visible to the naked eye these specks when placed by him under a lens of high power presented a beautiful appearance they were perfectly circular and consisted of the finest fibres of a brown colour radiating with great exactness from a common centre these little radiating stars are occasionally intersected and portions are quite cut off by the fine ribbonlike zones of colour in the agate in the obsidian of ascension the halves of a sphaerulite often lie in different zones of colour but they are not cut off by them as in the agate in some fine specimens of partially devitrified glass in the possession of mr stokes the sphaerulites are united into straight layers with even sides parallel to each other and to one of the outer surfaces exactly as in the obsidian these layers sometimes interbranch and form loops but i did not see any case of actual intersection they form the passage from the perfectly glassy portions to those nearly homogeneous and stony with only an obscure concretionary structure in the same specimen also sphaerulites differing slightly in colour and in structure occur embedded close together considering these facts it is some confirmation of the view above given of the concretionary origin of the obsidian and natural sphaerulites to find that m dartigues journal de physique tome 59 1804 pages 10 12 in his curious paper on this subject attributes the production of sphaerulites in glass to the different ingredients obeying their own laws of attraction and becoming aggregated he is led to believe that this takes place from the difficulty in remelting sphaerulitic glass without the whole be first thoroughly pounded and mixed together and likewise from the fact that the change takes place most readily in glass composed of many ingredients in confirmation of m dartigues view i may remark that m fleuriau de bellevue idem tome 60 1805 page 418 found that the sphaerulitic portions of devitrified glass were acted on both by nitric acid and under the blowpipe in a different manner from the compact paste in which they were embedded  comparison of the obsidian beds and alternating strata of ascension with those of other countries  i have been struck with much surprise how closely the excellent description of the obsidian rocks of hungary given by beudant voyage en hongrie tome 1 page 330 tome 2 pages 221 and 315 tome 3 pages 369 371 377 381 and that by humboldt of the same formation in mexico and peru essai geognostique pages 176 326 328 and likewise the descriptions given by several authors p scrope geological transactions volume 2 second series page 195 consult also dolomieu voyage aux isles lipari and daubuisson traite de geogn tome 2 page 534 of the trachytic regions in the italian islands agree with my observations at ascension many passages might have been transferred without alteration from the works of the above authors and would have been applicable to this island they all agree in the laminated and stratified character of the whole series and humboldt speaks of some of the beds of obsidian being ribboned like jasper in mr stokes fine collection of obsidians from mexico i observe that the sphaerulites are generally much larger than those of ascension they are generally white opaque and are united into distinct layers there are many singular varieties different from any at ascension the obsidians are finely zoned in quite straight or curved lines with exceedingly slight differences of tint of cellularity and of more or less perfect degrees of glassiness tracing some of the less perfectly glassy zones they are seen to become studded with minute white sphaerulites which become more and more numerous until at last they unite and form a distinct layer on the other hand at ascension only the brown sphaerulites unite and form layers the white ones always being irregularly disseminated some specimens at the geological society said to belong to an obsidian formation from mexico have an earthy fracture and are divided in the finest parallel laminae by specks of a black mineral like the augitic or hornblendic specks in the rocks at ascension they all agree in the nodular or concretionary character of the obsidian and of the passage of these nodules into layers they all refer to the repeated alterations often in undulatory planes of glassy pearly stony and crystalline layers the crystalline layers however seem to be much more perfectly developed at ascension than in the abovenamed countries humboldt compares some of the stony beds when viewed from a distance to strata of a schistose sandstone sphaerulites are described as occurring abundantly in all cases and they everywhere seem to mark the passage from the perfectly glassy to the stony and crystalline beds beudants account beudant voyage tome 3 page 373 of his perlite lithoide globulaire in every even the most trifling particular might have been written for the little brown sphaerulitic globules of the rocks of ascension  from the close similarity in so many respects between the obsidian formations of hungary mexico peru and of some of the italian islands with that of ascension i can hardly doubt that in all these cases the obsidian and the sphaerulites owe their origin to a concretionary aggregation of the silica and of some of the other constituent elements taking place whilst the liquified mass cooled at a certain required rate it is however wellknown that in several places obsidian has flowed in streams like lava for instance at teneriffe at the lipari islands and at iceland for teneriffe see von buch descript des isles canaries pages 184 and 190 for the lipari islands see dolomieu voyage page 34 for iceland see mackenzie travels page 369 in these cases the superficial parts are the most perfectly glassy the obsidian passing at the depth of a few feet into an opaque stone in an analysis by vauquelin of a specimen of obsidian from hecla which probably flowed as lava the proportion of silica is nearly the same as in the nodular or concretionary obsidian from mexico it would be interesting to ascertain whether the opaque interior portions and the superficial glassy coating contained the same proportional constituent parts we know from m dufrenoy memoires pour servir a une descript geolog de la france tome 4 page 371 that the exterior and interior parts of the same stream of lava sometimes differ considerably in their composition even should the whole body of the stream of obsidian turn out to be similarly composed with nodular obsidian it would only be necessary in accordance with the foregoing facts to suppose that lava in these instances had been erupted with its ingredients mixed in the same proportion as in the concretionary obsidian  lamination of volcanic rocks of the trachytic series  we have seen that in several and widely distant countries the strata alternating with beds of obsidian are highly laminated the nodules also both large and small of the obsidian are zoned with different shades of colour and i have seen a specimen from mexico in mr stokes collection with its external surface weathered macculloch states classification of rocks page 531 that the exposed surfaces of the pitchstone dikes in arran are furrowed with undulating lines resembling certain varieties of marbled paper and which evidently result from some corresponding difference of laminar structure into ridges and furrows corresponding with the zones of different degrees of glassiness humboldt personal narrative volume 1 page 222 moreover found on the peak of teneriffe a stream of obsidian divided by very thin alternating layers of pumice many other lavas of the feldspathic series are laminated thus masses of common trachyte at ascension are divided by fine earthy lines along which the rock splits separating thin layers of slightly different shades of colour the greater number also of the embedded crystals of glassy feldspar are placed lengthways in the same direction mr p scrope geological transactions volume 2 second series page 195 has described a remarkable columnar trachyte in the panza islands which seems to have been injected into an overlying mass of trachytic conglomerate it is striped with zones often of extreme tenuity of different textures and colours the harder and darker zones appearing to contain a larger proportion of silica in another part of the island there are layers of pearlstone and pitchstone which in many respects resemble those of ascension the zones in the columnar trachyte are generally contorted they extend uninterruptedly for a great length in a vertical direction and apparently parallel to the walls of the dikelike mass von buch description des iles canaries page 184 has described at teneriffe a stream of lava containing innumerable thin platelike crystals of feldspar which are arranged like white threads one behind the other and which mostly follow the same direction dolomieu voyage aux isles de lipari pages 35 and 85 also states that the grey lavas of the modern cone of vulcano which have a vitreous texture are streaked with parallel white lines he further describes a solid pumicestone which possesses a fissile structure like that of certain micaceous schists phonolite which i may observe is often if not always an injected rock also often has a fissile structure this is generally due to the parallel position of the embedded crystals of feldspar but sometimes as at fernando noronha seems to be nearly independent of their presence in this case and in that of the fissile pumicestone the structure is very different from that in the foregoing cases where the laminae consist of alternate layers of different composition or texture in some sedimentary formations however which apparently are homogeneous and fissile as in glossy clayslate there is reason to believe according to daubuisson that the laminae are really due to excessively thin alternating layers of mica from these facts we see that various rocks of the feldspathic series have either a laminated or fissile structure and that it occurs both in masses which have injected into overlying strata and in others which have flowed as streams of lava  the laminae of the beds alternating with the obsidian at ascension dip at a high angle under the mountain at the base of which they are situated and they do not appear as if they had been inclined by violence a high inclination is common to these beds in mexico peru and in some of the italian islands see phillips mineralogy for the italian islands page 136 for mexico and peru see humboldt essai geognostique mr edwards also describes the high inclination of the obsidian rocks of the cerro del navaja in mexico in the proc of the geolog soc june 1838 on the other hand in hungary the layers are horizontal the laminae also of some of the lavastreams above referred to as far as i can understand the descriptions given of them appear to be highly inclined or vertical i doubt whether in any of these cases the laminae have been tilted into their present position and in some instances as in that of the trachyte described by mr scrope it is almost certain that they have been originally formed with a high inclination in many of these cases there is evidence that the mass of liquified rock has moved in the direction of the laminae at ascension many of the aircells have a drawn out appearance and are crossed by coarse semiglassy fibres in the direction of the laminae and some of the layers separating the sphaerulitic globules have a scored appearance as if produced by the grating of the globules i have seen a specimen of zoned obsidian from mexico in mr stokes collection with the surfaces of the bestdefined layers streaked or furrowed with parallel lines and these lines or streaks precisely resembled those produced on the surface of a mass of artificial glass by its having been poured out of a vessel humboldt also has described little cavities which he compares to the tails of comets behind sphaerulites in laminated obsidian rocks from mexico and mr scrope has described other cavities behind fragments embedded in his laminated trachyte and which he supposes to have been produced during the movement of the mass geological transactions volume 2 second series page 200 etc these embedded fragments in some instances consist of the laminated trachyte broken off and enveloped in those parts which still remained liquid beudant also frequently refers in his great work on hungary tome 3 page 386 to trachytic rocks irregularly spotted with fragments of the same varieties which in other parts form the parallel ribbons in these cases we must suppose that after part of the molten mass had assumed a laminated structure a fresh irruption of lava broke up the mass and involved fragments and that subsequently the whole became relaminated from such facts most authors have attributed the lamination of these volcanic rocks to their movement whilst liquified although it is easy to perceive why each separate aircell or each fibre in pumicestone dolomieu voyage page 64 should be drawn out in the direction of the moving mass it is by no means at first obvious why such aircells and fibres should be arranged by the movement in the same planes in laminae absolutely straight and parallel to each other and often of extreme tenuity and still less obvious is it why such layers should come to be of slightly different composition and of different textures  in endeavouring to make out the cause of the lamination of these igneous feldspathic rocks let us return to the facts so minutely described at ascension we there see that some of the thinnest layers are chiefly formed by numerous exceedingly minute though perfect crystals of different minerals that other layers are formed by the union of different kinds of concretionary globules and that the layers thus formed often cannot be distinguished from the ordinary feldspathic and pitchstone layers composing a large portion of the entire mass the fibrous radiating structure of the sphaerulites seems judging from many analogous cases to connect the concretionary and crystalline forces the separate crystals also of feldspar all lie in the same parallel planes the formation indeed of a large crystal of any mineral in a rock of mixed composition implies an aggregation of the requisite atoms allied to concretionary action the cause of the crystals of feldspar in these rocks of ascension being all placed lengthways is probably the same with that which elongates and flattens all the brown sphaerulitic globules which behave like feldspar under the blowpipe in this same direction these allied forces therefore have played an important part in the lamination of the mass but they cannot be considered the primary force for the several kinds of nodules both the smallest and largest are internally zoned with excessively fine shades of colour parallel to the lamination of the whole and many of them are also externally marked in the same direction with parallel ridges and furrows which have not been produced by weathering  some of the finest streaks of colour in the stony layers alternating with the obsidian can be distinctly seen to be due to an incipient crystallisation of the constituent minerals the extent to which the minerals have crystallised can also be distinctly seen to be connected with the greater or less size and with the number of the minute flattened crenulated aircavities or fissures numerous facts as in the case of geodes and of cavities in silicified wood in primary rocks and in veins show that crystallisation is much favoured by space hence i conclude that if in a mass of cooling volcanic rock any cause produced in parallel planes a number of minute fissures or zones of less tension which from the pentup vapours would often be expanded into crenulated aircavities the crystallisation of the constituent parts and probably the formation of concretions would be superinduced or much favoured in such planes and thus a laminated structure of the kind we are here considering would be generated  that some cause does produce parallel zones of less tension in volcanic rocks during their consolidation we must admit in the case of the thin alternate layers of obsidian and pumice described by humboldt and of the small flattened crenulated aircells in the laminated rocks of ascension for on no other principle can we conceive why the confined vapours should through their expansion form aircells or fibres in separate parallel planes instead of irregularly throughout the mass in mr stokes collection i have seen a beautiful example of this structure in a specimen of obsidian from mexico which is shaded and zoned like the finest agate with numerous straight parallel layers more or less opaque and white or almost perfectly glassy the degree of opacity and glassiness depending on the number of microscopically minute flattened aircells in this case it is scarcely possible to doubt but that the mass to which the fragment belonged must have been subjected to some probably prolonged action causing the tension slightly to vary in the successive planes  several causes appear capable of producing zones of different tension in masses semiliquified by heat in a fragment of devitrified glass i have observed layers of sphaerulites which appeared from the manner in which they were abruptly bent to have been produced by the simple contraction of the mass in the vessel in which it cooled in certain dikes on mount etna described by m elie de beaumont mem pour servir etc tome 4 page 131 as bordered by alternating bands of scoriaceous and compact rock one is led to suppose that the stretching movement of the surrounding strata which originally produced the fissures continued whilst the injected rock remained fluid guided however by professor forbes edinburgh new phil journal 1842 page 350 clear description of the zoned structure of glacierice far the most probable explanation of the laminated structure of these feldspathic rocks appears to be that they have been stretched whilst slowly flowing onwards in a pasty condition i presume that this is nearly the same explanation which mr scrope had in his mind when he speaks geolog transact volume 2 second series page 228 of the ribboned structure of his trachytic rocks having arisen from a linear extension of the mass while in a state of imperfect liquidity coupled with a concretionary process in precisely the same manner as professor forbes believes that the ice of moving glaciers is stretched and fissured in both cases the zones may be compared to those in the finest agates in both they extend in the direction in which the mass has flowed and those exposed on the surface are generally vertical in the ice the porous laminae are rendered distinct by the subsequent congelation of infiltrated water in the stony feldspathic lavas by subsequent crystalline and concretionary action the fragment of glassy obsidian in mr stokes collection which is zoned with minute aircells must strikingly resemble judging from professor forbes descriptions a fragment of the zoned ice and if the rate of cooling and nature of the mass had been favourable to its crystallisation or to concretionary action we should here have had the finest parallel zones of different composition and texture in glaciers the lines of porous ice and of minute crevices seem to be due to an incipient stretching caused by the central parts of the frozen stream moving faster than the sides and bottom which are retarded by friction hence in glaciers of certain forms and towards the lower end of most glaciers the zones become horizontal may we venture to suppose that in the feldspathic lavas with horizontal laminae we see an analogous case all geologists who have examined trachytic regions have come to the conclusion that the lavas of this series have possessed an exceedingly imperfect fluidity and as it is evident that only matter thus characterised would be subject to become fissured and to be formed into zones of different tensions in the manner here supposed we probably see the reason why augitic lavas which appear generally to have possessed a high degree of fluidity are not like the feldspathic lavas divided into laminae of different composition and texture basaltic lavas and many other rocks are not unfrequently divided into thick laminae or plates of the same composition which are either straight or curved these being crossed by vertical lines of fissure sometimes become united into columns this structure seems related in its origin to that by which many rocks both igneous and sedimentary become traversed by parallel systems of fissures moreover in the augitic series there never appears to be any tendency to concretionary action which we have seen plays an important part in the lamination of rocks of the trachytic series or at least in rendering that structure apparent   whatever may be thought of the explanation here advanced of the laminated structure of the rocks of the trachytic series i venture to call the attention of geologists to the simple fact that in a body of rock at ascension undoubtedly of volcanic origin layers often of extreme tenuity quite straight and parallel to each other have been producedsome composed of distinct crystals of quartz and diopside mingled with amorphous augitic specks and granular feldsparothers entirely composed of these black augitic specks with granules of oxide of ironand lastly others formed of crystalline feldspar in a more or less perfect state of purity together with numerous crystals of feldspar placed lengthways at this island there is reason to believe and in some analogous cases it is certainly known that the laminae have originally been formed with their present high inclination facts of this nature are manifestly of importance with relation to the structural origin of that grand series of plutonic rocks which like the volcanic have undergone the action of heat and which consist of alternate layers of quartz

craters of elevation  the whole island is of volcanic origin its circumference according to beatson is about twentyeight miles governor beatson account of st helena the central and largest part consists of rocks of a feldspathic nature generally decomposed to an extraordinary degree and when in this state presenting a singular assemblage of alternating red purple brown yellow and white soft argillaceous beds from the shortness of our visit i did not examine these beds with care some of them especially those of the white yellow and brown shades originally existed as streams of lava but the greater number were probably ejected in the form of scoriae and ashes other beds of a purple tint porphyritic with crystal shaped patches of a white soft substance which are now unctuous and yield like wax a polished streak to the nail seem once to have existed as solid claystoneporphyries the red argillaceous beds generally have a brecciated structure and no doubt have been formed by the decomposition of scoriae several extensive streams however belonging to this series retain their stony character these are either of a blackishgreen colour with minute acicular crystals of feldspar or of a very pale tint and almost composed of minute often scaly crystals of feldspar abounding with microscopical black specks they are generally compact and laminated others however of similar composition are cellular and somewhat decomposed none of these rocks contain large crystals of feldspar or have the harsh fracture peculiar to trachyte these feldspathic lavas and tuffs are the uppermost or those last erupted innumerable dikes however and great masses of molten rock have subsequently been injected into them they converge as they rise towards the central curved ridge of which one point attains the elevation of 2700 feet this ridge is the highest land in the island and it once formed the northern rim of a great crater whence the lavas of this series flowed from its ruined condition from the southern half having been removed and from the violent dislocation which the whole island has undergone its structure is rendered very obscure  basaltic series  the margin of the island is formed by a rude circle of great black stratified ramparts of basalt dipping seaward and worn into cliffs which are often nearly perpendicular and vary in height from a few hundred feet to two thousand this circle or rather horseshoe shaped ring is open to the south and is breached by several other wide spaces its rim or summit generally projects little above the level of the adjoining inland country and the more recent feldspathic lavas sloping down from the central heights generally abut against and overlap its inner margin on the northwestern side of the island however they appear judging from a distance to have flowed over and concealed portions of it in some parts where the basaltic ring has been breached and the black ramparts stand detached the feldspathic lavas have passed between them and now overhang the seacoast in lofty cliffs the basaltic rocks are of a black colour and thinly stratified they are generally highly vesicular but occasionally compact some of them contain numerous crystals of glassy feldspar and octahedrons of titaniferous iron others abound with crystals of augite and grains of olivine the vesicles are frequently lined with minute crystals of chabasie and even become amygdaloidal with them the streams are separated from each other by cindery matter or by a bright red friable saliferous tuff which is marked by successive lines like those of aqueous deposition and sometimes it has an obscure concretionary structure the rocks of this basaltic series occur nowhere except near the coast in most volcanic districts the trachytic lavas are of anterior origin to the basaltic but here we see that a great pile of rock closely related in composition to the trachytic family has been erupted subsequently to the basaltic strata the number however of dikes abounding with large crystals of augite with which the feldspathic lavas have been injected shows perhaps some tendency to a return to the more usual order of superposition  basal submarine lavas  the lavas of this basal series lie immediately beneath both the basaltic and feldspathic rocks according to mr seale they may be seen at intervals on the seabeach round the entire island geognosy of the island of st helena mr seale has constructed a gigantic model of st helena well worth visiting which is now deposited at addiscombe college in surrey in the sections which i examined their nature varied much some of the strata abound with crystals of augite others are of a brown colour either laminated or in a rubbly condition and many parts are highly amygdaloidal with calcareous matter the successive sheets are either closely united together or are separated from each other by beds of scoriaceous rock and of laminated tuff frequently containing wellrounded fragments the interstices of these beds are filled with gypsum and salt the gypsum also sometimes occurring in thin layers from the large quantity of these two substances from the presence of rounded pebbles in the tuffs and from the abundant amygdaloids i cannot doubt that these basal volcanic strata flowed beneath the sea this remark ought perhaps to be extended to a part of the superincumbent basaltic rocks but on this point i was not able to obtain clear evidence the strata of the basal series whenever i examined them were intersected by an extraordinary number of dikes  flagstaff hill and the barn  figure 8 flagstaff hill and the barn section west left to east right flagstaff hill 2272 feet high to the barn 2015 feet high  the double lines represent the basaltic strata the single the basal submarine strata the dotted the upper feldspathic strata the dikes are shaded transversely  i will now describe some of the more remarkable sections and will commence with these two hills which form the principal external feature on the northeastern side of the island the square angular outline and black colour of the barn at once show that it belongs to the basaltic series whilst the smooth conical figure and the varied bright tints of flagstaff hill render it equally clear that it is composed of the softened feldspathic rocks these two lofty hills are connected as is shown in figure 8 by a sharp ridge which is composed of the rubbly lavas of the basal series the strata of this ridge dip westward the inclination becoming less and less towards the flagstaff and the upper feldspathic strata of this hill can be seen though with some difficulty to dip conformably to the wsw close to the barn the strata of the ridge are nearly vertical but are much obscured by innumerable dikes under this hill they probably change from being vertical into being inclined into an opposite direction for the upper or basaltic strata which are about eight hundred or one thousand feet in thickness are inclined northeastward at an angle between thirty and forty degrees   this ridge and likewise the barn and flagstaff hills are interlaced by dikes many of which preserve a remarkable parallelism in a nnw and sse direction the dikes chiefly consist of a rock porphyritic with large crystals of augite others are formed of a finegrained and brown coloured trap most of these dikes are coated by a glossy layer from one to twotenths of an inch in thickness which unlike true pitchstone fuses into a black enamel this layer is evidently analogous to the glossy superficial coating of many lava streams this circumstance has been observed lyell principles of geology volume 4 chapter 10 page 9 in the dikes of the atrio del cavallo but apparently it is not of very common occurrence sir g mackenzie however states page 372 travels in iceland that all the veins in iceland have a black vitreous coating on their sides captain carmichael speaking of the dikes in tristan dacunha a volcanic island in the southern atlantic says linnaean transactions volume 12 page 485 that their sides where they come in contact with the rocks are invariably in a semivitrified state the dikes can often be followed for great lengths both horizontally and vertically and they seem to preserve a nearly uniform thickness geognosy of the island of st helena plate 5 mr seale states that one near the barn in a height of 1260 feet decreases in width only four inchesfrom nine feet at the bottom to eight feet and eight inches at the top on the ridge the dikes appear to have been guided in their course to a considerable degree by the alternating soft and hard strata they are often firmly united to the harder strata and they preserve their parallelism for such great lengths that in very many instances it was impossible to conjecture which of the beds were dikes and which streams of lava the dikes though so numerous on this ridge are even more numerous in the valleys a little south of it and to a degree i never saw equalled anywhere else in these valleys they extend in less regular lines covering the ground with a network like a spiders web and with some parts of the surface even appearing to consist wholly of dikes interlaced by other dikes  from the complexity produced by the dikes from the high inclination and anticlinal dip of the strata of the basal series which are overlaid at the opposite ends of the short ridge by two great masses of different ages and of different composition i am not surprised that this singular section has been misunderstood it has even been supposed to form part of a crater but so far is this from having been the case that the summit of flagstaff hill once formed the lower extremity of a sheet of lava and ashes which were erupted from the central crateriform ridge judging from the slope of the contemporaneous streams in an adjoining and undisturbed part of the island the strata of the flagstaff hill must have been upturned at least twelve hundred feet and probably much more for the great truncated dikes on its summit show that it has been largely denuded the summit of this hill now nearly equals in height the crateriform ridge and before having been denuded it was probably higher than this ridge from which it is separated by a broad and much lower tract of country we here therefore see that the lower extremities of a set of lavastreams have been tilted up to as great a height as or perhaps greater height than the crater down the flanks of which they originally flowed i believe that dislocations on so grand a scale are extremely rare in volcanic districts m constant prevost mem de la soc geolog tome 2 observes that les produits volcaniques nont que localement et rarement meme derange le sol a travers lequel ils se sont fait jour the formation of such numbers of dikes in this part of the island shows that the surface must here have been stretched to a quite extraordinary degree this stretching on the ridge between flagstaff and barn hills probably took place subsequently though perhaps immediately so to the strata being tilted for had the strata at that time extended horizontally they would in all probability have been fissured and injected transversely instead of in the planes of their stratification although the space between the barn and flagstaff hill presents a distinct anticlinal line extending north and south and though most of the dikes range with much regularity in the same line nevertheless at only a mile due south of the ridge the strata lie undisturbed hence the disturbing force seems to have acted under a point rather than along a line the manner in which it has acted is probably explained by the structure of little stonytop a mountain 2000 feet high situated a few miles southward of the barn we there see even from a distance a darkcoloured sharp wedge of compact columnar rock with the brightcoloured feldspathic strata sloping away on each side from its uncovered apex this wedge from which it derives its name of stonytop consists of a body of rock which has been injected whilst liquified into the overlying strata and if we may suppose that a similar body of rock lies injected beneath the ridge connecting the barn and flagstaff the structure there exhibited would be explained  turks cap and prosperous bays  figure 9 prosperous hill and the barn section sse left to nnw right prosperous hill through holdfasttom and flagstaff hill to the barn  the double lines represent the basaltic strata the single the basal submarine strata the dotted the upper feldspathic strata  prosperous hill is a great black precipitous mountain situated two miles and a half south of the barn and composed like it of basaltic strata these rest in one part on the browncoloured porphyritic beds of the basal series and in another part on a fissured mass of highly scoriaceous and amygdaloidal rock which seems to have formed a small point of eruption beneath the sea contemporaneously with the basal series prosperous hill like the barn is traversed by many dikes of which the greater number range north and south and its strata dip at an angle of about 20 degrees rather obliquely from the island towards the sea the space between prosperous hill and the barn as represented in figure 9 consists of lofty cliffs composed of the lavas of the upper or feldspathic series which rest though unconformably on the basal submarine strata as we have seen that they do at flagstaff hill differently however from in that hill these upper strata are nearly horizontal gently rising towards the interior of the island and they are composed of greenishblack or more commonly pale brown compact lavas instead of softened and highly coloured matter these browncoloured compact lavas consist almost entirely of small glimmering scales or of minute acicular crystals of feldspar placed close by the side of each other and abounding with minute black specks apparently of hornblende the basaltic strata of prosperous hill project only a little above the level of the gentlysloping feldspathic streams which wind round and abut against their upturned edges the inclination of the basaltic strata seems to be too great to have been caused by their having flowed down a slope and they must have been tilted into their present position before the eruption of the feldspathic streams  basaltic ring  proceeding round the island the lavas of the upper series southward of prosperous hill overhang the sea in lofty precipices further on the headland called great stonytop is composed as i believe of basalt as is long range point on the inland side of which the coloured beds abut on the southern side of the island we see the basaltic strata of the south barn dipping obliquely seaward at a considerable angle this headland also stands a little above the level of the more modern feldspathic lavas further on a large space of coast on each side of sandy bay has been much denuded and there seems to be left only the basal wreck of the great central crater the basaltic strata reappear with their seaward dip at the foot of the hill called manandhorse and thence they are continued along the whole northwestern coast to sugarloaf hill situated near to the flagstaff and they everywhere have the same seaward inclination and rest in some parts at least on the lavas of the basal series we thus see that the circumference of the island is formed by a muchbroken ring or rather a horseshoe of basalt open to the south and interrupted on the eastern side by many wide breaches the breadth of this marginal fringe on the northwestern side where alone it is at all perfect appears to vary from a mile to a mile and a half the basaltic strata as well as those of the subjacent basal series dip with a moderate inclination where they have not been subsequently disturbed towards the sea the more broken state of the basaltic ring round the eastern half compared with the western half of the island is evidently due to the much greater denuding power of the waves on the eastern or windward side as is shown by the greater height of the cliffs on that side than to leeward whether the margin of basalt was breached before or after the eruption of the lavas of the upper series is doubtful but as separate portions of the basaltic ring appear to have been tilted before that event and from other reasons it is more probable that some at least of the breaches were first formed reconstructing in imagination as far as is possible the ring of basalt the internal space or hollow which has since been filled up with the matter erupted from the great central crater appears to have been of an oval figure eight or nine miles in length by about four miles in breadth and with its axis directed in a ne and s w line coincident with the present longest axis of the island  the central curved ridge  this ridge consists as before remarked of grey feldspathic lavas and of red brecciated argillaceous tuffs like the beds of the upper coloured series the grey lavas contain numerous minute black easily fusible specks and but very few large crystals of feldspar they are generally much softened with the exception of this character and of being in many parts highly cellular they are quite similar to those great sheets of lava which overhang the coast at prosperous bay considerable intervals of time appear to have elapsed judging from the marks of denudation between the formation of the successive beds of which this ridge is composed on the steep northern slope i observed in several sections a much worn undulating surface of red tuff covered by grey decomposed feldspathic lavas with only a thin earthy layer interposed between them in an adjoining part i noticed a trapdike four feet wide cut off and covered up by the feldspathic lava as is represented in figure 9 the ridge ends on the eastern side in a hook which is not represented clearly enough in any map which i have seen towards the western end it gradually slopes down and divides into several subordinate ridges the best defined portion between dianas peak and nest lodge which supports the highest pinnacles in the island varying from 2000 to 2700 feet is rather less than three miles long in a straight line throughout this space the ridge has a uniform appearance and structure its curvature resembles that of the coastline of a great bay being made up of many smaller curves all open to the south the northern and outer side is supported by narrow ridges or buttresses which slope down to the adjoining country the inside is much steeper and is almost precipitous it is formed of the basset edges of the strata which gently decline outwards along some parts of the inner side a little way beneath the summit a flat ledge extends which imitates in outline the smaller curvatures of the crest ledges of this kind occur not unfrequently within volcanic craters and their formation seems to be due to the sinking down of a level sheet of hardened lava the edges of which remain like the ice round a pool from which the water has been drained adhering to the sides a most remarkable instance of this structure is described in ellis polynesian researches second edition where an admirable drawing is given of the successive ledges or terraces on the borders of the immense crater at hawaii in the sandwich islands  figure 10 dike section showing layers 1 2 and 3 from top to bottom  1 grey feldspathic lava  2 a layer one inch in thickness of a reddish earthy matter  3 brecciated red argillaceous tuff  in some parts the ridge is surmounted by a wall or parapet perpendicular on both sides near dianas peak this wall is extremely narrow at the galapagos archipelago i observed parapets having a quite similar structure and appearance surmounting several of the craters one which i more particularly examined was composed of glossy red scoriae firmly cemented together being externally perpendicular and extending round nearly the whole circumference of the crater it rendered it almost inaccessible the peak of teneriffe and cotopaxi according to humboldt are similarly constructed he states that at their summits a circular wall surrounds the crater which wall at a distance has the appearance of a small cylinder placed on a truncated cone personal narrative volume 1 page 171 on cotopaxi this peculiar structure is visible to the naked eye at more than two thousand toises distance and no person has ever reached its crater humboldt picturesque atlas folio plate 10 on the peak of teneriffe the parapet is so high that it would be impossible to reach the caldera if on the eastern side there did not exist a breach the origin of these circular parapets is probably due to the heat or vapours from the crater penetrating and hardening the sides to a nearly equal depth and afterwards to the mountain being slowly acted on by the weather which would leave the hardened part projecting in the form of a cylinder or circular parapet  from the points of structure in the central ridge now enumeratednamely from the convergence towards it of the beds of the upper seriesfrom the lavas there becoming highly cellularfrom the flat ledge extending along its inner and precipitous side like that within some still active cratersfrom the parapetlike wall on its summitand lastly from its peculiar curvature unlike that of any common line of elevation i cannot doubt that this curved ridge forms the last remnant of a great crater in endeavouring however to trace its former outline one is soon baffled its western extremity gradually slopes down and branching into other ridges extends to the seacoast the eastern end is more curved but it is only a little better defined some appearances lead me to suppose that the southern wall of the crater joined the present ridge near nest lodge in this case the crater must have been nearly three miles long and about a mile and a half in breadth had the denudation of the ridge and the decomposition of its constituent rocks proceeded a few steps further and had this ridge like several other parts of the island been broken up by great dikes and masses of injected matter we should in vain have endeavoured to discover its true nature even now we have seen that at flagstaff hill the lower extremity and most distant portion of one sheet of the erupted matter has been upheaved to as great a height as the crater down which it flowed and probably even to a greater height it is interesting thus to trace the steps by which the structure of a volcanic district becomes obscured and finally obliterated so near to this last stage is st helena that i believe no one has hitherto suspected that the central ridge or axis of the island is the last wreck of the crater whence the most modern volcanic streams were poured forth  the great hollow space or valley southward of the central curved ridge across which the half of the crater must once have extended is formed of bare waterworn hillocks and ridges of red yellow and brown rocks mingled together in chaoslike confusion interlaced by dikes and without any regular stratification the chief part consists of red decomposing scoriae associated with various kinds of tuff and yellow argillaceous beds full of broken crystals those of augite being particularly large here and there masses of highly cellular and amygdaloidal lavas protrude from one of the ridges in the midst of the valley a conical precipitous hill called lot boldly stands up and forms a most singular and conspicuous object it is composed of phonolite divided in one part into great curved laminae in another into angular concretionary balls and in a third part into outwardly radiating columns at its base the strata of lava tuff and scoriae dip away on all sides abich in his views of vesuvius plate 6 has shown the manner in which beds under nearly similar circumstances are tilted up the upper beds are more turned up than the lower and he accounts for this by showing that the lava insinuates itself horizontally between the lower beds the uncovered portion is 197 feet in height this height is given by mr seale in his geognosy of the island the height of the summit above the level of the sea is said to be 1444 feet and its horizontal section gives an oval figure the phonolite is of a greenishgrey colour and is full of minute acicular crystals of feldspar in most parts it has a conchoidal fracture and is sonorous yet it is crenulated with minute aircavities in a sw direction from lot there are some other remarkable columnar pinnacles but of a less regular shape namely lots wife and the asses ears composed of allied kinds of rock from their flattened shape and their relative position to each other they are evidently connected on the same line of fissure it is moreover remarkable that this same ne and sw line joining lot and lots wife if prolonged would intersect flagstaff hill which as before stated is crossed by numerous dikes running in this direction and which has a disturbed structure rendering it probable that a great body of once fluid rock lies injected beneath it  in this same great valley there are several other conical masses of injected rock one i observed was composed of compact greenstone some of which are not connected as far as is apparent with any line of dike whilst others are obviously thus connected of these dikes three or four great lines stretch across the valley in a ne and sw direction parallel to that one connecting the asses ears lots wife and probably lot the number of these masses of injected rock is a remarkable feature in the geology of st helena besides those just mentioned and the hypothetical one beneath flagstaff hill there is little stonytop and others as i have reason to believe at the manandhorse and at high hill most of these masses if not all of them have been injected subsequently to the last volcanic eruptions from the central crater the formation of conical bosses of rock on lines of fissure the walls of which are in most cases parallel may probably be attributed to inequalities in the tension causing small transverse fissures and at these points of intersection the edges of the strata would naturally yield and be easily turned upwards finally i may remark that hills of phonolite everywhere are apt to assume singular and even grotesque shapes like that of lot daubuisson in his traite de geognosie tome 2 page 540 particularly remarks that this is the case the peak at fernando noronha offers an instance at st jago however the cones of phonolite though tapering have a regular form supposing as seems probable that all such hillocks or obelisks have originally been injected whilst liquified into a mould formed by yielding strata as certainly has been the case with lot how are we to account for the frequent abruptness and singularity of their outlines compared with similarly injected masses of greenstone and basalt can it be due to a less perfect degree of fluidity which is generally supposed to be characteristic of the allied trachytic lavas  superficial deposits  soft calcareous sandstone occurs in extensive though thin superficial beds both on the northern and southern shores of the island it consists of very minute equalsized rounded particles of shells and other organic bodies which partially retain their yellow brown and pink colours and occasionally though very rarely present an obscure trace of their original external forms i in vain endeavoured to find a single unrolled fragment of a shell the colour of the particles is the most obvious character by which their origin can be recognised the tints being affected and an odour produced by a moderate heat in the same manner as in fresh shells the particles are cemented together and are mingled with some earthy matter the purest masses according to beatson contain 70 per cent of carbonate of lime the beds varying in thickness from two or three feet to fifteen feet coat the surface of the ground they generally lie on that side of the valley which is protected from the wind and they occur at the height of several hundred feet above the level of the sea their position is the same which sand if now drifted by the tradewind would occupy and no doubt they thus originated which explains the equal size and minuteness of the particles and likewise the entire absence of whole shells or even of moderatelysized fragments it is remarkable that at the present day there are no shelly beaches on any part of the coast whence calcareous dust could be drifted and winnowed we must therefore look back to a former period when before the land was worn into the present great precipices a shelving coast like that of ascension was favourable to the accumulation of shelly detritus some of the beds of this limestone are between six hundred and seven hundred feet above the sea but part of this height may possibly be due to an elevation of the land subsequent to the accumulation of the calcareous sand  the percolation of rainwater has consolidated parts of these beds into a solid rock and has formed masses of dark brown stalagmitic limestone at the sugarloaf quarry fragments of rock on the adjoining slopes have been thickly coated by successive fine layers of calcareous matter in the earthy detritus on several parts of this hill irregular masses of very impure crystallised sulphate of lime occur as this substance is now being abundantly deposited by the surf at ascension it is possible that these masses may thus have originated but if so it must have been at a period when the land stood at a much lower level this earthy selenite is now found at a height of between six hundred and seven hundred feet it is singular that many of these pebbles have their entire surfaces coated without any point of contact having been left uncovered hence these pebbles must have been lifted up by the slow deposition between them of the successive films of carbonate of lime masses of white finely oolitic rock are attached to the outside of some of these coated pebbles von buch has described a compact limestone at lanzarote which seems perfectly to resemble the stalagmitic deposition just mentioned it coats pebbles and in parts is finely oolitic it forms a farextended layer from one inch to two or three feet in thickness and it occurs at the height of 800 feet above the sea but only on that side of the island exposed to the violent northwestern winds von buch remarks that it is not found in hollows but only on the unbroken and inclined surfaces of the mountain description des isles canaries page 293 he believes that it has been deposited by the spray which is borne over the whole island by these violent winds it appears however to me much more probable that it has been formed as at st helena by the percolation of water through finely comminuted shells for when sand is blown on a muchexposed coast it always tends to accumulate on broad even surfaces which offer a uniform resistance to the winds at the neighbouring island moreover of feurteventura there is an earthy limestone which according to von buch is quite similar to specimens which he has seen from st helena and which he believes to have been formed by the drifting of shelly detritus idem pages 314 and 374  the upper beds of the limestone at the abovementioned quarry on the sugarloaf hill are softer finergrained and less pure than the lower beds they abound with fragments of landshells and with some perfect ones they contain also the bones of birds and the large eggs apparently of waterfowl colonel wilkes in a catalogue presented with some specimens to the geological society states that as many as ten eggs were found by one person dr buckland has remarked geolog trans volume 5 page 474 on these eggs it is probable that these upper beds remained long in an unconsolidated form during which time these terrestrial productions were embedded mr gr sowerby has kindly examined three species of landshells which i procured from this bed and has described them in detail one of them is a succinea identical with a species now living abundantly on the island the two others namely cochlogena fossilis and helix biplicata are not known in a recent state the latter species was also found in another and different locality associated with a species of cochlogena which is undoubtedly extinct  beds of extinct landshells  landshells all of which appear to be species now extinct occur embedded in earth in several parts of the island the greater number have been found at a considerable height on flagstaff hill on the nw side of this hill a rainchannel exposes a section of about twenty feet in thickness of which the upper part consists of black vegetable mould evidently washed down from the heights above and the lower part of less black earth abounding with young and old shells and with their fragments part of this earth is slightly consolidated by calcareous matter apparently due to the partial decomposition of some of the shells mr seale an intelligent resident who first called attention to these shells gave me a large collection from another locality where the shells appear to have been embedded in very black earth mr gr sowerby has examined these shells and has described them there are seven species namely one cochlogena two species of the genus cochlicopa and four of helix none of these are known in a recent state or have been found in any other country the smaller species were picked out of the inside of the large shells of the cochlogena aurisvulpina this lastmentioned species is in many respects a very singular one it was classed even by lamarck in a marine genus and having thus been mistaken for a seashell and the smaller accompanying species having been overlooked the exact localities where it was found have been measured and the elevation of this island thus deduced it is very remarkable that all the shells of this species found by me in one spot form a distinct variety as described by mr sowerby from those procured from another locality by mr seale as this cochlogena is a large and conspicuous shell i particularly inquired from several intelligent countrymen whether they had ever seen it alive they all assured me that they had not and they would not even believe that it was a land animal mr seale moreover who was a collector of shells all his life at st helena never met with it alive possibly some of the smaller species may turn out to be yet living kinds but on the other hand the two land shells which are now living on the island in great numbers do not occur embedded as far as is yet known with the extinct species i have shown in my journal journal of researches page 582 that the extinction of these landshells possibly may not be an ancient event as a great change took place in the state of the island about one hundred and twenty years ago when the old trees died and were not replaced by young ones these being destroyed by the goats and hogs which had run wild in numbers from the year 1502 mr seale states that on flagstaff hill where we have seen that the embedded landshells are especially numerous traces are everywhere discoverable which plainly indicate that it was once thickly clothed with trees at present not even a bush grows there the thick bed of black vegetable mould which covers the shellbed on the flanks of this hill was probably washed down from the upper part as soon as the trees perished and the shelter afforded by them was lost  elevation of the land  seeing that the lavas of the basal series which are of submarine origin are raised above the level of the sea and at some places to the height of many hundred feet i looked out for superficial signs of the elevation of the land the bottoms of some of the gorges which descend to the coast are filled up to the depth of about a hundred feet by rudely divided layers of sand muddy clay and fragmentary masses in these beds mr seale has found the bones of the tropicbird and of the albatross the former now rarely and the latter never visiting the island from the difference between these layers and the sloping piles of detritus which rest on them i suspect that they were deposited when the gorges stood beneath the sea mr seale moreover has shown that some of the fissure like gorges become with a concave outline gradually rather wider at the bottom than at the top and this peculiar structure was probably caused by the wearing action of the sea when it entered the lower part of these gorges a fissurelike gorge near stonytop is said by mr seale to be 840 feet deep and only 115 feet in width at greater heights the evidence of the rise of the land is even less clear nevertheless in a baylike depression on the tableland behind prosperous bay at the height of about a thousand feet there are flattopped masses of rock which it is scarcely conceivable could have been insulated from the surrounding and similar strata by any other agency than the denuding action of a sea beach much denudation indeed has been effected at great elevations which it would not be easy to explain by any other means thus the flat summit of the barn which is 2000 feet high presents according to mr seale a perfect network of truncated dikes on hills like the flagstaff formed of soft rock we might suppose that the dikes had been worn down and cut off by meteoric agency but we can hardly suppose this possible with the hard basaltic strata of the barn  coast denudation  the enormous cliffs in many parts between one and two thousand feet in height with which this prisonlike island is surrounded with the exception of only a few places where narrow valleys descend to the coast is the most striking feature in its scenery we have seen that portions of the basaltic ring two or three miles in length by one or two miles in breadth and from one to two thousand feet in height have been wholly removed there are also ledges and banks of rock rising out of profoundly deep water and distant from the present coast between three and four miles which according to mr seale can be traced to the shore and are found to be the continuations of certain wellknown great dikes the swell of the atlantic ocean has obviously been the active power in forming these cliffs and it is interesting to observe that the lesser though still great height of the cliffs on the leeward and partially protected side of the island extending from the sugarloaf hill to south west point corresponds with the lesser degree of exposure when reflecting on the comparatively low coasts of many volcanic islands which also stand exposed in the open ocean and are apparently of considerable antiquity the mind recoils from an attempt to grasp the number of centuries of exposure necessary to have ground into mud and to have dispersed the enormous cubic mass of hard rock which has been pared off the circumference of this island the contrast in the superficial state of st helena compared with the nearest island namely ascension is very striking at ascension the surfaces of the lavastreams are glossy as if just poured forth their boundaries are well defined and they can often be traced to perfect craters whence they were erupted in the course of many long walks i did not observe a single dike and the coast round nearly the entire circumference is low and has been eaten back though too much stress must not be placed on this fact as the island may have been subsiding into a little wall only from ten to thirty feet high yet during the 340 years since ascension has been known not even the feeblest signs of volcanic action have been recorded in the nautical magazine for 1835 page 642 and for 1838 page 361 and in the comptes rendus april 1838 accounts are given of a series of volcanic phenomenaearthquakestroubled waterfloating scoriae and columns of smokewhich have been observed at intervals since the middle of the last century in a space of open sea between longitudes 20 degrees and 22 degrees west about half a degree south of the equator these facts seem to show that an island or an archipelago is in process of formation in the middle of the atlantic a line joining st helena and ascension prolonged intersects this slowly nascent focus of volcanic action on the other hand at st helena the course of no one stream of lava can be traced either by the state of its boundaries or of its superficies the mere wreck of one great crater is left not the valleys only but the surfaces of some of the highest hills are interlaced by worndown dikes and in many places the denuded summits of great cones of injected rock stand exposed and naked lastly as we have seen the entire circuit of the island has been deeply worn back into the grandest precipices  craters of elevation  there is much resemblance in structure and in geological history between st helena st jago and mauritius all three islands are bounded at least in the parts which i was able to examine by a ring of basaltic mountains now much broken but evidently once continuous these mountains have or apparently once had their escarpments steep towards the interior of the island and their strata dip outwards i was able to ascertain only in a few cases the inclination of the beds nor was this easy for the stratification was generally obscure except when viewed from a distance i feel however little doubt that according to the researches of m elie de beaumont their average inclination is greater than that which they could have acquired considering their thickness and compactness by flowing down a sloping surface at st helena and at st jago the basaltic strata rest on older and probably submarine beds of different composition at all three islands deluges of more recent lavas have flowed from the centre of the island towards and between the basaltic mountains and at st helena the central platform has been filled up by them all three islands have been raised in mass at mauritius the sea within a late geological period must have reached to the foot of the basaltic mountains as it now does at st helena and at st jago it is cutting back the intermediate plain towards them in these three islands but especially at st jago and at mauritius when standing on the summit of one of the old basaltic mountains one looks in vain towards the centre of the islandthe point towards which the strata beneath ones feet and of the mountains on each side rudely convergefor a source whence these strata could have been erupted but one sees only a vast hollow platform stretched beneath or piles of matter of more recent origin  these basaltic mountains come i presume into the class of craters of elevation it is immaterial whether the rings were ever completely formed for the portions which now exist have so uniform a structure that if they do not form fragments of true craters they cannot be classed with ordinary lines of elevation with respect to their origin after having read the works of mr lyell principles of geology fifth edition volume 2 page 171 and of mm c prevost and virlet i cannot believe that the great central hollows have been formed by a simple domeshaped elevation and the consequent arching of the strata on the other hand i have very great difficulty in admitting that these basaltic mountains are merely the basal fragments of great volcanoes of which the summits have either been blown off or more probably swallowed up by subsidence these rings are in some instances so immense as at st jago and at mauritius and their occurrence is so frequent that i can hardly persuade myself to adopt this explanation moreover i suspect that the following circumstances from their frequent concurrence are someway connected togethera connection not implied in either of the above views namely first the broken state of the ring showing that the now detached portions have been exposed to great denudation and in some cases perhaps rendering it probable that the ring never was entire secondly the great amount of matter erupted from the central area after or during the formation of the ring and thirdly the elevation of the district in mass as far as relates to the inclination of the strata being greater than that which the basal fragments of ordinary volcanoes would naturally possess i can readily believe that this inclination might have been slowly acquired by that amount of elevation of which according to m elie de beaumont the numerous upfilled fissures or dikes are the evidence and the measurea view equally novel and important which we owe to the researches of that geologist on mount etna  a conjecture including the above circumstances occurred to me when with my mind fully convinced from the phenomena of 1835 in south america that the forces which eject matter from volcanic orifices and raise continents in mass are identicali viewed that part of the coast of st jago where the horizontally upraised calcareous stratum dips into the sea directly beneath a cone of subsequently erupted lava i have given a detailed account of these phenomena in a paper read before the geological society in march 1838 at the instant of time when an immense area was convulsed and a large tract elevated the districts immediately surrounding several of the great vents in the cordillera remained quiescent the subterranean forces being apparently relieved by the eruptions which then recommenced with great violence an event of somewhat the same kind but on an infinitely smaller scale appears to have taken place according to abich views of vesuvius plates 1 and 9 within the great crater of vesuvius where a platform on one side of a fissure was raised in mass twenty feet whilst on the other side a train of small volcanoes burst forth in eruption the conjecture is that during the slow elevation of a volcanic district or island in the centre of which one or more orifices continue open and thus relieve the subterranean forces the borders are elevated more than the central area and that the portions thus upraised do not slope gently into the central less elevated area as does the calcareous stratum under the cone at st jago and as does a large part of the circumference of iceland but that they are separated from it by curved faults it appears from information communicated to me in the most obliging manner by m e robert that the circumferential parts of iceland which are composed of ancient basaltic strata alternating with tuff dip inland thus forming a gigantic saucer m robert found that this was the case with a few and quite local exceptions for a space of coast several hundred miles in length i find this statement corroborated as far as regards one place by mackenzie in his travels page 377 and in another place by some ms notes kindly lent me by dr holland the coast is deeply indented by creeks at the head of which the land is generally low m robert informs me that the inwardly dipping strata appear to extend as far as this line and that their inclination usually corresponds with the slope of the surface from the high coastmountains to the low land at the head of these creeks in the section described by sir g mackenzie the dip is 120 the interior parts of the island chiefly consist as far as is known of recently erupted matter the great size however of iceland equalling the bulkiest part of england ought perhaps to exclude it from the class of islands we have been considering but i cannot avoid suspecting that if the coastmountains instead of gently sloping into the less elevated central area had been separated from it by irregularly curved faults the strata would have been tilted seaward and a crater of elevation like that of st jago or that of mauritius but of much vaster dimensions would have been formed i will only further remark that the frequent occurrence of extensive lakes at the foot of large volcanoes and the frequent association of volcanic and freshwater strata seem to indicate that the areas around volcanoes are apt to be depressed beneath the level of the adjoining country either from having been less elevated or from the effects of subsidence we might expect from what we see along ordinary faults that the strata on the upraised side already dipping outwards from their original formation as lavastreams would be tilted from the line of fault and thus have their inclination increased according to this hypothesis which i am tempted to extend only to some few cases it is not probable that the ring would ever be formed quite perfect and from the elevation being slow the upraised portions would generally be exposed to much denudation and hence the ring become broken we might also expect to find occasional inequalities in the dip of the upraised masses as is the case at st jago by this hypothesis the elevation of the districts in mass and the flowing of deluges of lava from the central platforms are likewise connected together on this view the marginal basaltic mountains of the three foregoing islands might still be considered as forming craters of elevation the kind of elevation implied having been slow and the central hollow or platform having been formed not by the arching of the surface but simply by that part having been upraised to a less height   chapter vgalapagos archipelago  chatham island craters composed of a peculiar kind of tuff

wenman abingdon bindloes tower narborough albemarle james indefatigable barrington chatham charles and hoods islands  this archipelago is situated under the equator at a distance of between five and six hundred miles from the west coast of south america it consists of five principal islands and of several small ones which together are equal in area but not in extent of land to sicily conjointly with the ionian islands i exclude from this measurement the small volcanic islands of culpepper and wenman lying seventy miles northward of the group craters were visible on all the islands of the group except on towers island which is one of the lowest this island is however formed of volcanic rocks they are all volcanic on two craters have been seen in eruption and on several of the other islands streams of lava have a recent appearance the larger islands are chiefly composed of solid rock and they rise with a tame outline to a height of between one and four thousand feet they are sometimes but not generally surmounted by one principal orifice the craters vary in size from mere spiracles to huge caldrons several miles in circumference they are extraordinarily numerous so that i should think if enumerated they would be found to exceed two thousand they are formed either of scoriae and lava or of a browncoloured tuff and these latter craters are in several respects remarkable the whole group was surveyed by the officers of the beagle i visited myself four of the principal islands and received specimens from all the others under the head of the different islands i will describe only that which appears to me deserving of attention  chatham island craters composed of a singular kind of tuff  towards the eastern end of this island there occur two craters composed of two kinds of tuff one kind being friable like slightly consolidated ashes and the other compact and of a different nature from anything which i have met with described this latter substance where it is best characterised is of a yellowishbrown colour translucent and with a lustre somewhat resembling resin it is brittle with an angular rough and very irregular fracture sometimes however being slightly granular and even obscurely crystalline it can readily be scratched with a knife yet some points are hard enough just to mark common glass it fuses with ease into a blackishgreen glass the mass contains numerous broken crystals of olivine and augite and small particles of black and brown scoriae it is often traversed by thin seams of calcareous matter it generally affects a nodular or concretionary structure in a hand specimen this substance would certainly be mistaken for a pale and peculiar variety of pitchstone but when seen in mass its stratification and the numerous layers of fragments of basalt both angular and rounded at once render its subaqueous origin evident an examination of a series of specimens shows that this resinlike substance results from a chemical change on small particles of pale and darkcoloured scoriaceous rocks and this change could be distinctly traced in different stages round the edges of even the same particle the position near the coast of all the craters composed of this kind of tuff or peperino and their breached condition renders it probable that they were all formed when standing immersed in the sea considering this circumstance together with the remarkable absence of large beds of ashes in the whole archipelago i think it highly probable that much the greater part of the tuff has originated from the trituration of fragments of the grey basaltic lavas in the mouths of craters standing in the sea it may be asked whether the heated water within these craters has produced this singular change in the small scoriaceous particles and given to them their translucent resinlike fracture or has the associated lime played any part in this change i ask these questions from having found at st jago in the cape de verde islands that where a great stream of molten lava has flowed over a calcareous bottom into the sea the outermost film which in other parts resembles pitchstone is changed apparently by its contact with the carbonate of lime into a resinlike substance precisely like the best characterised specimens of the tuff from this archipelago the concretions containing lime which i have described at ascension as formed in a bed of ashes present some degree of resemblance to this substance but they have not a resinous fracture at st helena also i found veins of a somewhat similar compact but non resinous substance occurring in a bed of pumiceous ashes apparently free from calcareous matter in neither of these cases could heat have acted  to return to the two craters one of them stands at the distance of a league from the coast the intervening tract consisting of a calcareous tuff apparently of submarine origin this crater consists of a circle of hills some of which stand quite detached but all have a very regular qua qua versal dip at an inclination of between thirty and forty degrees the lower beds to the thickness of several hundred feet consist of the resin like stone with embedded fragments of lava the upper beds which are between thirty and forty feet in thickness are composed of a thinly stratified finegrained harsh friable browncoloured tuff or peperino those geologists who restrict the term of tuff to ashes of a white colour resulting from the attrition of feldspathic lavas would call these browncoloured strata peperino a central mass without any stratification which must formerly have occupied the hollow of the crater but is now attached only to a few of the circumferential hills consists of a tuff intermediate in character between that with a resinlike and that with an earthy fracture this mass contains white calcareous matter in small patches the second crater 520 feet in height must have existed until the eruption of a recent great stream of lava as a separate islet a fine section worn by the sea shows a grand funnelshaped mass of basalt surrounded by steep sloping flanks of tuff having in parts an earthy and in others a semiresinous fracture the tuff is traversed by several broad vertical dikes with smooth and parallel sides which i did not doubt were formed of basalt until i actually broke off fragments these dikes however consist of tuff like that of the surrounding strata but more compact and with a smoother fracture hence we must conclude that fissures were formed and filled up with the finer mud or tuff from the crater before its interior was occupied as it now is by a solidified pool of basalt other fissures have been subsequently formed parallel to these singular dikes and are merely filled with loose rubbish the change from ordinary scoriaceous particles to the substance with a semiresinous fracture could be clearly followed in portions of the compact tuff of these dikes  figure 12 the kicker rock 400 feet high  at the distance of a few miles from these two craters stands the kicker rock or islet remarkable from its singular form it is unstratified and is composed of compact tuff in parts having the resinlike fracture it is probable that this amorphous mass like that similar mass in the case first described once filled up the central hollow of a crater and that its flanks or sloping walls have since been worn quite away by the sea in which it stands exposed  small basaltic craters  a bare undulating tract at the eastern end of chatham island is remarkable from the number proximity and form of the small basaltic craters with which it is studded they consist either of a mere conical pile or but less commonly of a circle of black and red glossy scoriae partially cemented together they vary in diameter from thirty to one hundred and fifty yards and rise from about fifty to one hundred feet above the level of the surrounding plain from one small eminence i counted sixty of these craters all of which were within a third of a mile from each other and many were much closer i measured the distance between two very small craters and found that it was only thirty yards from the summitrim of one to the rim of the other small streams of black basaltic lava containing olivine and much glassy feldspar have flowed from many but not from all of these craters the surfaces of the more recent streams were exceedingly rugged and were crossed by great fissures the older streams were only a little less rugged and they were all blended and mingled together in complete confusion the different growth however of the trees on the streams often plainly marked their different ages had it not been for this latter character the streams could in few cases have been distinguished and consequently this wide undulatory tract might have as probably many tracts have been erroneously considered as formed by one great deluge of lava instead of by a multitude of small streams erupted from many small orifices  in several parts of this tract and especially at the base of the small craters there are circular pits with perpendicular sides from twenty to forty feet deep at the foot of one small crater there were three of these pits they have probably been formed by the falling in of the roofs of small caverns m elie de beaumont has described mem pour servir etc tome 4 page 113 many petits cirques deboulement on etna of some of which the origin is historically known in other parts there are mammiform hillocks which resemble great bubbles of lava with their summits fissured by irregular cracks which appeared upon entering them to be very deep lava has not flowed from these hillocks there are also other very regular mammiform hillocks composed of stratified lava and surmounted by circular steepsided hollows which i suppose have been formed by a body of gas first arching the strata into one of the bubble like hillocks and then blowing off its summit these several kinds of hillocks and pits as well as the numerous small scoriaceous craters all show that this tract has been penetrated almost like a sieve by the passage of heated vapours the more regular hillocks could only have been heaved up whilst the lava was in a softened state sir g mackenzie travels in iceland pages 389 to 392 has described a plain of lava at the foot of hecla everywhere heaved up into great bubbles or blisters sir george states that this cavernous lava composes the uppermost stratum and the same fact is affirmed by von buch descript des isles canaries page 159 with respect to the basaltic stream near rialejo in teneriffe it appears singular that it should be the upper streams that are chiefly cavernous for one sees no reason why the upper and lower should not have been equally affected at different timeshave the inferior streams flowed beneath the pressure of the sea and thus been flattened after the passage through them of bodies of gas  albemarle island   this island consists of five great flattopped craters which together with the one on the adjoining island of narborough singularly resemble each other in form and height the southern one is 4700 feet high two others are 3720 feet a third only 50 feet higher and the remaining ones apparently of nearly the same height three of these are situated on one line and their craters appear elongated in nearly the same direction the northern crater which is not the largest was found by the triangulation to measure externally no less than three miles and oneeighth of a mile in diameter over the lips of these great broad caldrons and from little orifices near their summits deluges of black lava have flowed down their naked sides   fluidity of different lavas   near tagus or banks cove i examined one of these great streams of lava which is remarkable from the evidence of its former high degree of fluidity especially when its composition is considered near the seacoast this stream is several miles in width it consists of a black compact base easily fusible into a black bead with angular and not very numerous aircells and thickly studded with large fractured crystals of glassy albite varying from the tenth of an inch to half an inch in diameter in the cordillera of chile i have seen lava very closely resembling this variety at the galapagos archipelago it contained however besides the albite wellformed crystals of augite and the base perhaps in consequence of the aggregation of the augitic particles was a shade lighter in colour i may here remark that in all these cases i call the feldspathic crystals albite from their cleavageplanes as measured by the reflecting goniometer corresponding with those of that mineral as however other species of this genus have lately been discovered to cleave in nearly the same planes with albite this determination must be considered as only provisional i examined the crystals in the lavas of many different parts of the galapagos group and i found that none of them with the exception of some crystals from one part of james island cleaved in the direction of orthite or potashfeldspar this lava although at first sight appearing eminently porphyritic cannot properly be considered so for the crystals have evidently been enveloped rounded and penetrated by the lava like fragments of foreign rock in a trapdike this was very clear in some specimens of a similar lava from abingdon island in which the only difference was that the vesicles were spherical and more numerous the albite in these lavas is in a similar condition with the leucite of vesuvius and with the olivine described by von buch as projecting in great balls from the basalt of lanzarote description des isles canaries page 295 besides the albite this lava contains scattered grains of a green mineral with no distinct cleavage and closely resembling olivine humboldt mentions that he mistook a green augitic mineral occurring in the volcanic rocks of the cordillera of quito for olivine but as it fuses easily into a green glass it belongs probably to the augitic family at james island however a similar lava contained true olivine i obtained specimens from the actual surface and from a depth of four feet but they differed in no respect the high degree of fluidity of this lavastream was at once evident from its smooth and gently sloping surface from the manner in which the main stream was divided by small inequalities into little rills and especially from the manner in which its edges far below its source and where it must have been in some degree cooled thinned out to almost nothing the actual margin consisting of loose fragments few of which were larger than a mans head the contrast between this margin and the steep walls above twenty feet high bounding many of the basaltic streams at ascension is very remarkable it has generally been supposed that lavas abounding with large crystals and including angular vesicles have possessed little fluidity but we see that the case has been very different at albemarle island the irregular and angular form of the vesicles is probably caused by the unequal yielding of a mass composed in almost equal proportion of solid crystals and of a viscid base it certainly seems a general circumstance as might have been expected that in lava which has possessed a high degree of fluidity as well as an evensized grain the vesicles are internally smooth and spherical the degree of fluidity in different lavas does not seem to correspond with any apparent corresponding amount of difference in their composition at chatham island some streams containing much glassy albite and some olivine are so rugged that they may be compared to a sea frozen during a storm whilst the great stream at albemarle island is almost as smooth as a lake when ruffled by a breeze at james island black basaltic lava abounding with small grains of olivine presents an intermediate degree of roughness its surface being glossy and the detached fragments resembling in a very singular manner folds of drapery cables and pieces of the bark of trees a specimen of basaltic lava with a few small broken crystals of albite given me by one of the officers is perhaps worthy of description it consists of cylindrical ramifications some of which are only the twentieth of an inch in diameter and are drawn out into the sharpest points the mass has not been formed like a stalactite for the points terminate both upwards and downwards globules only the fortieth of an inch in diameter have dropped from some of the points and adhere to the adjoining branches the lava is vesicular but the vesicles never reach the surface of the branches which are smooth and glossy as it is generally supposed that vesicles are always elongated in the direction of the movement of the fluid mass i may observe that in these cylindrical branches which vary from a quarter to only the twentieth of an inch in diameter every aircell is spherical  craters of tuff   about a mile southward of banks cove there is a fine elliptic crater about five hundred feet in depth and threequarters of a mile in diameter its bottom is occupied by a lake of brine out of which some little crateriform hills of tuff rise the lower beds are formed of compact tuff appearing like a subaqueous deposit whilst the upper beds round the entire circumference consist of a harsh friable tuff of little specific gravity but often containing fragments of rock in layers this upper tuff contains numerous pisolitic balls about the size of small bullets which differ from the surrounding matter only in being slightly harder and finer grained the beds dip away very regularly on all sides at angles varying as i found by measurement from twentyfive to thirty degrees the external surface of the crater slopes at a nearly similar inclination and is formed by slightly convex ribs like those on the shell of a pecten or scallop which become broader as they extend from the mouth of the crater to its base these ribs are generally from eight to twenty feet in breadth but sometimes they are as much as forty feet broad and they resemble old plastered much flattened vaults with the plaster scaling off in plates they are separated from each other by gullies deepened by alluvial action at their upper and narrow ends near the mouth of the crater these ribs often consist of real hollow passages like but rather smaller than those often formed by the cooling of the crust of a lavastream whilst the inner parts have flowed onwardof which structure i saw many examples at chatham island there can be no doubt but that these hollow ribs or vaults have been formed in a similar manner namely by the setting or hardening of a superficial crust on streams of mud which have flowed down from the upper part of the crater in another part of this same crater i saw open concave gutters between one and two feet wide which appear to have been formed by the hardening of the lower surface of a mud stream instead of as in the former case of the upper surface from these facts i think it is certain that the tuff must have flowed as mud this conclusion is of some interest because m dufrenoy mem pour servir tome 4 page 274 has argued from strata of tuff apparently of similar composition with that here described being inclined at angles between 18 degrees and 20 degrees that monte nuevo and some other craters of southern italy have been formed by upheaval from the facts given above of the vaulted character of the separate rills and from the tuff not extending in horizontal sheets round these crateriform hills no one will suppose that the strata have here been produced by elevation and yet we see that their inclination is above 20 degrees and often as much as 30 degrees the consolidated strata also of the internal talus as will be immediately seen dips at an angle of above 30 degrees this mud may have been formed either within the crater or from ashes deposited on its upper parts and afterwards washed down by torrents of rain the former method in most of the cases appears the more probable one at james island however some beds of the friable kind of tuff extend so continuously over an uneven surface that probably they were formed by the falling of showers of ashes   within this same crater strata of coarse tuff chiefly composed of fragments of lava abut like a consolidated talus against the inside walls they rise to a height of between one hundred and one hundred and fifty feet above the surface of the internal brinelake they dip inwards and are inclined at an angle varying from thirty to thirtysix degrees they appear to have been formed beneath water probably at a period when the sea occupied the hollow of the crater i was surprised to observe that beds having this great inclination did not as far as they could be followed thicken towards their lower extremities  banks cove  figure 13 a sectional sketch of the headlands forming banks cove showing the diverging crateriform strata and the converging stratified talus the highest point of these hills is 817 feet above the sea  this harbour occupies part of the interior of a shattered crater of tuff larger than that last described all the tuff is compact and includes numerous fragments of lava it appears like a subaqueous deposit the most remarkable feature in this crater is the great development of strata converging inwards as in the last case at a considerable inclination and often deposited in irregular curved layers these interior converging beds as well as the proper diverging crateriform strata are represented in figure 13 a rude sectional sketch of the headlands forming this cove the internal and external strata differ little in composition and the former have evidently resulted from the wear and tear and redeposition of the matter forming the external crateriform strata from the great development of these inner beds a person walking round the rim of this crater might fancy himself on a circular anticlinal ridge of stratified sandstone and conglomerate the sea is wearing away the inner and outer strata and especially the latter so that the inwardly converging strata will perhaps in some future age be left standing alonea case which might at first perplex a geologist i believe that this case actually occurs in the azores where dr webster description page 185 has described a basinformed little island composed of strata of tuff dipping inwards and bounded externally by steep seaworn cliffs dr daubeny supposes volcanoes page 266 that this cavity must have been formed by a circular subsidence it appears to me far more probable that we here have strata which were originally deposited within the hollow of a crater of which the exterior walls have since been removed by the sea  james island  two craters of tuff on this island are the only remaining ones which require any notice one of them lies a mile and a half inland from puerto grande it is circular about the third of a mile in diameter and 400 feet in depth it differs from all the other tuffcraters which i examined in having the lower part of its cavity to the height of between one hundred and one hundred and fifty feet formed by a precipitous wall of basalt giving to the crater the appearance of having burst through a solid sheet of rock the upper part of this crater consists of strata of the altered tuff with a semiresinous fracture its bottom is occupied by a shallow lake of brine covering layers of salt which rest on deep black mud the other crater lies at the distance of a few miles and is only remarkable from its size and perfect condition its summit is 1200 feet above the level of the sea and the interior hollow is 600 feet deep its external sloping surface presented a curious appearance from the smoothness of the wide layers of tuff which resembled a vast plastered floor brattle island is i believe the largest crater in the archipelago composed of tuff its interior diameter is nearly a nautical mile at present it is in a ruined condition consisting of little more than half a circle open to the south its great size is probably due in part to internal degradation from the action of the sea  segment of a basaltic crater  figure 14 segment of a very small orifice of eruption on the beach of freshwater bay  one side of freshwater bay in james island is bounded by a promontory which forms the last wreck of a great crater on the beach of this promontory a quadrantshaped segment of a small subordinate point of eruption stands exposed it consists of nine separate little streams of lava piled upon each other and of an irregular pinnacle about fifteen feet high of reddishbrown vesicular basalt abounding with large crystals of glassy albite and with fused augite this pinnacle and some adjoining paps of rock on the beach represent the axis of the crater the streams of lava can be followed up a little ravine at right angles to the coast for between ten and fifteen yards where they are hidden by detritus along the beach they are visible for nearly eighty yards and i do not believe that they extend much further the three lower streams are united to the pinnacle and at the point of junction as shown in figure 14 a rude sketch made on the spot they are slightly arched as if in the act of flowing over the lip of the crater the six upper streams no doubt were originally united to this same column before it was worn down by the sea the lava of these streams is of similar composition with that of the pinnacle excepting that the crystals of albite appear to be more comminuted and the grains of fused augite are absent each stream is separated from the one above it by a few inches or at most by one or two feet in thickness of loose fragmentary scoriae apparently derived from the abrasion of the streams in passing over each other all these streams are very remarkable from their thinness i carefully measured several of them one was eight inches thick but was firmly coated with three inches above and three inches below of red scoriaceous rock which is the case with all the streams making altogether a thickness of fourteen inches this thickness was preserved quite uniformly along the entire length of the section a second stream was only eight inches thick including both the upper and lower scoriaceous surfaces until examining this section i had not thought it possible that lava could have flowed in such uniformly thin sheets over a surface far from smooth these little streams closely resemble in composition that great deluge of lava at albemarle island which likewise must have possessed a high degree of fluidity  pseudoextraneous ejected fragments  in the lava and in the scoriae of this little crater i found several fragments which from their angular form their granular structure their freedom from aircells their brittle and burnt condition closely resembled those fragments of primary rocks which are occasionally ejected as at ascension from volcanoes these fragments consist of glassy albite much mackled and with very imperfect cleavages mingled with semirounded grains having tarnished glossy surfaces of a steelblue mineral the crystals of albite are coated by a red oxide of iron appearing like a residual substance and their cleavageplanes also are sometimes separated by excessively fine layers of this oxide giving to the crystals the appearance of being ruled like a glass micrometer there was no quartz the steelblue mineral which is abundant in the pinnacle but which disappears in the streams derived from the pinnacle has a fused appearance and rarely presents even a trace of cleavage i obtained however one measurement which proved that it was augite and in one other fragment which differed from the others in being slightly cellular and in gradually blending into the surrounding matrix the small grains of this mineral were tolerably well crystallised although there is so wide a difference in appearance between the lava of the little streams and especially of their red scoriaceous crusts and one of these angular ejected fragments which at first sight might readily be mistaken for syenite yet i believe that the lava has originated from the melting and movement of a mass of rock of absolutely similar composition with the fragments besides the specimen above alluded to in which we see a fragment becoming slightly cellular and blending into the surrounding matrix some of the grains of the steelblue augite also have their surfaces becoming very finely vesicular and passing into the nature of the surrounding paste other grains are throughout in an intermediate condition the paste seems to consist of the augite more perfectly fused or more probably merely disturbed in its softened state by the movement of the mass and mingled with the oxide of iron and with finely comminuted glassy albite hence probably it is that the fused albite which is abundant in the pinnacle disappears in the streams the albite is in exactly the same state with the exception of most of the crystals being smaller in the lava and in the embedded fragments but in the fragments they appear to be less abundant this however would naturally happen from the intumescence of the augitic base and its consequent apparent increase in bulk it is interesting thus to trace the steps by which a compact granular rock becomes converted into a vesicular pseudoporphyritic lava and finally into red scoriae the structure and composition of the embedded fragments show that they are parts either of a mass of primary rock which has undergone considerable change from volcanic action or more probably of the crust of a body of cooled and crystallised lava which has afterwards been broken up and reliquified the crust being less acted on by the renewed heat and movement  concluding remarks on the tuffcraters  these craters from the peculiarity of the resinlike substance which enters largely into their composition from their structure their size and number present the most striking feature in the geology of this archipelago the majority of them form either separate islets or promontories attached to the larger islands and those which now stand at some little distance from the coast are worn and breached as if by the action of the sea from this general circumstance of their position and from the small quantity of ejected ashes in any part of the archipelago i am led to conclude that the tuff has been chiefly produced by the grinding together of fragments of lava within active craters communicating with the sea in the origin and composition of the tuff and in the frequent presence of a central lake of brine and of layers of salt these craters resemble though on a gigantic scale the salses or hillocks of mud which are common in some parts of italy and in other countries daubuisson traite de geognosie tome 1 page 189 i may remark that i saw at terceira in the azores a crater of tuff or peperino very similar to these of the galapagos archipelago from the description given in freycinet voyage similar ones occur at the sandwich islands and probably they are present in many other places their closer connection however in this archipelago with ordinary volcanic action is shown by the pools of solidified basalt with which they are sometimes filled up   it at first appears very singular that all the craters formed of tuff have their southern sides either quite broken down and wholly removed or much lower than the other sides i saw and received accounts of twentyeight of these craters of these twelve form separate islets these consist of the three crossman islets the largest of which is 600 feet in height enchanted island gardner island 760 feet high champion island 331 feet high enderby island brattle island two islets near indefatigable island and one near james island a second crater near james island with a salt lake in its centre has its southern side only about twenty feet high whilst the other parts of the circumference are about three hundred feet in height and now exist as mere crescents quite open to the south with occasionally a few points of rock marking their former circumference of the remaining sixteen some form promontories and others stand at a little distance inland from the shore but all have their southern sides either the lowest or quite broken down two however of the sixteen had their northern sides also low whilst their eastern and western sides were perfect i did not see or hear of a single exception to the rule of these craters being broken down or low on the side which faces a point of the horizon between se and sw this rule does not apply to craters composed of lava and scoriae the explanation is simple at this archipelago the waves from the tradewind and the swell propagated from the distant parts of the open ocean coincide in direction which is not the case in many parts of the pacific and with their united forces attack the southern sides of all the islands and consequently the southern slope even when entirely formed of hard basaltic rock is invariably steeper than the northern slope as the tuffcraters are composed of a soft material and as probably all or nearly all have at some period stood immersed in the sea we need not wonder that they should invariably exhibit on their exposed sides the effects of this great denuding power judging from the worn condition of many of these craters it is probable that some have been entirely washed away as there is no reason to suppose that the craters formed of scoriae and lava were erupted whilst standing in the sea we can see why the rule does not apply to them at ascension it was shown that the mouths of the craters which are there all of terrestrial origin have been affected by the tradewind and this same power might here also aid in making the windward and exposed sides of some of the craters originally the lowest  mineralogical composition of the rocks  in the northern islands the basaltic lavas seem generally to contain more albite than they do in the southern half of the archipelago but almost all the streams contain some the albite is not unfrequently associated with olivine i did not observe in any specimen distinguishable crystals of hornblende or augite i except the fused grains in the ejected fragments and in the pinnacle of the little crater above described i did not meet with a single specimen of true trachyte though some of the paler lavas when abounding with large crystals of the harsh and glassy albite resemble in some degree this rock but in every case the basis fuses into a black enamel beds of ashes and farejected scoriae as previously stated are almost absent nor did i see a fragment of obsidian or of pumice von buch believes that the absence of pumice on mount etna is consequent on the feldspar being of the labrador variety description des isles canaries page 328 if the presence of pumice depends on the constitution of the feldspar it is remarkable that it should be absent in this archipelago and abundant in the cordillera of south america in both of which regions the feldspar is of the albitic variety owing to the absence of ashes and the general indecomposable character of the lava in this archipelago the islands are slowly clothed with a poor vegetation and the scenery has a desolate and frightful aspect  elevation of the land  proofs of the rising of the land are scanty and imperfect at chatham island i noticed some great blocks of lava cemented by calcareous matter containing recent shells but they occurred at the height of only a few feet above highwater mark one of the officers gave me some fragments of shells which he found embedded several hundred feet above the sea in the tuff of two craters distant from each other it is possible that these fragments may have been carried up to their present height in an eruption of mud but as in one instance they were associated with broken oyster shells almost forming a layer it is more probable that the tuff was uplifted with the shells in mass the specimens are so imperfect that they can be recognised only as belonging to recent marine genera on charles island i observed a line of great rounded blocks piled on the summit of a vertical cliff at the height of fifteen feet above the line where the sea now acts during the heaviest gales this appeared at first good evidence in favour of the elevation of the land but it was quite deceptive for i afterwards saw on an adjoining part of this same coast and heard from eye witnesses that wherever a recent stream of lava forms a smooth inclined plane entering the sea the waves during gales have the power of rolling up rounded blocks to a great height above the line of their ordinary action as the little cliff in the foregoing case is formed by a stream of lava which before being worn back must have entered the sea with a gently sloping surface it is possible or rather it is probable that the rounded boulders now lying on its summit are merely the remnants of those which had been rolled up during storms to their present height  direction of the fissures of eruption  the volcanic orifices in this group cannot be considered as indiscriminately scattered three great craters on albermarle island form a wellmarked line extending nw by n and se by s narborough island and the great crater on the rectangular projection of albemarle island form a second parallel line to the east hoods island and the islands and rocks between it and james island form another nearly parallel line which when prolonged includes culpepper and wenman islands lying seventy miles to the north the other islands lying further eastward form a less regular fourth line several of these islands and the vents on albemarle island are so placed that they likewise fall on a set of rudely parallel lines intersecting the former lines at right angles so that the principal craters appear to lie on the points where two sets of fissures cross each other the islands themselves with the exception of albemarle island are not elongated in the same direction with the lines on which they stand the direction of these islands is nearly the same with that which prevails in so remarkable a manner in the numerous archipelagoes of the great pacific ocean finally i may remark that amongst the galapagos islands there is no one dominant vent much higher than all the others as may be observed in many volcanic archipelagoes the highest is the great mound on the south western extremity of albemarle island which exceeds by barely a thousand feet several other neighbouring craters   chapter vitrachyte and basaltdistribution of volcanic isles  the

volcanic islands bordering continents antiquity of volcanic islands and their elevation in mass eruptions on parallel lines of fissure within the same geological period  on the separation of the constituent minerals of lava according to their specific gravities  one side of freshwater bay in james island is formed by the wreck of a large crater mentioned in the last chapter of which the interior has been filled up by a pool of basalt about two hundred feet in thickness this basalt is of a grey colour and contains many crystals of glassy albite which become much more numerous in the lower scoriaceous part this is contrary to what might have been expected for if the crystals had been originally disseminated in equal numbers the greater intumescence of this lower scoriaceous part would have made them appear fewer in number von buch has described a stream of obsidian on the peak of teneriffe in which the crystals of feldspar become more and more numerous as the depth or thickness increases so that near the lower surface of the stream the lava even resembles a primary rock description des isles canaries pages 190 and 191 von buch further states that m dree in his experiments in melting lava found that the crystals of feldspar always tended to precipitate themselves to the bottom of the crucible in these cases i presume there can be no doubt that the crystals sink from their weight in a mass of molten iron it is found edinburgh new philosophical journal volume 24 page 66 that the substances which have a closer affinity for oxygen than iron has rise from the interior of the mass to the surface but a similar cause can hardly apply to the separation of the crystals of these lavastreams the cooling of the surface of lava seems in some cases to have affected its composition for dufrenoy mem pour servir tome 4 page 271 found that the interior parts of a stream near naples contained twothirds of a mineral which was acted on by acids whilst the surface consisted chiefly of a mineral unattackable by acids the specific gravity of feldspar varies from 24 to 258 whilst obsidian seems commonly to be from 23 to 24 and in a fluidified state its specific gravity would probably be less which would facilitate the sinking of the crystals of feldspar i have taken the specific gravities of the simple minerals from von kobell one of the latest and best authorities and of the rocks from various authorities obsidian according to phillips is 235 and jameson says it never exceeds 24 but a specimen from ascension weighed by myself was 242 at james island the crystals of albite though no doubt of less weight than the grey basalt in the parts where compact might easily be of greater specific gravity than the scoriaceous mass formed of melted lava and bubbles of heated gas  the sinking of crystals through a viscid substance like molten rock as is unequivocally shown to have been the case in the experiments of m dree is worthy of further consideration as throwing light on the separation of the trachytic and basaltic series of lavas mr p scrope has speculated on this subject but he does not seem to have been aware of any positive facts such as those above given and he has overlooked one very necessary element as it appears to me in the phenomenonnamely the existence of either the lighter or heavier mineral in globules or in crystals in a substance of imperfect fluidity like molten rock it is hardly credible that the separate infinitely small atoms whether of feldspar augite or of any other mineral would have power from their slightly different gravities to overcome the friction caused by their movement but if the atoms of any one of these minerals became whilst the others remained fluid united into crystals or granules it is easy to perceive that from the lessened friction their sinking or floating power would be greatly increased on the other hand if all the minerals became granulated at the same time it is scarcely possible from their mutual resistance that any separation could take place a valuable practical discovery illustrating the effect of the granulation of one element in a fluid mass in aiding its separation has lately been made when lead containing a small proportion of silver is constantly stirred whilst cooling it becomes granulated and the grains of imperfect crystals of nearly pure lead sink to the bottom leaving a residue of melted metal much richer in silver whereas if the mixture be left undisturbed although kept fluid for a length of time the two metals show no signs of separating a full and interesting account of this discovery by mr pattinson was read before the british association in september 1838 in some alloys according to turner chemistry page 210 the heaviest metal sinks and it appears that this takes place whilst both metals are fluid where there is a considerable difference in gravity as between iron and the slag formed during the fusion of the ore we need not be surprised at the atoms separating without either substance being granulated the sole use of the stirring seems to be the formation of detached granules the specific gravity of silver is 104 and of lead 1135 the granulated lead which sinks is never absolutely pure and the residual fluid metal contains when richest only 1119 part of silver as the difference in specific gravity caused by the different proportions of the two metals is so exceedingly small the separation is probably aided in a great degree by the difference in gravity between the lead when granular though still hot and when fluid  in a body of liquified volcanic rock left for some time without any violent disturbance we might expect in accordance with the above facts that if one of the constituent minerals became aggregated into crystals or granules or had been enveloped in this state from some previously existing mass such crystals or granules would rise or sink according to their specific gravity now we have plain evidence of crystals being embedded in many lavas whilst the paste or basis has continued fluid i need only refer as instances to the several great pseudoporphyritic streams at the galapagos islands and to the trachytic streams in many parts of the world in which we find crystals of feldspar bent and broken by the movement of the surrounding semifluid matter lavas are chiefly composed of three varieties of feldspar varying in specific gravity from 24 to 274 of hornblende and augite varying from 30 to 34 of olivine varying from 33 to 34 and lastly of oxides of iron with specific gravities from 48 to 52 hence crystals of feldspar enveloped in a mass of liquified but not highly vesicular lava would tend to rise to the upper parts and crystals or granules of the other minerals thus enveloped would tend to sink we ought not however to expect any perfect degree of separation in such viscid materials trachyte which consists chiefly of feldspar with some hornblende and oxide of iron has a specific gravity of about 245 whilst basalt composed chiefly of augite and feldspar often with much iron and olivine has a gravity of about 30 trachyte from java was found by von buch to be 247 from auvergne by de la beche it was 242 from ascension by myself it was 242 jameson and other authors give to basalt a specific gravity of 30 but specimens from auvergne were found by de la beche to be only 278 and from the giants causeway to be 291 accordingly we find that where both trachytic and basaltic streams have proceeded from the same orifice the trachytic streams have generally been first erupted owing as we must suppose to the molten lava of this series having accumulated in the upper parts of the volcanic focus this order of eruption has been observed by beudant scrope and by other authors three instances also have been given in this volume as the later eruptions however from most volcanic mountains burst through their basal parts owing to the increased height and weight of the internal column of molten rock we see why in most cases only the lower flanks of the central trachytic masses are enveloped by basaltic streams the separation of the ingredients of a mass of lava would perhaps sometimes take place within the body of a volcanic mountain if lofty and of great dimensions instead of within the underground focus in which case trachytic streams might be poured forth almost contemporaneously or at short recurrent intervals from its summit and basaltic streams from its base this seems to have taken place at teneriffe consult von buchs wellknown and admirable description physique of this island which might serve as a model of descriptive geology i need only further remark that from violent disturbances the separation of the two series even under otherwise favourable conditions would naturally often be prevented and likewise their usual order of eruption be inverted from the high degree of fluidity of most basaltic lavas these perhaps alone would in many cases reach the surface  as we have seen that crystals of feldspar in the instance described by von buch sink in obsidian in accordance with their known greater specific gravity we might expect to find in every trachytic district where obsidian has flowed as lava that it had proceeded from the upper or highest orifices this according to von buch holds good in a remarkable manner both at the lipari islands and on the peak of teneriffe at this latter place obsidian has never flowed from a less height than 9200 feet obsidian also appears to have been erupted from the loftiest peaks of the peruvian cordillera i will only further observe that the specific gravity of quartz varies from 26 to 28 and therefore that when present in a volcanic focus it would not tend to sink with the basaltic bases and this perhaps explains the frequent presence and the abundance of this mineral in the lavas of the trachytic series as observed in previous parts of this volume  an objection to the foregoing theory will perhaps be drawn from the plutonic rocks not being separated into two evidently distinct series of different specific gravities although like the volcanic they have been liquified in answer it may first be remarked that we have no evidence of the atoms of any one of the constituent minerals in the plutonic series having been aggregated whilst the others remained fluid which we have endeavoured to show is an almost necessary condition of their separation on the contrary the crystals have generally impressed each other with their forms the crystalline paste of phonolite is frequently penetrated by long needles of hornblende from which it appears that the hornblende though the more fusible mineral has crystallised before or at the same time with a more refractory substance phonolite as far as my observations serve in every instance appears to be an injected rock like those of the plutonic series hence probably like these latter it has generally been cooled without repeated and violent disturbances those geologists who have doubted whether granite could have been formed by igneous liquefaction because minerals of different degrees of fusibility impress each other with their forms could not have been aware of the fact of crystallised hornblende penetrating phonolite a rock undoubtedly of igneous origin the viscidity which it is now known that both feldspar and quartz retain at a temperature much below their points of fusion easily explains their mutual impressment consult on this subject mr horners paper on bonn geolog transact volume 4 page 439 and linstitut with respect to quartz 1839 page 161  in the second place the perfect tranquillity under which it is probable that the plutonic masses buried at profound depths have cooled would most likely be highly unfavourable to the separation of their constituent minerals for if the attractive force which during the progressive cooling draws together the molecules of the different minerals has power sufficient to keep them together the friction between such halfformed crystals or pasty globules would effectually prevent the heavier ones from sinking or the lighter ones from rising on the other hand a small amount of disturbance which would probably occur in most volcanic foci and which we have seen does not prevent the separation of granules of lead from a mixture of molten lead and silver or crystals of feldspar from streams of lava by breaking and dissolving the less perfectly formed globules would permit the more perfect and therefore unbroken crystals to sink or rise according to their specific gravity  although in plutonic rocks two distinct species corresponding to the trachytic and basaltic series do not exist i much suspect that a certain amount of separation of their constituent parts has often taken place i suspect this from having observed how frequently dikes of greenstone and basalt intersect widely extended formations of granite and the allied metamorphic rocks i have never examined a district in an extensive granitic region without discovering dikes i may instance the numerous trapdikes in several districts of brazil chile and australia and at the cape of good hope many dikes likewise occur in the great granitic tracts of india in the north of europe and in other countries whence then has the greenstone and basalt forming these dikes come are we to suppose like some of the elder geologists that a zone of trap is uniformly spread out beneath the granitic series which composes as far as we know the foundations of the earths crust is it not more probable that these dikes have been formed by fissures penetrating into partially cooled rocks of the granitic and metamorphic series and by their more fluid parts consisting chiefly of hornblende oozing out and being sucked into such fissures at bahia in brazil in a district composed of gneiss and primitive greenstone i saw many dikes of a dark augitic for one crystal certainly was of this mineral or hornblendic rock which as several appearances clearly proved either had been formed before the surrounding mass had become solid or had together with it been afterwards thoroughly softened portions of these dikes have been broken off and are now surrounded by the primary rocks with their laminae conformably winding round them dr hubbard also sillimans journal volume 34 page 119 has described an interlacement of trapveins in the granite of the white mountains which he thinks must have been formed when both rocks were soft on both sides of one of these dikes the gneiss was penetrated to the distance of several yards by numerous curvilinear threads or streaks of dark matter which resembled in form clouds of the class called cirrhi comae some few of these threads could be traced to their junction with the dike when examining them i doubted whether such hairlike and curvilinear veins could have been injected and i now suspect that instead of having been injected from the dike they were its feeders if the foregoing views of the origin of trapdikes in widely extended granitic regions far from rocks of any other formation be admitted as probable we may further admit in the case of a great body of plutonic rock being impelled by repeated movements into the axis of a mountainchain that its more liquid constituent parts might drain into deep and unseen abysses afterwards perhaps to be brought to the surface under the form either of injected masses of greenstone and augitic porphyry or of basaltic eruptions mr phillips lardners encyclop volume 2 page 115 quotes von buchs statement that augitic porphyry ranges parallel to and is found constantly at the base of great chains of mountains humboldt also has remarked the frequent occurrence of traprock in a similar position of which fact i have observed many examples at the foot of the chilian cordillera the existence of granite in the axes of great mountain chains is always probable and i am tempted to suppose that the laterally injected masses of augitic porphyry and of trap bear nearly the same relation to the granitic axes which basaltic lavas bear to the central trachytic masses round the flanks of which they have so frequently been erupted much of the difficulty which geologists have experienced when they have compared the composition of volcanic with plutonic formations will i think be removed if we may believe that most plutonic masses have been to a certain extent drained of those comparatively weighty and easily liquified elements which compose the trappean and basaltic series of rocks  on the distribution of volcanic islands  during my investigations on coralreefs i had occasion to consult the works of many voyagers and i was invariably struck with the fact that with rare exceptions the innumerable islands scattered throughout the pacific indian and atlantic oceans were composed either of volcanic or of modern coralrocks it would be tedious to give a long catalogue of all the volcanic islands but the exceptions which i have found are easily enumerated in the atlantic we have st pauls rock described in this volume and the falkland islands composed of quartz and clayslate but these latter islands are of considerable size and lie not very far from the south american coast judging from forsters imperfect observation perhaps georgia is not volcanic dr allan is my informant with regard to the seychelles i do not know of what formation rodriguez in the indian ocean is composed in the indian ocean the seychelles situated in a line prolonged from madagascar consist of granite and quartz in the pacific ocean new caledonia an island of large size belongs as far as is known to the primary class new zealand which contains much volcanic rock and some active volcanoes from its size cannot be classed with the small islands which we are now considering the presence of a small quantity of nonvolcanic rock as of clayslate on three of the azores this is stated on the authority of count v de bedemar with respect to flores and graciosa charlsworth magazine of nat hist volume 1 page 557 st maria has no volcanic rock according to captain boyd von buch descript page 365 chatham island has been described by dr dieffenbach in the geographical journal 1841 page 201 as yet we have received only imperfect notices on kerguelen land from the antarctic expedition or of tertiary limestone at madeira or of clayslate at chatham island in the pacific or of lignite at kerguelen land ought not to exclude such islands or archipelagoes if formed chiefly of erupted matter from the volcanic class  the composition of the numerous islands scattered through the great oceans being with such rare exceptions volcanic is evidently an extension of that law and the effect of those same causes whether chemical or mechanical from which it results that a vast majority of the volcanoes now in action stand either as islands in the sea or near its shores this fact of the oceanislands being so generally volcanic is also interesting in relation to the nature of the mountainchains on our continents which are comparatively seldom volcanic and yet we are led to suppose that where our continents now stand an ocean once extended do volcanic eruptions we may ask reach the surface more readily through fissures formed during the first stages of the conversion of the bed of the ocean into a tract of land  looking at the charts of the numerous volcanic archipelagoes we see that the islands are generally arranged either in single double or triple rows in lines which are frequently curved in a slight degree professors william and henry darwin rogers have lately insisted much in a memoir read before the american association on the regularly curved lines of elevation in parts of the appalachian range each separate island is either rounded or more generally elongated in the same direction with the group in which it stands but sometimes transversely to it some of the groups which are not much elongated present little symmetry in their forms m virlet bulletin de la soc geolog tome 3 page 110 states that this is the case with the grecian archipelago in such groups i suspect for i am aware how easy it is to deceive oneself on these points that the vents are generally arranged on one line or on a set of short parallel lines intersecting at nearly right angles another line or set of lines the galapagos archipelago offers an example of this structure for most of the islands and the chief orifices on the largest island are so grouped as to fall on a set of lines ranging about nw by n and on another set ranging about wsw in the canary archipelago we have a simpler structure of the same kind in the cape de verde group which appears to be the least symmetrical of any oceanic volcanic archipelago a nw and se line formed by several islands if prolonged would intersect at right angles a curved line on which the remaining islands are placed  von buch description des isles canaries page 324 has classed all volcanoes under two heads namely central volcanoes round which numerous eruptions have taken place on all sides in a manner almost regular and volcanic chains in the examples given of the first class as far as position is concerned i can see no grounds for their being called central and the evidence of any difference in mineralogical nature between central volcanoes and volcanic chains appears slight no doubt some one island in most small volcanic archipelagoes is apt to be considerably higher than the others and in a similar manner whatever the cause may be that on the same island one vent is generally higher than all the others von buch does not include in his class of volcanic chains small archipelagoes in which the islands are admitted by him as at the azores to be arranged in lines but when viewing on a map of the world how perfect a series exists from a few volcanic islands placed in a row to a train of linear archipelagoes following each other in a straight line and so on to a great wall like the cordillera of america it is difficult to believe that there exists any essential difference between short and long volcanic chains von buch idem page 393 states that his volcanic chains surmount or are closely connected with mountainranges of primary formation but if trains of linear archipelagoes are in the course of time by the long continued action of the elevatory and volcanic forces converted into mountainranges it would naturally result that the inferior primary rocks would often be uplifted and brought into view  some authors have remarked that volcanic islands occur scattered though at very unequal distances along the shores of the great continents as if in some measure connected with them in the case of juan fernandez situated 330 miles from the coast of chile there was undoubtedly a connection between the volcanic forces acting under this island and under the continent as was shown during the earthquake of 1835 the islands moreover of some of the small volcanic groups which thus border continents are placed in lines related to those along which the adjoining shores of the continents trend i may instance the lines of intersection at the galapagos and at the cape de verde archipelagoes and the best marked line of the canary islands if these facts be not merely accidental we see that many scattered volcanic islands and small groups are related not only by proximity but in the direction of the fissures of eruption to the neighbouring continentsa relation which von buch considers characteristic of his great volcanic chains  in volcanic archipelagoes the orifices are seldom in activity on more than one island at a time and the greater eruptions usually recur only after long intervals observing the number of craters that are usually found on each island of a group and the vast amount of matter which has been erupted from them one is led to attribute a high antiquity even to those groups which appear like the galapagos to be of comparatively recent origin this conclusion accords with the prodigious amount of degradation by the slow action of the sea which their originally sloping coasts must have suffered when they are worn back as is so often the case into grand precipices we ought not however to suppose in hardly any instance that the whole body of matter forming a volcanic island has been erupted at the level on which it now stands the number of dikes which seem invariably to intersect the interior parts of every volcano show on the principles explained by m elie de beaumont that the whole mass has been uplifted and fissured a connection moreover between volcanic eruptions and contemporaneous elevations in mass has i think been shown to exist in my work on coralreefs both from the frequent presence of upraised organic remains and from the structure of the accompanying coralreefs a similar conclusion is forced on us by the phenomena which accompanied the earthquake of 1835 at concepcion and which are detailed in my paper volume 5 page 601 in the geological transactions finally i may remark that in the same archipelago eruptions have taken place within the historical period on more than one of the parallel lines of fissure thus at the galapagos archipelago eruptions have taken place from a vent on narborough island and from one on albemarle island which vents do not fall on the same line at the canary islands eruptions have taken place in teneriffe and lanzarote and at the azores on the three parallel lines of pico st jorge and terceira believing that a mountainaxis differs essentially from a volcano only in plutonic rocks having been injected instead of volcanic matter having been ejected this appears to me an interesting circumstance for we may infer from it as probable that in the elevation of a mountainchain two or more of the parallel lines forming it may be upraised and injected within the same geological period   chapter viiaustralia new zealand cape of good hope  new south wales sandstone formation embedded pseudofragments of shale stratification

observations to south america i will here briefly describe all that i observed at these places worthy of the attention of geologists  new south wales  my opportunities of observation consisted of a ride of ninety geographical miles to bathurst in a wnw direction from sydney the first thirty miles from the coast passes over a sandstone country broken up in many places by traprocks and separated by a bold escarpment overhanging the river nepean from the great sandstone platform of the blue mountains this upper platform is 1000 feet high at the edge of the escarpment and rises in a distance of twentyfive miles to between three and four thousand feet above the level of the sea at this distance the road descends to a country rather less elevated and composed in chief part of primary rocks there is much granite in one part passing into a red porphyry with octagonal crystals of quartz and intersected in some places by trapdikes near the downs of bathurst i passed over much palebrown glossy clayslate with the shattered laminae running north and south i mention this fact because captain king informs me that in the country a hundred miles southward near lake george the micaslate ranges so invariably north and south that the inhabitants take advantage of it in finding their way through the forests  the sandstone of the blue mountains is at least 1200 feet thick and in some parts is apparently of greater thickness it consists of small grains of quartz cemented by white earthy matter and it abounds with ferruginous veins the lower beds sometimes alternate with shales and coal at wolgan i found in carbonaceous shale leaves of the glossopteris brownii a fern which so frequently accompanies the coal of australia the sandstone contains pebbles of quartz and these generally increase in number and size seldom however exceeding an inch or two in diameter in the upper beds i observed a similar circumstance in the grand sandstone formation at the cape of good hope on the south american coast where tertiary and supra tertiary beds have been extensively elevated i repeatedly noticed that the uppermost beds were formed of coarser materials than the lower this appears to indicate that as the sea became shallower the force of the waves or currents increased on the lower platform however between the blue mountains and the coast i observed that the upper beds of the sandstone frequently passed into argillaceous shalethe effect probably of this lower space having been protected from strong currents during its elevation the sandstone of the blue mountains evidently having been of mechanical origin and not having suffered any metamorphic action i was surprised at observing that in some specimens nearly all the grains of quartz were so perfectly crystallised with brilliant facets that they evidently had not in their present form been aggregated in any previously existing rock i have lately seen in a paper by smith the father of english geologists in the magazine of natural history that the grains of quartz in the millstone grit of england are often crystallised sir david brewster in a paper read before the british association 1840 states that in old decomposed glass the silex and metals separate into concentric rings and that the silex regains its crystalline structure as is shown by its action on light it is difficult to imagine how these crystals could have been formed one can hardly believe that they were separately precipitated in their present crystallised state is it possible that rounded grains of quartz may have been acted on by a fluid corroding their surfaces and depositing on them fresh silica i may remark that in the sandstone formation of the cape of good hope it is evident that silica has been profusely deposited from aqueous solution  in several parts of the sandstone i noticed patches of shale which might at the first glance have been mistaken for extraneous fragments their horizontal laminae however being parallel with those of the sandstone showed that they were the remnants of thin continuous beds one such fragment probably the section of a long narrow strip seen in the face of a cliff was of greater vertical thickness than breadth which proves that this bed of shale must have been in some slight degree consolidated after having been deposited and before being worn away by the currents each patch of the shale shows also how slowly many of the successive layers of sandstone were deposited these pseudofragments of shale will perhaps explain in some cases the origin of apparently extraneous fragments in crystalline metamorphic rocks i mention this because i found near rio de janeiro a welldefined angular fragment seven yards long by two yards in breadth of gneiss containing garnets and mica in layers enclosed in the ordinary stratified porphyritic gneiss of the country the laminae of the fragment and of the surrounding matrix ran in exactly the same direction but they dipped at different angles i do not wish to affirm that this singular fragment a solitary case as far as i know was originally deposited in a layer like the shale in the blue mountains between the strata of the porphyritic gneiss before they were metamorphosed but there is sufficient analogy between the two cases to render such an explanation possible  stratification of the escarpment  the strata of the blue mountains appear to the eye horizontal but they probably have a similar inclination with the surface of the platform which slopes from the west towards the escarpment over the nepean at an angle of one degree or of one hundred feet in a mile this is stated on the authority of sir t mitchell in travels volume 2 page 357 the strata of the escarpment dip almost conformably with its steeply inclined face and with so much regularity that they appear as if thrown into their present position but on a more careful examination they are seen to thicken and to thin out and in the upper part to be succeeded and almost capped by horizontal beds these appearances render it probable that we here see an original escarpment not formed by the sea having eaten back into the strata but by the strata having originally extended only thus far those who have been in the habit of examining accurate charts of seacoasts where sediment is accumulating will be aware that the surfaces of the banks thus formed generally slope from the coast very gently towards a certain line in the offing beyond which the depth in most cases suddenly becomes great i may instance the great banks of sediment within the west indian archipelago i have described these very curious banks in the appendix to my volume on the structure of coralreefs i have ascertained the inclination of the edges of the banks from information given me by captain b allen one of the surveyors and by carefully measuring the horizontal distances between the last sounding on the bank and the first in the deep water widely extended banks in all parts of the west indies have the same general form of surface which terminate in submarine slopes inclined at angles of between thirty and forty degrees and sometimes even at more than forty degrees every one knows how steep such a slope would appear on the land banks of this nature if uplifted would probably have nearly the same external form as the platform of the blue mountains where it abruptly terminates over the nepean  currentcleavage  the strata of sandstone in the low coast country and likewise on the blue mountains are often divided by cross or current laminae which dip in different directions and frequently at an angle of fortyfive degrees most authors have attributed these cross layers to successive small accumulations on an inclined surface but from a careful examination in some parts of the new red sandstone of england i believe that such layers generally form parts of a series of curves like gigantic tidal ripples the tops of which have since been cut off either by nearly horizontal layers or by another set of great ripples the folds of which do not exactly coincide with those below them it is wellknown to surveyors that mud and sand are disturbed during storms at considerable depths at least from three hundred to four hundred and fifty feet see martin white on soundings in the british channel pages 4 and 166 so that the nature of the bottom even becomes temporarily changed the bottom also at a depth between sixty and seventy feet has been observed to be broadly rippled m siau on the action of waves edin new phil journ volume 31 page 245 one may therefore be allowed to suspect from the appearance just mentioned in the new red sandstone that at greater depths the bed of the ocean is heaped up during gales into great ripplelike furrows and depressions which are afterwards cut off by the currents during more tranquil weather and again furrowed during gales   valleys in the sandstone platforms  the grand valleys by which the blue mountains and the other sandstone platforms of this part of australia are penetrated and which long offered an insuperable obstacle to the attempts of the most enterprising colonist to reach the interior country form the most striking feature in the geology of new south wales they are of grand dimensions and are bordered by continuous links of lofty cliffs it is not easy to conceive a more magnificent spectacle than is presented to a person walking on the summit plains when without any notice he arrives at the brink of one of these cliffs which are so perpendicular that he can strike with a stone as i have tried the trees growing at the depth of between one thousand and one thousand five hundred feet below him on both hands he sees headland beyond headland of the receding line of cliff and on the opposite side of the valley often at the distance of several miles he beholds another line rising up to the same height with that on which he stands and formed of the same horizontal strata of pale sandstone the bottoms of these valleys are moderately level and the fall of the rivers flowing in them according to sir t mitchell is gentle the main valleys often send into the platform great baylike arms which expand at their upper ends and on the other hand the platform often sends promontories into the valley and even leaves in them great almost insulated masses so continuous are the bounding lines of cliff that to descend into some of these valleys it is necessary to go round twenty miles and into others the surveyors have only lately penetrated and the colonists have not yet been able to drive in their cattle but the most remarkable point of structure in these valleys is that although several miles wide in their upper parts they generally contract towards their mouths to such a degree as to become impassable the surveyorgeneral sir t mitchell in vain endeavoured first on foot and then by crawling between the great fallen fragments of sandstone to ascend through the gorge by which the river grose joins the nepean travels in australia volume 1 page 154i must express my obligation to sir t mitchell for several interesting personal communications on the subject of these great valleys of new south wales yet the valley of the grose in its upper part as i saw forms a magnificent basin some miles in width and is on all sides surrounded by cliffs the summits of which are believed to be nowhere less than 3000 feet above the level of the sea when cattle are driven into the valley of the wolgan by a path which i descended partly cut by the colonists they cannot escape for this valley is in every other part surrounded by perpendicular cliffs and eight miles lower down it contracts from an average width of half a mile to a mere chasm impassable to man or beast sir t mitchell states that the great valley of the cox river with all its branches contracts where it unites with the nepean into a gorge 2200 yards wide and about one thousand feet in depth idem volume 2 page 358 other similar cases might have been added  the first impression from seeing the correspondence of the horizontal strata on each side of these valleys and great amphitheatrelike depressions is that they have been in chief part hollowed out like other valleys by aqueous erosion but when one reflects on the enormous amount of stone which on this view must have been removed in most of the above cases through mere gorges or chasms one is led to ask whether these spaces may not have subsided but considering the form of the irregularly branching valleys and of the narrow promontories projecting into them from the platforms we are compelled to abandon this notion to attribute these hollows to alluvial action would be preposterous nor does the drainage from the summitlevel always fall as i remarked near the weatherboard into the head of these valleys but into one side of their baylike recesses some of the inhabitants remarked to me that they never viewed one of these baylike recesses with the headlands receding on both hands without being struck with their resemblance to a bold seacoast this is certainly the case moreover the numerous fine harbours with their widely branching arms on the present coast of new south wales which are generally connected with the sea by a narrow mouth from one mile to a quarter of a mile in width passing through the sandstone coastcliffs present a likeness though on a miniature scale to the great valleys of the interior but then immediately occurs the startling difficulty why has the sea worn out these great though circumscribed depressions on a wide platform and left mere gorges through which the whole vast amount of triturated matter must have been carried away the only light i can throw on this enigma is by showing that banks appear to be forming in some seas of the most irregular forms and that the sides of such banks are so steep as before stated that a comparatively small amount of subsequent erosion would form them into cliffs that the waves have power to form high and precipitous cliffs even in landlocked harbours i have observed in many parts of south america in the red sea banks with an extremely irregular outline and composed of sediment are penetrated by the most singularly shaped creeks with narrow mouths this is likewise the case though on a larger scale with the bahama banks such banks i have been led to suppose have been formed by currents heaping sediment on an irregular bottom see the appendix to the part on coralreefs the fact of the sea heaping up mud round a submarine nucleus is worthy of the notice of geologists for outlyers of the same composition with the coast banks are thus formed and these if upheaved and worn into cliffs would naturally be thought to have been once connected together that in some cases the sea instead of spreading out sediment in a uniform sheet heaps it round submarine rocks and islands it is hardly possible to doubt after having examined the charts of the west indies to apply these ideas to the sandstone platforms of new south wales i imagine that the strata might have been heaped on an irregular bottom by the action of strong currents and of the undulations of an open sea and that the valleylike spaces thus left unfilled might during a slow elevation of the land have had their steeply sloping flanks worn into cliffs the worndown sandstone being removed either at the time when the narrow gorges were cut by the retreating sea or subsequently by alluvial action  van diemens land  the southern part of this island is mainly formed of mountains of greenstone which often assumes a syenitic character and contains much hypersthene these mountains in their lower half are generally encased by strata containing numerous small corals and some shells these shells have been examined by mr gb sowerby and have been described by him they consist of two species of producta and of six of spirifera two of these namely p rugata and s rotundata resemble as far as their imperfect condition allows of comparison british mountainlimestone shells mr lonsdale has had the kindness to examine the corals they consist of six undescribed species belonging to three genera species of these genera occur in the silurian devonian and carboniferous strata of europe mr lonsdale remarks that all these fossils have undoubtedly a palaeozoic character and that probably they correspond in age to a division of the system above the silurian formations  the strata containing these remains are singular from the extreme variability of their mineralogical composition every intermediate form is present between flintyslate clayslate passing into grey wacke pure limestone sandstone and porcellanic rock and some of the beds can only be described as composed of a siliceocalcareoclayslate the formation as far as i could judge is at least a thousand feet in thickness the upper few hundred feet usually consist of a siliceous sandstone containing pebbles and no organic remains the inferior strata of which a pale flinty slate is perhaps the most abundant are the most variable and these chiefly abound with the remains between two beds of hard crystalline limestone near newtown a layer of white soft calcareous matter is quarried and is used for whitewashing houses from information given to me by mr frankland the surveyorgeneral it appears that this palaeozoic formation is found in different parts of the whole island from the same authority i may add that on the northeastern coast and in bass straits primary rocks extensively occur  the shores of storm bay are skirted to the height of a few hundred feet by strata of sandstone containing pebbles of the formation just described with its characteristic fossils and therefore belonging to a subsequent age these strata of sandstone often pass into shale and alternate with layers of impure coal they have in many places been violently disturbed near hobart town i observed one dike nearly a hundred yards in width on one side of which the strata were tilted at an angle of 60 degrees and on the other they were in some parts vertical and had been altered by the effects of the heat on the west side of storm bay i found these strata capped by streams of basaltic lava with olivine and close by there was a mass of brecciated scoriae containing pebbles of lava which probably marks the place of an ancient submarine crater two of these streams of basalt were separated from each other by a layer of argillaceous wacke which could be traced passing into partially altered scoriae the wacke contained numerous rounded grains of a soft grassgreen mineral with a waxy lustre and translucent on its edges under the blowpipe it instantly blackened and the points fused into a strongly magnetic black enamel in these characters it resembles those masses of decomposed olivine described at st jago in the cape de verde group and i should have thought that it had thus originated had i not found a similar substance in cylindrical threads within the cells of the vesicular basalta state under which olivine never appears this substance i believe would be classed as bole by mineralogists chlorophaeite described by dr macculloch western islands volume 1 page 504 as occurring in a basaltic amygdaloid differs from this substance in remaining unchanged before the blowpipe and in blackening from exposure to the air may we suppose that olivine in undergoing the remarkable change described at st jago passes through several states  travertin with extinct plants  behind hobart town there is a small quarry of a hard travertin the lower strata of which abound with distinct impressions of leaves mr robert brown has had the kindness to look at my specimens and he informed me that there are four or five kinds none of which he recognises as belonging to existing species the most remarkable leaf is palmate like that of a fan palm and no plant having leaves of this structure has hitherto been discovered in van diemens land the other leaves do not resemble the most usual form of the eucalyptus of which tribe the existing forests are chiefly composed nor do they resemble that class of exceptions to the common form of the leaves of the eucalyptus which occur in this island the travertin containing this remnant of a lost vegetation is of a pale yellow colour hard and in parts even crystalline but not compact and is everywhere penetrated by minute tortuous cylindrical pores it contains a very few pebbles of quartz and occasionally layers of chalcedonic nodules like those of chert in our greensand from the pureness of this calcareous rock it has been searched for in other places but has never been found from this circumstance and from the character of the deposit it was probably formed by a calcareous spring entering a small pool or narrow creek the strata have subsequently been tilted and fissured and the surface has been covered by a singular mass with which also a large fissure has been filled up formed of balls of trap embedded in a mixture of wacke and a white earthy aluminocalcareous substance hence it would appear as if a volcanic eruption had taken place on the borders of the pool in which the calcareous matter was depositing and had broken it up and drained it  elevation of the land  both the eastern and western shores of the bay in the neighbourhood of hobart town are in most parts covered to the height of thirty feet above the level of highwater mark with broken shells mingled with pebbles the colonists attribute these shells to the aborigines having carried them up for food undoubtedly there are many large mounds as was pointed out to me by mr frankland which have been thus formed but i think from the numbers of the shells from their frequent small size from the manner in which they are thinly scattered and from some appearances in the form of the land that we must attribute the presence of the greater number to a small elevation of the land on the shore of ralph bay opening into storm bay i observed a continuous beach about fifteen feet above highwater mark clothed with vegetation and by digging into it pebbles encrusted with serpulae were found along the banks also of the river derwent i found a bed of broken seashells above the surface of the river and at a point where the water is now much too fresh for seashells to live but in both these cases it is just possible that before certain spits of sand and banks of mud in storm bay were accumulated the tides might have risen to the height where we now find the shells  it would appear that some changes are now in progress in ralph bay for i was assured by an intelligent farmer that oysters were formerly abundant in it but that about the year 1834 they had without any apparent cause disappeared in the transactions of the maryland academy volume 1 part 1 page 28 there is an account by mr ducatel of vast beds of oysters and clams having been destroyed by the gradual filling up of the shallow lagoons and channels on the shores of the southern united states at chiloe in south america i heard of a similar loss sustained by the inhabitants in the disappearance from one part of the coast of an edible species of ascidia  evidence more or less distinct of a change of level between the land and water has been detected on almost all the land on this side of the globe captain grey and other travellers have found in southern australia upraised shells belonging either to the recent or to a late tertiary period the french naturalists in baudins expedition found shells similarly circumstanced on the sw coast of australia the rev wb clarke finds proofs of the elevation of the land to the amount of 400 feet at the cape of good hope proceedings of the geological society volume 3 page 420 in the neighbourhood of the bay of islands in new zealand i observed that the shores were scattered to some height as at van diemens land with seashells which the colonists attribute to the natives i will here give a catalogue of the rocks which i met with near the bay of islands in new zealand1st much basaltic lava and scoriform rocks forming distinct craters2nd a castellated hill of horizontal strata of fleshcoloured limestone showing when fractured distinct crystalline facets the rain has acted on this rock in a remarkable manner corroding its surface into a miniature model of an alpine country i observed here layers of chert and clay ironstone and in the bed of a stream pebbles of clayslate3rd the shores of the bay of islands are formed of a feldspathic rock of a bluishgrey colour often much decomposed with an angular fracture and crossed by numerous ferruginous seams but without any distinct stratification or cleavage some varieties are highly crystalline and would at once be pronounced to be trap others strikingly resembled clayslate slightly altered by heat i was unable to form any decided opinion on this formation whatever may have been the origin of these shells i cannot doubt after having seen a section of the valley of the thames river 37 degrees s drawn by the rev w williams that the land has been there elevated on the opposite sides of this great valley three steplike terraces composed of an enormous accumulation of rounded pebbles exactly correspond with each other the escarpment of each terrace is about fifty feet in height no one after having examined the terraces in the valleys on the western shores of south america which are strewed with seashells and have been formed during intervals of rest in the slow elevation of the land could doubt that the new zealand terraces have been similarly formed i may add that dr dieffenbach in his description of the chatham islands geographical journal volume 11 pages 202 205 sw of new zealand states that it is manifest that the sea has left many places bare which were once covered by its waters  king georges sound  this settlement is situated at the southwestern angle of the australian continent the whole country is granitic with the constituent minerals sometimes obscurely arranged in straight or curved laminae in these cases the rock would be called by humboldt gneissgranite and it is remarkable that the form of the bare conical hills appearing to be composed of great folding layers strikingly resembles on a small scale those composed of gneissgranite at rio de janeiro and those described by humboldt at venezuela these plutonic rocks are in many places intersected by trappeandikes in one place i found ten parallel dikes ranging in an e and w line and not far off another set of eight dikes composed of a different variety of trap ranging at right angles to the former ones i have observed in several primary districts the occurrence of systems of dikes parallel and close to each other  superficial ferruginous beds  the lower parts of the country are everywhere covered by a bed following the inequalities of the surface of a honeycombed sandstone abounding with oxides of iron beds of nearly similar composition are common i believe along the whole western coast of australia and on many of the east indian islands at the cape of good hope at the base of the mountains formed of granite and capped with sandstone the ground is everywhere coated either by a finegrained rubbly ochraceous mass like that at king georges sound or by a coarser sandstone with fragments of quartz and rendered hard and heavy by an abundance of the hydrate of iron which presents when freshly broken a metallic lustre both these varieties have a very irregular texture including spaces either rounded or angular full of loose sand from this cause the surface is always honeycombed the oxide of iron is most abundant on the edges of the cavities where alone it affords a metallic fracture in these formations as well as in many true sedimentary deposits it is evident that iron tends to become aggregated either in the form of a shell or of a network the origin of these superficial beds though sufficiently obscure seems to be due to alluvial action on detritus abounding with iron  superficial calcareous deposit  a calcareous deposit on the summit of bald head containing branched bodies supposed by some authors to have been corals has been celebrated by the descriptions of many distinguished voyagers i visited this hill in company with captain fitzroy and we came to a similar conclusion regarding these branching bodies it folds round and conceals irregular hummocks of granite at the height of 600 feet above the level of the sea it varies much in thickness where stratified the beds are often inclined at high angles even as much as at thirty degrees and they dip in all directions these beds are sometimes crossed by oblique and evensided laminae the deposit consists either of a fine white calcareous powder in which not a trace of structure can be discovered or of exceedingly minute rounded grains of brown yellowish and purplish colours both varieties being generally but not always mixed with small particles of quartz and being cemented into a more or less perfect stone the rounded calcareous grains when heated in a slight degree instantly lose their colours in this and in every other respect closely resembling those minute equal sized particles of shells and corals which at st helena have been drifted up the side of the mountains and have thus been winnowed of all coarser fragments i cannot doubt that the coloured calcareous particles here have had a similar origin the impalpable powder has probably been derived from the decay of the rounded particles this certainly is possible for on the coast of peru i have traced large unbroken shells gradually falling into a substance as fine as powdered chalk both of the abovementioned varieties of calcareous sandstone frequently alternate with and blend into thin layers of a hard substalagmitic rock which even when the stone on each side contains particles of quartz is entirely free from them i adopt this term from lieutenant nelsons excellent paper on the bermuda islands geolog trans volume 5 page 106 for the hard compact cream or brown coloured stone without any crystalline structure which so often accompanies superficial calcareous accumulations i have observed such superficial beds coated with substalagmitic rock at the cape of good hope in several parts of chile and over wide spaces in la plata and patagonia some of these beds have been formed from decayed shells but the origin of the greater number is sufficiently obscure the causes which determine water to dissolve lime and then soon to redeposit it are not i think known the surface of the substalagmitic layers appears always to be corroded by the rainwater as all the abovementioned countries have a long dry season compared with the rainy one i should have thought that the presence of the substalagmitic was connected with the climate had not lieutenant nelson found this substance forming under seawater disintegrated shell seems to be extremely soluble of which i found good evidence in a curious rock at coquimbo in chile which consisted of small pellucid empty husks cemented together a series of specimens clearly showed that these husks had originally contained small rounded particles of shells which had been enveloped and cemented together by calcareous matter as often happens on seabeaches and which subsequently had decayed and been dissolved by water that must have penetrated through the calcareous husks without corroding themof which processes every stage could be seen hence we must suppose that these layers as well as certain vein like masses have been formed by rain dissolving the calcareous matter and reprecipitating it as has happened at st helena each layer probably marks a fresh surface when the now firmly cemented particles existed as loose sand these layers are sometimes brecciated and recemented as if they had been broken by the slipping of the sand when soft i did not find a single fragment of a seashell but bleached shells of the helix melo an existing land species abound in all the strata and i likewise found another helix and the case of an oniscus  the branches are absolutely undistinguishable in shape from the broken and upright stumps of a thicket their roots are often uncovered and are seen to diverge on all sides here and there a branch lies prostrate the branches generally consist of the sandstone rather firmer than the surrounding matter with the central parts filled either with friable calcareous matter or with a substalagmitic variety this central part is also frequently penetrated by linear crevices sometimes though rarely containing a trace of woody matter these calcareous branching bodies appear to have been formed by fine calcareous matter being washed into the casts or cavities left by the decay of branches and roots of thickets buried under drifted sand the whole surface of the hill is now undergoing disintegration and hence the casts which are compact and hard are left projecting in calcareous sand at the cape of good hope i found the casts described by abel quite similar to these at bald head but their centres are often filled with black carbonaceous matter not yet removed it is not surprising that the woody matter should have been almost entirely removed from the casts on bald head for it is certain that many centuries must have elapsed since the thickets were buried at present owing to the form and height of the narrow promontory no sand is drifted up and the whole surface as i have remarked is wearing away we must therefore look back to a period when the land stood lower of which the french naturalists see m peron voyage tome 1 page 204 found evidence in upraised shells of recent species for the drifting on bald head of the calcareous and quartzose sand and the consequent embedment of the vegetable remains there was only one appearance which at first made me doubt concerning the origin of the castnamely that the finer roots from different stems sometimes became united together into upright plates or veins but when the manner is borne in mind in which fine roots often fill up cracks in hard earth and that these roots would decay and leave hollows as well as the stems there is no real difficulty in this case besides the calcareous branches from the cape of good hope i have seen casts of exactly the same forms from madeira and from bermuda at this latter place the surrounding calcareous rocks judging from the specimens collected by lieutenant nelson are likewise similar as is their subaerial formation reflecting on the stratification of the deposit on bald headon the irregularly alternating layers of substalagmitic rockon the uniformly sized and rounded particles apparently of seashells and coralson the abundance of landshells throughout the massand finally on the absolute resemblance of the calcareous casts to the stumps roots and branches of that kind of vegetation which would grow on sandhillocks i think there can be no reasonable doubt notwithstanding the different opinion of some authors that a true view of their origin has been here given  dr j macaulay has fully described edinb new phil journ volume 29 page 350 the casts from madeira he considers differently from mr smith of jordan hill these bodies to be corals and the calcareous deposit to be of subaqueous origin his arguments chiefly rest for his remarks on their structure are vague on the great quantity of the calcareous matter and on the casts containing animal matter as shown by their evolving ammonia had dr macaulay seen the enormous masses of rolled particles of shells and corals on the beach of ascension and especially on coralreefs and had he reflected on the effects of longcontinued gentle winds in drifting up the finer particles he would hardly have advanced the argument of quantity which is seldom trustworthy in geology if the calcareous matter has originated from disintegrated shells and corals the presence of animal matter is what might have been expected mr anderson analysed for dr macaulay part of a cast and he found it composed of carbonate of lime7315 silica1190 phosphate of lime881 animal matter425 sulphate of limea trace                        9811  calcareous deposits like these of king georges sound are of vast extent on the australian shores dr fitton remarks that recent calcareous breccia by which term all these deposits are included was found during baudins voyage over a space of no less than twentyfive degrees of latitude and an equal extent of longitude on the southern western and northwestern coasts for ample details on this formation consult dr fitton appendix to captain kings voyage dr fitton is inclined to attribute a concretionary origin to the branching bodies i may remark that i have seen in beds of sand in la plata cylindrical stems which no doubt thus originated but they differed much in appearance from these at bald head and the other places above specified it appears also from m peron with whose observations and opinions on the origin of the calcareous matter and branching casts mine entirely accord that the deposit is generally much more continuous than near king georges sound at swan river archdeacon scott states that in one part it extends ten miles inland proceedings of the geolog soc volume 1 page 320 captain wickham moreover informs me that during his late survey of the western coast the bottom of the sea wherever the vessel anchored was ascertained by crowbars being let down to consist of white calcareous matter hence it seems that along this coast as at bermuda and at keeling atoll submarine and subaerial deposits are contemporaneously in process of formation from the disintegration of marine organic bodies the extent of these deposits considering their origin is very striking and they can be compared in this respect only with the great coralreefs of the indian and pacific oceans in other parts of the world for instance in south america there are superficial calcareous deposits of great extent in which not a trace of organic structure is discoverable these observations would lead to the inquiry whether such deposits may not also have been formed from disintegrated shells and corals  cape of good hope  after the accounts given by barrow carmichael basil hall and wb clarke of the geology of this district i shall confine myself to a few observations on the junction of the three principal formations the fundamental rock is granite in several places i observed in the granite small darkcoloured balls composed of minute scales of black mica in a tough basis in another place i found crystals of black schorl radiating from a common centre dr andrew smith found in the interior parts of the country some beautiful specimens of granite with silvery mica radiating or rather branching like moss from central points at the geological society there are specimens of granite with crystallised feldspar branching and radiating in like manner overlaid by clayslate the latter is generally hard and glossy from containing minute scales of mica it alternates with and passes into beds of slightly crystalline feldspathic slaty rock this clayslate is remarkable from being in some places as on the lions rump decomposed even to the depth of twenty feet into a palecoloured sandstonelike rock which has been mistaken i believe by some observers for a separate formation i was guided by dr andrew smith to a fine junction at green point between the granite and clayslate the latter at the distance of a quarter of a mile from the spot where the granite appears on the beach though probably the granite is much nearer underground becomes slightly more compact and crystalline at a less distance some of the beds of clayslate are of a homogeneous texture and obscurely striped with different zones of colour whilst others are obscurely spotted within a hundred yards of the first vein of granite the clayslate consists of several varieties some compact with a tinge of purple others glistening with numerous minute scales of mica and imperfectly crystallised feldspar some obscurely granular others porphyritic with small elongated spots of a soft white mineral which being easily corroded gives to this variety a vesicular appearance close to the granite the clayslate is changed into a darkcoloured laminated rock having a granular fracture which is due to imperfect crystals of feldspar coated by minute brilliant scales of mica  the actual junction between the granitic and clayslate districts extends over a width of about two hundred yards and consists of irregular masses and of numerous dikes of granite entangled and surrounded by the clay slate most of the dikes range in a nw and se line parallel to the cleavage of the slate as we leave the junction thin beds and lastly mere films of the altered clayslate are seen quite isolated as if floating in the coarsely crystallised granite but although completely detached they all retain traces of the uniform nw and se cleavage this fact has been observed in other similar cases and has been advanced by some eminent geologists see m keilhau theory on granite translated in the edinburgh new philosophical journal volume 24 page 402 as a great difficulty on the ordinary theory of granite having been injected whilst liquified but if we reflect on the probable state of the lower surface of a laminated mass like clayslate after having been violently arched by a body of molten granite we may conclude that it would be full of fissures parallel to the planes of cleavage and that these would be filled with granite so that wherever the fissures were close to each other mere parting layers or wedges of the slate would depend into the granite should therefore the whole body of rock afterwards become worn down and denuded the lower ends of these dependent masses or wedges of slate would be left quite isolated in the granite yet they would retain their proper lines of cleavage from having been united whilst the granite was fluid with a continuous covering of clayslate  following in company with dr a smith the line of junction between the granite and the slate as it stretched inland in a se direction we came to a place where the slate was converted into a finegrained perfectly characterised gneiss composed of yellowbrown granular feldspar of abundant black brilliant mica and of few and thin laminae of quartz from the abundance of the mica in this gneiss compared with the small quantity and excessively minute scales in which it exists in the glossy clayslate we must conclude that it has been here formed by the metamorphic actiona circumstance doubted under nearly similar circumstances by some authors the laminae of the clayslate are straight and it was interesting to observe that as they assumed the character of gneiss they became undulatory with some of the smaller flexures angular like the laminae of many true metamorphic schists  sandstone formation  this formation makes the most imposing feature in the geology of southern africa the strata are in many parts horizontal and attain a thickness of about two thousand feet the sandstone varies in character it contains little earthy matter but is often stained with iron some of the beds are very finegrained and quite white others are as compact and homogeneous as quartz rock in some places i observed a breccia of quartz with the fragments almost dissolved in a siliceous paste broad veins of quartz often including large and perfect crystals are very numerous and it is evident in nearly all the strata that silica has been deposited from solution in remarkable quantity many of the varieties of quartzite appeared quite like metamorphic rocks but from the upper strata being as siliceous as the lower and from the undisturbed junctions with the granite which in many places can be examined i can hardly believe that these sandstonestrata have been exposed to heat the rev wb clarke however states to my surprise geolog proceedings volume 3 page 422 that the sandstone in some parts is penetrated by granitic dikes such dikes must belong to an epoch altogether subsequent to that when the molten granite acted on the clayslate on the lines of junction between these two great formations i found in several places the granite decayed to the depth of a few inches and succeeded either by a thin layer of ferruginous shale or by four or five inches in thickness of the recemented crystals of the granite on which the great pile of sandstone immediately rested  mr schomburgk has described geographical journal volume 10 page 246 a great sandstone formation in northern brazil resting on granite and resembling to a remarkable degree in composition and in the external form of the land this formation of the cape of good hope the sandstones of the great platforms of eastern australia which also rest on granite differ in containing more earthy and less siliceous matter no fossil remains have been discovered in these three vast deposits finally i may add that i did not see any boulders of fartransported rocks at the cape of good hope or on the eastern and western shores of australia or at van diemens land in the northern island of new zealand i noticed some large blocks of greenstone but whether their parent rock was far distant i
