96266296	nobodys man  by  e phillips oppenheim  1921        nobodys man  chapter i  andrew tallente stepped out of the quaint little train on to the flowerbedecked platform of this devonshire hamlet amongst the hills to receive a surprise so immeasurable that for a moment he could do nothing but gaze silently at the tall ungainly figure whose unpleasant smile betrayed the fact that this meeting was not altogether accidental so far as he was concerned  miller he exclaimed a little aimlessly  why not was the almost challenging reply you are not the only great statesman who needs to step off the treadmill now and then  there was a certain quiet contempt in tallentes uplifted eyebrows the contrast between the two men momentarily isolated on the little platform was striking and extreme tallente had the bearing the voice and the manner which were his by heritage education and natural culture miller who was the son of a postman in a small scotch town an exhibitioner so far as regards his education and a mimic where social gifts were concerned had all the aggressive bumptiousness of the successful man who has wit enough to perceive his shortcomings in his illchosen tourist clothes untidy collar and badly arranged tie he presented a contrast to his companion of which he seemed in a way bitterly conscious  you are staying near here tallente enquired civilly  over near lynton dartrey has a cottage there i came down yesterday  surely you were in hellesfield the day before yesterday  miller smiled illnaturedly  i was he admitted and i flatter myself that i was able to make the speech which settled your chances in that direction  tallente permitted a slight note of scorn to creep into his tone  it was not your eloquence he said or your arguments which brought failure upon me it was partly your lies and partly your tactics  an unwholesome flush rose in the others face  lies he repeated a little truculently  tallente looked him up and down the station master was approaching now the whistle had blown their conversation was at an end  i said lies tallente observed most advisedly the train was already on the move and the departing passenger was compelled to step hurriedly into a carriage tallente waited upon by the obsequious station master strolled across the line to where his car was waiting it was not until his arrival there that he realised that miller had offered him no explanation as to his presence on the platform of this tiny wayside station  did you notice the person with whom i was talking he asked the station master  a tall thin gentleman in knickerbockers yes sir the man replied  part of your description is correct tallente remarked drily do you know what he was doing here  been down to your house i believe sir he arrived by the early train this morning and asked the way to the manor  to my house tallente repeated incredulously  it was the manor he asked for sir the station master assured his questioner begging your pardon sir is it true that he was miller the socialist mp  true enough was the brief reply what of it  the man coughed as he deposited the dispatch box which he had been carrying on the seat of the waiting car  they think a lot of him down in these parts sir he observed a little apologetically  tallente made no answer to the station masters last speech and merely waved his hand a little mechanically as the car drove off his mind was already busy with the problem suggested by millers appearance in these parts for the first few minutes of his drive he was back again in the turmoil which he had left then with a little shrug of the shoulders he abandoned this new enigma its solution must be close at hand  arrived at the edge of the dusty white strip of road along which he had travelled over the moors from the station tallente leaned forward and watched the unfolding panorama below with a little start of surprise he had passed through acres of yellowing gorse of purple heather and mossy turf fragrant with the aromatic perfume of sunbaked herbiage in the distance the moorland reared itself into strange promontories outflung to the sea on his right a little farm with its cluster of outbuildings nestled in the bosom of the hills on either side the fields still stretched upward like patchwork to a clear sky but below down into the hollow blotting out all that might lie beneath was a curious sea of rolling white mist soft and fleecy yet impenetrable tallente who had seen very little of this newly chosen country home of his had the feeling as the car crept slowly downward of one about to plunge into a new life to penetrate into an unknown world a man of extraordinarily sensitive perceptions leading him often outside the political world in which he fought the battle of life he was conscious of a curious and grim premonition as the car crawling down the precipitous hillside approached and was enveloped in the grey shroud the world which a few moments before had seemed so wonderful the sunlight the distant view of the sea the perfumes of flowers and shrubs had all gone the car was crawling along a rough and stony road between hedges dripping with moisture and trees dimly seen like spectres at last about threequarters of the way down to the sea after an abrupt turn they entered a winding avenue and emerged on to a terrace the chauffeur who had felt the strain of the drive ran a little past the front door and pulled up in front of an uncurtained window tallente glanced in dazzled a little at first by the unexpected lamplight then he understood the premonition which had sat shivering in his heart during the long descent   the mist which had hung like a spectral curtain over the little demesne of martinhoe manor had almost entirely disappeared when at a few minutes before eight with all traces of his long journey obliterated andrew tallente stepped out on to the stoneflagged terrace and looked out across the little bay below the top of the red sandstone cliff opposite was still wreathed with mists but the sunlight lay upon the tennis lawn the flower gardens below and the rocks almost covered by the full swelling tide tall and looking slimmer than ever in his plain dinner garb there were some indications of an hour of strange and unexpected suffering in the tired face of the man who gazed out in somewhat dazed fashion at the little panorama which he had been looking forward so eagerly to seeing again throughout the long journey down from town he had felt an unusual and almost boyish enthusiasm for his coming holiday he had thought of his tennis racquet and fishing rods wondered about his golf clubs and his guns even the unexpected encounter with miller had done little more than leave an unpleasant taste in his mouth and then on his way down from up over as the natives called that little strip of moorland overhead he had vanished into the mist and had come out into another world  andrew so you are out here why did you not come to my room surely your train was very punctual  tallente remained for a moment tense and motionless then he turned around the woman who stood upon the threshold of the house framed with a little cascade of drooping roses sought for his eyes almost hungrily he realised how she must be feeling a dormant vein of cynicism parted his lips as he held her fingers for a moment his tone and his manner were quite natural  we were i believe unusually punctual he admitted what an extraordinary mist up over there was no sign of it at all  she shivered her eyes were still watching his face seeking for an answer to her unasked question blue eyes they were which had been beautiful in their day a little hard and anxious now she wore a white dress simple with the simplicity of supreme and expensive art a rope of pearls was her only ornament her hair was somewhat elaborately coiffured there was a touch of rouge upon her cheeks and the unscreened evening sunlight was scarcely kind to her rather wan features and carefully arranged complexion she still had her claims to beauty however tallente admitted that to himself as he stood there appraising her with a strange and almost impersonal regardhis wife of thirteen years she was beautiful notwithstanding the strained look of anxiety which at that moment disfigured her face the lurking fear which made her voice sound artificial the nervousness which every moment made fresh demands upon her selfrestraint  it came up from the sea she said one moment tony and i were sitting out under the trees to keep away from the sun and the next we were driven shivering indoors it was just like running into a fog bank in the middle of the atlantic on a hot summers day  i found the difference in temperature amazing he observed i too dropped from the sunshine into a strange chill  she tried to get rid of the subject  so you lost your seat she said i am very sorry tell me how it happened  he shrugged his shoulders  the democratic party made up their mind for some reason or other that i shouldnt sit the labour party generally were not thinking of running a candidate i was to have been returned unopposed in acknowledgment of my work on the nationalisation bill the democrats however ratted they put up a man at the last moment andwell you know the resulti lost  i dont understand english politics she confessed but i thought you were almost a labour man yourself  i am practically he replied i dont know even now what made them oppose me  what about the future  my plans are not wholly made  for the first time an old and passionate ambition prevailed against the thrall of the moment  one of the papers this morning she said eagerly suggested that you might be offered a peerage  i saw it he acknowledged it was in the sun i was once unfortunate enough to be on the committee of a club which blackballed the editor  her mouth hardened a little  but you havent forgotten your promise  bargain shall we call it he replied no i have not forgotten  tony says you could have a peerage whenever you liked  then i suppose it must be so just at present i am not prepared to write finis to my political career  the butler announced dinner tallente offered his arm and they passed through the homely little hall into the dining room beyond stella came to a sudden standstill as they crossed the threshold  why is the table laid for two only she demanded mr palliser is here  i was obliged to send tony awayon important business tallente intervened he left about an hour ago  once more the terror was upon her the fingers which gripped her napkin trembled her eyes filled with fierce enquiry were fixed upon her husbands as he took his place in leisurely fashion and glanced at the menu  obliged to send tony away she repeated i dont understand he told me that he had several days work here with you  something intervened he murmured  why didnt you wire she faltered almost under her breath he couldnt have had any time to get ready  andrew tallente looked at his wife across the bowl of floating flowers  ah he exclaimed i didnt think of that but in any case i did not make up my mind until i arrived that it was necessary for him to go  there was silence for a time an unsatisfactory and in some respects an unnatural silence tallente trifled with his hors doeuvres and was inquisitive about the sauce with which his fish was flavoured stella sent away her plate untouched but drank two glasses of champagne the light came back to her eyes she found courage again after all she was independent of this man independent even of his name she looked across the table at him appraisingly he was still sufficiently goodlooking lithe of frame and muscular with features wellcut although a little irregular in outline time however and anxious work were beginning to leave their marks his hair was grey at the sides there were deep lines in his face he seemed to her fancy to have shrunken a little during the last few years he had still the languid highbred voice which she had always admired so munch the same coolness of manner and quiet dignity he was a personable man but after all he was a failure his career so far as she could judge it was at an end she was a fool to imagine even for a moment that her whole future lay in his keeping  have you any plans she asked him presently another constituency  he smiled a little wearily for once he spoke quite naturally  the only plan i have formulated at present is to rest for a time he admitted  she drank another glass of champagne and felt almost confident she told him the small events of the sparsely populated neighbourhood spoke of the lack of water in the trout stream the improvement in the golf links the pheasants which a nearby landowner was turning down they were comparative newcomers and had seen as yet little of their neighbours  i was told she concluded that the great lady of the neighbourhood was to have called upon me this afternoon i waited in but she didnt come  and who is that he enquired  lady jane partington of woolhangera daughter of the duke of barminster woolhanger was left to her by an old aunt and they say that she never leaves the place  an elderly lady he asked merely with an intent of prolonging a harmless subject of conversation  on the contrary quite young his wife replied she seems to be a sort of bachelorspinster who lives out in that lonely place without a chaperon and rules the neighborhood you ought to make friends with her andrew they say that she is half a socialistby the by how long are we going to stay down here  we will discuss that presently he answered  the service of dinner came to its appointed end tallente drank one glass of port alone then he rose left the room by the french windows passed along the terrace and looked in at the drawingroom where stella was lingering over her coffee  will you walk with me as far as the lookout he invited your maid can bring you a cloak if you are likely to be cold  she responded a little ungraciously but appeared a few minutes later a filmy shawl of lace covering her bare shoulders she walked by his side to the end of the terrace along the curving walk through the plantation and by the sea wall to the flagged space where some seats and a table had been fixed four hundred feet below the sea was beating against jagged rocks the moon was late and it was almost dark she leaned over and he stood by her side  stella he said you asked me at dinner when we were leaving here you are leaving tomorrow morning by the twelvethirty train  what do you mean she demanded with a sudden sinking of the heart  please do not ask he replied you know and i know it is not my wish to make public the story of ourdisagreement  she was silent for several moments looking over into the black gulf below watching the swirl of the sea listening to its dull booming against the distant rocks the shriek of the backwarddragged pebbles an owl flew out from some secret place in the cliffs and wheeled across the bay she drew her shawl around her with a little shiver  so this is the end she answered  no doubt in my way he reflected i have been as great a disappointment to you as you to me you brought me your great wealth believing that i could use it towards securing just what you desired in the way of social position perhaps that might have come but for the war now i have become rather a failure  there was no necessity for you ever to have gone soldiering she reminded him a little hardly  as you say he acquiesced still i went and i do not regret it i might even remind you that i met with some success  pooh she scoffed what is the use of a few military distinctions what are an mc and a dso and a few french and belgian orders going to do for me you know i want other things they told me when i married you she went on warming with her own sense of injury that you were certain to be prime minister they told me that the coalition party couldnt do without you that you were the only effective link between them and labour you had only to play your cards properly and you could have pushed out horlock whenever you liked and now see what a mess you have made of things you have built up horlocks party for him he offers you an insignificant post in the cabinet and you cant even win your seat in parliament  your epitome of my later political career has its weak points but i dare say from your point of view you have every reason for complaint he observed since i have failed to procure for you the position you desire our parting will have a perfectly natural appearance your fortune is unimpairedyou cannot say that i have been extravagantand i assure you that i shall not regret my return to poverty  but you wont be able to live she said bluntly you havent any income at all  believe me he answered quietly you exaggerate my poverty in any case it is not your concern  you wouldnt  she paused she was a woman of not very keen perceptions but she realised that if she were to proceed with the offer which was half framed in her mind the man by her side with his to her outlook distorted sense of honour would become her enemy she shrugged her shoulders and turning towards him held out her hand  it is the end then she said well andrew i did my best according to my lights and i failed will you shake hands  he shook his head  i cannot stella let us agree to part here we know all there is to be known of one another and we shall be able to say goodby without regret  she drifted slowly away from him he watched her figure pass in and out among the trees she was unashamed perhaps relievedprobably he reflected as he watched her enter the house already making her plans for a more successful future he turned away and looked downwards the darkness seemed if possible to have become a little more intense the moaning of the sea more insistent little showers of white spray enlaced the sombre rocks the owl came back from his mysterious journey hovered for a moment over the cliff and entered his secret home behind him the lights in the house went out one by one suddenly he felt a grip upon his shoulder a hot breath upon his cheek it was stella returned dishevelled her lace scarf streaming behind her eyes lit with horror andrew she cried it came over mejust as i entered the house what have you done with anthony    chapter ii  tallentes first impressions of jane partington were that an exceedingly attractive but somewhat imperious young woman had surprised him in a most undignified position she had come cantering down the drive on a horse which by comparison with the exmoor ponies which every one rode in those parts had seemed gigantic and finding a difficulty in making her presence known had motioned to him with her whip he climbed down from the steps where he had been busy fastening up some roses removed a nail from his mouth and came towards her  how is it that i can make no one hear she asked do you know if mrs tallente is at home  tallente was in no hurry to reply he was busy taking in a variety of pleasant impressions notwithstanding the severely cut riding habit and the hard little hat he decided that he had never looked into a more attractively feminine face for some occult reason unconnected he was sure with the use of any skin food or face cream this young woman who had the reputation of living out of doors winter and summer had a complexion which notwithstanding its faint shade of tan would have passed muster for delicacy and clearness in any mayfair drawingroom her eyes were soft and brown her hair a darker shade of the same colour her mouth for all its firmness was soft and pleasantly curved her tone though a trifle imperative was kindly gracious and full of musical quality her figure was moderately slim but indistinguishable at that moment under her long coat she possessed a curious air of physical wellbeing the wellbeing of a woman who has found and is enjoying what she seeks in life  wont you tell me why i can make no one hear she repeated still goodnaturedly but frowning slightly at his silence  mrs tallente is in london he announced she has taken most of the establishment with her  the visitor fumbled in her side pocket and produced a diminutive ivory case she withdrew a card and handed it to tallente with a glance at his gloved hands  will you give this to the butler she begged tell him to tell his mistress that i was sorry not to find her at home  the butler tallente explained has gone for the milk he shall have the card immediately on his return  she looked at him for a moment and then smiled  do forgive me she said i believe you are mr tallente  he drew off his gloves and shook hands  how did you guess that he asked  from the illustrated papers of course she answered i have come to the conclusion that you must be a very vain man i have seen so many pictures of you lately  a matter of snapshots he replied for which as a rule the victim is not responsible you should abjure such a journalistic vice as picture papers  why she laughed they lead to such pleasant surprises i had been led to believe for instance by studying the daily mirror that you were quite an elderly person with a squint  i am becoming selfconscious he confessed wont you come in there is a boy somewhere about the premises who can look after your horse and i shall be able to give you some tea as soon as robert gets back with the milk  he cooeed to the boy who came up from one of the lower shelves of garden and she followed him into the hall he looked around him for a moment in some perplexity  i wonder whether you would mind coming into my study he suggested i am here quite alone for the present and it is the only room i use  she followed him down a long passage into a small apartment at the extreme end of the house  you are like me she said i keep most of my rooms shut up and live in my den a lonely person needs so much atmosphere  rather a pigsty isnt it he remarked sweeping a heap of books from a chair i am without a secretary just nowin fact he went on with a little burst of confidence engendered by her friendly attitude we are in a mess altogether  she laughed softly leaning back amongst the cushions of the chair and looking around the room her kindly eyes filled with interest  it is a most characteristic mess she declared i am sure an interviewer would give anything for this glimpse into your tastes and habits golf clubs all cleaned up and ready for action trout rod newlywaxed at the jointsyou must try my stream there is no water in yours tennis racquets in a very excellent pressi wonder whether youre too good for a single with me some day typewriterrather dusty i dont believe that you can use it  i cant he admitted i have been writing my letters by hand for the last two days  she sighed  men are helpless creatures fancy a great politician unable to write his own letters what has become of your secretary  tallente threw some books to the floor and seated himself in the vacant easychair  i shall begin to think he said a little querulously that you dont read the newspapers my secretary according to that portion of the press which guarantees to provide full value for the smallest copper coin has disappeared  really she exclaimed he or she  hethe honourable anthony palliser by name son of stobart palliser who was at eton with me  she nodded  i expect i know his mother what exactly do you mean by disappeared  tallente was looking out of the window a slight hardness had crept into his tone and manner he had the air of one reciting a story  the young man and i differed last tuesday night he said in the language of the novelists he walked out into the night and disappeared only an hour before dinner too nothing has been heard of him since  what a fatuous thing to do she remarked shall you have to get another secretary  presently he assented just for the moment i am rather enjoying doing nothing  she leaned back amongst the cushions of her chair and looked across at him with interest an interest which presently drifted into sympathy even the lightness of his tone could not mask the inwritten weariness of the man the tired droop of the mouth and the lacklustre eyes  do you know she said i have never been more intrigued than when i heard you were really coming down here last summer i was in scotlandin fact i have been away every time the manor has been open i am so anxious to know whether you like this part of the world  i like it so much he replied that i feel like settling here for the rest of my life  she shook her head  you will never be able to do that she said at least not for many years the country will need so much of your time but it is delightful to think that you may come here for your holidays  if you read the newspapers he remarked a little grimly you might not be so sure that the country is clamouring for my services  she waved away his speech with a little gesture of contempt  rubbish your defeat at hellesfield was a matter of political jobbery any one could see through that horlock ought never to have sent you there he ought to have found you a perfectly safe seat and of course he will have to do it  he shook his head  i am not so sure horlock resents my defeat almost as though it were a personal matter besides it is an age of young men lady jane  young men she scoffed but you are young  am i he answered a little sadly i am not feeling it just now besides there is something wrong about my enthusiasms they are becoming altogether too pastoral i am rather thinking of taking up the cultivation of roses and of making a terraced garden down to the sea do you know anything about gardening lady jane  of course i do she answered a little impatiently a very excellent hobby it is for women and dreamers and elderly men there is plenty of time for you to take up such a pursuit when you have finished your work  fifteen thousand intelligent voters have just done their best to tell me that it is already finished he sighed  she made a little grimace  am i going to be disappointed in you i wonder she asked i dont think so you surely wouldnt let a little affair like one election drive you out of public life it was so obvious that you were made the victim for horlocks growing unpopularity in the country havent you realised that yourselfor perhaps you dont care to talk about these things to an ignoramus such as i am  please dont believe that he begged hastily i think yours is really the commonsense view of the matter only he went on i have always represented amongst the coalitionists the moderate socialist the views of those men who recognise the power and force of the coming democracy and desire to have legislation attuned to it yet it was the democratic vote which upset me at hellesfield  that was entirely a matter of faction she persisted that horrible person miller was sent down there for some reason or other to make trouble i believe if the election had been delayed another week and you had been able to make two more speeches like you did at the corn exchange you would have got in  he looked at her in some surprise  that is exactly what i thought myself he agreed how on earth do you come to know all these things  i take an interest in your career she said smiling at him and i hate to see you so dejected without cause  he felt a little thrill at her words a queer new sense of companionship stirred in his pulses the bitterness of his suppressed disappointment was suddenly soothed there was something of the excitement of the discoverer too in these new sensations it seemed to him that he was finding something which had been choked out of his life and which was yet a real and natural part of it  you will make an awful nuisance of me if you dont mind he warned her if you encourage me like this you will develop the most juvenile of all failingsyou will make me want to talk about myself i am beginning to feel terribly egotistical already  she leaned a little towards him her mouth was soft with sweet and feminine tenderness her eyes warm with kindness  that is just what i hoped i might succeed in doing she declared i have been interested in your career ever since i had the faintest idea of what politics meant you could not give me a greater happiness than to talk to meabout yourself    chapter iii  very soon tea was brought in the homely service of the meal and roberts plain clothes seemed to demand some sort of explanation it was she who provided the opening  will your wife be long away she enquired  tallente looked at his guest thoughtfully she was pouring out tea from an ordinary brown earthenware pot with an air of complete absorption in her task the friendliness of her seemed somehow to warm the atmosphere of the room even as her sympathy had stolen into the frozen places of his life for the moment he ignored her question his eyes appraised her critically reminiscently there was something vaguely familiar in the frank sweetness of her tone and manner  i am going to make the most idiotically commonplace remark he said i cannot believe that this is the first time we have met  it isnt she replied helping herself to strawberry  are you in earnest he asked puzzled  do you mean that i have spoken to you  absolutely  not only that but you have made me a present  he searched the recesses of his memory in vain she smiled at his perplexity and began to count on her fingers  let me see she said exactly fourteen years ago you arrived in paris from london on a confidential mission to a certain person  to lord peters he exclaimed  she nodded  you had half an hour to spare after you had finished your business and you begged to see the young people maggie peters was always a friend of yours you came into the morningroom and i was there  you  yes i was at school in paris and i was spending my halfholiday with maggie  the little brown girl he murmured i never heard your name and when i sent the chocolates i had to send them to the young lady in brown of course i remember but your hair was down your back you had freckles and you were as silent as a mouse  you see how much better my memory is than yours she laughed  i am not so sure he objected you took me for the gardener just now  not when you came down the steps she protested and besides it is your own fault for wearing such atrociously old clothes  they shall be given away tomorrow he promised  i should think so she replied and you might part with the battered straw hat you were wearing at the same time  it shall be done he promised meekly  she became reminiscent  we were all so interested in you in those days lord peters told us after you were gone that some day you would be prime minister  i am afraid he sighed that i have disappointed most of my friends  you have disappointed no one she assured him firmly you will disappoint no one you are the one person in politics who has kept a steadfast course and if you have lost ground a little in the country and slipped out of peoples political appreciation during the last decade dont we all know why every one of your friendsand your wife of course she put in hastily must be proud that you have lost ground there isnt another man in the country who gave up a great political career to learn his drill in a cadet corps who actually served in the trenches through the most terrible battles of the war and came out of it a brigadiergeneral with all your distinctions  he felt his heart suddenly swell no one had ever spoken to him like this the newspapers had been complimentary for a day and had accepted the verdict of circumstances the next his wife had simply been the reflex of other peoples opinion and the trend of events  you make me feel he told her earnestly almost for the first time that after all it was worth while  the slight unsteadiness of his tone at first surprised then brought her almost to the point of confusion their eyes meta startled glance on her part merely to assure herself that he was in earnestand afterwards there was a moments embarrassment she accepted a cigarette and went back to her easychair  you did not answer the question i asked you a few minutes ago she reminded him when is your wife returning  the shadow was back on his face  lady jane he said if it were not that we are old friends dating from that box of chocolates remember i might have felt that i must make you some sort of a formal reply but as it is i shall tell you the truth my wife is not coming hack  not at all she exclaimed  to me never he answered we have separated  i am so very sorry she said after a moments startled silence i am afraid that i asked a tactless question but how could i know  there was nothing tactless about it he assured her it makes it much easier for me to tell you i married my wife thirteen years ago because i believed that her wealth would help me in my career she married me because she was an american with ambitions anxious to find a definite place in english society she has been disappointed in me other circumstances have now presented themselves i have discovered that my wifes affections are bestowed elsewhere to be perfectly honest the discovery was a relief to me  so that is why you are living down here like this she murmured  precisely the one thing for which i am grateful he went on is that i always refused to let my wife take a big country house i insisted upon an unpretentious place for the times when i could rest i think that i shall settle down here altogether i can just afford to live here if i shoot plenty of rabbits and if roberts rheumatism is not too bad for him to look after the vegetable garden  of course you are talking nonsense she pronounced a little curtly  why nonsense  you must go back to your work she insisted  keep this place for your holiday moments certainly but for the rest to talk of settling down here is simply wicked  what is my work he asked i tell you frankly that i do not know where i belong a very intelligent constituency stuffed up to the throat with schoolboard education has determined that it would prefer a representative who has changed his politics already four times i seem to be nobodys man horlock at heart is frightened of me because he is convinced that i am not sound and he has only tried to make use of me as a sop to democracy the whigs hate me like poison hate me even worse than horlock if i were in parliament i should not know which party to support i think i shall devote my time to roses  and between september and may  i shall hibernate and think about them  of course she said with the air of one humoring a child you are not in earnest you have just been through a very painful experience and you are suffering from it as for the rest you are talking nonsense  explain please he begged  you said just now that you did not know where your place was she continued you called yourself nobodys man why the most ignorant person who thinks about things could tell you where you belong even i could tell you  please do he invited  she rose to her feet  walk round the garden with me she begged brushing the cigarette ash from her skirt you know what a terrible outofdoor person i am this room seems to me close i want to smell the sea from one of those wonderful lookouts of yours  he walked with her along one of the lower paths deliberately avoiding the upper lookouts they came presently to a grassgrown pier she stood at the end her firm capable fingers clenching the stone wall her eyes looking seaward  i will tell you where you belong she said in your heart you must know it but you are suffering from that reaction which comes from failure to those people who are not used to failure you belong to the head of things you should hold up your right hand and the party you should lead should form itself about you no dont interrupt me she went on you and all of us know that the country is in a bad way she is feeling all the evils of a toogreat prosperity thrust upon her after a period of suffering you can see the dangers aheadi learnt them first from you in the pages of the reviews when after the war you foretold the exact position in which we find ourselves today industrial wealth means the building up of a new democracy the democracy already exists but it is unrepresented because those people who should form its bulwark and its strength are attached to various factions of what is called the labour party they dont know themselves yet no rienzi has arisen to hold up the lookingglass if some one does not teach them to find themselves there will be trouble mind i am only repeating what you have told others  it is all true he agreed  then cant you see she continued eagerly what party it is to which you ought to attach yourselfthe party which has broken up now into half a dozen factions they are all misnamed but that is no matter you should stand for parliament as a labour or a socialist candidate because you understand what the people want and what they ought to have you should draw up a new and final programme  you are a wonderful person he said with conviction but like all people who are clearsighted and who have imagination you are also a theorist i believe your idea is the true one but to stand for parliament as a labour member you have to belong to one of the acknowledged factions to be sure of any support at all an independent member can count his votes by the capful  that is the old system she pointed out firmly it is for you to introduce a new one if necessary you must stoop to political cunning you should make use of those very factions until you are strong enough to stand by yourself through their enmity amongst themselves one of them would come to your side anyway but i should like to see you discard all old parliamentary methods i should like to see you speak to the heart of the man who is going to record his vote  it is a slow matter to win votes in units he reminded her  but it is the real way she insisted voting by party and government by party will soon come to an end it must all that it needs is a strong man with a definite programme of his own to attack the whole principle  he looked away from the sea towards the woman by his side the wind was blowing in her face blowing back little strands of her tightly coiled hair blowing back her coat and skirt outlining her figure with soft and graceful distinction she was young healthy and splendid full of all the enthusiasm of her age he sighed a little bitterly  all that you say he reminded her should have been said to me by the little brown girl in paris years ago i am too old now for great tasks  she turned towards him with the pitying yet pleasant air of one who would correct a child  you are fortynine years old and three months she said  how on earth did you know that he demanded  she smiled  a valuable little red book called whos who you see it is no use your trying to pose as a methuselah for a politician you are a young man you have time and strength for the greatest of all tasks find some other excuse sir if you talk of laying down the sword and picking up the shuttle  he looked back seawards his eyes were following the flight of a seagull wheeling in the sunlight  i suppose you are right he acknowledged no man is too old for work  i beg your pardon sir  they turned abruptly around they had been so engrossed that they had not noticed the sound of footsteps robert a little out of breath was standing at attention there was a disturbed look in his face a tremor in his voice  i beg your pardon sir he repeated there issome one here to see you  some one tallente repeated impatiently  robert leaned a little forward the effort at lowering his voice only made his hoarse whisper sound more agitated  a police inspector sir from barnstaple is waiting in the study    chapter iv  mr inspector gillian of barnstaple had no idea of denying his profession he had travelled over in a specially hired motorcar and he was wearing his best uniform he rose to his feet at tallentes entrance and saluted a little ponderously  mr andrew tallente sir he enquired  tallente silently admitted his identity waved the inspector back to his seatthe one highbacked and uncomfortable chair in the roomand took an easychair himself  i have come over sir the man continued according to instructions received by telephone from scotland yard my business is to ask you a few questions concerning the disappearance of the honourable anthony palliser who was i am given to understand your secretary  dear me tallente exclaimed i had no idea that the young mans temporary absence from polite society would be turned into a melodramatic disappearance  the inspector took mental note of the levity in tallentes tone and disapproved  the honourable anthony palliser disappeared from here sir on tuesday night last the night of your return from london he said i have come to ask you certain questions with reference to that disappearance  go ahead tallente begged care to smoke a cigar  not whilst on duty thank you sir was the dignified reply  you will forgive my cigarette tallente observed lighting one now you can go ahead as fast as you like  question number one is this sir i wish to know whether mr pallisers abrupt departure from the manor was due to any disagreement with you  in a sense i suppose it was the other acknowledged i turned him out of the house  the inspector did not attempt to conceal his gratification he made a voluminous note in his pocketbook  am i to conclude then that there was a quarrel he enquired  i do not quarrel with people to whom i pay a salary tallente replied  when you say that you turned him out of the house that rather implies a quarrel doesnt it it might even implyblows  you can put your own construction upon it was the cool reply  had you any idea where the honourable anthony palliser was going to  i suggested the devil tallente confided blandly i expect he will get there some time i put up with him because i knew his father but he is not a young man to make a fuss about  the inspector was a little staggered  i am to conclude then he said that you were dissatisfied with his work as your secretary  absolutely was the firm reply you have no idea what a mess he was liable to make of things if he was left alone  the inspector coughed  mr tallente sir he said my instructions are to ask you to disclose the nature of your displeasure if any with the honourable mr anthony palliser in plain words scotland yard desires to know why he was turned away from his place at a moments notice  i suppose it is the duty of scotland yard to be inquisitive in cases of this sort tallente observed you can report to them the whole of the valuable information with which i have already furnished you and you can add that i absolutely refuse to give any information respecting theerdifference of opinion between the young man and myself  the inspector did not conceal his dissatisfaction  i shall ask you sir he said with dignity to reconsider that decision remember that it is the police who ask and in cases of this sort they have special privileges  as soon as any criminal case arises from anthony pallisers disappearance tallente pointed out you will be in a position to ask me questions from a different standpoint for the present i have given you just as much information as i feel inclined to shall we leave it at that  the inspector appeared to have become hard of hearing he did not attempt to rise from his chair  being your private secretary sir he said the honourable anthony palliser would no doubt have access to your private papers  naturally tallente conceded  there might be amongst them papers of importance papers whose possession by parties in the other camp of politics  stop tallente interrupted inspector gillan you are an astute man excuse me  he crossed the room and with a key which he took from a chain attached to his trouser button opened a small but powerful safe fitted into the wall he opened it confidently enough gazed inside and remained for a moment transfixed then he took up a few little packets of papers glanced them through and replaced them he still stood there dangling the key in his hard the inspector watched him curiously  anything missing sir he asked  tallente swung the door to and came back to his chair  yes he admitted  can i make a note of the nature of the loss sir the man asked moistening his pencil  a political paper of some personal consequence tallente replied its absence disquiets me it also confirms my belief that palliser is lying doggo for a time  a hint as to the contents of the missing paper would be very acceptable sir inspector gillian begged  tallente shook his head  for the present he decided i can only repeat what i said a few moments agoi have given you just as much information as i feel inclined to  the inspector rose to his feet  my report will not be wholly satisfactory to scotland yard sir he declared  my experience of the estimable body is that they take a lot of satisfying tallente replied will you take anything before you go inspector  nothing whatever thank you sir at the risk of annoying you i am bound to ask this question will you tell me whether anything in the nature of blows passed between you and the honourable anthony palliser previous to his leaving your house  i will not even satisfy your curiosity to that extent tallente answered  it will be my duty sir the inspector said ponderously to examine some of your servants  scotland yard can do that for themselves tallente observed my wife and the greater part of the domestic staff left here for london a week ago  the representative of the law saluted solemnly  i am sorry that you have not felt inclined to treat me with more confidence in this matter mr tallente he said  he took his leave then tallente heard him conversing for some time with robert and saw him in the garden interviewing the small boy afterwards he climbed into his car and drove away tallente opened his safe and once more let the little array of folded papers slip through his hands then he rang the bell for robert who presently appeared  the inspector has quite finished with you his master asked  robert was a portly man a little unhealthy in colour and a little short of breath he had been gassed in the war and his nerves were not what they had been it was obvious as he stood on the other side of the table that he was trembling  quite sir he was enquiring about mr palliser  his master nodded  i am afraid he will find it a little difficult to obtain any information round here he remarked there are certain things connected with that young man which may throw a new light upon his disappearance  indeed sir robert murmured  tallente glanced towards the safe  robert he confided i have been robbed  the man started a little  indeed sir he replied nothing very valuable i hope  i have been robbed of papers tallente said quietly which in the wrong hands might ruin me mr palliser had a key to that safe have you ever seen it open  never sir  when did mr palliser arrive here  on the evening train of the monday sir that you arrived by on the tuesday  tell me did he receive any visitors at all on the tuesday  there was a man came over from a house near lynton sir said his name was miller  have you any idea what he wanted  no certain idea sir robert replied doubtfully now i come to think of it though it seemed as though he had come to make mr palliser some sort of an offer after i had let him out he came back and said something to mr palliser about three thousand pounds and mr palliser said he would let him know i got the idea somehow or other that the transaction whatever it might have been was to be concluded on tuesday night  why didnt you tell me this before robert his master enquired  other things drove it out of my mind sir the man confessed i didnt look upon it as of much consequence i thought it was something to do with mr pallisers private affairs  tallente glanced at the safe  i saw this man miller at the station he said when i arrived  that would be on his way back from here sir robert acquiesced i gathered that he was coming back again after dinner in a car  did you hear a car at all that night  i rather fancied i did the man asserted i didnt take particular notice though  tallente frowned  i am very much afraid robert he said that wherever mr palliser is those papers are  robert shivered  very good sir he said in a low tone  any speculations as to that young mans whereabouts tallente continued thoughtfully must necessarily be a matter of pure guesswork but supposing robert he should have wandered in that mist the wrong wayturned to the left for instance outside this window instead of to the righthe might very easily have fallen over the cliff  the walk is very unsafe in the dark sir robert acquiesced looking down at the carpet  it was not my intention tallente remarked thoughtfully to kill the young man a brawl in front of the windows was impossible so i took him with me to the lookout i suppose he was tactless and i lost my temper i struck him on the chin and he went backwards through that piece of rotten paling you know robert  i know sir the man interrupted with a little moan please dont  tallente shrugged his shoulders  i took him at no disadvantage he said coolly he knew how to use the gloves and he was twenty years younger than i however there it is backwards he went all legs and arms and shrieks and with him went the papers he had stolenat twelve oclock tonight robert i must go down after him  its impossible sir its a sheer precipice for four hundred feet  nothing of the sort was the cool reply there are heaps of ledges and little clumps of pines and yews all that you will have to do is to pull up the rope when i am ready you can fasten it to a tree when i go down  its not worth it sir the man protested anxiously no one will ever find the body down there  send the boy home to stay with his parents tonight tallente continued your wife i suppose can be trusted  she is living up at the garage sir robert answered besides she is deaf ill tell her that i am sleeping in the house tonight as you are not very well and forgive me sirher ladyship left a message she hoped you would lunch with her tomorrow  tallente strolled out again in a few minutes curiously impatient of the restraint of walls and clambered up the precipitous field at the back of the manor far up the winding road which led back into the world a motorcar was crawling on its way up over he watched it through a pair of field glasses leaning back in the tonneau with folded arms as though solemnly digesting a problem was inspector gillian tallente closed the glasses with a little snap and smiled  the bucket type he murmured to himself very much the bucket type    chapter v  the moon that night seemed to be indulging in strange vagaries now dimly visible behind a mist of thin grey vapour now wholly obscured behind jagged masses of black cloud and occasionally shining brilliantly from a little patch of clear sky tallente waited for one of the latter moments before he finally tested the rope which was wound around the strongest of the young pine trees and stepped over the rustic wooden paling at the edge of the lookout he stood there balanced between earth and sky until robert who watched him shivered there is nothing to fear his master said coolly remember i am an old hand at mountain climbing robert all the same if anything should happen youd better say that we fancied we heard a cry from down below and i went to see what it was you understand  yes sir  tallente took a step into what seemed to be eternity the rope cut into his hands for the first three or four yards as the red sand crumbled away beneath his feet and he was obliged to grip for his life presently he gained a little ledge from which a single yew tree was growing and paused for breath  are you all right sir robert called out from above  quite was the confident answer i shall be off again in a minute  tallentes head had been the wonder even of members of the alpine club years ago in switzerland he found himself now in this strangest of all positions absolutely steady and unmoved sheer below him dark rushing waves broke upon the rocks sending showers of glittering spray upwards above the little lookout with its rustic paling seemed almost more than directly overhead the few stars and the fugitive moon seemed somehow set in a different sky he felt a new kinship with a great gull who came floating by he had become himself a creature of the wild places presently he began once more to let himself down hand over hand to where the next little clump of trees showed a chance of a precarious foothold the rope chafed his fingers but he remained absolutely steady once he trusted for a moment to a yew tree growing out of a fissure in the rock which came out by the roots and went hurtling down into space from overhead he heard roberts terrified cry the rope stood the strain of his sudden clutch however and all was well a little lower down holding on with one hand he took his torch from his pocket and examined the surface of the cliff nothing apparently had been disturbed nor was there any sign of any heavy body having been dashed through the undergrowth soon he went on again and working a little to the left stood for a moment upon a green turfcovered crag a tiny plateau covered with the refuse of seagulls and a few stunted trees from amongst which a startled hawk rose with a wild cry he waited here until the moon shone once more and he could see the little strip of shingle below nowhere could he find any trace of the thing he sought  at the end of half an hours climbing he reached the end of the rope the little cove filled with tumbled rocks and a narrow strip of beach was still about eighty feet below the slope here was far less precipitous and there was a foothold in many places amongst the thinly growing firs and dwarfed oaks calmly he let go the rope and commenced to scramble more than once his foot slipped but he was always in a position to save himself the time came at last when he stood upon the pebbly beach surprised to find that his knees were shaking and his breath coming fast the little place was so enclosed that when he looked upwards it seemed as though he were at the bottom of a pit as though the stars and the doubtful moon had receded and he was somehow in the bowels of the earth instead of being on the sea level there were only a few feet of the shingle dry and a great wave breaking amongst the huge rocks drenched him with spray he proceeded with his task however searching methodically amongst the rocks scanning the pebbly beach with his torch always amazed that nowhere could he find the slightest trace of what he sought finally drenched to the skin and utterly exhausted he commenced once more the upward climb he was an hour reaching the end of the rope then he blew the whistle and the rest was easy nevertheless when the paling came into sight and he felt roberts arms under his shoulders he reeled over towards the seat and lay there his clothes caked in red mud the knees of his knickerbockers cut blood on his hands and forehead breathless robert forced brandy down his throat however and in a moment or two he was himself again  a miracle he gasped there is nothing there  there was something dark i fancied upon the strip of beach sir robert ventured  i thought so too it was a tarred plank of timber  then the tide must have reached him  tallente rose to his feet and looked over  the sea alone knows he said for the first time though robert i feel inclined to agree with the newspapers who speak of the strange disappearance of the honourable antimony palliser could any man go backwards over that palisading do you think and save his life  robert shook his head  miracles cant happen sir he muttered  nevertheless tallente said a little gloomily the sea never keeps what the land gives it my fate will rest with the tides  robert suddenly gripped his masters arm the moon had disappeared underneath a fragment of cloud and they stood in complete darkness both men listened from one of the paths which led through the grounds from the beach came the sound of muffled footsteps a startled owl flew out and wheeled over their heads with a queer little cry  whos that in the grounds robert tallente demanded  ive no idea sir the latter replied his voice shaking the cottage is empty the boy went homei saw him start off there is no one else about the place  nevertheless the footsteps came nearer by and by through the trees came the occasional flash of an electric torch robert turned towards the house but tallente gripped him by the arm  stop here he muttered we couldnt get away any one would hear our footsteps along this flinty path besides there is the rope  its someone else searching robert whispered hoarsely  the light grew nearer and nearer a little way below the path branched to the right and the left to the left it encircled the tennis lawn and led to the manor or back to the road the path to the right led to the little lookout upon which the two men were standing the footsteps for a moment hesitated then the light flashed out and approached whoever the intruder might be he was making his way directly towards them tallente shrugged his shoulders  we must see this through robert he said we were in a tighter corner at ypres remember keep as quiet as you can now then  tallente flashed on his own torch  whos there he asked sternly  there was no answer the torch for a moment remained stationary then it began again to advance  what are you doing in my grounds tallente demanded who are you  a shape loomed into distinctness a bulky man in dark clothes came into sight  i am gillianinspector gillian what are you doing out here mr tallente  tallente laughed a little scornfully  it seems to me that the boot is on the other leg he said i should like to know what the mischief you mean by wandering around my grounds at this hour of the night without my permission  the inspector completed his climb and stood in the little circle of light he took note of the rope and of tallentes condition  my presence here sir the inspector announced is connected with the disappearance of the honourable anthony palliser  confidence for confidence tallente replied so is mine  the inspector moved to the palisading the top rail had been broken as though it had given under the weight of some heavy body he held up the loose fragment glanced downwards into the dark gulf and back again to tallente youve been over there he said i have tallente admitted ive made a search that i dont fancy youd have tackled yourself ive been down the cliff to the beach  what reason had you for supposing that you might discover mr pallisers body there the other asked bluntly  tallente sat on the stone seat and lit a cigarette  i will take you into my confidence mr inspector he said this afternoon i strolled round here with a lady caller just before you came and i fancied that i heard a faint cry i took no notice of it at the time but tonight after dinner i wandered out here again and again i fancied i heard it it got on my nerves to such an extent that i fetched robert here a coil of rope put on some shoes with spikes and tried to remember that i was an alpine climber  youve been down to the beach and back sir the inspector asked looking over a little wonderingly  every inch of the way the last eighty feet or so i had to scramble  did you discover anything sir  not a thing i couldnt even find a broken twig in any of the little clumps of outgrowing trees there wasnt a sign of the sand having been disturbed anywhere down the face of the cliff and i shouldnt think a human being had been on that beach during our lifetimes i have had my nights work for nothing  it was just the cry you fancied you heard which made you undertake this expedition  precisely  the inspector held up the broken rail  when was this smashed he enquired  i have no idea tallente answered all the woodwork about the place is rotten  doesnt it occur to you sir as being an extraordinarily dangerous thing to put it back in exactly the same position as though it were sound  iniquitous tallente agreed  the inspector made a mental note tallente threw the remains of his cigarette into the sea i am going to bed now he said can i offer you any refreshment mr inspector or are your investigations not yet complete  i thank you sir but i require nothing i have some men up in the wood there and i shall join them presently i am staying in the neighborhood  tallente pointed to the rope  if you would care to search for yourself mr inspector well help you down  the man shook his head  scarcely a job for a man of my build sir i have a professional climber coming tomorrow i wish you had informed me of your intention to go down tonight  if you had informed me of your intention to remain in the neighborhood that might have been possible was the cool reply the man took the loose wooden rail from its place and held it under his arm walking off with a portion of my fence eh tallente asked  the inspector made no direct reply he turned his torch on to the broken end  a clue tallente asked him lightly the other turned away it is not my place sir he announced to share any discovery i might make with a person who has deliberately refused to assist the law  no one has convinced me yet tallente replied that pallisers disappearance is a matter in which the law need concern itself the inspector coughed i wish you good night sir he disappeared along the narrow path they listened to his retreating footsteps tallente picked up his end of the rope i was right he said as he led the way back to the house quite the inspector bucket type    chapter vi  at noon the next day tallente nervously as well as physically exhausted with the long climb from the manor turned aside from the straight dusty road and seated himself upon a lichencovered boulder he threw his cap on the ground filled and lighted an old briar pipe and gazed with a queer mixture of feelings across the moorland to where woolhanger spread itself a queer medley of dwelling house and farm buildings strangely situated at the far end of the tableland he was crossing where the moor leaned down to a great hollow in the hills the open stretch of common which lay between him and his destination had none of the charm of the surrounding country it was like a dark spot set in the midst of the rolling splendours of the moorland proper there were boulders of rock of unknown age dark patches of peat land where even in midsummer the mud oozed up at the lightest footfall pools and sedgy places the home and sometimes the breeding place of the melancholy snipe of colour there was singularly little the heather bushes were stunted their roots blackened as though with fire and even the yellow of the gorse shone with a dimmer lustre but in the distance a flaming carpet of orange and purple stretched almost to the summit of the brown hills of kindlier soil and farther round westwards richly cultivated fields from which the labourers seemed to hang like insects in the air rolled away almost to the clouds  tallente looked at them a little wearily impressed with the allegorical significance of his position it seemed to him that he was in the land to which he belonged the barren land of desolation and failure the triumphs of the past failed for a moment to thrill his pulses the memory of his welllived and successful life brought him not an atom of consolation the present was all that mattered and the present had brought him to the gates of failureafter all what did a man work for he wondered what was the end and aim of it all life at martinhoe manor with a faithful but terrified manservant bookshelves ready to afford him the phantasmal satisfaction of another mans thoughts sea and winds beauties of landscape and colour to bring him to the threshold of an epicurean pleasure which needed yet that one pulsating link with humanity to yield the full meed of joy and content it all came back to the old story of mans weakness he thought as he rose to his feet his teeth almost savagely clenching his pipe he had become a conqueror of circumstances only to become a victim of the primitive needs of life  at about a quarter of a mile from the house the road branched away to the left to disappear suddenly over the edge of a drop of many hundreds of feet tallente passed through a plain white gate down an avenue of dwarfed oaks to emerge into an unexpectedly green meadow cloven through the middle with a straight white avenue through another gate he passed into a drive which led through flaming banks of rhododendrons now a little past their full glory to the front of the house a long and amplified building which by reason of many additions had become an abode of some pretensions a manservant answered his ring at once and led him into a cool white stone hall the walls of which were hung from floor to ceiling with hunting and sporting trophies  her ladyship is still at the farm sir the man announced she said if you came before she returned would you care to step round  tallente signified his assent and was led through the house across a more extensive garden from which a marvellous view of the valley and the climbing slopes behind held him spellbound by the side of a small quaintly shaped church to a circular group of buildings of considerable extent the man conducted him to the front of a whiteplastered cottage covered with roses and knocked at the door  this is her ladyships office sir he announced  lady janes invitation to enter was clear and friendly tallente found her seated behind a desk talking to a tall man in riding clothes who swung around to eye the newcomer with a curiosity which seemed somehow not altogether friendly lady jane held out her hand and smiled delightfully  do come in mr tallente she begged i cant tell you how glad i am to see you now you will believe wont you that i am not altogether an idler in life this is my agent mr segersonmr tallente  lionel segerson held out his hand he was a tall wellbuilt young devonian sunburnt with fair curly hair a somewhat obstinate type of countenance and dressed in the dandified fashion of the sporting farmer  glad to know you mr tallente he said in a tone which lacked enthusiasm i hope youre going to stay down in these parts for a time  tallente made only a monosyllabic reply and lady jane with a little gesture of apology continued her conversation with segerson  i should like you she directed to see james crockford for yourself try and explain my views to himyou know them quite well i want him to own his land you can tell him that within the last two years i have sold eleven farms to their tenants and no one could say that i have not done so on easy terms but i need further convincing that crocker is in earnest about the matter and that he will really work to make his farm a success in five good years he has only saved a matter of four hundred pounds although his rental has been almost insignificant that is the worst showing of any of the tenants on the estate and though if i had more confidence in him i would sell on a mortgage i dont feel inclined to until he has shown that he can do better tell him that he can have the farm for two thousand pounds but he must bring me eight hundred in cash and it must not be borrowed money that ought to satisfy him he must know quite well that i could get three thousand pounds for it in the open market  these fellows never take any notice of that segerson remarked ungrateful beggars all of them ill tell him what you say lady jane  thank you  anything else the young man asked showing a disposition to linger  nothing thanks until tomorrow morning there was even then a slight unwillingness in his departure which provoked a smile from lady jane as the door closed  the young men of today are terribly spoilt she said he expected to be asked to lunch  i am glad he wasnt tallente observed  she laughed  why not he is quite a nice young man  no doubt tallente agreed without conviction however i hate young men and i want to talk to you  young men are tiresome sometimes she agreed rising from her chair  and older ones too i am afraid  she closed her desk and he stood watching her she was wearing an extraordinarily masculine garba covertcoating riding costume with breeches and riding boots concealed under a long coatbut she contrived somehow to remain altogether feminine she stood for a moment looking about her as though wondering whether there were anything else to be done a capable figure attractive because of her earnest selfpossession  sarah she called out  the sound of a typewriter in an inner room ceased the door was opened and a girl appeared on the threshold  you wont see me again today unless you send up for me her mistress announced let me have the letters to sign before five try and get away early if you can the car is going in to lynton perhaps you would like the ride  i should enjoy it very much your ladyship the girl replied gratefully there is really very little to do this afternoon  you can bring the letters whenever you like then lady jane told her and let martin know that you are going in with him  you study your people i see tallente remarked as they strolled together back to the house  i try she assented i try to do what i can in my little community here very much as you in a far greater way try to study the people in your political programme of course she went on it is far easier for me the one thing i try to develop amongst them is a genuine not a false spirit of independence i want them to lean upon no one i have no charities in connection with the estate no soup kitchens or coal at christmas or anything of that sort my theory is that every person is the better for being able to look after himself and my idea of charity is placing him in a position to be able to do it i dont want to be their lady of the manor and accept their rents and give them a dinner i try to encourage them to save money and to buy their own farms the man here who owns his own farm and makes it pay is in a position to lead a thoroughly selfrespecting and honourable life he ought to get what there is to be got out of life and his children should be yeomen citizens of the best possible type of course all this sort of thing is so much easier in the country very often in the winter nights here i waste my time trying to think out your greater problems  problems he observed which the good people of hellesfield have just decided that i am not the man to solve  an election counts for nothing she declared the merest whim will lead thousands of voters into the wrong polling booth besides nearly all the papers admit that your defeat was owing to a political intrigue the very men who should have supported youwho had promised to support you in factwent against you at the last moment that was entirely due to miller wasnt it  miller has been my political bête noir for years he confessed to me he represents the ignominious pacifist whereas to him i represent the sabrerattling jingo i got the best of it while the war was on today it seems to me that he has an undue share of influence in the country  who are the men who really represent what you and i would understand as labour she asked  that is too difficult a question to answer offhand he replied personally i have come to the conclusion that labour is unrepresentablelabour as a cause there are too many of the people yet who havent vision  they passed into the cool geraniumscented hall she pointed to an easychair by the side of which was set on a small mahogany table a silver cocktail shaker and two glasses  please be as comfortable as you can she begged for a quarter of an hour if you like to wash a touch of the bell there will bring morton i must change my clothes i had to ride out to one of the outlying farms this morning and we came back rather quickly  she moved about the hall as she spoke putting little things to rights then she passed up the circular staircase at the bend she looked back and caught him watching her she waved her hand with a little less than her usual frankness tallente had forgotten for a moment his whereabouts his fatigue his general weariness he had turned around in his chair and was watching her she found something in the very intensity of his gaze disturbing vaguely analogous to certain halfformed thoughts of her own she called out some light remark scoffed at herself and ran lightly out of sight calling to her maid as she went    chapter vii  luncheon was served in a small room at the back of the house through the wideflung french windows was a vista of terraced walks the two sunken tennis lawns a walled garden leading into an orchard and beyond the great woodhung cleft in the hills on either side of which the pastoral fields like little squares stretched away upwards from here there was no trace of the more barren unkinder side of the moorland the succession of rich colours merged at last into the dim pearly hue where sky and cloud met in the golden haze of the august heat a haze more like a sort of transparent filminess than anything which really obscured  lady jane whose gift of femininity had triumphed even over her farm clothes seemed to tallente to convey a curiously mingled impression of restfulness and delicate charm in her cool white muslin dress low at the neck the paquinmade garment of an aphrodite she talked to him with all the charm of an accomplished hostess and yet with the occasional fascinating reserve of the woman who finds her companion something more than ordinarily sympathetic the butler served them unattended from the sideboard but before luncheon was half way through they dispensed with his services  i suppose it has occurred to you by this time mr tallente she said as she watched the coffee in a glass machine by her side that i am a very unconventional person  whatever you are he replied i am grateful for  cryptic but with quite a nice sort of sound about it she observed smiling tell me honestly though arent you surprised to find me living here quite alone  it seems to me perfectly natural he answered  i live without a chaperon she went on because a chaperon called by that name would bore me terribly as a matter of fact though there is generally some one staying here i find it easy enough to persuade my friends and some of my relatives that a corner of exmoor is not half a bad place in the spring and summer it is through the winter that i am generally avoided  i have always had a fancy to spend a winter on exmoor he confided  it has its compensations she agreed apart of course from the hunting  he felt the desire to speak of more vital things what did hunting or chaperons more or less matter to the lady janes of the world already he knew enough of her to be sure that she would have her way in any crisis that might arise how much of the year he asked do you actually spend here  as much as i can  you are content to be here alone even in the winter  more contented than i should be anywhere else she assured him there is always plenty to do useful work toothings that count  london  bores me terribly she confessed  foreign travel  she nodded more tolerantly  i have done a little of it she said i should love to do more but travel as travel is such an unsatisfying thing if a place attracts you you want to imbibe it travel leaves you no time to do anything but sniff life is so short one must concentrate or one achieves nothing i know what the general idea of a stayathome is she went on many of my friends consider me narrow perhaps i am anyhow i prefer to lead a complete and i believe useful life here to looking back in later years upon that hotchpotch of lurid sensations tangled impressions and restless moments that most of them call life  you display an amazing amount of philosophy for your years he ventured after a little hesitation there is one instinct however which you seem to ignore  what is it please  shall i call it the gregarious one the desire for companionship of young people of your own age  she shrugged her shoulders she had the air of one faintly amused by his diffidence  you mean that i ought to be husband hunting she said i quite admit that a husband would be a very wonderful addition to life i have none of the sentiments of the old maid on the other hand i am rather a fatalist if any man is likely to come my way whom i should care to marry he is just as likely to find me here as though i tramped the thoroughfares of the world searching for him at last she went on in a changed tone as she poured out his coffee i do hope you will find it good the cigarettes are at your elbow this is quite one of the moments of life isnt it  he agreed with her emphatically  a counsel of perfection he murmured as he sniffed the delicate turkish tobacco tell me some more about yourself  she shook her head  i am much too selfish a person she declared and nothing that i do or say or am amounts to very much i want you to let me a little way into your life talk either about your soldiering or your politics you have been a cabinet minister and you will be again tell me what it feels like to be one of the worlds governors  let us finish talking about you first he begged you spoke quite frankly of a husband tell me have you made up your mind what manner of man he must be  not in the least i am content to leave that entirely to fate  bucolic intellectual an artist a man of affairs  she made a little grimace  how can i tell i cannot conceive caring for an ordinary person but then every woman feels like that and you see if i did care he wouldnt be ordinaryto me and so far as i am concerned she insisted with a shade of restlessness in her manner that finishes the subject you must please devote yourself to telling me at least some of the things i want to know what is the use of having one of the worlds successful men têteatête a prisoner to my hospitality unless i can make him gratify my curiosity  the thought created by her words burned through his mind like a flash of destroying lightning  one of the worlds successful men he repeated is that how i seem to you  and to the world she asserted  he shook his head sadly  i have worked very hard he said i have been very ambitious a few of my ambitions have been gratified but the glory of them has passed with attainment now i enter upon the last lap and i possess none of the things i started out in life to achieve  but how absurd she exclaimed you are one of our great politicians you would have to be reckoned with in any regrouping of parties  without even a seat in the house of commons he reminded her bitterly and again how can a man be a great politician when there are no politics the confusion amongst the parties has become chaos and i for one have not been clearsighted enough to see my way through  of course i know vaguely what you mean she said but remember that i am only a newspapereducated politician cant you be a little more explicit  he lit another cigarette and smoked restlessly for a moment  ill try and explain if i can he went on to be a successful politician from the standard which you or i would aim at a man needs not only political insight but he needs to be able to adopt his views to the practical programme of one of the existing parties or else to be strong enough to form a party of his own that is where i have come to the culdesac in my career it was my ambition to guide the working classes of the country into their rightful place in our social scheme but i have also always been an intensely keen imperialist and therefore at daggers drawn with many of the socalled labour leaders the consequence has been that for ten years i have been hanging on to the thin edge of nothing a member of the coalition government a member by sufferance of a hotchpotch party which was created by the combination of the radicals and the unionists with the sole idea of seeing the country through its great crisis all legislation in the wider sense of the term had to be shelved while the country was in danger and while it was recovering itself that time i spent striving to educate the people i wanted to represent striving to make them see reason to combat the two elements in their outlook which have been their eternal drawback the elements of blatant selfishness and greedy ignorance well i failed that is all there is about iti failed no party claims me i havent even a seat in the house of commons i am nearly fifty years old and i am tired  nearly fifty years old she repeated but what is that you havehealth you are strong and well there is nothing a younger man can do that you cannot why do you worry about your age  perhaps he admitted with a faint smile and an innate compulsion to tell her of the thought which had lurked behind because you are so marvelously young  absurd she scoffed i am twentynine years oldpractically thirty that is to say with the usual twenty years allowance you and i are of the same age  he looked across at her across the lacedraped table with its bowls of fruit its richlycut decanter of wine its low bowl of roses its haze of cigarette smoke she was leaning back in her chair her head resting upon the fingers of one hand her face seemed alive with so many emotions she was so anxious to console so interested in her companion herself and the moment he felt something unexpected and irresistible  i would to god i could look at it like that he exclaimed suddenly  the words had left his lips before he was conscious that the thought which had lain at the back of them had found expression in his tone and glance just at first they produced no other effect in her save that evidenced by the gently upraised eyebrows the sweetly tolerant smile and then a sudden cloud scarcely of discomfiture certainly not of displeasure more of unrest swept across her face her eyes no longer met his so clearly and frankly there was a little mist there and a silence she was looking away through the windows to the dim pearly line of blue the actual horizon of things present her pulses were scarcely steady she was possessed to a full extent of the her qualities of courage physical and spiritual yet at that moment she felt a wave of curious fear the fear of the idealist that she may not be true to herself  the moment passed and she looked at him with a smile an innate gift of concealment the heritage of her sex came to her rescue but she felt somehow or other as though she had passed through one of the crises of her lifethat she could never be quite the same again she had ceased for those few seconds to be natural  what does that wish mean she asked do you mean that you would like to agree with me or would you like to be twentynine  he too turned his back upon that little pool of emotion did his best to be natural and easy to shut out the memory of that flaming moment  at twentynine he told her i was first secretary at st petersburg i am afraid that i was rather a dull dog too all russia even then was seething and i was trying to understand i never did no one ever understood russia the explanation of all that has happened there is simply the eternal duplication of historya huge class of people physically omnipotent conscious of wrongs unintelligent and led by false prophets all revolutions are the same the purging is too severe so the good remains undone  there followed a silence purposeful on her port scarcely realised by him she sought for means of escape to bring their conversation down to the level where alone safety lay she moved her chair a little farther back into the scented chamber as though she found the sunlight too dazzling  you are like so many of the men who work for us she said you are just a little tired arent you you come down here to rest and i dig up all the old problems and ask you to vex yourself with them we must talk about slighter things you are going to shoot here this seasonperhaps hunt later on  i do not think so he answered i have forgotten what sports mean i may take a gun out sometimes there is a little shooting that goes with the manor but very few birds i believe the last ten years seem to have driven all those things out of ones mind  dont you think that you are inclined to take life a little too earnestly she asked one should have amusements  i may feel the necessity he replied but it is not easy to take up ones earlier pleasures at my time of life  dont think me inquisitive she went on but as i told you i have looked you up in one of those wonderful books which tell us everything about everybody you were a double blue at oxford  racquets and cricket he assented neither of them much use to me now  racquets would help you with lawn tennis she said but beyond that i find that not a dozen years ago you were a scratch golfer and you certainly won the amateur championship of italy  it is eleven years since i touched a club he told her  then you ought to be ashamed of yourself she declared games are part of an englishmans life and when he neglects them altogether there is something wrong i shall insist upon your taking up lawn tennis again i have two beautiful courts there and very seldom any one to play with who has the least idea of the game  his eyes rested for a moment upon the smoothly shaven lawns  so you think that regeneration may come to me through lawn tennis he murmured  and why not you are taking yourself far too seriously you know how do you expect regeneration to come  shall i tell you what it is i lack he answered suddenly incentive i think my will has suddenly grown flabby the ego in me unresponsive you know the moods in which one asks oneself whether it is worth while whether anything is worth while well i am there at the crossroads i think i feel more inclined to look for a seat than to go on  the strongest of us need to rest sometimes she agreed quietly  he relapsed into a silence so apparently deliberate that she accepted it as a respite for herself also from the greater seclusion of her shadowy seat she found herself presently able to watch him unnoticedthe brooding melancholy of his face the nervous unsatisfied mouth the discontent of his sombre brows then even as she watched the change in his expression startled her his eyes were fixed upon the narrow ribbon of road which twisted around the other side of the house and led over the bleaker moors seawards the look puzzled her gave her an uncomfortable feeling its note of appreciation seemed to her inexplicable with a quaint electrical sympathy he caught the unspoken question in her eyes and translated it  you are beginning to doubt me he said you are wondering if the shadow i carry with me is not something more than the mere depression of a man who has failed  you have not failed she declared and i never doubt you but there was something in your face just then which was strange something alien to our talk it was as though you saw something ominous in the distance  it is true he admitted in the distance i can see the car i ordered to come and fetch me there is a passengera man in the tonneau i am wondering who he is  some one to whom your man has given a lift perhaps she suggested  he shook his head  i have another feelingperhaps i should say an apprehension it is some one who brings news  political ordomestic  neither he answered i thought that fate had dealt me out most of her evil tricks when i came down here a political outcast she had another one up her sleeve however do you read your morning papers  every day she confessed is it a weakness  not at all  you read of the disappearance of the honourable anthony palliser  of course she answered besides you told me about it did you not yesterday afternoon i know one of his sisters quite well and i was looking forward to seeing something of him down here  i was obliged to dismiss him at a moments notice tallente went on he betrayed his trust and he has disappeared that very imposing police inspector who broke up our têteatête yesterday afternoon and i fear shortened your visit came on his account he was the spokesman for a superior authority in london they have come to the conclusion that i could if i chose throw some light upon his disappearance  and could you  he rose to his feet  you are the one person in the world he said to whom i could tell nothing but the truth i could  they both heard the sound of footsteps in the hall lady jane disturbed by the ominous note in tallentes voice rose also to her feet glancing from him towards the door filled with some vague inexplicable apprehension tallente showed no fear but it was plain that he had nerved himself to face evil things there was something almost ludicrous in this denouement to a situation which to both had seemed filled with almost dramatic possibilities the door was opened by parkins the stout discreet man servant ushering in the unkempt illtailored ungainly figure of james miller  this gentleman parkins announced wishes to see mr tallente on urgent business    chapter viii  the newcomer had distinctly the best of the situation tallente who had expected a very different visitor was for the moment bereft of words lady jane who among her minor faults was inclined to be a supercilious person with too great a regard for externals gazed upon this strange figure which had found its way into her sanctum with an astonishment which kept her also silent  sorry to intrude mr miller began with an affability which he meant to be reassuring mr tallente will you introduce me to the lady  tallente acquiesced unwillingly  lady jane he said this is mr james millerlady jane partington  mr miller was impressed held out his hand and withdrew it  i must apologize for this intrusion lady jane and to you tallente of course mr tallente is naturally surprised to see me he and i are political opponents he confided turning to jane  her surprise increased if possible  are you mr miller the democrat mp she askedthe mr miller who was making those speeches at hellesfield last week  at your ladyships service he replied with a low bow i am afraid if you are a friend of mr tallentes you must look upon me as a very disagreeable person  if the newspapers are to be believed your strategies up at hellesfield scarcely give one an exalted idea of your tactics she replied coldly they all seem to agree that mr tallente was cheated out of his seat  the intruder smiled tolerantly he glanced around the room as though expecting to be asked to seat himself no invitation of the sort however was accorded him alls fair in love and politics lady jane he declared we democrats have our programme and our motto is that those who are not with us are against us mr tallente here knew pretty well what he was up against  on the contrary tallente interrupted one never knows what one is up against when you are in the opposite camp miller would you mind explaining why you have sought me out in this singular fashion  certainly was the gracious reply you have a very distinguished visitor over at the manor waiting there to see you i came over with him and found your car on the point of starting i took the liberty of hunting you up so that there should be no delay in your return  and who may this distinguished visitor he tallente enquired with unconscious sarcasm stephen dartrey miller answered he and miss miall and i are staying not far from you  stephen dartrey lady jane murmured dartrey tallente echoed do you mean to say that he is over at the manor now  waiting to see you miller announced and for a moment there was a little gleam of displeasure in his eyes lady jane sighed now if only youd brought him over with you mr miller she said a shade more amiably you would have given me real pleasure there is no man whom i am more anxious to meet miller smiled tolerantly dartrey is a very difficult person he declared although he is the leader of our party and before very long will be the leader of the whole labour party although he could be prime minister tomorrow if he cared about it he is one of the most retiring men whom i ever knew at the present moment i believe that he would have preferred to have remained living his hermits life a writer and a dilettante if circumstances had not dragged him into politics he lives in the simplest way and hates all society save the company of a few old cronies  what does dartrey want with me tallente interrupted a little brusquely it is no part of my mission to explain miller replied i undertook to come here and beg you to return at once tallente turned to lady jane you will forgive me he begged in any case i must have been going in a few minutes  i should forgive you even if you went without saying goodby she replied and i can assure you that i shall envy you i do not want to turn your head she went on pleasantly as she walked by his side towards the door and across the hall rather ignoring miller who followed behind but for the last two or three years the only political figures who have interested me at all have been dartrey and yourselfyou as the man of action and dartrey as the most wonderful exponent of the real higher socialism i had a shelf made for his three books alone they hang in my bedroom and i look upon them as my textbooks  i must tell dartrey this miller remarked from behind i am sure hell be flattered  what can he want with you lady jane asked dropping her voice a little  i cant tell tallente confessed his visit puzzles me he is the hermit of politics he seldom makes advances and has few friends he is i believe a man with the highest sense of honour perhaps he has come to explain to me why they threw me out at hellesfield  in any case she said as they stood for a moment on the step i feel that something exciting is going to happen  miller carrying his tweed cap in his hand insisted upon a farewell  sorry to have taken your guest away lady jane he said its an important occasion however would you like me to bring dartrey over if we are out this way before we go back  she shook her head  no i dont think so she answered quietly i might have an illusion dispelled thank you very much all the same  mr miller stepped into the car a little discomfited tallente lingered on the step  you will let me know she begged  i will he promised it is probably just a visit of courtesy dartrey must feel that he has something to explain about hellesfield  there was a moments curious lingering each seemed to seek in vain for a last word they parted with a silent handshake tallente looked around at the corner of the avenue she was still standing there gazing after the car slim cool and stately miller waved his cap and she disappeared  the car sped over the moorland miller with his cap tucked into his pocket leaned forward taking deep gulps of the wonderful air  marvellous he exclaimed tallente you ought to live for ever in such a spot  what does dartrey want to see me about his companion asked a little abruptly  miller coughed leaned back in his place and became impressive  tallente he said i dont know exactly what dartrey is going to say to you i only know this that it is very possible he may make you on behalf of all of usthe democratic party that is to sayan offer which you will do well to consider seriously  to join your ranks i suppose  i must not betray a confidence miller continued cautiously at the same time you know our power you have insight enough to guess at our destiny it is an absolute certainty that dartrey if he chooses may be the next prime minister you might have been in horlocks cabinet but for an accident it may be that you are destined to be in dartreys  tallente found his thoughts playing strange pranks with him no man appreciated the greatness of dartrey more than he no man perhaps had a more profound conviction as to the truth and future of the principles of which he had become the spokesman he realised the irresistible power of the new democracy he was perfectly well aware that it was within dartreys power to rule the country whenever he chose yet there seemed something shadowy about these things something unpleasantly real and repulsive in the familiarity of his companion in the thought of association with him he battled with the idea treated it as a prejudice analysed it from head to foot the man wore the wrong clothes in the wrong mannerboots of a vivid shade of brown thick socks without garters an obviously readymade suit of grey flannel a hopeless tie an unimaginable collar even his ready flow of speech suggested the gifts of the tubthumpers his indomitable persistence a lack of sensibility he knew his facts knew all the stock arguments was brimful of statistics was argumentative convincing in his way sincere tallente acknowledged all these things and yet found himself wondering with a grim sense of irony how he could call a man comrade with such finger nails  its given you something to think about eh miller remarked affably  tallente came to himself with a little start  im afraid my mind was wandering he confessed  his companion smiled knowingly he was conscious of tallentes aloofness but determined to break through it if he could after all this caste feeling was absurd he was in his way a wellknown man a member of parliament a future cabinet minister he was the equal of anybody  dont wonder at it pleasant neighbours hereabouts eh  tallente affected to misunderstand he glanced around at the few farmhouses dotted in sheltered places amongst the hills  there are very few of them he answered that makes this place all the more enjoyable for any one who comes for a real rest  miller felt that he was suffering defeat he opened his lips and closed them again the jocular reference to lady jane remained unspoken there was something in the calm aloofness of the man by his side which intimidated even while it annoyed him soon they commenced the drop from the moorland to where far away below the manor with its lawn and gardens and outbuildings seemed like a childs pleasure palace miller leaned forward and pointed downwards  theres dartrey sitting on the terrace he pointed out dartrey and nora miall youve heard of her i expect  i know her by repute of course tallente admitted she is a very brilliant young woman it will give me great pleasure to meet her    chapter ix  tallente took tea that afternoon with his three guests upon the terrace before them towered the woodembosomed cliffs with here and there great red gashes of scarred sandstone beyond lay the sloping meadow with its clumps of bracken and grey stone walls and in the background a more rugged line of rocky cliffs the sea in the bay flashed and glittered in the long rays of the afternoon sunshine the scene was extraordinarily peaceful stephen dartrey for the first few minutes certainly justified his reputation for taciturnity he leaned back in a long wicker chair his head resting upon his hand his thoughtful eyes fixed upon vacancy no man in those days could have resembled less a popular leader of the people in appearance he was a typical aristocrat and his expression notwithstanding his fine forehead and thoughtful eyes was marked with a certain simplicity which in his younger days had lured many an inexperienced debater on to ridicule and extinction in an intensely curious age dartrey was still a man over whose personality controversy raged fiercely he was a poet a dreamer a writer of elegant prose an orator an artist and behind all these things there was a flame in the man a perfect passion for justice for seeing people in their right places which had led him from the more flowery ways into the world of politics his enemies called him a dilettante and a poseur his friends were led into rhapsodies through sheer affection his supporters hailed him as the one man of genius who held out the scales of justice before the world  of course nora miall observed looking up at her host pleasantly i can see what is going to happen mr dartrey came out here to talk to you upon most important matters this place the beauty of it all is acting upon him like a soporific if we dont shake him up presently he will go away with wonderful mind pictures of your cliffs and sea and his whole mission unfulfilled  libellous as usual nora dartrey murmured without turning his head mr tallente is providing me with a few minutes of intense enjoyment he has assured me that his time is ours soon i shall finish my tea light a cigarette and talk just now you may exercise the privilege of your sex unhindered and better your own acquaintance with our host  the girl laughed up into tallentes face  very likely mr tallente doesnt wish to improve his acquaintance with me she said  tallente hastened to reassure her somehow the presence of these two did much to soothe the mental irritation which miller had set up in him they at least were of the world of understandable things miller slouching in his chair with a cheap tieclip showing underneath his waistcoat a bulging mass of sock descending over the top of his boot rolling a cigarette with yellowstained objectionable fingers still involved him in introspective speculation as to real values in life  i have often felt myself unfortunate in not having met you before miss miall he said some of your writings have interested me immensely  some of them she queried with a smile  absolute agreement would deny us even the stimulus of an argument he observed besides after all men find it more difficult to get rid of prejudices than women  she leaned forward to help herself to a cigarette and he studied her for a moment she was a little under medium height trimly yet almost squarely built her mouth was delightful humourous and attractive and her eyes were of the deepest shade of violet with black silken eyelashes her voice was the voice of a cultivated woman and tallente as he mostly listened to her light ripple of conversation realised that the charm which was hers by reputation was by no means undeserved in many ways she astonished him the stories which had been told of her even written were incredible yet her manners were entirely the manners of one of his own world the triodartrey with his silence and occasional monosyllabic remarksseemed to draw closer together at every moment until miller obviously chafing at his isolation thrust himself into the conversation  mr tallente he said taking advantage of a moments pause to direct the conversation into a different channel we kept our word at hellesfield  you did his host acknowledged drily you succeeded in cheating me out of the seat i still dont know why  he turned as though appealing to dartrey and dartrey accepted the challenge swinging a little around in his chair and tapping his cigarette against the table preparatory to lighting it  you lost hellesfield mr tallente as you would have lost any seat north of bedford he declared  owing to the influence of the democrats  certainly  but why is that influence exercised against me tallente demanded i am thankful to have an opportunity of asking you that question dartrey surely you would reckon me more of a peoples man than these whigs and coalitionists  very much more dartrey agreed so much more mr tallente that we dont wish to see you dancing any longer between two stools we want you in our camp you are the first man tallente whom we have sought out in this way we have come at a busy time under pretext of a holiday some two hundred miles from london to suggest to you temporarily deprived of political standing that you join us  that temporary deprivation tallente murmured being due to your efforts  precisely  and the alternative  those who are not with us are against us dartrey declared if you persist in remaining the doubtful factor in politics it is our business to see that you have no definite status there  tallente laughed a little cynically  your methods are at least modern he observed you invite a man to join your party and if he refuses you threaten him with political extinction  why not dartrey asked wonderingly you do not pause to consider the matter government is meant for the million where the individual might impede good government common sense calls for his ostracism no nation has been more slow to realise this than england a code of order and morals established two thousand years ago has been accepted by them as incapable of modification or improvement to take a single instance supposing de valera had been shot the first day he talked treason against the empire your troubles with ireland would have been immensely minimised and mark this for it is the crux of the whole matter the people of ireland would have attained what they wanted much sooner you are not one of those andrew tallente who refuse to see the writing on the wall you know that in one form or another in this country the democracy must rule they felt the flame of inspiration when war came and they helped to win the war what was their reward the opulent portion of them were saddled with an enormous income tax and high prices of living through bad legislation which made life a burden the more povertystricken suffered sympathetically in exactly the same way we won the war and we lost the peace we fastened upon the shoulders of the deserving the wageearning portion of the community a burden which their shoulders could never carry a burden which had we lost the war instead of winning it would have led promptly to a revolution and a measure at least of freedom  there is so much of truth in what you say tallente declared that i am going to speak to you frankly even though my frankness seems brutal i am going to speak about your friend miller here throughout the war miller was a pacifist he was dead against killing germans he was all for a peace at any price  steady on miller interrupted suddenly sitting up in his chair look here tallente  be quiet until i have finished tallente went on he was concerned in no end of intrigue with austrian and german socialists for embarrassing the government and bringing the war to an end i should say that but for the fact that our government at the time was wholly one of compromise and was leaning largely upon the labour vote he would have been impeached for high treason  miller who had been busy rolling a cigarette lit it with ostentatious carelessness  and what of all this he demanded  nothing tallente replied except that it seems a strange thing to find you now associated with a party who threaten me openly with political extinction unless i choose to join them i call this junkerdom not socialism  no mans principles can remain stable in an unstable world miller pronounced i still detest force and compulsion of every sort but i recognise its necessity in our present civil life far more than i did in a war which was after all a war of politicians  nora miall leaned over from her chair and laid her hand on tallentes arm after millers raucous tones her voice sounded almost like music  mr tallente she said i can understand your feeling aggrieved you are not a man whom it is easy to threaten but remember that after all we must go on our fixed way towards the appointed goal andconsiderisnt the upraised rod for your good your place is with usindeed it is i fancy that stephen here forgets that you are not yet fully acquainted with our real principles and aims a political party cannot be judged from the platform the views expressed there have to be largely governed by the character of the audience it is to the textbooks of our creed dartreys textbooks that you should turn  i have read your views on certain social matters miss miall tallente observed turning towards her  she laughed understandingly her eyes twinkled as she looked at him  and thoroughly disapproved them of course but you know mr tallente we are out not to reconstruct society but to lay the stepping stones for a reconstruction that is all i suppose that any single generation could accomplish the views which i have advocated in the universal review are the views which will be accepted as a matter of course in fifty years time today they seem crude and unmoral chiefly because the casual reader especially the british reader dwells so much upon external effects and thinks so little of the soul that lies below even you mr tallente with your passion for order and your distrust of all change in established things can scarcely consider our marriage laws an entire success  tallente winced a little and dartrey hastily intervened  we want you to remember this he said the principles which we advocate are condemned before they are considered by men of inherited principles and academic education such as yourself because you have associated them always with the disciples of anarchy bolshevism and other diseased rituals you have never stooped to separate the good from the bad the person who dares to tamper with the laws of king alfred stands before you prejudged granted that our doctrines are extreme are welet me be personal and say am ithe class of man whom you have associated with these doctrines we democrats have gained great power during the last ten years we have thrust our influence deep into the hearts of those great sinister bodies the trades unions there is no one except ourselves who realises our numerical and potential strength we could have created a revolution in this country at any time since the premiers first gloomy speech in the house of commons after the signing of peace had we chosen i can assure you that we havent the least fancy for marching through the streets with red flags and letting loose the diseased end of our community upon the palaces and public buildings of london we are democrats or republicans whichever you choose to call us who desire to conquer with the brain as we shall conquer and where we recognise a man of genius like yourself who must be for us or against us if we cannot convert him then we must see that politically he ceases to count  robert came out and whispered in his masters ear tallente turned to his guests  i cannot offer you dinner he said but my servant assures me that he can provide a cold supper will you stay i think that you dartrey would enjoy the view from some of my lookouts  i accept your invitation dartrey replied eagerly i have been sitting here longing for the chance to watch the sunset from behind your wood  it will be delightful nora murmured i want to go down to the grass pier  miller too accepted a little ungraciously the little party wandered off down the path which led to the seashore miller detained his host for a moment at one of the corners  by the by tallente he asked what about the disappearance of palliser  he has disappeared tallente answered calmly that is all i know about it  miller stood with his hands in his pockets gnawing the end of his moustache gazing covertly at the man who stood waiting for him to pass on tallentes face was immovable  disappeared do you mean to say that you dont know where he is  i have no idea  again there was a moments silence then miller leaned a little forward look here tallente he begannora turned round and suddenly beckoned her host to her  come quickly she begged i can do nothing with mr dartrey he has just decided that our whole scheme of life is absurd that politics and power are shadows and that work for others is lunacy all that he wants is your cottage a fishing rod and a few books  nothing else tallente asked smiling  there was a momentary cloud upon her face  nothing else in the world she answered her eyes fixed upon the figure of the man who was leaning now over the grey stone wall gazing seaward   during the service of the meal on the terrace afterwards and even when they strolled down to the edge of the cliff to see the great yellow moon come up from behind the hills scarcely a word was spoken on political subjects dartrey was an oxford man of tallentes own college and although several years his senior they discovered many mutual acquaintances and indulged in reminiscences which seemed to afford pleasure to both then they drifted into literature and tallente found himself amazed at the knowledge of the man whose whole life was supposed to have been given to his labours for the people dartrey explained his intimate acquaintance with certain modern writings and his marvellous familiarity with many of the classics as he and his host walked down together along one of the narrow paths you see tallente he said i have never been a practical politician i dare say that accounts for my rather peculiar position today i have evolved a whole series of social laws by which i maintain that the people should be governed and those laws have been accepted wherever socialism flourishes they took me some years of my earlier life to elaborate some years of study before i set pen to paper some years of my later life to place before the world and there my task practically ended there is nothing fresh to say about these great human problems they are there for any man to whom daylight comes to see they are all inevitably bound up with the future of our race but there is no need to dig further my work is done  how can you say that tallente argued when day by day your power in the country grows when everything points to you as the next premier  precisely dartrey replied quietly that is why i am here the head of the democratic party has a right to the government of this country but you know at this point i have a very sad confession to make i am the worst politician who ever sat in the house i am a poor debater a worse strategist again tallente that is why you and i at this moment walk together through your beautiful grounds and watch the rim of that yellow moon it is yourself we want  tallente felt the thrill of the moment felt the sincerity of the man whose hand pressed gently upon his arm  if you are our man tallente his visitor continued if you see eye to eye with us as to the great things if you can cast away what remains to you of class and hereditary prejudice and throw in your lot with ours there is no office of the state which you may not hope to occupy i had not meant to appeal to your ambitions i do so now only generally as a rule every man connected with a revolution thinks himself able to govern the state that is not so with us a man may have the genius for seeing the truth the genius even for engraving the laws which should govern the world upon tablets of stone without having the capacity for government  but do you mean to say tallente asked that when horlock goes down as go down he must within the next few months you are not prepared to take his place  i should never accept the task of forming a government dartrey said quietly unless i am absolutely driven to do so i have shown the truth to the world i have shown to the people whom i love their destiny but i have not the gifts to lead them i am asking you tallente to join us to enter parliament as one of our party and to lead for us in the house of commons  yours is the offer of a prince tallente replied after a brief nervous pause if i hesitate you must remember all that it means for me  dartrey smiled  now my friend he said look me in the face and answer me this question you know little of us democrats as a party you see nothing but a hotchpotch of strange people struggling and striving to attain definite form naturally you are full of prejudices yet consider your own political position i am not here to make capital out of a mans disappointment in his friends but has your great patron used you well horlock offers you a grudging and belated place in his cabinet what did he say to you when you came hack from hellesfield tallente was silent there was in fact no answer which he could make i do not wish to dwell on that dartrey went on ingratitude is the natural sequence of the distorted political ideals which we are out to destroy you should be in the frame of mind tallente to see things clearly you must realise the rotten condition of the political party to which horlock belongsthe coalitionists the whip or whatever they like to call themselves the government of this country since the war has been a farce and a mockery we are dropping behind in the worlds race labour fattens with sops develops a spirit of greed and production languishes you know why labour would toil for its country labour can feel patriotism with the best but labour hates to toil under the earth upon the earth and in the factories of the world for the sake of the profiteer this is the national spirit that jealousy that slackness which the last ten years has developed there is a new little englander abroad and he speaks with the voice of labour it is our task to find the soul of the people and i have come to you for your aid  tallente looked for a moment down to the bay and listened to the sound of the incoming tide breaking upon the rocks dimmer now but even more majestic in the twilight the great immovable cliffs towered up to the sky an owl floated up from the grove of trees beneath and with a strange cry circled round for a moment to drop on to the lawn a shapeless solemn mass of feathers at the back of the hills a little rim of gold no wider than a wedding ring announced the rising of the moon he felt a touch upon his sleeve a very sweet persuasive voice in his ear nora had left miller in the background and was standing by his side  i heard mr dartreys last words she said can you refuse such an appeal in such a spot you turn away to think turn to the quietness of all these dreaming voices believe me if there is a soul beneath them it is the same soul which has inspired our creed you yourself have come here full of bitterness andrew tallente because it seemed to you that there was no place for you amongst the prophets of democracy it was you yourself in a moment of passion perhaps who said that democracy as typified in existing political parties was soulless you were right hasnt mr dartrey just told you so and doesnt that make our task the clearer it brings before us those wonderful days written about in the old testamentthe people must be led into the light  her voice had become almost part of the music of the evening she was looking up at him her beautiful eyes aglow dartrey a yard or two off his thoughtful face paler than ever in the faint light was listening with joyous approval in the background miller with his hands in his pockets was smoking mechanically the cigarette which he had just rolled and lit the thrill of a great moment brought to tallente a feeling of almost strange exaltation  i am your man dartrey he promised i will do what i can    chapter x  the right honourable john augustus horlock prime minister of england through a most amazing fluke received tallente a few days later with the air of one desiring to show as much graciousness as possible to a discomfited follower he extended two fingers and indicated an uncomfortable chair  well well tallente he said sorry i wasnt in town when you passed through from the north bad business that hellesfield affair  it was a very bad business indeed tallente agreed chiefly because it shows that our agents there must be utterly incapable  the prime minister coughed  you think so tallente eh now their point of view is that you let miller make all the running let him make his points and never got an answer innever got a grip on the people eh  that may do for the official explanation tallente replied coldly but as a plain statement of facts it is entirely beside the mark if you will forgive my saying so sir it has been one of your characteristics in life born without doubt he added with a little bow of your indomitable courage to minimise difficulties and dangers of a certain type you did not sympathise with me in my defeat at hellesfield because you underrated as you always have underrated the vastly growing strength and dangerous popularity of the party into whose hands the government of this country will shortly pass  mr horlock frowned portentously this was not at all the way in which he should have been addressed by an unsuccessful follower but underneath that frown was anxiety  you refer to the democrats  naturally  do i understand you to attribute your defeat then to the tactics of the democratic party  it is no question of supposition tallente replied it is a certainty  you believe that they have a greater hold upon the country than we imagine then  i am sure of it was the confident answer they occupy a position no other political party has aimed at occupying in the history of this country they aid and support themselves by means of direct and logical propaganda carried to the very heart and understanding of their possible supporters their methods are absolutely unique and personally i am convinced that it is their destiny to bring into one composite body what has been erroneously termed the labour vote  horlock smiled indulgently he preferred to assume a confidence which he could not wholly feel  i am glad to hear your opinion tallente he said i have to remember however that you are still smarting under a defeat inflicted by these people what i cannot altogether understand is this how was it that you were entirely deprived of their support at hellesfield you yourself are supposed to be practically a socialist at any rate from the point of view of the staider of my party yet these fellows down at hellesfield preferred to support bloxham who twenty years ago would have been called a tory  i can quite understand your being puzzled at that tallente acknowledged i was myself at first since then i have received an explanation  well well mr horlock interjected with a return of his official genial manner well let sleeping dogs lie have you made any plans tallente  a week ago i thought of going to samoa was the grim reply you dont want me the country didnt seem to want me i have worked for other people for thirty years i rather thought of resting living the life of a lotus eater for a time  an extremist as ever the prime minister remarked tolerantly even a politician who has worked as hard as you have can find many pleasurable paths in life open to him in this country however the necessity for such an extreme course of action on your part is done away with i am very pleased to be able to tell you that the affair concerning which i have been in communication with your secretary for the last two months has taken an unexpectedly favourable turn  what the mischief do you mean tallente enquired puzzled  i mean mr horlock announced with a friendly smile that sooner than be deprived of your valuable services his majesty has consented that you should go to the upper house you will be offered a peerage within the next fortnight  tallente stared at the speaker as though he had suddenly been bereft of his senses  what on earth are you talking about sir he demanded  mr horlock somewhat resented his visitors tone  surely my statement was sufficiently explicit he said a little stiffly the peerage concerning which at first i admit i saw difficulties is yours you can without doubt be of great service to us in the upper house and  but id sooner turn shopkeeper tallente interrupted if i understand that it is your intention to offer me a peerage let us have no misunderstanding about the matter it is refused absolutely and finally  the prime minister stared at his visitor for a moment in amazement then he unlocked a drawer in his desk drew out several letters and threw them over to tallente  and will you tell me what the devil you mean by authorising your secretary to write these letters he demanded  tallente picked them up read them through and gasped  written by palliser arent they mr horlock demanded  without a doubt tallente acknowledged the amazing thing however is that they are entirely unauthorised the subject has never even been discussed between palliser and myself i am exceedingly sorry sir he went on that you should have been misled in this fashion but i can only give you my word of honour that these letters are entirely and absolutely unauthorised  god bless my soul the prime minister exclaimed where is palliser better telephone  palliser left my service a week or more ago tallente replied he left it at a moments notice in consequence of a personal disagreement concerning which i beg that you will ask no questions i can only assure you that it was not political since he left no word has been heard of him the papers even have been making capital of his disappearance  it is the most extraordinary thing i ever heard in my life horlock declared a little irritably why ive spent hours of my time trying to get this matter through  dealing seriously with palliser thinking that he represented me in this matter  without a doubt  will you lend me the letters tallente asked  mr horlock threw them across the table  here they are my secretary wrote twice to palliser last week and received no reply that is why i sent you a telegram  i was on my way to see you anyway tallente observed i thought that you were going to offer me a seat  mr horlock shook his head  we simply havent a safe one he confided and there isnt a soul i could ask to give up especially to speak plainly for you tallente they look upon you as dangerous and although it would have been a nine days wonder most of my people would have been relieved to have heard of your going to the upper house  i see tallente murmured in plain words youve no use for me in the cabinet  my dear fellow the prime minister expostulated you have no right to talk like that i offered you a post of great responsibility and a seat which we believed to be perfectly safe you lost the election bringing a considerable amount of discredit if you will forgive my saying so upon the government what more can i do  tallente was watching the speaker curiously he had thought over this interview all the way up on the train thought it out on very different lines  nothing i suppose he admitted yet theres a certain risk about dropping me isnt there you might drive me into the arms of the enemy  what the old whig lot not a chance i know you too well for that  no the democrats  horlock moved restlessly in his chair he was eyeing his visitor steadfastly  what the people who have just voted solidly against you  hasnt it occurred to you that that might have been political strategy tallente suggested they might have maneuvered for the very situation which has arisenthat is if i am really worth anything to anybody  horlock shook his head  oil and water wont mix tallente and you dont belong to that crowd all the same he confessed i shouldnt like you with them i cannot believe that such a thing would ever come to pass but the thought isnt a pleasant one  now that you have made up your mind that i dont want to go to the house of lords and wouldnt under any possible consideration tallente asked have you anything else to suggest  mr horlock was a little annoyed he considered that he had shown remarkable patience with a somewhat troublesome visitor  tallente he said it is of no use your being unreasonable you had your chance at hellesfield and you lost it your chance in my cabinet and lost that too you know for yourself how many rising politicians i have to satisfy youll be back again with us before long of course but for the present you must be content to take a rest we can make use of you on the platform and there are always the reviews  i see tallente murmured  the fact is his host concluded as his fingers strayed towards the dismissal bell you made rather a mistake tallente years ago in dabbling at all with the labour party at first i must admit that i was glad i felt that you created as it were a link between my government and a very troublesome opposition today things have altered labour has shown its hand and it demands what no sane man could give weve finished with compromise we have to fight socialism or go under  tallente nodded  one moment he begged as the prime ministers forefinger rested upon the button of the bell now may i tell you just why i came to pay you this visit  if there is anything more left to be said mr horlock conceded with an air of exaggerated patience  there is just this tallente declared if you had had a seat to offer me or a post in your cabinet i should have been compelled to decline it just as i have declined that ridiculous offer of a peerage i have consented to lead the democratic party in the house of commons  the prime ministers fingers slipped slowly from the knob of the bell he was a person of studied deportment a journalist who had once written of his courtly manners had found himself before long the subeditor of a government journal at that moment he was possessed of neither manners nor presence he sat gazing at tallente with his mouth open the latter rose to his feet  i ask you to believe sir he said that the step which i am taking is in no way due to my feeling of pique or dissatisfaction with your treatment i go where i think i can do the best work for my country and employ such gifts as i have to their best advantage  but you are out to ruin the country horlock faltered the democrats are socialists  from one point of view tallente rejoined every christian is a socialist the term means nothing the programme of my new party aims at the destruction of all artificial barriers which make prosperity easy to one and difficult to another it aims not only at the abolition of great fortunes and trusts but at the abolition of the conditions which make them possible it embraces a scheme for national service and a reasonable imperialism it has a sane programme and that is more than any government which has been in office since the war has had  mr horlock rose to his feet  tallente he pronounced you are a traitor to your class and to your country  he struck the bell viciously his visitor turned away with a faint smile  dont annoy me he begged or i may some day have to send you to the house of lords    chapter xi  tallente obeying an urgent telephone message made his way to claridges and sent his card up to his wife her maid came down and invited him to her suite an invitation which he promptly declined in about a quarter of an hour she descended to the lounge dressed for the street she showed no signs of confusion or nervousness at his visit she was hard and cold and fair with a fraudulent smile upon her lips dressed to perfection her maid hovering in the background with a pekinese under one arm and a jewel case in her other hand  thank goodness she said as she fluttered into a chair by his side that you hate scenes even more than i do you have the air of a man who has found out no end of disagreeable things  you are observant he answered drily i have just come from the prime minister  well  i find that palliser has been conducting a regular conspiracy behind my back with reference to this wretched peerage he has practically forged my name and has placed me in a most humiliating position you i suppose were his instigator in this matter  i suppose i was she admitted  what was to be his rewardhis ulterior reward i mean  i promised him twenty thousand pounds she answered with cold fury it appears that i overvalued your importance to your party tony apparently did the same he thought that you had only to intimate your readiness to accept a peerage and the thing would be arranged it seems that we were wrong  you were doubly wrong he replied in the first place there were difficulties and in the second nothing would have induced me to accept such a humiliating offer  how did you find this out she enquired  the prime minister offered me the peerage less than an hour ago he answered i need not say that i unhesitatingly refused it  stella ceased buttoning her gloves there was a cold glitter in her eyes  you refused it  of course  she was silent for a moment  andrew she said you have scarcely kept your bargain with me  i am not prepared to admit that he replied you had a very considerable social position at the time when i was in office it was up to you to make that good  i am tired of political society she answered it isnt the real thing now you are out of parliament though even that has vanished andrew  well  she leaned a little towards him she began to regret that he had not accepted her invitation to visit her in her suite years ago she had been able to bend him sometimes to her will why should she take it for granted that she had lost her power here however even persuasions were difficult he sat upon a straight highbacked chair by her side and his face seemed as though it were carved out of stone  you have always declined andrew to make very much use of my money she said could we not make a bargain now i will give you a hundred thousand pounds and settle five million dollars on the holder of the title forever if you will accept this peerage i wouldnt mind a present to the party funds either if that helped matters  tallente shook his head  i am sorry for your disappointment he said but nothing would induce me to accept a seat in the upper house i have other plans  they could be changed  impossible  you might be forced to change them  by whom  the smile maddened her she had meant to be subtle she became flamboyant she leaned forward in her chair  what have you done with tony palliser she demanded  tallente remained absolutely unruffled he had been expecting something of this sort the only wonder was that it had been delayed so long  a threat he asked pleasantly  call it what you like men dont disappear like that what did you do with him  what do you think he deserved  she bit her lip  i think you are the most detestable human being who ever breathed she faltered supposing i go to the police  dont be melodramatic he begged in the first place what have you to tell in the second place in this country at any rate a wife cannot give evidence against her husband  you admit that something has happened she asked eagerly  i admit nothing he replied except that anthony palliser has disappeared under circumstances which you and i know about that he has forged my name and entered into a disgraceful conspiracy with you and that he has stolen from my wife a political document of great importance to me  i knew nothing about the political document she said quickly  possibly not he agreed still the fact remains that tony was a thoroughly bad lot i find myself able to regard the possibility of an accident having happened to him with equanimity have you anything further to say  she sat looking down on the floor for several minutes she had probably tallente decided as he watched her some way of suffering in secret all the more terrible because of its repression when she looked up her face seemed pinched and older her voice however was steady  let us have an understanding she said you do not desire my return to martinhoe  i do not he agreed  and what about cheverton house here  i have nothing to do with it he replied you persuaded me to allow you to take it and i have lived with you there i never pretended however to be able to contribute to its upkeep you can live there if you choose or wherever else you please  alone  it would be more reputable  you mean that you will not return there  i do mean that  his cold firmness daunted her she was besides at a disadvantage she had no idea how much he knew  i can make you come back to me if i choose she threatened  the attempt would cost you a great deal of money he told her and the result would be the same frankly stella he went on striving to impart a note of friendliness into his tone we made a bad bargain and it is no use clinging to the impossible i have tried to keep my end of it technically i have kept it if i have failed in other ways i am very sorry the whole thing was a mistake we have been frank about it more than once so we may just as well be frank about it now i married for money and you for position i have not found your money any particular advantage and i have realised that as a man gets on in life there are other and more vital things which he misses though making such a bargain you are not satisfied with your position and perhaps you too have something of the same feeling that i have you are your own mistress and you are a very rich woman and in whichever direction you may decide to seek for a larger measure of content you will not find me in the way   i am not sentimental she said coldly i know what i want and i am not afraid to own it i want to be a peeress  in that respect i am unable to help you he replied and in case i have not made myself sufficiently clear upon the subject let me tell you that i deeply resent the plot by which you endeavoured to foist such an indignity upon me  this is your last word she demanded  absolutely  then i demand that you set me free  he was a little staggered  how on earth can i do that  you can allow me to divorce you  and spoil any chance i might have of reentering political life he remarked quietly  i have no further interest in your political life she retorted  he looked at her steadfastly  there is another way he suggested i might divorce you  her eyes fell before the steely light in his she did her best however to keep her voice steady  that would not suit me she admitted i could not be received at court and there are other social penalties which i am not inclined to face in the case of a disagreement like ours if the man realises his duty it is he who is willing to bear the sacrifice  under some circumstances yes he agreed in our case however there is a certain consideration upon which i have forborne to touch  it was as much her anger as anything else which induced her lack of selfcontrol she gave a little cry  andrew you are detestable she exclaimed let us end this conversation you have said all that you wish to say  everything  please go away then she begged i am expecting visitors i think that we understand each other  he rose to his feet  i am sorry for our failure stella he said pray do not hesitate to write to me at any time if my advice or assistance can be of service  he passed down the lounge more crowded now than when he had entered a very fashionably dressed young woman one of a smart tea party leaned back in her chair as he passed and held out her hand  and how does town seem mr tallente after your sylvan solitude she asked  tallente for a moment was almost at a loss then a glance into her really very wonderful eyes and the curve of her lips as she smiled convinced him of the truth which he had at first discarded  miss miall he exclaimed  please dont look so surprised she laughed i suppose you think i have no right to be frivolling in these very serious times but i am afraid i am rather an offender when the humour takes me you kept your word to mr dartrey i see  tallente nodded  i came to town yesterday  i must hear all the news please she insisted will you come and see me tomorrow afternoon i share a flat with another girl in westminsternumber 13 brown square  i shall be delighted he answered i think your hostess wants to speak to me she is an old friend of my aunt  he moved on a few steps and bowed over the thin overbejewelled fingers of the countess of clanarton an old lady whose vogue still remained unchallenged although the publication of her memoirs had very nearly sent a highly respected publisher into prison  andrew she exclaimed we are all so distressed about you how dared you lose your election you know my little fireeating friend i see i keep in with her because when the revolution comes she is going to save me from the guillotine arent you nora  my revolution wont have anything to do with guillotines the girl laughed back and if you really want to have a powerful friend at court pin your faith on mr tallente  lady clanarton shook her head  i have known andrew my dear since he was in his cradle she said i have heard him spout socialism and i know he has written about revolutions but believe me hes a good oldfashioned whig at heart hell never carry the red flag i see your wife has bought the maharajaim of sapongs pearls andrew do you think shed leave them to me if i were to call on her  why not ask her tallente suggested she is over there  dear me so she is she exclaimed how smart too i thought when she came in she must be some one not quite respectable she was so welldressed going andrew well come and see me before you return to the country and i wouldnt go and have tea with that little hussy if i were you shell burn the good oldfashioned principles out of you if anything could  not later than five please nora called out you shall have muffins if i can get them  shes got her eye on you the old lady chuckled most dangerous child in london they all tell me youre warned andrew  he smiled as he raised her fingers to his lips  is my danger political or otherwise he whispered  otherwise i should think was the prompt retort you are too british to change our politics but thank goodness infidelity is one of the cosmopolitan virtues you were never the man to marry a plastercast type of wife andrew for all her millions i could have done better for you than that whats this they are telling me about tony palliser  tallente stiffened a little  a good many people seem to be talking about tony palliser he observed  you shouldnt have let your wife make such an idiot of herself with himlunching and dining and theatring all the time and now they say he has disappeared poor little man what have you done to him andrew  tallente sighed  i can see that i shall have to take you into my confidence he murmured  you neednt tell me a single word because i shouldnt believe you if you did are you staying here with your wife  no tallente answered i am back at my old rooms in charges street  the old lady patted him on the arm and dismissed him  you see ive found out all i wanted to know she chuckled    chapter xii  dartrey had been called unexpectedly to the north to a great labour conference and tallente waiting for his return promised within the next fortyeight hours found himself rather at a loose end he avoided the club where he would have been likely to meet his late political associates and spent the morning after his visit to the prime minister strolling around the park paying visits to his tailor and hosier and lunched by himself a little sadly in a fashionable restaurant at five oclock he found his way to westminster and discovered nora mialls flat a busy young person in pincenez and a long overall who announced herself as miss mialls secretary was in the act of showing out james miller as he rang the bell any news the latter asked after tallente had found it impossible to avoid shaking hands i am waiting for mr dartreys return no there is no particular news that i know of  dartreys had to go north for a few days miller confided officiously i ought to have gone too but some one had to stay and look after things in the house rather a nuisance his being called away just now  tallente preserved a noncommittal silence miller rolled a cigarette hastily took up his unwrapped umbrella and an illbrushed bowler hat  well i must be going he concluded if there is anything i can do for you during the chiefs absence look me up mr tallente its all the same you knowdartrey or medemos house in parliament street or the house you havent forgotten your way there yet i expect  with which parting shaft mr james miller departed and the secretary opening the door of noras sitting room ushered tallente in  mr tallente she announced with a subdued smile fresh from a most engaging but rather onesided conversation with mr miller  nora was evidently neither attired nor equipped this afternoon for a tea party at claridges she wore a dark blue princess frock buttoned right up to the throat her hair was brushed straight back from her head revealing a little more completely her finely shaped forehead she was seated before a round table covered with papers and tallente fancied even as he crossed the threshold that there was an electric atmosphere in the little apartment an impression which the smouldering fire in her eyes as she glanced up confirmed the change in her expression however as she recognised her visitor was instantaneous a delightful smile of welcome chased away the sombreness of her face  my dear man she exclaimed come and sit down and help me to forget that annoying person who has just gone out  tallente smiled  miller is not one of your favorites then  isnt he the most impossible person who ever breathed she replied he was a conscientious objector during the war a sex fanatic sincemr dartrey had to use all his influence to keep him out of prison for writing those scurrulous articles in the cometand i think he is one of the smallestminded most untrustworthy persons i ever met for some reason or other stephen dartrey believes in him he has a wonderful talent for organization and a good deal of influence with the trades unionsby the by its all right about the muffins  she rang the bell and ordered tea tallente glanced for a moment about the room the four walls were lined with wellfilled bookcases but the mural decorations consistedexcept for one wonderful nude figure copy of a wellknown rodinof statistical charts and shaded maps there were only two signs of feminine occupation an immense bowl of red roses rising with strange effect from the sea of manuscript pamphlets and volumes of reference and a wide luxurious couch drawn up to the window through which the tops of a little clump of lime trees were just visible as she turned back to him he noticed with more complete appreciation the lines of her ample but graceful figure the more remarkable because she was neither tall nor slim  so that was your wife at claridges yesterday afternoon she remarked a little abruptly  he assented in silence her eyes sought his speculatively  i know that lady clanarton is a terrible gossip she went on was she telling me the truth when she said that your married life was not an entire success  she was telling you the truth tallente admitted  i like to know everything she suggested quietly you must remember that we shall probably become intimates  i did my wife the injustice of marrying her for money tallente explained she married me because she thought that i could provide her with a social position such as she desired our marriage was a double failure i found no opportunity of making use of her money and she was discontented with the value she received for it we have within the last few days agreed to separate now you know everything he added with a little smile and curiously enough considering the brevity of our acquaintance you know it before anybody else in the world except one person  she smiled  i like to know everything about the people i am interested in she admitted besides your story sounds so quaint it seems to belong somehow or other to the days of anthony trollope and jane austen i suppose that is because i always feel that i am living a little way in the future  tea was brought in and a place cleared for the tray upon a crowded table afterwards she lit a cigarette and threw herself upon the lounge  turn your chair around towards me she invited this is the hour i like best of any during the day do you see what a beautiful view i have of the houses of parliament and there across the river behind that mist the cesspool begins sometimes i lie here and think i see right into bermondsey and rotherhithe and all those places and think out the lives of the people as they are being lived then i look through those wonderful windows therehow they glitter in the sunshine dont theyand i think i hear the men speak whom they have sent to plead their cause some demosthenes from tower hill exhausts himself with phrasemaking shouts himself into a perspiration drawing lurid pictures of hideous and apparent wrongs and a hundred or so welldressed legislators whisper behind the palms of their hands make their plans for the evening and trot into their appointed lobbies like sheep when the division bell rings it is the most tragical epitome of inadequacy the world has ever known  have you democrats any fresh inspiration then he asked  of course we have she rapped out sharply it isnt like you to ask such a question the principles for which we stand never existed before except academically no party has ever been able to preach them within the realm of practical politics because no party has been comprehensive enough the labour party as it was understood ten years ago was a pitiful conglomeration of selfish atoms without the faintest idea of coordination it is for the souls of the people we stand we democrats whether they belong to trades unions or not whether they till the fields or sweat in the factories whether they bend over a desk or go back and forth across the sea whether they live in small houses or large whether they belong to the respectable middle classes whom the afterthewar legislation did its best to break or to the class of actual manual laborers  i dont see what place a man like miller has in your scheme of things he observed a little restlessly  she shrugged her shoulders  miller is a limpet she said he has posed as a man of brains for half a generation his only real cleverness is an unerring but selfish capacity for attaching himself to the right cause we cant ignore him he has a following on the other hand he does not represent our principles any more than pitt would if he were still alive  what will be your position really as regards the two main sections of the labour party he asked we are absorbing the best of them day by day she answered quickly what is left of either will be merely the scum the people will come to us their discarded leaders can crawl back to obscurity the people may follow false gods for a very long time but they have the knack of recognising the truth when it is shown them  you have the gift of conviction he said thoughtfully  she shrugged her shoulders  our cause speaks not i she declared every word i utter is a waste of breath a task of supererogation you cant associate with stephen dartrey for a month without realising for yourself what our party means and stands for soenough i didnt ask you here to undertake any missionary work i asked you as a matter of fact for my own pleasure take another cigarette and pass me one please and heres another cushion she added throwing it to him you look as though you needed it he settled down more comfortably he had the pleasant feeling of being completely at his ease  so far as entertaining you is concerned he confessed i fear i am likely to be a failure i am beginning to feel like a constant note of interrogation there is so much i want to know  proceed then i am resigned she said with a smile about yourself i just knew of you as the writer of one or two articles in the reviews why have i never heard more of you  one reason she confided is because i am so painfully young i havent had time yet to become a wonderful woman you see i have the tremendous advantage of not having known the world except from underneath a pigtail while the war was on i was able to bring to these new conditions an absolutely unbiassed understanding  but what was your upbringing he asked your father for instance  is this going to be a pill for you she enquired with slightly wrinkled forehead he was professor of english at dresden university we were all living there when the war broke out but he was such a favourite that they let us go to paris he died there the week after peace was declared my mother still lives at versailles she was governess to lady clanartons grandchildren hence my presence yesterday in those aristocratic circles  and you live here alone  with my secretarythe fuzzyhaired young person who was just getting rid of mr miller for me when you arrived we are a terribly advanced couple in our ideas but we lead a thoroughly reputable life i sometimes think she went on with a sigh that all ones tendencies towards the unusual can be got rid of in opinions susan for instancethat is my secretarys namepronounces herself unblushingly in favour of free love but i dont think she has ever allowed a man to kiss her in her life  your own opinions he asked curiously i suppose they too are a little revolutionary so far as regards our social laws  i dare not even define them she acknowledged they are so entirely negative somehow or other i cant help thinking that the present system will die out through the sheer absurdity of it we really shant need a crusade against the marriage laws the whole system is committing suicide as fast as it can  how old are you he asked  twentyfour she answered promptly  and supposing you fell in lovetaking it for granted that you have not done so alreadyshould you marry  her eyes rested upon his a little narrowed curiously and pleasantly reflective all the time the corners of her sensitive mouth twitched a little  to tell you the truth she confided with a somewhat evasive air i have been so busy thinking out life for other people that i have never stopped to apply its general principles to myself  you are a sophist he declared  i have not your remarkable insight she laughed mockingly    chapter xiii  how this came about i dont even quite know tallente remarked an hour or so later as he laid down the menu and smiled across the corner table in the little soho restaurant at his two companions  i can tell you exactly nora declared you are in town for a few days only and i want to see as much of you as i can susan here is deserting me at nine oclock to go to a musical comedy i particularly wanted a sole georges and i knew if susan and i came here alone a person whom we neither of us like would come and share our table therefore i made artless enquiries as to your engagements for the evening when i found that you proposed to dine alone in some hidden place rather than run the risk of meeting any of your political acquaintances at the club i went in for a little mental suggestion  i see he murmured then my invitation wasnt a spontaneous one  not at all she agreed i put the idea into your head  and now that we are here are you going to stretch me on the rack and delve for my opinions on all sorts of subjects is miss susan there going to take them down in shorthand on her cuff and you make a report to dartrey when he comes back tomorrow  she laughed at him from underneath her closefitting becoming little hat she was biting an olive with firm white teeth  after hours she reassured him susan and i are going to talk a little nonsense after the days work you may join in if you can unbend so far we shall probably eat more than is good for usi had a cup of coffee for lunchand if you decide to be magnificent and offer us wine we shall drink it and talk more nonsense than ever  he called for the wine list  i thought we were going to discuss the effect of grecian philosophy upon the roman system of government  she shook her head  youre a long way out she declared our conversation will skirt the edges of many subjects we shall speak of the russian ballet susan and i will exchange a few whispered confidences about our admirers we shall discuss even one who comes in and goes out with subtle references to their clothes and morals and when you and i are left alone we may even indulge in the wholesome sentimental exercise of a little flirtation  there you have me he confessed i know a little about everything else you have mentioned  a very good opening she approved keep it till susan has gone and then propose yourself as a disciple there is only one drawback about this place she went on nodding curtly across the room to miller so many of our own people come here mr miller must be pleased to see us together  why tallente asked is he an admirer  noras face was almost ludicrously expressive  he would like to he she admitted but thickskinned though he is i have managed to make him understand pretty well how i feel about him youll find him a thorn in your side she went on reflectively  you see if our party has a fault it is in a certain lack of system we have only a titular chief and no real leader miller thinks that post is his by predestination your coming is beginning to worry him already it was entirely on your account he paid me that visit this afternoon  to be perfectly frank with you tallente sighed i should find miller a loathsome coadjutor  there are drawbacks to everything in life nora replied long before miller has become anything except a nuisance to you you will have realised that the only political party worth considering during the next fifty years at any rate will be the democrats after that i shouldnt be at all surprised if the aristocrats didnt engineer a revolution especially if we disenfranchise themsusan you have a new hat on tell me at once with whom you are going to dalys  no one who counts the girl declared with a little grimace i am going with my brother and a very sober married friend of his  after working hours nora confessed glancing critically at the sole which had just been tendered for tallentes examination the chief interest of susan and myself as you may have observed lies in food and in your sex i think we must have what some nasty german woman once called the manhunger  it sounds cannibalistic tallente rejoined have i any cause for alarm  not so far as i am concerned susan assured him i have really found my man only he doesnt know it yet i am trying to get it into his brain by mental suggestion  you wouldnt think susan would be so much luckier than i would you nora observed studying her friend reflectively i am really much betterlooking but i think she must have more taking ways you neednt be nervous mr tallente you are outside the range of our ambitions i shall have to be content with some one in a humbler walk of life  arent you a little overmodest he asked you havent told me much about the social side of this new era which you propose to inaugurate but i imagine that intellect will be the only aristocracy  even then norah sighed i am lacking in confidence to tell you the truth i am not a great believer in my own sex i dont see us occupying a very prominent place in the politics of the next few decades the functions of woman were decided for her by nature and a million years of revolt will never alter them  tallente was a little surprised  you mean that you dont believe in woman member of parliament doctors and lawyers and that sort of thing  in a general way certainly not she replied women doctors for women and children yes lawyersno members of parliamentcertainly not women were made for one thing and to do that properly should take all the energy they possess  you are full of surprises tallente declared i expected a miracle of complexity and i find you almost primitive she laughed then considering the sort of man you are i ought to have gone up a lot in your estimation  there are a very few higher notches he assured her smiling than the one where you now sit enthroned  nora glanced at her wrist watch  susan dear what time do you have to join your friends she asked  susan shook her head  nothing doing ive got my seat i am going when ive had my dinner comfortably theres fried chicken coming and no considerations of friendship would induce me to hurry away from it  nora sighed plaintively  there is no doubt about it women do lack the sporting instinct she lamented now if wed both been men and mr tallente a charming woman i should have just given you a wink you would have muttered something clumsy about an appointment shuffled off and finished your dinner elsewhere  our sex isnt capable of such sacrifices susan declared leaning back to enable the waiter to fill her glass theres the champagne too  the meal came to a conclusion with scarcely another serious word susan departed in due course and tallente called for his bill a short time afterwards with a feeling of absolute reluctance  shall we try and get in at a show somewhere he suggested  she shook her head  not tonight four nights a week i go to bed early and this is one of them lets escape if we can before mr miller can make his way over here i know hell try and have coffee with us or something  tallente was adroit and they left the restaurant just as miller was rising to his feet nora sprang into the waiting taxi with a little laugh of triumph and drew her skirts on one side to make room for her escort they drove slowly off along the hot and crowded street with its longdrawnout tangle of polyglot shops foreignlooking restaurants and delicatessen establishments every one who was not feverishly busy was seated either at the open windows of the second or third floor or out on the pavement below the city seemed to be exuding the soakedin heat of the long summers day the women who floated by were dressed in the lightest of muslins even the plainest of them gained a new charm in their airy and butterflylooking costumes the men walked bareheaded waistcoatless fanning themselves with straw hats here and there as they turned into shaftesbury avenue an immaculately turnedout young man in evening dress passed along the baked pavements and dived into one of the theatres notwithstanding the heat there seemed to be a sort of voluptuous atmosphere brooding over the crowded streets the sky over piccadilly circus was almost violet and the luminous unneeded lamps had a festive effect the strain of a long day had passed it was the pleasureseekers alone who thronged the thoroughfares tallente turned and looked into the corner of the cab to meet a soft reflective gleam in noras eyes  isnt london wonderful she murmured dreamily on a night like this it always seems to me like a great human being whose pulses you can see heating beating all the time  tallente a person very little given to selfanalysis never really understood the impulse which prompted him to lean towards her the slightly quickening sense of excitement with which he sought for the kindness of her eyes suddenly he felt his fingers clasped in hers a warm pleasant grasp yet which somehow or other seemed to have the effect of a barrier  you asked me a question at dinnertime she said winch i did not answer at the time you asked me why i disliked james miller so much  dont tell me unless you like he begged dont talk about that sort of person at all just now unless you want to  i must tell you why i dislike him so much she insisted it is because he once tried to kiss me  was that so terrible a sin he asked a little thickly  she smiled up at him with the candour of a child  to me it was she acknowledged because it was just the casual caress of a man seeking for a momentary emotion sometimes you have wonderedor you have looked as though you were wonderingwhat my ideas about men and women and the future and the marriage laws and all that sort of thing really are perhaps i havent altogether made up my mind myself but i do know this because it is part of myself and my life the one desire i have is for childrensons for the state or daughters who may bear sons there isnt anything else which it is worth while for a woman thinking about for a moment and yet do you know i never actually think of marrying i never think about whether love is right or wrong i simply think that no man shall ever kiss me or hold me in his arms unless it is the man who is sent to me for my desire and when he comes just whoever he may be or whenever it may be and whether st georges opens its doors to us or whether we go through some tangle of words at a registry office or whether neither of these things happens i really do not mind when he comes he will give me what i wantthat is just all that counts and until he comes i shall stay just as i have been ever since my pigtail went up and my skirts came down  she gave his hand a final little pressure patted and released it he felt somehow or other immeasurably grateful to her flattered by her confidence curiously exalted by her hesitating words speech however he found an impossibility  so you see she concluded sitting up and speaking once more in her conversational manner i am not a bit modern really am i i am just as primitive as i can be longing for the things all women long for and unashamed to confess my longing to any one who has the gift of understanding any one who walks with his eyes turned towards the clouds  their taxicab stopped outside the building in which her little flat was situated she handed him the door key please turn this for me she begged i am at home every afternoon between five and seven come and see me whenever you can he opened the door and she passed in looking back at him with a little wave of the hand before she vanished lightly into the shadows tallente dismissed the cab and walked back towards his rooms his lightheartedness was passing away with every step he took the cheerful little groups of pleasureseekers he encountered seemed like an affront to his increasing melancholy once more he had to reckon with this strange new feeling of loneliness which had made its disturbing entrance into his thoughts within the last few years it was as though a certain weariness of life and its prospects had come with the temporary cessation of his daybyday political work and as though an unsuspected desire terrified at the passing years was tugging at his heartstrings in the desperate call for some tardy realisation    chapter xiv  tallente met the prime minister walking in the park early on the following morning the latter had established the custom of walking from knightsbridge barracks where his car deposited him to marble arch and back every morning and it had come to be recognised as his desire and a part of the etiquette of the place that he should be allowed this exercise without receiving even the recognition of passersby on this occasion however he took the initiative stopped tallente and invited him to talk with him  i thought of writing to you tallente he said i cannot bring myself to believe that you were in earnest on wednesday morning  absolutely the other assured him i have an appointment with dartrey in an hours time to close the matter  the prime minister was shocked and pained  you will dig your own grave he declared the idea is perfectly scandalous you propose to sell your political birthright for a mess of pottage  i am afraid i cant agree with you sir tallente regretted i am at least as much in sympathy with the programme of the democratic party as i am with yours  in that case was the somewhat stiff rejoinder there is i fear nothing more to be said  there was a brief silence tallente would have been glad to make his escape but found no excuse  when we beat germany horlock ruminated the man in the street thought that we had ensured the peace of the world who could have dreamed that a nation who had played such an heroic part which had imperiled its very existence for the sake of a principle was all the time rotten at the core  i will challenge you to repeat that statement in the house or on any public platform sir tallente objected the present state of discontent throughout the country is solely owing to the shocking financial mismanagement of every chancellor of the exchequer and lawmaker since peace was signed we won the war and the people who had been asked to make heroic sacrifices were simply expected to continue them afterwards as a matter of course what chance has the man of moderate means had to improve his position to save a little for his old age during the last ten years a third of his income has gone in taxation and the cost of everything is fifty per cent more than it was before the war and we won it mind that is what he cant understand we won the war and found ruin  legislation has done its best the prime minister said to assist in the distribution of capital  legislation was too slow tallente answered bluntly legislation is only playing with the subject now you sneer at the democratic party but they have a perfectly sound scheme of financial reform and they undertake to bring the income tax down to two shillings in the pound within the next three years  theyll ruin half the merchants and the manufacturers in the country if they attempt it  how can they ruin them tallente replied the factories will be there the trade will be there the money will still be there the financial legislation of the last few years has simply been a blatant nursing of the profiteer  i need not say tallente that i disagree with you entirely his companion declared at the same time i am not going to argue with you to tell you the truth i spent a great part of last night with you in my thoughts we cannot afford to let you go supposing now that i could induce watkinson to give up kendal his seat is quite safe and with a little reshuffling you would be able to slip back gradually to your place amongst us  tallente shook his head  i am very sorry sir he said but my decision is taken i have come to the conclusion that with proper handling and amalgamation the democrats are capable of becoming the only sound political party at present possible if stephen dartrey is still of the same mind when i see him this morning i shall throw in my lot with theirs  the prime minister frowned he recognised bitterly an error in tactics the ranks of his own party were filled with brilliant men without executive gifts it was for that reason he had for the moment ignored tallente he realised however that in the opposite camp no man could be more dangerous  this thing seems to me really terrible tallente he protested gravely after all however much we may ignore it there is what we might call a clannishness amongst englishmen of a certain order which has helped this country through many troubles you are going to leave behind entirely the companionship of your class you are going to cast in your lot with the riffraff of politics the mealymouthed anarchist only biding his time the blatant bolshevist talking of compromise with his tongue in his cheek the tubthumper out to confiscate every ones wealth and start a public house you wont know yourself in this gallery  tallente shook his head  these people he admitted are full of their extravagances although i think that the types you mention are as extinct as the dodo but i will admit their extravagances only to pass on to tell you this i claim for them that they are the only political party even with their strange conglomeration of material which possesses the least spark of spirituality i think and their programme proves it that they are trying to look beyond the crying needs of the moment trying to frame laws which will be lasting and just without pandering to capital or factions of any sort i think that when their time comes they will try at least to govern this country from the loftiest possible standard  the prime minister completed his walk the enjoyment of which tallente had entirely spoilt he held out his hand a little pettishly  politics he said is the one career in which men seldom recover from their mistakes i hope that even at the eleventh hour you will relent it will be a grief to all of us to see you slip away from the reputable places  the right honourable john augustus horlock stepped into his motorcar and drove away tallente after a glance at his watch called a taxi and proceeded to keep his appointment at demos house the great block of buildings where dartrey had established his headquarters in the large open waiting room where he was invited to take a seat he watched with interest the faces of the passersby there seemed to be visitors from every class of the community a board of trade official was there to present some figures connected with the industry which he represented half a dozen operatives personally conducted by a local leader had travelled up that morning from one of the great manufacturing centres a wellknown writer was there waiting to see the chief of the literary section tallente found his period of detention all too short he was summoned in to see dartrey who welcomed him warmly  sit down tallente he invited we are both of us men who believe in simple things and direct action have you made up your mind  i have tallente announced i have broken finally with horlock i have told him that i am coming to you  dartrey leaned over and held out both his hands the spiritual side of his face seemed at that moment altogether in the ascendant he welcomed tallente as the head of a great religious order might have welcomed a novice he was full of dignity and kindliness as well as joy  you will help us to set the world to rights he said alas that is only a phrase but you will help us to let in the light remember he went on that there may be moments of discouragement much of the material we have to use the people we have to influence the way we have to travel may seem sordid but the light is shining there all the time tallente we are not politicians we are deliverers  it was one of dartreys rare moments of genuine enthusiasm his visitor forgot for a moment the businesslike office with its row of telephones its shelves of blue books and masses of papers he seemed to be breathing a new and wonderful atmosphere  i am your man dartrey he promised simply make what use of me you will  dartrey smiled once more the plain kindly man of affairs  to descend then very much to the earth he said tonight you must go to bradford odames will resign tomorrow this time he added with a little smile i think i can promise you the democratic support and a very certain election    book two  chapter i  tallente found himself possessed of a haunting almost a morbid feeling that a lifetime had passed since last his car had turned out of the station gates and he had seen the moorland unroll itself before his eyes there was a new pungency in the autumn air an unaccustomed scantiness in the herbiage of the moor and the low hedges growing from the top of the stone walls the glory of the heather had passed though here and there a clump of brilliant yellow gorse remained the telegraph posts leaning away from the wind seemed somehow scantier the road stretched between them lonely and desolate from a farmhouse in the bosom of the treehung hills lights were already twinkling and when he reached the edge of the moor and the sea spread itself out almost at his feet the shapes of the passing steamers with their long trail of smoke were blurred and uncertain below his home field his wallenclosed patch of kitchen garden the long low house itself lay like pieces from a childs playbox stretched out upon the carpet only tonight there was no mist they made their cautious way downwards through the clearest of darkening atmospheres on the hillsides as they dropped down they could hear the music of an occasional sheep bell rabbits scurried away from the headlights of the car an early owl flew hooting over their heads tallente tired with his journey perhaps a little worn with the excitement of the last two months found something dark and a little lonely about the unoccupied house something a little dreary in his solitary dinner and the long evening spent with no company save his books and his pipe later on he lay for long awake watching the twin lights flash out across the channel and listening to the melancholy call of the owls as they swept back and forth across the lawn to their secret abodes in the cliffs when at last he slept however he slept soundly an unlookedfor gleam of sunshine and the dull roar of the incoming tide breaking upon the beach below woke him the next morning long after his usual hour he bathed shaved in front of the open window and breakfasted with an absolute renewal of his fuller interest in life it was not until he had sent back the car in which he had driven as far as the station and was swinging on foot across woolhanger moor that he realised fully why he had come why he had schemed for these two days out of a life packed with multifarious tasks then he laughed at himself heartily yet a little selfconsciously a fools errand might yet be a pleasant one even though his immediate surroundings seemed to mock the sound of his mirth woolhanger moor in november was a drear enough sight there were many patches of black mud and stagnant water carpets of treacherouslooking green moss bare clumps of bushes bent all one way by the northwest wind masses of rock gaunter and sterner now that their summer covering of creeping shrubs and bracken had lost their foliage it was indeed the month of desolation every scrap of colour seemed to have faded from the dripping wet landscape phantasmal clouds of grey mist brooded here and there in the hollows the distant hills were wreathed in vapour so that even the green of the pastures was invisible every now and then a snipe started up from one of the weedy places with his shrill mournful cry and more than once a solitary hawk hovered for a few minutes above his head the only other sign of life was a black speck in the distance a speck which came nearer and nearer until he paused to watch it standing upon a little incline and looking steadily along the rude cart track the speck grew in size a person on horsebacka woman soon she swung her horse around as though she recognised him jumped a little dike to reach him the quicker and reined up her horse by his side holding one hand down to him mr tallente she exclaimed how wonderful he held her hand looking steadfastly almost eagerly up into her flushed face her eyes were filled with pleasure his errand in those few breathless moments seemed no longer the errand of a fool  i cant realise it even now she went on drawing her hand away at last i pictured you at westminster in committee rooms and all sorts of places arent you forging weapons to drive us from our homes and portion out our savings  i have left the thunderbolts alone for one short weekend he answered i felt a hunger for this moorland air london becomes so enveloping jane sat upright upon her horse and looked at him with a mocking smile how ungallant i hoped you had come to atone for your neglect  have i neglected you he asked quietly turning and walking by her side  shockingly you lunched with me on the seventh of august i see you again on the second of november and i do believe that i shall have to save you from starvation again  its quite true he admitted i have a sandwich in my pocket though in case you were away from home  worse than ever she sighed you didnt even trouble to make enquiries  from whom should i robertmy servanthis wife and a boy to help in the garden are all my present staff at the manor robert drives the car and waits on me and his wife cooks they are estimable people but i dont think they are up in local news  you were quite safe she said looking ahead of her i am never away the tail end of a scat of rain beat on their faces from the hollow on their left the wind came booming up  i should have thought that for these few months just now he suggested you might have cared for a change  i have my work here such as it is she answered a little listlessly if i were in town for instance i should have nothing to do  you would meet people you must sometimes feel the need of society down here  i doubt whether i should meet the people who would interest me she replied and in any case i have my work here that keeps me occupied  they turned into the avenue and soon the long front of the house spread itself out before them jane who had been momentarily absorbed looked down at her companion  you are alone at the manor she asked  quite alone  she became the hostess directly they had passed the portals of the house she led him across the hall into her little sanctum  this is the room she told him in which i never do a stroke of worksacred to the frivolities alone i shall send morton in to see what you will have to drink while i change my habit you must have something after that walk i shant be long  for the second time she avoided meeting his eves as she left the room tallente stood on the hearthrug still looking at the closed door through which she had vanished puzzled a little chilled he gave his order to the attentive butler who presently appeared and who looked at him with covert interestthe press had been almost hysterically prodigal of his name during the last few weeks then he settled down to wait for her return with an impatience which became almost uncontrollable it seemed to him as he paced restlessly about that this little apartment which he remembered so well had in a measure changed was revealing a different atmosphere as though in sympathy with some corresponding change in its presiding spirit there was a huge and wellworn couch smothered with cushions and suggestive of a comfort almost voluptuous a large easychair into which he presently sank of the same character the wood logs burning in the grate gave out a pleasant sense of warmth he took more particular note of the volumes in the wellfilled bookcasesvolumes of poetry french novels with a fair sprinkling of modern english fiction there was a plaster cast of the paris magdalene over the door and one or two fine point etchings after the style of heillieu upon the walls there was no writing table in the room nor any signs of industry but a black oak gatetable was laden with magazines and fashion papers against the brown walls a clump of flaming yellow gorse leaned from a distant corner its faint almondlike fragrance mingling aromatically with the perfume of burning logs and a great bowl of dried lavender more than ever it seemed to tallente that the atmosphere of the room had changed had become in some subtle way at the same time more enervating and more exciting it was like a revelation of a hidden side of the woman who might indeed have had some purpose of her own in leaving him here he set down his empty glass with the feeling that vermouth was a heavier drink than he had fancied then a streak of watery sunshine filtered its way through the plantation and crept across the worn handsome carpet he felt a queer exultation at the sound of her footsteps outside she entered as she had departed without directly meeting his earnest gaze  i hope you have made yourself at home she said dear me how untidy everything is  she moved about altering the furniture a little making little piles of the magazines a graceful elegant figure in her dark velvet house dress with a thin band of fur at the neck she turned suddenly around and found him watching her this time she laughed at him frankly  sit down at once she ordered motioning him back to his easychair and coming herself to a corner of the lounge remember that you have a great deal to tell me and explain the newspapers say such queer things is it true that i really am entertaining a possible future prime minister  i suppose that might be he answered a little vaguely his eyes still fixed upon her so this is your room i like it and i like  well go on please she begged  i like the softness of your gown and i like the fur against your throat and neck and i like those buckles on your shoes and the way you do your hair  she laughed gracefully enough yet with some return to that note of uneasiness  you mustnt turn my head she protested you fresh from london which they tell me is terribly gay just now i want to understand just what it means your throwing in your lot with the democrats my uncle says for instance that you have abandoned respectable politics to become a tower hill pedagogue  respectable politics he replied if by that you mean the present government of the country have been in the wrong hands for so long that people scarcely realise what is undoubtedly the factthat the country isnt being governed at all a government with an opposition party almost as powerful as itself all made up of separate parties which are continually demanding sops can scarcely progress very far can it  but the democrats she ventured are surely only one of these isolated parties  i have formed a different idea of their strength he answered i believe that if a general election took place tomorrow the democrats would sweep the country i believe that we should have the largest working majority any government has had since the war  how terrible she murmured involuntarily truthful  your tame socialism isnt equal to the prospect he remarked a little bitterly  my tame socialism as you call it she replied draws the line at seeing the country governed by one class of person only and that class the one who has the least at stake in it  lady jane he said earnestly i am glad that i am here to point out to you a colossal mistake from which you and many others are suffering the democrats do not represent labour only  the small shopkeepers she suggested  nothing of the sort he replied the influence of my party has spread far deeper and further we number amongst our adherents the majority of the professional classes and the majority of the thinking people amongst the community of moderate means why if you consider the legislation of the last seven or eight years you will see how they have been driven to embrace some sort of socialism nothing so detestable and shortsighted as our financial policy has ever been known in the history of the world the middle classes meaning by the middle classes professional men and men of moderate means bore the chief burden of the war they submitted to terrible taxation to many privations besides the universal gift of their young blood we won the war and what was the result the wealth of the country through ghastly legislation drifted into the hands of the profiteering classes the wholesale shopkeepers the ship owners the factory owners the mine owners the professional man with two thousand a year was able to save a quarter of that before the war after the war taxation demanded that quarter and more for income tax thrust upon him an increased cost of living cut the ground from beneath his feet it isnt either of the two extremesthe aristocrat or the labouring manwhere you must look for the pulse of a countrys prosperity it is to the classes in between and lady jane they are flocking to our camp just as fast as they can just as fast as the country is heading for ruin under its present government  you are very convincing she admitted why have you not spoken so plainly in the house  the moment hasnt arrived tallente replied there will be a general election before many months have passed and that will be the end of the present fools paradise at st stephens  and then  we shant abuse our power he assured her what we aim at is a national party which will consider the interests of every class that is our reading of the term democrat our programme is not nearly so revolutionary as you are probably led to believe but we do mean to smooth away so far as we can from a practical point of view the inequalities of life we want to sweep away the last remnants of feudalism  tell me why they were so anxious to gather you into the fold she asked  i think for this reason he explained stephen dartrey is a brilliant writer a great orator and an inspired lawmaker the whole world recognises him as a statesman it is his name and genius which have made the democratic party possible on the other hand he is not in the least a politician he doesnt understand the game as it is played in the house of commons he lives above those things that is why i suppose they wanted me i have learnt the knack of apt debating and i understand the tricks even if ever i become the titular head of the party dartrey will remain the soul and spirit of it if they were not able to lay their hands upon some person like myself i believe that miller was supposed to have the next claim and i should think that miller is the one man in the world who might disunite the strongest party on earth  disunite it i should think he would disperse it to the four corners of the world she exclaimed  the butler announced luncheon she rose to her feet  i cannot tell you he said with a little sigh of relief as he held open the door for her how thankful i am that i happened to find you alone    chapter ii  luncheon was a pleasant even a luxurious meal for the woolhanger chef had come from the ducal household but it was hedged about with restraints which fretted tallente and rendered conversation monosyllabic it was served too in the larger dining room where the table reduced to its smallest dimensions still seemed to place a formidable distance between himself and his hostess a manservant stood behind lady janes chair and the butler was in constant attendance at the sideboard under such circumstances conversation became precarious and was confined chiefly to local topics when they left the room for their coffee they found it served in the hall tallente however protested vigorously  cant we have it served in your sitting room please he begged it is impossible to talk to you here there are people in the background all the time and you might have callers  she hesitated for a moment but yielded the point with the door closed and the coffee tray between them tallente drew a sigh of relief  i hope you dont think i am a nuisance he said bluntly but after all i came down from london purposely to see you  i am not so vain as to believe that she answered  it is nevertheless true and i think that you do believe it what have i done that you should all of a sudden build a fence around yourself  that may be she replied smiling for my own protection i can assure you that i am not used to têteatête luncheons with guests who insist upon having their own way in everything  i wonder if it is a good thing for you to be so much your own mistress he reflected  you must judge by results i always have beenat least since i decided to lead this sort of life  why have you never married he asked her a little abruptly  we discussed that before didnt we i suppose because the right man has never asked me  perhaps he ventured the right man isnt able to  perhaps there isnt any right man at allperhaps there never will be  the minutes ticked away the room with its mingled perfumes and pleasant warmth its manifold associations with her wholesome and orderly life seemed to have laid a sort of spell upon him she was leaning back in her corner of the lounge her hands hanging over the sides her eyes fixed upon the burning log she herself was so abstracted that he ventured to let his eyes dwell upon her to trace the outline of her slim but powerful limbs to admire her long delicate feet and hands the strong womanly face with its kindly mouth and soft almost affectionate eyes tallente who for the last ten years had looked upon the other sex as nonexistent crushed into an uninteresting negation for him owing to his wifes cold and shadowy existence twice within the last few months found himself pass in a different way under the greatest spell in life nora miall had provoked his curiosity had reawakened a dormant sense of sex without attracting it towards herself jane brought to him again from the first moment he had seen her that halfwistful recrudescence of the sentiment of his earlier days he was amazed to find how once more in her presence that sentiment had taken to itself fire and life how different a thing it was from those first dreams of her which had seemed like an echo from the period of his poetryreading youth of all women in the world she seemed to him now the most desirable that she was unattainable he was perfectly willing to admit even then he had not the strength to deny himself the doubtful joys of imagination with regard to her he revelled in her proximity because of the pleasure it gave him heedless or reckless of consequences between them in vastly different degrees these two women seemed to have brought him back something of his youth  the silence became noticeable led him at last into a certain measure of alarm  lady jane he ventured have i said anything to offend you  of course not she answered looking at him kindly  you are very silent are you afraid that i am going to attempt to make love to you  she was startled in earnest this time she sat up and looked at him disapprovingly there was a touch of the old hauteur in her tone  how can you be so ridiculous she exclaimed  would it be ridiculous of me  does it occur to you she asked that i am the sort of person to encourage attentions from a man who is not free to offer them  i had forgotten that he admitted quite frankly of course i see the point i have a wife even though of her own choosing she does not count  she exists  so do i  jane broke into a little laugh  now we are both being absurd she declared and i dont want to be and i dont want you to be of course you cant look at things just as i do you belong to a very large world you spend your life destroying obstacles all my people you know she went on look upon me as terribly emancipated they think my mild socialism and my refusal to listen to such a thing as a chaperon most terribly improper but at heart you know i am still a very conventional person i have torn down a great many conventions but there are some upon which i cannot bring myself even to lay my fingers  perhaps it wouldnt be you if you did he reflected  perhaps not  and yet he went on tell me are you wholly content here your life in its way is splendid you live as much for the benefit of others as for yourself you are encouraging the right principle amongst your yeomen and your farmers you are setting your heel upon feudalismyou the daughter of a race who have always demanded it you live amongst these wonderful surroundings you grow into the bigness of them nature becomes almost your friend it is one of the most dignified and beautiful lives i ever knew for a woman and yetare you wholly content  i am not she admitted frankly and listen she went on after a moments pause i will show you how much i trust you how much i really want you to understand me i am not completely happy because i know perfectly well that it is unnatural to live as i do if i met the man i could care for and who cared for me i should prefer to be married she had commenced her speech with the faintest tinge of colour burning underneath the wholesome sunburn of her cheeks she had spoken boldly enough even though towards the end of her sentence her voice had grown very low when she had finished however it seemed as though the memory of her words were haunting her as though she suddenly realised the nakedness of them she buried her face in her hands and he saw her shoulders heave as though she were sobbing he stood very close and for the first time he touched her he held the fingers of her hand gently in his dear lady jane he begged dont regret even for a moment that you have spoken naturally if we are to be friends to be anything at all to one another it is wonderful of you to tell me so sweetly what women take such absurd pains to conceal    when you look up let us start our friendship all over again only before you do listen to my confession if fifteen years could be rolled off my back and i were free it isnt political ambition i should look to for my guiding star i should have one far greater far more wonderful desire the fingers he held were gently withdrawn she drew herself up her forehead was wrinkled questioningly she forced a smile you would be very foolish she said if you tried to part with one of those fifteen years every one has brought you experiences every one has helped to make you what you are  and yet he began  he broke off abruptly in his speech the hall seemed suddenly full of voices jane rose to her feet at the sound of approaching footsteps she made the slightest possible grimace but tallente was oppressed with a suspicion that the interruption was not altogether unwelcome to her  some of my cousins and their friends from minehead she said i am so sorry i expect they have lost the hunt and come here for tea  the room was almost instantly invaded by a company of lighthearted noisy young people flushed with exercise and calling aloud for tea intimates all of them calling one another by their christian names speaking a jargon which sounded to tallente like another language he stayed for a quarter of an hour and then took his leave of the newcomers no one seemed to have an idea who he was no one seemed to care in the least whether he remained or went he was only able to snatch a word of farewell with jane at the door she shook her head at his whispered request  i am afraid not she answered how could i besides there is no telling when this crowd will go you are sure you wont let me send you home  tallente shook his head  the walk will do me good he said i get lazy in town but you are sure  the butler was holding open the door two of the girls had suddenly taken possession of jane she shook her head slightly  goodby she called out come and see me next time you are down  tallente was suddenly his old self grave and severe he bowed stiffly in response to the little chorus of farewells and followed the butler down the hall the latter who was something of a politician did his best to indicate by his manner his appreciation of tallentes position  you are sure you wont allow me to order a car sir he said with his hand upon the door i know her ladyship would be only too pleased its a long step to the manor and if youll forgive my saying so sir youve a good deal on your shoulders just now  tallente caught a glimpse of the bleak moorland and of the distant hills wrapped in mist the idea of vigorous exercise however appealed to him he shook his head  id rather walk thanks he said  its a matter of five miles sir  tallente smiled there was something in the fresh cold air wonderfully alluring after the atmosphere of the room he had quitted he turned his coat collar up and strode down the avenue    chapter iii  tallente reached the manor about an hour and a half later mudsplashed wet and weary robert followed him into the study and mixed him a whisky and soda  youve walked all the way back sir he remarked with a note of protest in his tone  they offered me a car tallente admitted i didnt want it i came down for fresh air and exercise  two very good things in their way sir but easily overdone was the mild rejoinder these hills are terrible unless youre at them all the time  tallente drank his whisky and soda almost greedily and felt the benefit of it although he was still weary he had walked for five miles in the company of ghosts and their faces had been grey perhaps too it was the passing of his youth which brought this tiredness to his limbs  robert he confessed abruptly i was a fool to come down here at all  its dreary at this time of the year unless youve time to shoot or hunt sir why not motor to bath tomorrow i could wire for rooms and i could drive you up to london the next day motorings a good way of getting the air sir and you wont overtire yourself  ill think of it in the morning his master promised  my wife has found the silver sir robert announced as he turned to leave the room and i managed to get a little fish that with some soup a pheasant and a fruit tart we thought  i shall be alone robert tallente interrupted there is no one coming for dinner  the mans disappointment was barely concealed he sighed as he took up the tray  very good sir your clothes are all out ill turn on the hot water in the bathroom  tallente threw off his rain and mudsoaked clothes bathed changed and descended to the dining room just as the gong sounded robert was in the act of moving the additional place from the little round dining table which he had drawn up closer to the wood fire but his master stopped him  you can let those things be he directed take away the champagne though i shant want that  robert bowed in silent appreciation of his masters humour and began ladling out soup at the sideboard tallentes lips were curled a little partly in selfcontempt with perhaps just a dash of selfpity it had come to this then that he must dine with fancies rather than alone that this tardily developed streak of sentimentality must be ministered to or would drag him into the depths of dejection he began to understand the psychology of its late appearance stellas artificial companionship had kept his thoughts imprisoned fettered with the meshes of an instinctive fidelity and had driven him sedulously to the solace of work and books now that it was removed and he was to all practical purposes a free man they took their own course his life had suddenly become a natural one and all that was human in him responded to the possibilities of his solitude he had had as yet no time to experience the relief to appreciate his liberty before he was face to face with this new loneliness tonight he thought as he looked at the empty place and remembered his wistful almost diffident invitation the solitude was almost unendurable if she had only understood how much it meant surely she would have made some effort would not have been content with that halfembarrassed halfdoubtful shake of the head in the darkened room with the throb of the sea and the crackling of the lop in his ears and only roberts silent form for company he felt a sudden craving for the things of his youth for another side of life the restaurants the bright eyes of women the whispered words of pleasant sentiment the perfume shaken into the atmosphere they created the low music in the background i beg your pardon sir robert said in his ear your soup gertrude has taken such pains with the dinner sir he added diffidently if i might take the liberty of suggesting it it would be as well if you could eat something tallente took up his spoon then they both started they both turned to the window a light had flashed into the room a low purring sound came from outside  a car sir robert exclaimed his face full of pleasurable anticipation if youll excuse me ill answer the door might it be the lady after all sir he hurried out tallente rose slowly to his feet he was listening intently the thing wasnt possible he told himself it wasnt possible then he heard a voice in the hall robert threw the door open and announced in a tone of triumph  lady jane partington sir  she came towards him smiling selfpossessed but a little interrogative he had a lightninglike impression of her beautiful shoulders rising from her plain black gown her delightfully easy walk the slimness and comeliness and stateliness of her  i know that i ought to be ashamed of myself for coming after i had told you i couldnt she said it will serve me right if youve eaten all the dinner but i do hope you havent  i had only just sat down he told her as he and robert held her chair and i think that this is the kindest action you ever performed in your life  robert his face glowing with satisfaction had become ubiquitous she had scarcely subsided into her chair before he was offering her a cocktail on a silver tray serving tallente with his forgotten glass at the sideboard ladling out soup out of the room and in again bringing back the rejected bottle of champagne  you will never believe that i am a sane person again she laughed after you had gone and all those foolish children had departed i felt it was quite impossible to sit down and dine alone i wanted so much to come and i realised how ridiculous it was of me not to have accepted at once at the last moment i couldnt bear it any longer so i rushed into the first gown i could find ordered out my little coupé and here i am  the most welcome guest who ever came to a lonely man he assured her a moment ago robert was complaining because i was sending my soup away now i shall show him what devon air can do  the champagne was excellent and the dinner over which gertrude had taken so much care was after all thoroughly appreciated tallente suddenly and unexpectedly lighthearted felt a keen desire to entertain his welcome guest and remembered his former successes as a raconteur they pushed politics and all personal matters far away he dug up reminiscences of his class in foreign capitals when he had first entered the diplomatic service betrayed his intimate knowledge of the florence which they both loved of paris where she had studied and which he had seen under so many aspectsparis the home of beauty and fashion before the war torn with anguish and horror during its earlier stages grim steadfast and sombre in the clays of verdun wildly madly exultant when wreathed and decorated with victory there were so many things to talk about for two people of agile brains come together late in life they had moved into the study and lady jane was sealed in his favourite easychair sipping her coffee and some wonderful green chartreuse before a single personal note had crept into the flow of their conversation  it cant be that i am in devonshire she said i never realised how much like a succession of pictures conversation can be you seem to remind me so much of things which i have kept locked away just because i have had no one to share them with  you are in devonshire all right he answered smiling you will realise it when you turn out of my avenue and face the hills you see youve dropped down from the fairyland of up over to the nesting place of the owls and the gulls  nine hundred feet she murmured thank heavens for my forty horsepower engine i want to see the sea break against your rocks she went on as she took the cigarette which he passed her there used to be a little path through your plantation to a place where you look sheer down dont you remember you took me there the first time i came to see you in august and i have never forgotten it  he rang the bell for her coat the night though windy and dark was warm stars shone out from unexpected places pencillike streaks of inkyblack clouds stretched menacingly across the sky the wind came down from the moors above with a dull boom which seemed echoed by the waves beating against the giant rocks the beads of the bare trees among which they passed were bent this way and that and the few remaining leaves rustled in vain resistance or yielding to the irresistible gusts sailed for a moment towards the skies to be dashed down into the evergrowing carpet the path was narrow and they walked in single file but at the bend he drew level with her walking on the seaward side and guiding her with his fingers upon her arm presently they reached the little circular space where rustic seats had been placed and leaned over a grey stone wall  there was nothing of the midsummer charm about the scene tonight sheer below them the sea driven by tide and wind rushed upon the huge masses of rock or beat direct upon the caveindented cliffs the spray leapt high into the air to be caught up by the wind in whirlpools little ghostly flecks luminous one moment and gone forever the next far away across the pitchy waters they could see at regular intervals a line of white where the breakers came rushing in here and there the agitated lights of passing steamers opposite the twin flares on the welsh coast and every sixty seconds the swinging white illumination from the lynmouth lighthouse shining up from behind the headland jane slipped one hand through his arm and stood there breathless rapturously watchful this is wonderful she murmured it is the one thing we have always lacked at woolhanger we get the booming of the windwonderful it is too like the hollow thunder of guns or the quick passing of an underground armybut we miss this i feel somehow as though i knew now why it tears past us uprooting the very trees that stand in its way it rushes to the sea what a meeting her hand tightened upon his arm as a great wave broke direct upon the cliff below and a torrent of wind rushing through the trees and downwards caught the spray and scattered it around them and high over their heads  we humans he whispered are taught our lesson  do we need it she asked with sudden fierceness do you believe that because some mysterious power imposes restraint upon us the passion isnt there all the while  she was suddenly in his arms the warm wind shrieking about them the darkness thick and soft as a mantle only he saw the anguished happiness in her eyes as they closed beneath his kisses  one moment out of life she faltered one moment  another great wave shook the ground beneath them but she had drawn away she struggled for breath then once more her hand was thrust through his arm he knew so well that his hour was over and he submitted  back please she whispered back through the plantationquietly  an almost supernatural instinct divined and acceded to her desire for silence so they walked slowly back towards the long low house whose faint lights flickered through the trees she leaned a little upon him the hand which she had passed through his arm was clasped in his only the wind spoke when at last they were en the terraces she drew a long breath  dear friend she said softly see how i trust you i leave in your keeping the most precious few minutes of my life  this is to be the end then he faltered  it is not we who have decided that she answered it is just what must be you go to a very difficult life a very splendid one i have my smaller task dont unfit me for it we will each do our best  her servant was waiting by the car his figure loomed up through the darkness you will come into the house for a few minutes he begged hoarsely she shook her head  why our farewells have been spoken i leave youso  the man had disappeared behind the bonnet of the car she grasped his hand with both of hers and brushed it lightly with her lips then she gilded away a moment later he was listening to her polite speeches as she leaned out of the coupé my dinner was too wonderful she said do make my compliments to that dear robert and his wife good luck to you and dont rob us poor landowners of every penny we possess in life  the car was gone in the midst of his vague little response he watched the lights go flashing up the hillside crawling around the hairpin corners up until it seemed that they had reached the black clouds and were climbing into the heavens then he turned back into the house the world was still a place for dreams    chapter iv  tallente sat in the morning train on his way to town and on the other side of the bare ridge at which he gazed so earnestly lady jane and segerson had brought their horses to a standstill half way along a rude cart track which led up to a farmhouse tucked away in the valley  this is where james crockfords land commences segerson remarked riding up to his companions side look around you i think you will admit that i have not exaggerated  she frowned thoughtfully on every side were evidences of poor farming and neglect the untrimmed hedges had been broken down in many places by cattle a plough which seemed as though it had been embedded there for ages stood in the middle of a halfploughed field several tracts of land which seemed prepared for winter sowing were covered with stones the farmhouse yard into which they presently passed was dirty and untidy segerson leaned down and knocked on the door with his whip after a short delay a slatternlylooking woman with tousled fair hair answered the summons  mr crockford in segerson asked  youll find him in the living room the woman answered curtly with a stare at lady jane heres himself  she retreated into the background a man with flushed face without collar or tie clad in trousers and shirt only had stepped out of the parlour he stared at his visitors in embarrassment  i came over to have a word or two with you on business mr crockford jane said coldly i rather expected to find you on the land  the man mumbled something and threw open the door of the sitting room  wont you come in he invited theres just mr pettigrew herethe vet from barnstaple hes come over to look at one of my cows  mr pettigrew also flushed rose to his feet jane acknowledged his greeting and glanced around the room it was untidy dirty and close smelling strongly of tobacco and beer on the table was a bottle of whisky half empty and two glasses  there is really no reason why i should disturb you jane said turning back upon the threshold a letter from mr segerson will do  crockford however had pulled himself together a premonition of his impending fate had already produced a certain sullenness  pettigrew he directed you get out and have another look at the cow if youve any business word to say to me your ladyship im here  jane looked once more around the squalid room watched the unsteady figure of pettigrew departing and looked back at her tenant  your lease is up on march the twentyfifth crockford she reminded him i have come to tell you that i shall not be prepared to renew it  the man simply blinked at her his fuddled brain was not equal to grappling with such a catastrophe  your farm is favourably situated she continued and although small has great possibilities i find you are dropping behind your neighbours and your crops are poorer each season have you saved any money crockford  saved any money the man blustered with shepherds wages alone at two pounds a week and a weeks rain starting in the day i began haymaking why my barley  you started your haymaking ten days too late segerson interrupted sternly you had plenty of warning and as for your barley you sold it in the kings arms at barnstaple when youd had too much to drink at thirty per cent below its value  jane turned towards the door  i need not stay any longer she said i wanted to look at your farm for myself mr crockford and i thought it only right that you should have early notice of my intention to ask you to vacate the place  the cold truth was finding its way into the mans consciousness it had a wonderfully sobering effect  look here maam he demanded is it true that you lent farmer holroyd four hundred pounds to buy his own farm and the crocombe brothers two hundred each  quite true jane replied coldly what of it  what of it the man repeated you lend them youngsters money and then you come to me a man whos been on this land for twentytwo years and youve nothing to say but get out where am i to find another farm at my time of life just answer me that will you  it is not my concern jane declared i only know that i decline to have any tenants on my property who do not do justice to the land when i see that they do justice to it then it is my wish that they should possess it it is true that i have lent money to some of the farmers round here but the greater part of what they have put down for the purchase of their holdings is savingsmoney they had saved and earned by working early and late by careful farming and husbandry by putting money in the bank every quarter youve had the same opportunity you have preferred to waste your time and waste your money youve had more than one warning you know crockford  aye more than a dozen segerson muttered  the man looked at them both and there was a dull hate gathering in his eyes  its easy to talk about saving money and working hard you that have got everything you want in life and no work to do he protested its enough to make a man turn socialist to listen to un  mr crockford jane said i am a socialist and if you take the trouble to understand even the rudiments of socialism you will learn that the drones have as small a part in that scheme of life as in any other you have a right to what you produce it is one of the pleasures of my life to help the deserving to enjoy what they produce it is also one of the duties when i find a nonproductive person filling a position to which his daily life and character do not entitle him to pull him up like a weed that is my idea of socialism mr crockford you will leave on march 25th  they rode homeward into a gathering storm a mass of black clouds was rolling up from the north and an unexpected wind came bellowing down the coombs bending the stunted oaks and dark pines and filling the air with sonorous but ominous music the hills around soon became invisible blotted out by fragments of the gathering mists the cold sleet stung their faces out on the moors was no sound but time tinkling of distant sheep bells  theres snow coming segerson muttered as he turned up his coat collar  it wont do any harm she answered the earth lies warm under it  the lights of parracombe precipitous and unexpected were like flecks in the sky wiped out by a sudden driving storm of sleet a little while later they cantered up the avenue to woolhanger and jane slipped from her horse with a little sigh of relief  youd better stay and have some tea mr segerson she invited john will take your horse and give him a rubdown  she changed her habit and forgetting her guest indulged in the luxury of a hot bath she descended some time later to find him sitting in front of the tea tray in the hall a more than usually gracious smile soon drove the frown from his forehead  i really am frightfully sorry she apologised as she handed him his tea i had no idea i was so wet youll have rather a bad ride home  oh im used to it he answered im afraid theyll lose a good many sheep on the higher farms though if the storm turns out as bad as it threatens hear that  a tornado of wind seemed to shake the ground beneath their feet jane shivered  i suppose she reflected that man crockford thought i was very cruel today  i will tell you crockfords point of view segerson replied he doesnt exactly understand what your aims are and wherever he goes he hears nothing but praise of the way you have treated your tenants and the way you have tried to turn them into small landowners he isnt intelligent enough to realise that there is a principle behind all this he has simply come to feel that he has a lenient landlord and that he has only to sit still and the plums will drop into his mouth too crockford is one of the weak spots in your system lady jane there is no place for him or his kind in a selfsupporting world  she sighed  then i am afraid he must go down she said he simply stands in the way of better men  one reads a good deal of mr tallente nowadays segerson remarked changing the conversation a little abruptly  jane leaned over and stroked the head of a dog which had come to lie at her feet  he seems to be making a good deal of stir she observed  the young man frowned  you know i am not unsympathetic with your views lady jane he said a little awkwardly but i dont mind admitting that if i had a big stake in the country i should be afraid of tallente no one seems to be able to pin him down to a definite programme and yet day by day his influence grows the labour party is disintegrated the best of all its factions are joining the democrats he is practically leader of the opposition party today and i dont see how they are going to stop his being prime minister whenever he chooses  dont you think hell make a good prime minister jane asked  no i dont was the curt answer he is too dark a horse for my fancy  i expect mr tallente will be ready with his programme when the time comes she observed he is a peoples man of course and his proposals will sound pretty terrible to a good many of the old school still something of the sort has to come  the butler brought in the postbag while they talked segerson as he rose to depart glanced with curiosity at half a dozen orangecoloured wrappers which were among the rest of the letters  fancy your subscribing to a presscutting agency lady jane he exclaimed you havent been writing a novel under a pseudonym have you  she laughed as she gathered up her correspondence in her hand  dont pry into my secrets she enjoined we may meet in barnstaple tomorrow if the weather clears i want to go in and see those cattle for myself  the young man took his reluctant departure jane crossed the hall entered her own little sanctum drew the lamp to the edge of the table and sank into her easychair with a little sigh of relief all the rest of her correspondence she threw to one side the orangecoloured wrappers she tore off one by one as she read her face softened and her eyes grew very bright the first cutting was a report of tallentes last speech in the house a clever and forceful attack upon the governments policy of compromise in the matter of recent strikes the next was a speech at the holborn town hall on workmens dwellings another a thoughtful appreciation of him from the pages of a great review there was also a eulogy from an american journal and a gloomy attack upon him in the chief whig organ when she had finished the pile she sat for some time gazing at the burning logs the little epitome of his daily lifethere were records there even of many of his social engagementsseemed to carry her into another atmosphere an atmosphere far removed from this lonely spot upon the moors she seemed to catch from those printed lines some faint reflective thrill of the more vital world of strife in which he was living for a moment the roar of london was in her ears she saw the lighted thoroughfares the crowded pavements the faces of the men and women all a little strained and eager so different from the placid immobility of the world in which she lived she rose to her feet and moved restlessly about the room presently she lifted the curtain and looked out there was a pause in the storm and a great mass of black clouds had just been driven past the face of the watery moon even the wind seemed to be holding its breath but so far as she could see moors and hillsides were wrapped in one unending mantle of snow there was no visible sign of any human habitation no sound from any of the birds or animals who were cowering in their shelters not even a sheep hell or the barking of a dog to break the profound silence she dropped the curtain and turned back to her chair her feet were leaden and her heart was heavy the struggle of the day was at an end memory was asserting itself she felt the flush in her cheek the quickening heat of her heart the thrill of her pulses as she lived again through those few wild minutes there was no longer any escape from the wild confusing truth the thing which she had dreaded had come    chapter v  the most popular hostess in london was a little thrilled at the arrival of the moment for which she had planned so carefully she laid her hand on tallentes arm and led him towards a comparatively secluded corner of the winter garden which made her own house famous i must apologise mrs van fosdyke he said for my late appearance i travelled up from devonshire this afternoon and found snow all the way we were nearly two hours late  it is all the more kind of you to have turned out at all then she told him warmly i dont mind telling you that i should have been terribly disappointed if you had failed me it has been my one desire for months to have you threethe prime minister lethbridge and youunder my roof at the same time  you find politics interesting over here tallente asked a little curiously  she flashed a quick glance at him  why i find them absolutely fascinating she declared the whole thing is so incomprehensible just look at tonight half of debrett is represented here practically the whole of the diplomats and yet except yourself not a single member of the political party who we are told will be ruling this country within a few months the very anomaly of it is so fascinating  there is no necessary kinship between society and politics tallente reminded her your own country for instance  mrs van fosdyke who was an american shrugged her shoulders  my own country scarcely counts she protested after all we came into being as a republic and our aristocracy is only a spurious conglomeration of people who are too rich to need to work but many of these people whom you see here tonight still possess feudal rights vast estates great names and yet over their heads there is coming this government in which they will be wholly unrepresented what are you going to do with the aristocracy mr tallente  encourage them to work he answered smiling  but they dont know how  they must learn no man has a right to his place upon the earth unless he is a productive human being there is no room in the world which we are trying to create for the parasite pure and simple  you are a very inflexible person mr tallente  there is no place in politics for the wobbler  do you know she went on glancing away for a moment that my rooms are filled with people who fear you the labour party as it was understood here five or six years ago never inspired that feeling there was something of the tubthumper about every one of them i think it is your repression mr tallente which terrifies them you dont say what you are going to do your programme is still a secret and yet every day your majority grows only an hour ago the prime minister told me that he couldnt carry on if you threw down the gage in earnest  tallente remained bland but became a little vague  i see foulds amongst your guests he observed have you seen his statue of perseus and andromeda  she laughed  i have but i am not going to discuss it of course i accept the hint but as a matter of fact i am a person to be trusted i ask for no secrets i have no position in this country even my sympathies are at present wobbling i am simply a little thrilled to have you here because the prime minister is within a few yards of us and i know that before many weeks are past the great struggle will come between you and him as to who shall guide the destinies of this country  you forget mrs van fosdyke he objected that i am not even the leader of my party stephen dartrey is our chief  she shook her head  dartrey is a brilliant person she admitted but we all know that he is not a practical politician the battle is between you and horlock  tallente was watching a woman go by a woman in black and silver whose walk reminded him of jane his hostess followed his eyes  you are one of alice mountgarrons admirers she enquired  i dont even know her he replied she reminded me of some one for a moment  she is one of the duchess of barminsters daughters his companion told him she married mountgarron last year her sister lady jane is rather inclined towards your political outlook she lives in devonshire and tries to do good  his eyes followed the woman in black and silver until she had passed out of sight the family likeness was there appealing to him curiously tugging at his heartstrings his artificial surroundings slipped easily away he was back on the moors he felt a sniff of the strong wind the wholesome exaltation of the empty places a more wonderful memory still was seeping in upon him his companion intervened chillingly  one never sees your wife nowadays mr tallente  my wife is in america he answered mechanically she has gone there to stay with some relatives  she is interested in politics  not in the least  mrs van fosdyke welcomed a newcomer with a gracious little smile and tallente rose to his feet horlock had left the group in the centre of the room and was making his way towards them  at least we can talk here he said shaking hands with tallente without any suggestion of a conspiracy the old gang you know he went on addressing his hostess simply close around me when i try to have a word with tallente they are afraid of some marvellous combination which is going to shut them out  lethbridge is the only one of them here tonight she observed and he is probably in one of the rooms where they are serving things now i must go back to my guests if i see him ill head him off  she strolled away the prime minister sank back upon a couch his air of wellbred content with himself and life fell away from him the moment his hostess was out of sight  tallente he said i suppose you mean to break us  i thought wed been rather friendly was the quiet reply weve been letting you have your own way for nearly a month  that is simply because we are on work which we are tackling practically in the fashion you dictated horlock pointed out when we have finished this irish business what are you going to do  i am not the leader of the party tallente reminded him  from a parliamentary point of view you are was the impatient protest dartrey is a dreamer he might even have dreamed away his opportunities if you hadnt come along miller would never have handled the house as you have miller was made to create factions you were made to coalesce to smooth over difficulties to bring men of opposite points of view into the same camp you are a genius at it tallente six months ago i was only afraid of the democrats now i dread them shall i tell you what it is that worries me most  if you think it wise  your absence of programme why dont you say what you want to dogive us some idea of how far you are going to carry your tenets are we to have the anarchy of bolshevists or the socialism of marxa red flag republic or a classical dictatorship  we are not out for anarchy at all events tallente assured him nor for revolutions in the ordinary sense of the word  you mean to upset the constitution  speaking officially i do not know speaking to you as a fellow politician i should say that sooner or later some changes are desirable  youll never get away from party government  perhaps not but i dare say we can find machinery to prevent the house of commons being used for a debating society  horlock whose sense of humour had never been entirely crushed by the exigencies of political leadership suddenly grinned  the old gang will commit suicide he declared if they arent allowed to spout theyll either wither or die old man lethbridges monthly attacks of highminded patriotism are the only things that keep him alive  i dont fancy tallente remarked that we shall abandon any of our principles for the sake of keeping lethbridge alive  what the mischief are your principles  no doubt dartrey would enlighten you if you chose to go to him was the indifferent reply within the course of the next few months we shall launch our thunderbolt you will know then what we claim for the people  hang the people horlock exclaimed ive legislated for them myself until im sick of it theyre never grateful  perhaps you confine yourself too much to one class tallente observed drily as a rule the less intelligent the voter the more easily he is caught by flashy legislation  the operative pure and simple horlock announced has no political outlook hell never see beyond his trades union youll never found a great national party with his aid  his companion smiled  then we shall fail and you will continue to be prime minister  mrs van fosdyke came back to them on the arm of a foreign diplomat she leaned over to horlock and whispered  lethbridge has heard that you two are here together and he is on your track better separate  she passed on the two men strolled away  have you any personal feeling against me tallente horlock asked  none whatever his companion assured him you did me the best turn in your life when you left me stranded after hellesfield  horlock sighed  lethbridge almost insisted he looked upon you as a firebrand he said there would be no repose about a cabinet with you in it  well its turned out for the best tallente remarked drily au revoir  on his way back to the reception rooms an acquaintance tapped him on the shoulder  one moment tallente lady alice mountgarron has asked me to present you  tallente bowed before the woman who stood looking at him pleasantly but a little curiously she held out her hand  i seem to have heard so much of you from my sister jane she said you are neighbours in devonshire arent you  neighbours from a devon mans point of view he answered i live halfway down a precipice and she five miles away at the back of a stygian moor and incidentally a thousand feet above me  you seem to have surmounted such geographical obstacles  your sisters friendship is worth greater efforts tallente replied  lady alice smiled  i wish that some of you could persuade her to come to town occasionally she said jane is a perfect dear of course and i know she does a great deal of good down there but i cant help thinking sometimes that she is a little wasted life must now and then be dreary for her tallente seemed for a moment to be looking through the walls of the room we are all made differently lady jane is very selfreliant and devonshire is one of those counties which have a curiously strong local hold  but when her moors and her farms are under snow and woolhanger is wreathed in mists and one hears nothing except the moaning of animals in distress what about the local attraction then  you speak feelingly tallente observed smiling i spent a fortnight with jane last winter she explains i had some idea of hunting never again only i miss jane she is such a dear and i dont see half enough of her  i saw her yesterday tallente said reminiscently this morning she told me she was going to ride out to inspect for herself the farm of the one black sheep amongst her tenants i looked out towards woolhanger as i came up in the train it seemed like a miasma of driven snow and mists  every one to his tastes lady alice observed as she turned away with a friendly little nod i have just an idea however that this mornings excursion was a little too much even for jane  what do you mean tallente asked eagerly lady alice looked at him over the top of her fan she was a woman of instinct i had a telegram from her just before i came out she said there wasnt much in it but it gave me an idea that after all perhaps she is thinking of a short visit to town come and see me mr tallente wont you i live in mount streetnumber 17 my husband used to play cricket with you i think  she passed on and tallente stood looking after her for a moment a little dazed a friend came up and took him by the arm  unprotected and alone in the gilded halls of the enemy the newcomer exclaimed come and have a drink by the by you look as though youd had good news  i have tallente assented smiling  then well drink to itmumll not bad stuff this way    chapter vi  tallente for the first time in his life was dining a few evenings later at dartreys house in chelsea and he looked forward with some curiosity to this opportunity of studying his chief under different auspices dartrey notwithstanding the fact that he was a miracle of punctuality and devotion to duty both at the offices in parliament street and at the house seemed to have the gift of fading absolutely out of sight from the ken of even his closest friends when the task of the day was accomplished he excused himself always courteously but finally from accepting anything whatever in the way of social entertainment he belonged to no clubs and if pressed he frankly confessed a predilection which amounted almost to passion for solitude during those hours not actually devoted to official duties the invitation to dinner therefore was received by tallente with some surprise he had grown into the habit of looking upon dartrey as a man who had no real existence outside the routine of their daily work he welcomed with avidity therefore this opportunity of understanding a little more thoroughly dartreys pleasant but elusive personality  the house itself situated in a chelsea square of some repute was small and unostentatious but was painted a spotless white and possessed even from the outside an air of quiet and unassuming elegance a trim maidservant opened the door and ushered him into a drawingroom of grey and silver with a little faded blue in the silks of the french chairs there were a few finepoint etchings upon the walls a small grand piano in a corner and very little furniture although the little there was was french of the best period there were no flowers and the atmosphere would have been chilly but for the brightly burning fire tallente was scarcely surprised when dartreys entrance alone indicated the fact that as was generally supposed he was free from family ties  i am a little early i am afraid tallente remarked as they shook hands  admirably punctual the other replied i shall make no apologies to you for my small party i have asked only miss miall and miller to meet youjust the trio of us who came to lure you out of your devonshire paradise  miller tallente repeated with instant comprehension  yes i was thinking only the other day that you scarcely see enough of miller  i see all that i want to was tallentes candid comment  dartrey laid his hand upon his guests shoulder in his sombre dinner garb with low turneddown collar and flowing black tie his greyblack beard cut to a point his high forehead his straightly brushedback hair which still betrayed its tendency to natural curls he looked a great deal more like an artist of the dreamy and aesthetic type than a man who had elaborated a new system of life and government  it is because of the feeling behind those words tallente he said that i have asked you to meet him here tonight miller has his objectionable points but he possesses still a great hold upon certain types of the working man i feel that you should appreciate that a little more thoroughly the politician as you should know better than i has no personal feelings  the politician is left with very few luxuries tallente replied with a certain grimness  nora was announced brilliant and gracious in a new dinner gown which she frankly confessed had ruined her and close behind her miller a little ungainly in his overlong dress coat and badly arranged white tie it struck tallente that he was aware of the object of the meeting and his manner obviously intended to be ingratiating had still a touch of selfconscious truculence  they went into dinner a few minutes later and their hosts tact in including nora in the party was at once apparent she talked brightly of the small happenings of their daybyday political life and bridged over the moments of awkwardness before general conversation assumed its normal swing dartrey encouraged miller to talk and they all listened while he spoke of the mammoth trades unions of the north where his hold upon the people was greatest he spoke still bitterly of the war from the moral effect of which he argued the working man had never wholly recovered tallente listened a little grimly  the fervour of selfsacrifice and socalled patriotism which some of the proletariat undoubtedly felt at the outbreak of the war miller argued was only an incidental a purely passing sensation compared to the idle and greedy inertia which followed it the war lost he went on might have acted as a lash upon the torpor of many of these men won it created a wave of immorality and extravagance from which they had never recovered they spent more than they had and they earned more than they were worth that is to say they lived an unnatural life  it is fortunate then tallente remarked that the new generation is almost here  they too carry the taint miller insisted tallente looked thoughtfully across towards his host  it seems to me that this is a little disheartening he said it is exactly what one might have expected from horlock or even lethbridge miller who is nearer to the proletariat than any of us would have us believe that the people who should be the bulwark of the state are not fit for their position  i fancy dartrey said soothingly that miller was talking more as a philosopher than a practical man  i speak according to my experience the latter insisted a little doggedly  amongst your own constituents tallente asked with a faint smile reminiscent of a recent unexpected defeat of one of millers partisans in a large constituency  amongst them and others was the somewhat acid reply sands lost his seat at tenchester through the apathy of the very class for whom we fight  tenchester is a wonderful place nora intervened i went down there lately to study certain phases of womens labour their factories are models and i found all the people with whom i came in contact exceptionally keen and wellinformed  miller gnawed his moustache for a moment  then i was probably unpopular there he said i have to tell the truth sometimes people do not like it  the dinner was simply but daintily served there were wines of wellknown vintages and as the meal progressed dartrey unbent eating scarcely anything and drinking less the purely intellectual stimulus of conversation seemed to unloose his tongue and give to his pronouncements a more pungent tone naturally politics remained the subject of discussion and dartrey disclosed a little the reason for the meeting which he had arranged  the craft of politics he pointed out makes but one inexorable demand upon her followersthe demand for unity the amazing thing is that this is not generally realised it seems the fashion nowadays to dissent from everything to cultivate the ego in its narrowest sense rather than to try and reach out and grasp the hands of those around the fault i think is in an overdeveloped theatrical sense the desire which so many clever men have for individual notoriety we democrats have prospered because we have been free from it we have been able to sink our individual prejudices in our cause that is because our cause has been great enough we aim so high we see so clearly that it is rare indeed to find amongst us those individual differences which have been the ruin of every political party up to today we have no brown who will not serve with smith no robinson who declines to be associated with jones we forget the small things which are repugnant to us in a fellowman because of the great things which bind us together  to a certain extent yes tallente agreed with some reserve in his tone yet we are all human there are some prejudices which no man may conquer if he pretends he does he only lives in an atmosphere of falsehood the strong man loves or hates  they took their coffee in their hosts very fascinating study there was little room here for decoration the walls were lined with books there were a few choice bronzes here and there a statue of wonderful beauty upon the writing table and a figure of justice leaning with outstretched arms over the world presented to dartrey by a great french artist for the rest there were comfortable chairs an ample fire and a round table on which were set out coffee and liqueurs of many sorts  you will find that i am not altogether an anchorite dartrey observed as they settled into their places  i am a lover of old brandy the 68 i recommend especially tallente and bring your chair round to the fire there are cigars and cigarettes at your elbow miller i think i know your taste help yourself wont you  miller drank crème de menthe and smoked homemade virginia cigarettes tallente watched him and sighed then suddenly conscious of his hosts critical scrutiny he felt an impulse of shame felt that his contempt for the man had in it something almost snobbish he leaned forward and did his best miller had been a schoolboard teacher an exhibitioner at college and was possessed of a singular though limited intelligence he could deal adequately with any one problem presented by itself and affected only by local conditions yet the more tallente talked with him the more he realised his lack of breadth his curious weakness of judgment when called upon to consider questions dependent upon varying considerations as to the right or wrong wording of a clause in the factory amendment act he could be lucid explanatory and convincing as to the justice of the same clause when compared with other forms of legislation he was vague and unconvincing didactic and prejudiced if dartreys object had been to bring these two men into closer understanding of each other he was certainly succeeding it is doubtful however whether the understanding progressed entirely in the fashion he had desired nora curled up in an easychair affecting to be sleepy but still listening earnestly felt at last that intervention was necessary the selfrevelation of miller under tallentes surgical questioning was beginning to disturb even their host  i am being neglected she complained if no one talks to me i shall go home  tallente rose at once and sat on the lounge by her side dartrey stood on the hearth rug and plunged into an ingenious effort to reconcile various points of difference which had arisen between his two guests tallente all the time was politely acquiescent miller a little sullen like all men with brains acute enough to deal logically with a procession of single problems he resented because he failed altogether to understand that a wider field of circumstances could possibly alter human vision  tallente walked home with nora they chose the longer way by the embankment  this is the cockneys antithesis to the moonlight and hills of you country folk nora observed as she pointed to the yellow lights gashing across the black water  tallente drew a long breath of content  its good to be here anyway i am glad to be out of that house he confessed  im afraid she sighed that our dear hosts party was a failure you and miller were born in different camps of life it doesnt seem to me that anything will ever bring you together  for this reason tallente explained eagerly millers outlook is narrow and egotistical he may be a shrewd politician but there isnt a grain of statesmanship in him he might make an excellent chairman of a parish council as a cabinet minister he would be impossible  he will demand office i am afraid nora remarked  tallente took off his hat he was watching the lights from the two great hotels the red fires from the funnel of a little tug mack and mysterious in the windy darkness  i am sick of politics he declared suddenly we are a parcel of fools our feet move day and night to the solemn music  you of all men she protested to be talking like this  i mean it he insisted a little doggedly i have spent too many of my years on the treadmill a man was born to be either an egoist and parcel out the earth according to his tastes or to develop like dartrey into a dreamercurse you he added suddenly shaking his fist at the tall towers of the houses of parliament youre like an infernal boardingschool with your detentions and impositions and castigations there must be something beyond  a cabinet minister she began  the sixth form he interrupted theres just one aspiration of life to be granted under that roof and to win it you are asked to stifle all the rest it isnt worth it  its the greatest game at which men can play she declared  and also the narrowest because it is the most absorbing he answered we have our triumphs there and they end in a chuckle dont you love sunshine in winter strange cities pictures pictures of another age pictures which take your thoughts back into another world architecture that is not utilitarian the faces of human beings on whom the strain of life has never fallen and womenwomen whose eyes will laugh into yours who havent a single view in life who dont care a fig about improving their race who want just love to give and to take  she gazed at him in astonishment a little carried away her eyes soft her lips parted  but you have turned pagan she cried  an instants revolt against the methodism of life he replied his feet once more upon the earth but the feelings there all the same he went on doggedly i want to leave school i have been there so long it seems to me my holiday is overdue  she passed her arm through his she was a very clever and a very understanding woman  that comes of your having ignored us she murmured  it isnt my fault if i have he reminded her  in a sense it is she insisted the woman in your life should be the most beautiful part of it you chose to make her the steppingstone to your ambition consequently you go through life hungry you wait till you almost starve and then suddenly the greatest things in the world which lie to your hand seem like baubles  you are hideously logical he grumbled  they were walking slower now within a few yards of the entrance to her flat both of them were a little disturbedshe full as she was with all the generous impulses of sensuous humanity intensely awakened intensely sympathetic  tell me where is your wife she asked  in america  it is hopeless with her  utterly and irretrievably hopeless  it has been for long  for years  and for the sake of your principles she went on almost angrily your stupid canonical and dryasdust little principles youve let your life shrivel up  i cant help it he answered what would you have me do stand in the market place and shout my needs  she clung to his arm you dear thing she said youre a great baby  they were in the shadow of the entrance to the flats he suddenly bent over her his lips were almost on hers there was a frightened gleam in her eyes but she made no movement of retreat suddenly he drew himself upright  that wouldnt help would it he said simply thank you all the same nora goodby  on his table when he entered his rooms that night lay the letter for which he had craved he opened it almost fiercely the few lines seemed like a message of hope  dont laugh at me dear friend but i am coming to london for a week or two to my little house in charles street i dont know exactly when you will find time to come and see me  here the mists seem to have fallen upon us like a shroud and we cant escape i galloped many miles this morning but it was like trying to find the edge of the world  please call on my sister at 17 mount street she likes you and wants to see more of you  jane    chapter vii  for some weeks after his chiefs dinner party tallente slackened a little in his grim devotion to work a strangely quiescent period of daybyday political history enabled him to be absent from his place in the house for several evenings during the week and although he spent a good many hours with dartrey at demos house carefully discussing and elaborating next seasons programme he still found himself with time to spare and with janes note buttoned up in his pocket he deliberately turned his face towards life in its more genial and human aspect  he dined one night at the club to which he had belonged for many years a club frequented chiefly by distinguished literary men successful barristers and a sprinkling of actors his arrival created at first almost a sensation a slight feeling of constraint even amongst the little gathering of men drinking their apéritifs in the lounge under the stairs somehow or other there was a feeling that many of the old ties had been broken tallente stood for new and menacing things in politics he had to a certain extent cut himself adrift from the world which starts at eton and oxford and ends by making mild puns on the judicial bench or uttering sonorous platitudes from a properly accredited seat in the house  tallente fully appreciating the atmosphere nevertheless made strenuous and not unsuccessful efforts to pick up the old threads he abandoned even the moderation of his daily life he drank cocktails champagne and port laughed heartily at the stories of the day and ransacked his brain to cap them of bridge unfortunately he knew nothing but he played pool with some success and left the club late leaving behind him curiously mingled opinions as to the cause for this sudden return to his old haunts  he himself walked through the streets on his way homeward conscious of at least partial success feeling the pleasurable warmth of the wine he had drunk and the companionship for which he had so strenuously sought he found himself thinking almost enviously of the men with whom he had associatedphilipson with whom he had been at college with three plays running at different theatres interested even fascinated by his work chaffing gaily with his principal actor as to the rendering of some of his lines then there was fardell also a schoolfellow now a police magistrate full of dry and pleasant humour called by his intimates the beak  amberson poseur and dilettante thirty years ago but always a good fellow now an acknowledged master of english prose and a critic whose word was unquestioned these men one and all seemed to be up to the neck in life kept young and human by the taste of it upon their palate the contemplation of their wholesided existence their sound combination of work and play produced in him a sort of jealousy for he knew that there was something behind it which he lacked  the night was bright and dry and there were still crowds about leicester square piccadilly circle and piccadilly itself as he walked he looked into the faces of the women who passed him by struggling against his old abhorrence as against one of the sickly offshoots of an overeclectic epicureanism they typified not vice but weakness the unhappy result of mans inevitable revolt against unnatural laws yet even then the mingled purity and priggishness encouraged by years of repression forbade any vital change in his sentiments the toleration for which he sought when it made its grudging appearance was mingled with dislike and distrust he breathed more freely as he turned into the quieter street in which his rooms were situated passing them by however crossing curzon street and embarking upon a brief pilgrimage which had become almost a nightly one within a very few minutes he paused before a certain number in a street even more secluded than his own at last the thing which he had so greatly anticipated had happened there were lights in the house from top to bottom jane had arrived  he walked slowly back and forth several times the music in his blood stirred already by the wine he had drunk and the revival of old memories moved to a new and more wonderful tune he knew now without any possibility of selfdeception exactly what he had been waiting for exactly where all his thoughts and hopes for the future were centered was she there now he wondered gazing at the windows like a moonstruck boy he lingered about and fate was kind to him  a limousine swung around the corner and pulled up in front of the door a few minutes later the footman on the box sprang down he heard her voice as she said goodby to some one the car rolled smoothly away she crossed the pavement with an involuntary glance at the tall approaching figure  jane he exclaimed  she stood quite still with the latchkey in her hand the car was out of sight now and they seemed to be almost alone in the street at first there was something almost unfamiliar in her rather startled face her coiffured hair her bare neck with its collar of diamonds there was a moment of suspense then he saw something flash into her eyes and he was glad to be there  you she exclaimed a little breathlessly he plunged into explanations  my rooms are close by here in charges street he told her i was walking home from the club and saw you step out of the car  how could you know that i was coming today she asked i only telephoned alice after i arrived  to tell you the truth he confessed i have got into the habit of walking this way home in casewell tonight i have my reward  she turned the key in the latch and pushed the door open  you must come in she invited  isnt it too late  what does that matter so long as i ask you  he followed her gladly into the hall closing the door behind him  that wretched switch is somewhere near here she said feeling along the wall  her fingers suddenly met his and stayed passive in his grasp she turned a little around as she realised the nearness of him  jane he whispered i have wanted you so much  for a single moment she rested in his armsa wonderful moment inexplicable voluptuous stirring him to the very depths then she slipped away her fingers sought the wall once more and the place was flooded with light  you must come in here for a moment she said opening the nearest door i shall not ask you to share my milk and i am afraid i dont know where to get you a whisky and soda but you can light a cigarette and just tell me how things are and when you are coming to see me  he followed her into a comfortable little apartment furnished in midvictorian fashion but with an easychair drawn up to the brightly burning fire on a table near was a glass of milk and some biscuits the ermine cloak slipped from her shoulders she stood with one foot upon the fender half turned towards him his eyes rested upon her filled with a great hunger  well she queried  you are wonderful he murmured  she laughed and for a moment her eyes fell  but my dear man she said i dont want compliments i want to know the news  there is none he answered we are marking time while horlock digs his own grave  you have been amusing yourself  indifferently i dined the other night with dartrey tonight at the sheridan club the most exciting thing in the twentyfour hours has been my nightly pilgrimage round here  how idiotic she laughed supposing you had not happened to meet me you could scarcely have rung my bell at this hour of the night  i should have been content to have seen the lights and to have known that you had arrived  you dear man she exclaimed with a sudden smile a smile of entire and sweet friendliness i like the thought of your doing that it is something to know that one is welcome when one breaks away from the routine of ones life as i have  tell me why you have done it he asked  she looked back into the fire  everything was going a little wrong she explained one of my farmers was troublesome and the snow has stopped work and hunting we lost thirty of our best ewes last week i found i was getting out of temper with everybody and everything so i suddenly remembered that i had an empty house here and came up  to the city of adventures he murmured  she shrugged her shoulders  london has never seemed like that to me i find it generally a very ugly and a very sordid place where i am hedged in with relatives generally wanting me to do the thing i loatheyou have really no news for me then  none except that i am glad to see you  when will you come and have a long talk  will you dine with me tomorrow night he begged eagerly in the afternoon i have committee meetings thursday afternoon you could come down to the house if you cared to  of course i should but hadnt you better dine here she suggested i can ask alice and another man  i want to see you alone he insisted for the first time at any rate  then will you take me to that little place you told me of in soho she suggested i dont want a whole crowd to know that i am in town just yet dont think that it sounds vain but people have such a habit of almost carrying one off ones feet i want to prowl about london and do ordinary things one or two theatres perhaps but no dinner parties i shant stay long i dont suppose as soon as i hear from mr segerson that the snow has gone and that terrible north wind has died away i know i shall be wanting to get back  you are very conscientious about your work there he complained dont you ever realise that you may have an even more important mission here  for a single moment she seemed troubled her manner when she spoke had lost something of its calm graciousness  really she said well you must tell me all about it tomorrow night i shall wear a hat and you must not order the dinner beforehand i dont mind your ordering the table because i like a corner but we must sail into the place just like any other two wanderers it is agreed  he bent over her fingers his good angel and his instinct of sensibility which was always appraising her attitude towards him prompted his studied farewell  you will let yourself out she begged i have taken off my cloak and i could not face that wind  of course he answered i shall call for you at a quarter to eight tomorrow night i only wish i could make you understand what it means to have that to look forward to  if you can make me believe that she answered gravely perhaps i shall be glad that i have come    chapter viii  whilst tallente rejuvenated and with a wonderful sense of wellbeing at the back of his mind was on his feet in the house of commons on the following afternoon leading an unexpected attack against the unfortunate government dartrey sat at tea in noras study nora who had had a very busy day was leaning back in her chair well content though a little fatigued dartrey who had forgotten his lunch in the stress of work was devoting himself to the muffins  while i think of it he said let me thank you for playing hostess so charmingly the other night  she made him a little bow  your dinner party was a great success  was it he murmured a little doubtfully i am not quite so sure i cant seem to get at tallente somehow  he is doing his work well isnt he  the mechanical side of it is most satisfactory dartrey confessed he is the most perfect parliamentary machine that was ever evolved  surely that is exactly what you want you were always complaining that there was no one to bring the stragglers into line  for the present dartrey admitted tallente is doing excellently i wish though that i could see a little farther into the future  tell me exactly what fault you find with him nora persisted  he lacks enthusiasm already he makes none of the mistakes which are coincident with genius and he is a little intolerant he takes no trouble to adapt himself to varying views he has a fine broad outlook but no man can see into every corner of the earth and what is outside his outlook does not exist  anything else  he is not happy in his work there is something wanting in his scheme of life i have built a ladder for him to climb i have given him the chance of becoming the greatest statesman of today one would think that he had some other ambition  nora sighed she looked across at her visitor a little diffidently  i can help you to understand andrew tallente she declared his condition is the greatest of all tributes to my sex he has had an unhappy married life from forty to fifty he has borne it philosophically as a man may now the reaction has come with the first dim approach of age he becomes suddenly terrified for the things he is missing  dartrey was thoughtful  i dare say you are right he admitted but if he needs an aspasia surely she could be found  nora rested her head upon her fingers she seemed to be watching intently the dancing flames her broad womanly forehead was troubled her soft brown eyes pensive  he is fifty years old she said it is rather an anomalous age at fifty a mans taste is almost hypercritical and his attraction to my sex is on the wane no the problem isnt so easy  dartrey had finished tea and was feeling for his cigarette case  i rather fancied nora that he was attracted by you  well he isnt then she replied with a smile  he was rather by way of thinking that he was the other night but that was simply because he was in a curiously unsettled state and he felt that i was sympathetic  you are a very clever woman nora he said looking across at her you could make him care for you if you chose  is that to be my sacrifice to the cause she asked am i to give my soul to its wrong keeper that our party may flourish  you dont like tallente  i like him immensely she contradicted vigorously if i werent hopelessly in love with some one else i could find it perfectly easy to try and make life a different place for him  he looked at her with trouble in his kind eyes it was as though he had suddenly stumbled upon a tragedy  i have never guessed this about you nora he murmured  you are not observant of small things she answered a little bitterly  who is the man  that i shall not tell you  do i know him  less i should say than any one of your acquaintance  he was silent for a moment or two then it chanced that the telephone rang for him with a message from the house of commons he gave some instructions to his secretary  it is a queer thing he remarked as he replaced the receiver how far our daily work and our ambitions take us out of our immediate environment i see you day by day nora i have known you intimately since your school daysand i never guessed  you never guessed and i have no time to suffer she answered so we go on until the breaking time comes until one part of ourselves conquers and the other loses it is rather like that just now with andrew tallente a few more years and it will probably be like that with me  he threw his cigarette away as though the flavour had suddenly become distasteful and sat drumming with his fingers upon the table his eyes fixed upon nora  tallentes position he said thoughtfully one can understand he is married isnt he and with all the splendid breadth of his intellectual outlook he is still harassed by the social fetters of his birth and bringing up i can conceive tallente as a person too highminded to seek to evade the law and too scornful for intrigue but you nora how is it that your love brings you unhappiness you are young and free and surely he concluded with a little sigh when you choose you can make yourself irresistible  she looked at him with a peculiar light in her eyes  i have proved myself very far from being irresistible she declared the man for whose love my whole being is aching today is absolutely unawakened as to my desirability i enjoy with him the most impersonal friendship in which two people of opposite sexes ever indulged  i thought that i was acquainted with all your intimates dartrey observed in a puzzled tone let me meet this man and judge for myself nora  do you mean that she asked  certainly  very well then she acquiesced ill ask him to dinner here when are you free  he glanced through a thin memorandum book  on sunday night  at eight oclock she said you wont mind a simple dinner i know i can promise you that you will be interested my friend is worth knowing  dartrey took his departure a little hurriedly he had suddenly remembered an appointment at his committee rooms and went off with his mind full of the troubles of a northern constituency on his way up parliament street he met miller who turned and walked by his side  heard the news the latter asked curtly no is there any was the quick reply  tallentes broken the truce miller announced there was rather an acid debate on the compensation clauses of henshams allotment bill tallente pulled them to pieces and then challenged a division the government whips were fairly caught napping and were beaten by twelve votes dartreys eyes flashed  tallente is a most wonderful tactician he said this is the second time hes forced the government into a hole horlock will never last the session at this rate  there are rumours of a resignation of course miller went on but they arent likely to go out on a snatched division like this  we dont want them to dartrey agreed all the time though this sort of thing is weakening their prestige we shall be ready to give them their coup de grace in about four months  the two men were silent for a moment then miller spoke again a little abruptly  i cant seem to get on with tallente he confessed  i am sorry dartrey regretted youll have to try miller we cant do without him  try i have tried was the impatient rejoinder tallente may have his points but nature never meant him to be a peoples man hes too hidebound in convention and tradition upon my soul dartrey he makes me feel like a republican of the bloodthirsty age hes so blasted superior  youre going back to the smaller outlook miller his chief expostulated these personal prejudices should be entirely negligible i am perfectly certain that tallente himself would lay no stress upon them  stress upon them damn it im as good as he is miller exclaimed irritably theres no harm in tallentes ratting quitting his order and coming amongst us democrats but what i do object to is his bringing the mannerisms and outlook of eton and oxford amongst us when i am with him he always makes me feel that i am doing the wrong thing and that he knows it  dartrey frowned a little impatiently  this is rubbish miller he pronounced it is you who are to blame for attaching the slightest importance to these trifles  trifles miller growled within a very short time dartrey this question will have to be settled does tallente know that i am promised a seat in his cabinet  i think that he must surmise it  the sooner he knows the better miller declared acidly tallente can unbend all right when he likes he was dining at the trocadero the other night with brooks and ainley and parker and saundersonthe most cheerful party in the place tallente seemed to have slipped out of himself and yet there isnt one of those men who has ever had a days schooling or has ever worn anything but readymade clothes he leaves his starch off when hes with them whats the matter with me i should like to know im a college man even though i did go as an exhibitioner i was a school teacher when those fellows were wielding pickaxes  dartrey looked at his companion thoughtfully for a single moment the words trembled upon his lips which would have brought things to an instant and profitless climax then he remembered the million or so of people of millers own class and way of thinking to whom he was a leading light and he choked back the words  i find this sort of conversation a little peevish miller he said as soon as any definite difference of opinion arises between you and tallente i will intervene at present you are both doing good work our cause needs you both  you wont forget how i stand miller persisted as they reached their destination  no one has ever yet accused me of breaking my word was the somewhat chilly rejoinder you shall have your pound of flesh    chapter ix  jane leaned back in her chair drew off her gloves and looked around her with an appreciative smile she had somehow the subtle air of being even more pleased with herself and her surroundings than she was willing to admit every table in the restaurant was occupied the waiters were busy there was an air of gaiety a faint smell of cookery hung about the place and its clients were undeniably a curious mixture of the bourgeois and theatrical nevertheless she was perfectly content and smiled her greetings to the great monsieur george who himself brought their menu  we want the best of your ordinary dishes tallente told him and remember that we do not come here expecting ritz specialities or a savoy chef doeuvre we want those special hors doeuvres which you know all about a sole grilled a la maison a plainly roasted chicken with an endive salad the sweets are your affair the savoury must be a cheese soufflé and for wine  he broke off and looked across the table jane smiled apologetically  you will never bring me out again she declared i want some champagne  i never felt more like it myself he agreed the pommery george slightly iced an aperitif now and the dinner can take its course we will linger over the hors doeuvres and we are in no hurry  george departed and tallente smiled across at his companion it was a wonderful moment this his steady success of the last few months the triumph of the afternoon had never brought him one of the thrills which were in his pulses at that moment not one iota of the pleasurable sense of wellbeing which was warming his veins the new menace which had suddenly thrown its shadow across his path was forgotten governments might come or go a career be made or broken upon the wheel he was alone with jane  now tell me all the news at woolhanger he asked  woolhanger lies under a mantle of snow she told him there is a wind blowing there which seems to have come straight from the ice of the north pole and sounds like the devil playing bowls amongst the hills  the hunting  all stopped of course a few nights ago two stags came right up to the house and quite a troop of the really wild ponies from over hawkbridge way weve never had such a spell of cold in my memory it reminded one of the snowstorm in lorna doonebut after all i told you all about woolhanger last night i want your news  i seem to have settled down with the democrats he told her i do my best to keep the party in line the great trades unions are of course our chief difficulty but i think we are making progress even with them some of the miners representatives dined with me at the trocadero the other night good fellows they are too there is only one great difficulty he went on in the consolidation of my party and that is to get a little more breadth into the views of these men who represent the leading industries they are obsessed with the duties that they owe to their own artificers and the labour connected with the particular industry they represent it is hard to make them see the importance of any other subject yet we need these very men as lawmakers i want them to study production and the laws of production from a universal point of view  i can quite understand she acquiesced sympathetically that you have a difficult class of men to deal with tell me what the evening papers mean by their placards  we had a small tactical success against the government this afternoon he explained it doesnt really amount to anything we are not ready for their resignation at the moment any more than they are ready to resign  you are an object of terror to all my people she confided smilingly they say that horlock dare not go to the country and that you could turn him out tomorrow if you cared to  so much for politics he remarked drily  so much for politics she assented and now about yourself  a little finger of flame burning in an empty place he sighed that is how life seems to me when i take my hand off the plough  she answered him lightly but her face softened and her eyes shone with sympathy  arent you by way of being just a little sentimental  perhaps he admitted if i am let me feel the luxury of it  one reads different things of you  for instance  town topics says that you have become an interesting figure at many social functions you must meet attractive people there  i only wish that i could find them so he answered london has been almost feverishly gay lately and every one seems to have discovered a vogue for entertaining politicians there seems to be a sort of idea that dangerous corners may be rubbed off us by a judicious application of turtle soup and champagne  cynic she scoffed pleasantly  well i dont know he went on from any other point of view some of the entertainments to which i have been bidden appear utterly without meaning however it is part of my programme to prove to the world that we democrats can open our arms wide enough to include every class in life therefore i go to many places i should otherwise avoid i have studied the attitude of the younger women whom i have approached purely impersonally and without the slightest hypersensitiveness they have all been perfectly pleasant perfectly disposed for conversation or any of the usual social amenities but they know that i have in the background a wife to flirt with a married man of fifty isnt worth while  it appears to me she said with a slight note of severity in her tone that you have set your mind upon having a perfectly frivolous time  not at all he objected i have simply been experimenting  the service of dinner had now commenced and with george in the background a haughty head waiter a few yards off and a myrmidon handing them their dishes with a beatific smile the conversation drifted naturally into generalities when they resumed their more intimate talk tallente felt himself inspired by an everincreasing admiration for his companion and her adaptability during this brief interval he had seen many admiring and some wondering glances directed towards jane and he realised that she was somehow a person entirely apart from any of the others more beautiful more distinguished more desirable of the lady jane ruling at woolhanger with a high hand there was no trace she looked out upon the gay room with its voluptuous air its many couples and little parties carrées with the friendly and sympathetic interest of one who finds herself in agreeable surroundings and whose only desire is to come into touch with them her plain black gown her simple hat with its single quill the pearls which were her sole adornment all seemed part of her she appeared wholly unconscious of the admiration she excited she who was sometimes inclined perhaps to carry herself a little haughtily in her mothers drawingroom was here only anxious to share in the genial atmosphere of friendliness which the general tone of her surroundings seemed to demand  well what was the final result of your efforts towards companionship she enquired after they had praised the chicken enthusiastically and the wave of service had momentarily ebbed kitchenwards  they have led me to only one conclusion he answered swiftly  which is  that if you remain on exmoor and i in westminster the affairs of this country are not likely to prosper  she laughed softly  as though i made any real difference  then she saw a transformed man the firm mouth suddenly softened the keen bright eyes glowed a light shone out of his worn face which few had ever seen there  you make all the difference he whispered you of your mercy can save me from the rocks i have discovered very late in life too late many would say that i cannot build the temples of life with hands and brain alone even though the time be short and i have so little to offer i am your greedy suitor i want help i want sympathy i want love  there was nothing whatever left now of lady jane of woolhanger segerson would probably not have recognised his autocratic mistress the most timid of her tenant farmers would have adopted a bold front with her she was simply a very beautiful woman trembling a little unsteady nervous and unsure of herself  oh i wish you hadnt said that she faltered  but i must say it he insisted with that alien note of tenderness still throbbing in his tone you are not a dabbler in life you have never been afraid to stand on your feet to look at it whole there is the solid undeniable truth it is a womans glory to help men on to the great places and the strangest thing in all the world is that there is only one woman for any one man and for meyou are the only one woman  around them conversation had grown louder the blue cloud of tobacco smoke more dense the odour of cigarettes and coffee more pungent down in the street a wandering musician was singing a little neapolitan love song they heard snatches of it as the door downstairs was opened  you have known me for so short a time she argued how can you possibly be sure that i could give you what you want and in any case how could i give anything except my eager wishes my friendshipperhaps if you will my affection but would that bring you content  no he answered unhesitatingly i want your love i want you yourself you have played a womans part in life you havent been content to sit down and wait for what fate might bring you you have worked out your own destiny and you have shown that you have courage dont disprove it  she looked him in the eyes very sweetly but with the shadow of a great disturbance in her face  i want to help you she said indeed i feel more than you can believemore than i could have believed possiblethe desire the longing to help but what is there you can ask of me beyond my hand in yours beyond all the comradeship which a woman who has more in her heart than she dare own can give  once more the door was opened below the voice of the singer came floating up then it was closed again and the little passionate cry blotted out his lips moved but he said nothing it seemed suddenly from the light in his face that he might have been echoing those words which rang in her ears she trembled and suddenly held her hand across the table  hold my fingers she begged these others will think that we have made a bet or a compact what does it matter i want to give you all that i can will you be patient will you remember that you have found your way along a very difficult path to a goal which no one yet has ever reached i could tell you more but may not that be enough i want you to have something to carry away with you something not too cold something that burns a little with the beginnings of life and love and if you will perhaps hope may that content you for a little while for you see although i am not a girl these things and thoughts of these things are new to me  he drew a little breath it seemed to him that there was no more beautiful place on earth than this little smokehung corner of the restaurant the words which escaped from his lips were vibrant tremulous  i am your slave i will wait there is no one like you in the world    chapter x  tallente found a distant connection of his waiting for him in his rooms on his return from the house at about halfpast sixspencer williams a young man who after a brilliant career at oxford had become one of the junior secretaries to the prime minister the young man rose to his feet at tallentes entrance and hastened to explain his visit  youll forgive my waiting sir he begged your servant told me that you were dining out and would be home before seven oclock to change  quite right spencer tallente replied glad to see you whisky and soda or cocktail  the young man chose a whisky and soda and tallente followed suit waving his visitor back into his chair and seating himself opposite  get right into the middle of it please he enjoined  to begin with then can you break your engagement and come and dine with the chief  out of the question even if it were a royal command was the firm reply my engagement is unbreakable  the chief will be sorry williams said so am i will you go round to downing street and see him afterwards  i could tallente admitted but why i have nothing to say to him i cant conceive what he could have to say to me there are always pressmen loitering about downing street who would place the wrong construction on my visit you saw all the rubbish they wrote because he and i talked together for a quarter of an hour at mrs van fosdykes  i know all about that williams assented but this time tallente theres something in it the chief quarrelled with you for the sake of the old gang well he made a bloomer the old gang arent worth sixpence theyre rather a hindrance than help to legislation and when theyre wanted theyre wobbly as you saw this afternoon lethbridge went into the lobby with you  tallente smiled a little grimly  he took particularly good care that i should know that  well there you are williams went on the chiefs fed up i can talk to you here freely because im not an official person can you discuss terms at all for a rapprochement  out of the question  you mean that you are too much committed to dartrey and the democrats  committed to them is scarcely the correct way of putting it tallente objected their principles are in the main my principles they stand for the cause i have championed all my life our alliance is a natural almost an automatic one  its all very well sir williams argued but dartrey stands for a labour party pure and simple you cant govern an empire by parish council methods   that is where the democrats come in tallente pointed out they have none of the narrower outlook of the labour party as you understand itof any of the late factions of the labour party perhaps i should say the democrats possess an international outlook when they legislate every class will receive its proper consideration no class will be privileged a man will be ranked according to his production  williams smiled with the faint cynicism of clairvoyant youth  sounds a little utopian sir he ventured what about miller  well what about him  are you going to serve with him  really tallente protested for a political opponent or the representative of a political opponent youre a trifle on the inquisitive side  its a matter that youll have to face sometime or other the young man asserted i happen to know that dartrey is committed to miller  i dont see how you can happen to know anything of the sort tallente declared a little bluntly in any case spencer my political association or nonassociation with miller is entirely my own affair and you can hook it remember me to all your people and give my love to muriel  nothing doing eh williams observed rising reluctantly to his feet  you have perception tallente replied  the chief was afraid you might be a little difficult about an interview those pressmen are an infernal nuisance anyway what about sneaking into downing street at about midnight in a cloak and slouch hat eh  too much of the cinema about you young fellow tallente scoffed run along now i have to dress  tallente held out his hand goodhumouredly his visitor made no immediate motion to take it  there was just one thing more i was asked to mention sir he said i will be quite frank if i may my instructions were not to allude to it if your attitude were in the least conciliatory  go on tallente bade him curtly  there has been a rumour going about that some years agowhile the war was on in factyou wrote a very wonderful attack upon the trades unions this attack was so bitter in tone so damning in some of its facts and in short such a wonderful production that at the last moment the late prime minister used his influence with you to suspend its publication it was held over and in the meantime the attitude of the trades unions towards certain phases of the war was modified and the collapse of germany followed soon afterwards consequently that article was never published  you are exceedingly well informed tallente admitted pray proceed  there is in existence the young man continued a signed copy of that article its publication at the present moment would probably make your position with the democratic party untenable  is this a matter of blackmail tallente asked  the young man stiffened  i am speaking on behalf of the prime minister sir he desired me to inform you that the signed copy of that article has been offered to him within the last few days  tallente was silent for several moments the young mans subtle intimation was a shock in more ways than one  the manuscript to which you refer he said at last was stolen from my study at martinhoe under somewhat peculiar conditions  perhaps you would like to explain those conditions to mr horlock williams suggested  tallente held open the door  i shall not seek out your chief he said but i will tell him the truth about that manuscript if at any time we should come together in the meantime i am perfectly in accord with the view which your chief no doubt holds concerning it the publication of that article at the present moment would inevitably end my connection with the democratic party and probably close my political career this is a position which i should court rather than submit to blackmail direct or indirect  my chief will resent your using such a word sir williams declared  your chief could have avoided it by a judicious use of the wastepaper basket and an exercise of the gift of silence tallente retorted as the young man took his departure  horlock came face to face with tallente the following afternoon in one of the corridors of the house and scarcely troubling about an invitation led him forcibly into his private room he turned his secretary out and locked the door  a cigar he suggested  tallente shook his head  i want to see whats doing in a few minutes he said  i can tell you that horlock declared nothing at all i was just off when i happened to see you youre looking very fit and pleased with yourself is it because of that rotten trick you played on us the other day  rotten i thought it was rather clever of me tallente objected  perfectly legitimate i suppose the other assented grudgingly thats the worst of having a tactician in opposition  you shouldnt have let me get there was the quick retort  horlock drew a paper knife slowly down between his fingers  i sent williams to you yesterday  you did a nice errand for a respectably broughtup young man  chuck that tallente  why i didnt misunderstand him did i  apparently he told me that you used the word blackmail  i dont think the dictionary supplies a milder equivalent  tallente said horlock with a frown well finish with this once and for ever i refused the offer of the manuscript in question  i am glad to hear it was the laconic reply  leaving that out of the question then i suppose theres no chance of your ratting  not the faintest i rather fancy ive settled down for good  horlock lit a cigarette and leaned back in his chair  no good looking impatient tallente he said the doors locked and you know it youll have to listen to what i want to say a few minutes of your time arent much to ask for  go ahead tallente acquiesced  there is only one ambition horlock continued for an earnest politician you know what that is as well as i do wouldnt you sooner be prime minister supported by a recognised and reputable political party than try to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for your friends dartrey miller and company  so this is the last bid eh tallente observed  its the last bid of all was the grave answer there is nothing more  and what becomes of you  one section of the press will say that i have shown selfdenial and patriotism greater than any man of my generation and that my name will be handed down to history as one of the most singleminded statesmen of the day another section will say that i have been forced into a welldeserved retirement and that it will remain a monument to my everlasting disgrace that i brought my party to such straits that it was obliged to compromise with the representative of an untried and unproven conglomeration of fanatics a third section  oh chuck it tallente interrupted horlock i appreciate your offer because i know that there is a large amount of selfdenial in it but i am glad of an opportunity to end all these discussions my word is passed to dartrey  and miller the prime minister asked with calm irony  tallente felt the sting and frowned irritably  i have had no discussions of any sort with miller he answered he has never been represented to me as holding an official position in the party  if you ever succeed in forming a democratic government horlock said mark my words you will have to include him  if ever i accept any ones offer to form a government tallente replied it will be on one condition and one condition only which is that i choose my own ministers  if you become the head of the democratic party horlock pointed out you will have to take over their pledges  i do not agree with you was the firm reply and further i suggest most respectfully that this discussion is not agreeable to me  an expression of hopelessness crept into horlocks face  youre a good fellow tallente he sighed and i made a big mistake when i let you go i did it to please the moderates and you know how theyve turned out there isnt one of them worth a row of pins if any one ever writes my political biography they will probably decide that the parting with you was the greatest of my blunders  he rose to his feet swinging the key upon his finger  one more word tallente he added i want to warn you that so far as your further progress is concerned there is a snake in the grass somewhere the manuscript of which williams spoke to you and which would of course damn you forever with any party which depended for its existence even indirectly upon the trades unions was offered to me without any hint at financial return on the sole condition that i guaranteed its public production it is perfectly obvious therefore that there is some one stirring who means harm i speak to you now only as a friend and as a wellwisher did i understand williams to say that the document was stolen from your study at martinhoe  it was stolen tallente replied by my secretary anthony palliser who disappeared with it one night in august  disappeared seems rather a vague term horlock remarked  a trifle melodramatic i admit tallente assented so were the circumstances of hisdisappearance i can assure you that i have had the police inspector of fiction asking me curious questions and i am convinced that down in devonshire i am still an object of suspicion to the local gossips  i remember reading about the affair at the time horlock remarked as he unlocked the door it never occurred to me though to connect it with anything of this sort surely palliser was a cut above the ordinary blackmailer  tallente shrugged his shoulders a confusion of ethics he said i dare say you remember that the young man conspired with my wife to boost me into a peerage behind my back however  one last word tallente horlock interrupted i am not at liberty to tell you from what source the offer as to your article came but i can tell you thispalliser was not or did not appear to be connected with it in any way  but i know who was tallente exclaimed with a sudden lightninglike recollection of that meeting on the railway platform at woody baymiller  horlock made no answer to his visitor however the whole affair was now clear  miller must have bought the manuscript from palliser he said when he knew what sort of an offer dartrey was going to make to me and realised how it would affect him horlock i am not sure after all that i dont rather envy you if you decide to drop out of politics the main road is well enough but the byways are pretty filthy  horlock remained gravely silent and tallente passed out of the room realising that he had finally severed his connection with orthodox english politics the realisation however was rather more of a relief than otherwise for fifteen years he had been cumbered with precedent in helping to govern by compromise now he was for the clean sweep or nothing he strolled into the house and back into his own committee room read through the orders of the day and spoke to the government whip it was as horlock had assured him a dead afternoon there were a sheaf of questions being asked none of which were of the slightest interest to any one with a little smile of anticipation upon his lips he hurried to the telephone in a few moments he was speaking to annie lady janes maid  will you give her ladyship a message he asked tell her that i am unexpectedly free for an hour or so and ask if i may come around and see her the maid was absent from the telephone for less than a minute when she returned her message was brief but satisfactory her ladyship would be exceedingly pleased to see mr tallente    chapter xi  tallente found a taxi on the stand and drove at once to charles street the butler took his hat and stick and conducted him into the spacious drawingroom upon the first floor here he received a shock the most natural thing in the world had happened but an event which he had never even taken into his calculation there were half a dozen other callers all save one women jane saw his momentary look of consternation but was powerless to send him even an answering message of sympathy she held out her hand and welcomed him with a smile  this is perfectly charming of you mr tallente she said i know how busy you must be in the afternoons but i am afraid i am oldfashioned enough to like my men friends to sometimes forget even the affairs of the nation you know my sister i thinklady alice mountgarron aunt may i present mr tallentethe countess of somerham mrs ward levittelady englishoh and colonel fosbrook  tallente made the best of a very disappointing situation he exchanged bows with his new acquaintances declined tea and was at once taken possession of by lady somerham a formidablelooking person in tortoiseshellrimmed spectacles with a rasping voice and a judicial air  so you are the mr tallente she began who somerham tells me has achieved the impossible  upon the face of it tallente rejoined with a smile your husband is proved guilty of an exaggeration  poor henry his wife sighed he does get a little hysterical about politics nowadays what he says is that you are in a fair way to form a coherent and united political party out of the various factions of labour a thing which a little time ago no one thought possible  tallente promptly disclaimed the achievement  stephen dartrey is the man who did that he declared i only joined the democrats a few months ago  but you are their leader lady alice put in  only in the house of commons tallente replied  dartrey is the leader of the party  somerham says that dartrey is a dreamer the countess went on that you are the man of affairs and the actual head of them all  your husband magnifies my position tallente assured her  mrs ward levitte the wife of a millionaire and a woman of vogue leaned forward and addressed him  do set my mind at rest mr tallente she begged are you going to break up our homes and divide our estates amongst the poor  is there going to be a revolution lady english asked eagerly and is it true that you are in league with all the bolshevists on the continent  tallente masked his irritation and answered with a smile  civil war he declared commences tomorrow every one with a title is to be interned in an asylum all country houses are to be turned into sanatoriums and all estates will be confiscated  the tiresome man wont tell us anything lady alice sighed  of course he wont mrs ward levitte observed you cant announce a revolution beforehand truthfully  if there is a revolution within the next fifteen years tallente said i think it will probably be on behalf of the disenfranchised aristocracy who want the vote back again  lady english and mrs levitte found something else to talk about between themselves lady somerham however had no intention of letting tallente escape  you are a neighbour of my niece in devonshire i believe she asked  he admitted the fact monosyllabically he was supremely uncomfortable and it seemed to him that jane who was conducting an apparently entertaining conversation with colonel fosbrook might have done something to rescue him  my niece has very broad ideas lady somerham went on some of her fellow landowners in devonshire are very much annoyed with the way she has been getting rid of her property  lady jane he pronounced drily is in my opinion very wise she is anticipating the legislation to come which will inevitably restore the land to the people from whom in most cases it was stolen  well my husband gave two hundred thousand pounds of good hardearned money for stoughton where we live mrs ward levitte intervened so far as i know the money wasnt stolen from anybody and i should say that the robbery would begin if the socialists or whatever they call themselves tried to take it away from us to distribute amongst their followers what do you think mr tallente my husband as i dare say you know is a banker and a very hardworking man  i agree with you he replied one of the pleasing features of the axioms of socialism adopted by the democratic party is that it respects the rights of the wealthy as well as the rights of the poor man the democrats mayin fact they most certainly willlegislate to prevent the hoarding of wealth or to have it handed down to unborn generations but i can assure you that it does not propose to interfere with the ethics of meum and tuum  i wish i could make out what its all about lady alice murmured  couldnt you give a drawingroom lecture mr tallente and tell us the bankers wife suggested  i am unfortunately a little short of time for such missionary enterprise tallente replied with unappreciated sarcasm dartreys volume on socialism in our daily life will tell you all about it far too dry she sighed i tried to read it but i never got past the first halfdozen pages  some day tallente observed coolly it may be worth your while all of you to try and master the mental inertia which makes thought a labour the application which makes a moderately good bridge player should be sufficient otherwise you may find yourselves living in an altered state of society without any reasonable idea as to how you got there mrs ward levitte turned to her hostess  lady jane she begged come and rescue us please we are being scolded colonel fosbrook we need a man to protect us mr tallente is threatening us with terrible things  were getting what we asked for lady alice put in quickly  colonel fosbrook caressed for a moment a somewhat scanty moustache he was a man of early middleage with a high forehead an aquiline nose and a somewhat vague expression  im afraid my protection wouldnt be much use to you he said regarding tallente with mild interest i happen to be one of the few surviving tories i imagine that mr tallentes opinions and mine are so far apart that even argument would be impossible  tallente acquiesced smiling  besides which i never argue outside the house he added you should stand for parliament colonel fosbrook and let us hear once more the athanasian creed of politics all opposition is wholesome  colonel fosbrook glared the fact that he had three times stood for parliament and three times been defeated was one of the mortifications of his life he made his adieux to jane and departed and to tallentes joy a breakup of the party seemed imminent mrs ward levitte drifted out and lady english followed suit lady somerham also rose to her feet but after a glance at tallente sat down again  my dear jane she insisted you must dine with us tonight you havent been here long enough to have any engagements and it always puts your uncle in such a good temper to hear that you are coming  jane shook her head  sorry aunt she regretted but i am dining with the temperleys i met diana in bond street this morning  thursday then  i am keeping thursday fora friend saturday i am free  saturday we are going into the country her aunt said a little ungraciously heaven knows what for your uncle hates shooting and always catches cold if he gets his feet wet  tallente unwillingly held out his hand to his hostess he seemed to have no alternative but to make his adieux jane walked with him towards the door  i am horribly disappointed he confessed under his breath  she smiled a little deprecatingly  i couldnt help having people here could i  i suppose not he answered with masculine unreasonableness i only know that i wanted to see you alone  men are such schoolboys she murmured tolerantly even you i must see my friends mustnt i when they know that i am here and call  about that friend on thursday night he went on  i am waiting to hear from him she answered whether he prefers to dine here or to take me out  his illhumour vanished and with it some of his stiffness of bearing his farewell bow from the door to lady somerham was distinguished with a new affability  if we may be alone he said softly i should like to come here  nevertheless his visit left him a little disturbed perhaps a little irritable with all the dominant selfishness which is part of a mans love he had spent every waking leisure moment since their last meeting in a world peopled by jane and himself alone a world in which any other would have been an intruder his eagerly anticipated visit to her had brought him sharply up against the commonplace facts of their daybyday existence he began to realise that she was without the liberty accorded to his sex or to such women as nora miall whose emancipation was complete janes way through life was guarded by a hundred irritating conventions he began to doubt even whether she realised the full import of what had happened between them there was nothing gross about his love not even a speculation in his mind as to its ultimate conclusion he was immersed in a wave of sentimentality he wanted her by his side free from any restraint he wanted the joy of her presence more of those soft almost reluctant kisses the mute obedience of her nature to the sweet and natural impulse of her love of the inevitable end of these things he never thought he was like a schoolboy in love for the first time his desires led him no further than the mystic joy of her presence the sweet passionless content of propinquity for the time the rest lay somewhere in a world of golden promise the sole right that he burned to claim was the right to have her continually by his side in the moments when he was freed from his work and even with the prospect of the following night before him he chafed a little as he reflected that until then he must stand aside and let others claim her in a fit of restlessness he abandoned his usual table in the house of commons grillroom and dined instead at the sheridan club where he drank a great deal of champagne and absorbed with ready appreciation and amusement the philosophy of the man of pleasure this was one of the impulses which kept his nature pliant even in the midst of these days of crisis    chapter xii  whilst tallente was trying to make up for the years of pleasant goodfellowship which his overstudious life had cost him and to recover touch with the friends of his earlier days stephen dartrey filled with a queer sense of impending disaster was climbing the steps to noras flat on the last landing he lingered for a moment and clenched his fingers  i am a coward he reflected sadly i have asked for this and it has come  he stood for a moment perfectly still with halfclosed eyes seeking for selfcontrol very much in the fashion of a man who says a prayer to himself then he climbed the last few stairs rang the bell and held out both his hands to nora who answered it herself  commend my punctuality he began  why call attention to the one and only masculine virtue she replied let me take your coat  he straightened his tie in front of the lookingglass and turned to look at her with something like wonder in his eyes  dear hostess he exclaimed what has come to you  an epoch of vanity she declared turning slowly around that he might appreciate better the clinging folds of her new black gown dont dare to say that you dont like it for heaven only knows what it cost me  it isnt only your gownits your hair  coiffured she confided by an artist not an ordinary hairdresser at all he only works for a few of our aristocracy and one or two leading ladies on the stage i pulled it half down and built it up again but its an improvement isnt it  it suits you he admitted butbut your colour  naturalabsolutely natural she insisted you can wet your finger and try if you like its excitement if you look into the depths of my wonderful eyesi have got wonderful eyes havent i  marvellous  you will see that i am suffering from suppressed excitement tonight is quite an epoch to tell you the truth i am rather nervous about it  is he here  you shall see him presently she promised come along  where is susan he asked as he followed her  gone out so has my maid i had a fancy to turn every one else out of the flat your only hot course will be from a chafingdish you see i am anxious to impresshimwith my culinary skill i hope you will like your dinner but it will be rather a picnic  dartrey glanced back at the hall stand there was no hat or coat there except his own he followed nora into the little study which was separated only by a curtain from the dining room  i think your idea is excellent he pronounced and you will forgive me he added producing the parcel which he had been carrying under his arm see what i have brought to drink your health and his even if he does not know yet the good fortune in store for him  he set down a bottle of champagne upon the table she laughed softly  you dear man she exclaimed fancy your thinking of it i thought you scarcely ever touched wine  i am not a crank he replied sometimes my guests have told me that i have quite a reasonably good cellar for a man who takes so little himself tonight i am going to drink a glass of champagne  pommery she exclaimed i hope youll be able to open it  that shall be my task he promised you neednt worry about flippers i have some in my pocket and by the by he added glancing at the clock where is your other guest it is ten minutes past eight and i can hear your chafingdish sizzling  she threw back the curtain and took his arm the table was laid for two he looked at it in bewilderment and then back at her  he has disappointed you  she smiled up at him  he has disappointed me many many times she said but not tonight  i dontunderstand he faltered  i think you do she answered  he took the chair opposite to hers the chafingdish was between them he was filled with a curious sense of unreality it was a little scene this out of a story or a play it didnt actually concern him it wasnt nora who sat within a few feet of him bending down over the chafingdish and stirring its contents vigorously  of course she said i am perfectly well aware that this is an anticlimax i am perfectly well aware too that you will have a most uncomfortable dinner you wont know what to say to me and youll be dying all the time to look in your calendar and see if this is leap year but even we working women sometimes she went on smiling bravely up at him have whims i had a whim stephen to let you know that i am very stupidly fond of you and although it isnt your fault and i expect nothing from you except that you do not alter our friendship you just stand in the way whenever i think of marrying any one  perhaps because speech seemed so inadequate dartrey said nothing he sat looking at her with a queer emotion in his soft studious eyes drumming a little on the table with his finger tips not quite sure what it meant that his heart was beating like a young mans and a queer sensation of happiness was stealing through his whole being  nothing in the world he murmured could alter our friendship  what you see before you she went on is an oyster stew the true hostess you see studying her guests special tastes it is very nearly cooked and if you do not pronounce it the most delicious thing you ever ate in your life i shall be terribly disappointed  dartrey sat as still as a man upon whom some narcotic influence rested and his words sounded almost unnatural  i am convinced he assured her that i shall be able to gratify you  what you get afterwards you see upon the sideboard cold partridgesboth young birds thoughham salad of my own mixing and behold my one outburst of extravagancestrawberries there is also a camembert cheese lying in ambush outside because of its strength i would suggest that during the three minutes which will ensue before i serve you with the stew you open the champagne you are so dumbfounded at my audacity that perhaps a little exercise will be good for you  dartrey rose to his feet produced the corkscrew and found the cork amenable he filled noras glass and his own then he leaned over her and took her hand for a moment his face was full of kindness and he was curiously disturbed  you are the dearest child on earth nora he said i find myself wishing from the bottom of my heart that it were possible that you could besomething nearer and dearer to me  she looked feverishly into his face and pushed him away  go and sit down and dont be absurd she enjoined try and forget everything else except that you are going to eat an oyster stew that is really the way to take life isnt itin cyclesand it doesnt matter then whether ones happy times are bounded by the coming night or the coming years for five minutes then a paradiseof oyster stew  it is distinctly the best oyster stew i have ever tasted in my life he pronounced a few minutes later  it is very good indeed she assented now your turn comes go to the sideboard and bring me something remember that i am hungry and dont forget the salad and tell me incidentally whether you have heard anything of a rumour going around about andrew tallente  he served her and himself and resumed his seat  a rumour he repeated no i have heard nothing what sort of a rumour  a vague but rather persistent one she replied they say that it is in the power of certain peopleto drive him out of political life at any moment  dartreys smile was sufficiently contemptuous but there was a note of anxiety in his tone which he could not altogether conceal  these canards are very absurd nora he declared the politician is the natural quarry of the blackmailer but i should think no man of my acquaintance has lived a more blameless life than andrew tallente  i will tell you in what form the story came to me she said it was from a journalist on the staff of one of our great london dailies the rumour was that they had been indirectly approached to know if they would pay a large sum for a story perfectly printable but which would drive tallente out of political life  do you know the name of the newspaper he asked eagerly  i was told nora answered but under the most solemn abjuration of secrecy you ought to be able to guess it though then a woman whom i met in the lyceum chub this afternoon asked me outright if there was any truth in certain rumours about tallente so people must be talking about it  the cloud lingered on dartreys face he ate and drank in his usual sparing fashion silently and apparently wrapped in thought from the other side of the pinkshaded lamp which stood in the middle of the table nora watched him with a curious almost a sardonic sadness in her clear eyes an hour ago she had looked at herself in the mirror and had been startled at what she saw the lines of her black gown the most extravagant purchase of her life had revealed the beauty of her soft and shapely figure her throat and bosom had seemed so dazzlingly white her hair so rich and glossy her eyes full of the hope the softness almost the anticipatory joy of the woman who has everything to offer to the one man in her life she had felt as she had looked almost a girl with music on her lips and joyous things in her heart nursing that wonderful gift to her sexthe hopeless optimism begotten of love and her little house of cards had tumbled so quickly to the ground the little denouement on which she had counted had fallen so flat they two were there alone the little dinner which she had planned was as near perfection as possible the champagne bubbled in their glasses the soft light the solitude the stillnessnothing had failed her except the man stephen sat within a few feet of her with furrowed brow and mind absorbed by a possible political problem  nora made coffee at the table but they drank it seated in great easy chairs drawn up to the fire she passed him silently a box of his favourite brand of cigarettes perhaps that evidence of her forethought the mute resignation of her restrained conversation with its attempted note of cheerfulness forced its way through the chinks of his unnatural armour his whole face suddenly softened he leaned across and took her fingers into his  dear nora he sighed what a brute i must seem to you and how difficult it is for me to try and tell you all that is in my heart  all tasks that are worth attempting are difficult she murmured please go on  they are such simple things that i feel he began simple and yet contradictory i should miss you more out of my life than any other person i shall resent from my very soul the man who takes you from me and yet i know what life is dear i know how inexorable are its decrees you have a fancy for me born of kindness and sympathy because you know that i am a little lonely in our thoughts too we live so much in the same world that is just one of the ironies of life nora our thoughts can move linked together through all the flowery and beautiful places of the world but our bodiesalas dear do you know how old i really am  i know how young you are she answered with a little choke in her throat  i am fiftyfour years old he went on i am in the last lap of physical wellbeing even though my mind should continue to flourish and you arehow much younger i dare not think  idiot she exclaimed at fiftyfour you are better and stronger than half the men of forty  i have good health he admitted but no constitution or manner of living is of any account against the years in six years time i shall be sixty years old  she leaned a little towards him now once more the light was coming back into her eyes if that was the only thing with him  in twelve years time from now she said i too shall turn over a chapter the chapter of my youth what is time but a relative thing who shall measure your six years against my twelve the years that count in the life of a man or a woman are the measure of their happiness  she glided from her chair and sank on her knees beside him her lips pleaded he took her gently far too gently into his arms  dear nora he begged be kind to me it is for your sake i know what love should mean for you what it must mean for every sweet woman you see only the present it is my hard task to look into the future for you  cant you understand she whispered feverishly that i would rather have that six years of your life and its aftermath than an eternity with any other man bend down your head stephen  her hands were clasped around his neck her lips forced his for a moment they remained so while the room swam around her and her heart throbbed like a mad thing then she slowly unlocked her arms and drew away as though unconscious of what she was doing she found herself rubbing her lips softly with her handkerchief she threw herself back in her chair a little recklessly  very well stephen she said you know your heart best drink your coffee and ill be sensible again directly  to his horror she was shaken with sobs he would have consoled her but she motioned him away  dear stephen she pleaded i am sorryto be such a foolbut this thing has lived with me a long time andwould you go away it would be kindest  he rose to his feet hesitated for one moment of agony then crossed the room with a farewell glance at the sad little feast he closed the door softly behind him descended the stairs and stood for a moment in the entrance hall looking out upon the street a cheerless drizzling rain was falling the streets were wet and swept with a cold wind he looked up and down thought out the way to his club and shivered thought out in misery the way back to chelsea the turning of his latchkey the darkened rooms the house opposite was brilliantly lit up they seemed to be dancing there and the music of violins floated out into the darkness even as he stood there he felt the bands of selfcontrol weaken about him a vision of the cold grey days ahead terrified him he was pitting his brain against his heart lives had been wrecked in that fashion philosophy as the years creep on is but a dour consolation he saw himself with the jewel of life in his hand prepared to cast it away he turned around and ran up the stone steps lighthearted and eager as a boy nora heard the door open and raised her head on the threshold stood stephen transformed rejuvenated the lover shining out of his eyes the look in his face for which she had prayed he came towards her speechless save for one little cry that ended like a sob in his throat took her into his arms tenderly but fiercely held her to him while the unsuspected passion of his lips brought paradise into the room  you care she faltered this is not pity  he held her to him till she almost swooned the restraint of so many years was broken down  must i after all be the teacher he asked passionately as their lips met again must i show you what love is    chapter xiii  tallente was seated at breakfast a few mornings later when his wife paid him an unexpected visit she responded to his greeting with a cold nod refused the coffee which he offered her and the easychair which he pushed forward to the fire  i got your letter andrew she said in which you proposed to call upon me this afternoon i am leaving town i am on my way back to new york as a matter of fact and i shall have left the hotel by midday so you see i have come to visit you instead  it is very kind he answered  she shrugged her shoulders and looked disparagingly around the plainly furnished mans sitting room  not much altered here she remarked it looks just as it did when i used to come to tea with you before we were married  the neighbourhood is a conservative one he replied still i must confess that i am glad i never gave the rooms up i dont think that nature intended me to dwell in palaces  perhaps not she agreed a little insolently it is a habit of yours to think and live parochially now what did you want of me please  there is a scheme on foot he began to bring about my political ruin  you dont mean to tell me she exclaimed with a sudden light in her eyes that you my wellbehaved andrew have been playing around you are not going to be a corespondent or anything of that sort  i used the word political he reminded her coldly you would not understand the situation but its interest and my danger centres round a certain document which was stolen from my study at martinhoe on or just before the day of my arrival from london last august  how dull she murmured  that document he went on was purloined by anthony palliser from the safe in my study it was either upon him when he disappeared or he disposed of it on the afternoon of my arrival to a political opponent of minejames miller  i had so hoped there was a lady in the case she yawned  if you will give me your attention for one moment longer he begged it will be all i ask i want you to tell me first of all whether james miller called at the manor that afternoon and saw palliser whether any one called who might have been helping him or  well  whether you have heard anything of palliser since his disappearance  she looked at him hardly  you have brought me here to answer these questions  pardon me he reminded her your coming was entirely your own idea  but why should you expect that i should give you information she demanded you refused to give me the thing i wanted more than anything in life and you have thrown me off like an old glove if you are threatened with what you call political ruin why on earth should i intervene to prevent it  he shrugged his shoulders  you take a severe and i venture to believe a prejudiced view of the situation between us he replied i never promised you that i would make you a peeress such a thing never entered into my head every pledge i made to you when we were married i kept you cannot say the same  the mans point of view i suppose she scoffed well ill tell you what i know in exchange for a little piece of information from you which iswhat do you know about anthony pallisers disappearance  he was silent for several moments the frown on his forehead deepened  your very question he observed answers one of the queries which have been troubling me  i have no objection to telling you she said that since that night i have neither seen nor heard of palliser  what happened that night was simple tallente explained calmly perhaps you would call it primitive you left the room i beckoned palliser to follow me outside the car was still in the avenue and the servants were taking my luggage in the spot where we stood on the terrace too was exactly underneath your window i took him by the arm and i led him along the little path towards the cliff when we came to the open space by the wall i let him go i asked him if he had anything to say he had nothing i thrashed him  you bully  tallente raised his eyebrows  palliser was twenty years younger than i and of at least equal build and strength he said it was not my fault that he seemed unable to defend himself  but his disappearancetell me about that  we were within a few feet of the edge of the cliff i struck him harder perhaps than i had intended and he went over i stood there and hooked down but i could see nothing i heard the crashing of some bushes and after thatsilence i even called out to him but there was no reply some time later robert and i searched the cliff and the bay below for his body we discovered nothing  it was high tide that night she cried you know very well that he must have been drowned  i have answered your question tallente replied quietly  there was a cold fury in her eyes the veins seemed to stand out on her clenched worn hands she looked at him with all the suppressed passion of a creature impotent yet fiercely anxious to strike  i shall give information she cried you shall be charged with his murder  tallente shook his head  you will waste your time stella he said for one thing a woman may not give evidence against her husband another thing there cannot very well be a charge for murder unsupported by the production of the body and for a third thing i should deny the whole story  her fury abated though the hate in her eyes remained  i think she declared that you are the most coldblooded creature i ever knew  the irony of the situation gripped at him he rose suddenly to his feet filled with an overwhelming desire to end it  stella he said to me you always seemed especially during our last few years together cold and utterly indifferent i know now that i was mistaken in your way you cared for palliser you starved me my own fault you would say perhaps but listen there is a way into every mans heart and a way into every womans but sometimes that way lies hidden except to the one right person and you werent the right person for me and i wasnt the right person for you now answer the rest of my question and let us part  tell me she asked with almost insolent irony do you believe that there could ever have been a right person for you  my god yes he answered with a sudden fire i suffer the tortures of the damned sometimes because i missed my chance there im telling you this just so that you shall think a little differently if you can you and i between us have made an infernal mess of things it was chiefly my fault and as regards palliserwell i am sorry only the fellowhe may have been lovable to you but he was a coward and a sneak to meand he paid i am sorry  she seemed a little dazed  you mean to tell me andrew she persisted that there is really some one you care for care for in the big waya woman who means as much to you as your place in parliamentyour ambition  more he declared vigorously there isnt a single thing i have or ever have had in life which i wouldnt give for the chancejust a chance  and she cares for you  i think that she would he answered she has been brought up in a very oldfashioned school she knows of you  stella smiled a little bitterly  well she said i suppose i am a brute but i am glad to know that you can suffer i hope you will suffer it makes you seem more human anyhow but in return for your confidence i will answer the other part of your question the man miller was at the manor that afternoon palliser confessed to me that he had given him some important document  given him  well sold him then tony hadnt got a shilling in the world and he would never take a halfpenny from me he had to have money he told me about it that night before you came miller gave him five thousand pounds for itsecret service money from one of the branches of his party now you know all about it  yes i know all about it tallente assented a little bitterly you can take your trip to america without a single regret stella i shall certainly never be a cabinet minister again much less prime minister of england miller can use those papers to my undoing  she shrugged her shoulders as she turned towards the door  you are like the fool she said who tried to build the tower of his life without cement all very well for experiments andrew when one is young and one can rebuild but you are a little old for that now arent you and all your brain and all your efforts and every thought you have been capable of since the day i met you have been given to that one thing youll find it a little difficult to start all over againdonttrouble i know the way down and i have a car waiting you must take up golf and make a water garden at martinhoe i dont know whether you deserve that i should wish you good fortune i cant make up my mind but i willand goodby  she left him in the end quite suddenly he had not even time to open the door for her tallente looked out of the window and watched her drive away his feelings were in a curiously numb state for stella he had no feeling whatever her confirmation of pallisers perfidy had awakened in him no new resentment only in a vague way he began to realise that his forebodings of the last few days were founded upon a reality whether palliser lived or was dead it was too late for him to undo the mischief he had done  tallente took up the receiver and asked for dartreys number in half an hour he was on his way to see him    chapter xiv  tallente had the surprise of his life when he was shown into dartreys little dining room a late breakfast was still upon the table and nora was seated behind the coffee pot she took prompt pity upon his embarrassment  youve surprised our secret she exclaimed but anyhow stephen was going to tell you today we were married the day before yesterday  that is why i played truant dartrey put in although we only went as far as tunbridge wells  tallente held out a hand to each for a moment the tragedy in his own life was forgotten  i cant wish you happiness because you have found it he said wise and wonderful people let me see if your coffee is what i should expect nora he went on to tell you the truth i have had rather a disturbed breakfast  so have we dartrey observed you mean the leeds figures of course  tallente shook his head  i havent even opened a newspaper  horlock went down himself yesterday to speak for his candidate our man is in by five thousand seven hundred votes  amazing tallente murmured  it is the greatest reversal of figures in political history dartrey declared listen tallente i was quite prepared to go the session as you know but horlocks had enough he is asking for a vote of confidence on tuesday hell lose by at least sixty votes  and then  we cant put it off any longer we shall have to take office i shall be sent for as the nominal leader of the party and i shall pass the summons on to you here is a list of names some of them we ought to see unofficially at once  tallente looked down the slip of paper he came to a dead stop with his finger upon millers name  i know dartrey said sympathetically but tallente you must remember that men are not made all in the same mould and miller is the link between us and a great many of the most earnest disciples of our faith in politics a man has sometimes to be accepted not so much for what he is as for the power which he represents  has he agreed to serve under me tallente inquired  we have never directly discussed the subject dartrey replied he posed rather as the ambassador when we came to you at martinhoe but as a matter of fact if it interests you to know it he was strongly opposed to my invitation to you i am expecting him here every momentin fact he telephoned that he was on the way an hour ago  miller arrived a few minutes later with the air of one already cultivating an official gravity he was dressed in his own conception of morning clothes which fitted him nowhere linen which confessed to a former days service and a brown homburg hat it was noticeable that whilst he was almost fulsome in his congratulations to nora and overcordial to dartrey he scarcely glanced at tallente and confined himself to a nod by way of greeting  couldnt believe it when you told me over the telephone he said i congratulate you both heartily what about leeds dartrey  splendid  its the end i suppose  absolutely that is why i telephoned for you horlock is quite resigned i understand that they will send for me but i wish to tell you miller as i have just told tallente that i have finally made up my mind that it would not be in the best interests of our party for me to attempt to form a ministry myself i am therefore passing the task on to tallente here is a list of what we propose  miller clenched the sheet of paper in his hand without glancing at it his tone was bellicose  do i understand that tallente is to be prime minister  certainly you see i have put you down for the home office sargent as chancellor of the exchequer saunderson  i dont want to hear any more miller interrupted its time we had this out i object to tallente being placed at the head of the party  and why dartrey asked coldly  because he is a newcomer and has done nothing to earn such a position miller declared because he has come to us as an opportunist because there are others who have served the cause of the people for all the years of their life who have a better claim and because at heart mind you dartrey he isnt a peoples man  what do you mean by saying that i am not a peoples man tallente demanded  just what the words indicate was the almost fierce reply youre eton and oxford not boardschool and apprentice your brain brings you to the cause of the people not your heart you arent one of us and never could be youre an aristocrat and before we knew where we were youd be legislating for aristocrats youd try and sneak them into your cabinet its their atmosphere youve been brought up in its with them you want to live thats what i mean when i say that youre not a peoples man tallente and i defy any one to say that you are  miller dartrey intervened earnestly you are expounding a case from the narrowest point of view you say that tallente was born an aristocrat that may or may not be true but surely it makes his espousal of the peoples cause all the more honest and convincing for you to say that he is not a peoples man you who have heard his speeches in the house who have read his pamphlets who have followed as you must have followed his political career is sheer folly  then i am content to remain a fool miller rejoined once and for all i decline to serve under tallente and i warn you that if you put him forward if you go so far even as to give him a seat in the cabinet of the government it is your job to form you will disunite the party and bring calamity upon us  have you any further reason for your attitude tallente asked pointedly except those you have put forward  miller met his questioners earnest gaze defiantly  i have he admitted  state it now then please  miller rose to his feet he became a little oratorical more than usually artificial  i make my appeal to you dartrey he said you have put forward this man as your choice of a leader of the great democratic party the party which is to combine all branches of labour the party which is to stand for the people i charge him with having written in the last year of the war a scathing attack upon the greatest of british institutions the trades unions an article written from the extreme aristocratic standpoint an article which if published today and distributed broadcast amongst the miners and operatives of the north would result in a revolution if his name were persisted in  i have read everything tallente has ever written and i have never come across any such article dartrey declared promptly  you have never come across it because it was never published miller continued and yet the fact remains that it was written and offered to the universal review it was actually in type and was only held back at the earnest request of the government because on the very day that it should have appeared an armistice was concluded between the railway men the miners and the war council and the government was terrified lest anything should happen to upset that armistice  is this true tallente dartrey asked anxiously  perfectly i admit the existence of the article and i admit that it was written with all the vigour i could command on the lines quoted by miller since however it was never published it can surely be treated as nonexistent  that is just what it cannot be miller declared the signed manuscript of that article is in the hands of those who would rather see it published than have tallente prime minister  blackmail the latter remarked quietly  you can call it what you please was the sneering reply the facts are as i have stated them  but what in the world could have induced you to write such an article tallente dartrey demanded your attitude towards labour even when you were in the coalition cabinet was perfectly sound  it was more than sound it was sympathetic tallente insisted that is why i worked myself into the state of indignation which induced me to write it i will not defend it it is sufficient to remind you both that when we were hard pressed when england really had her back to the wall when coal was the very blood of life to her a strike was declared in south wales and received the open sympathy of the faction with which this man miller here is associated miller has spoken plainly about me let him hear what i have to say about him he went down to south wales to visit these miners and he encouraged them in a course of action which if other industries had followed suit would have brought this country into slavery and disgrace and furthermore let me remind you of this dartrey it was millers branch of the labour party who sent him to switzerland to confer with enemy socialists and for the last eighteen months of the war he practically lived under the espionage of our secret servicea suspected traitor  its a lie miller fumed  it is the truth and easily proved tallente retorted when peace came however millers party altered their tactics and the hatchet was to have been buried my article was directed against the trades unions as they were at that time not as they are today and i still claim that if public opinion had not driven them into an arrangement with the government my article would have been published and would have done good to publish it now could answer no useful purpose its application is gone and the conditions which prompted its tone disappeared  i am beginning to understand dartrey admitted tell me how did the manuscript ever leave your possession tallente  i will tell you tallente replied pointing over at miller because that man paid palliser my secretary five thousand pounds out of his secret service money to obtain possession of it  miller was plainly discomfited  who told you that lie he faltered  its no lieits the truth tallente rejoined you used five thousand pounds of secret service money to gratify a private spite  thats false anyhow miller retorted i have no personal spite against you tallente i look upon you as a dangerous man in our party and if i have sought for means to remove you from it it has been not from personal feeling but for the good of the cause  there stands your leader tallente continued did you consult him before you bribed my secretary and hawked about that article first to horlock and now to heaven knows whom  it is the first i have heard of it dartrey said sternly  just so it goes to prove what i have declared beforethat millers attack upon me is a personal one  and i deny it miller exclaimed fiercely i dont like you tallente i hate your class and i distrust your presence in the ranks of the democratic party against your leadership i shall fight tooth and nail dartrey he went on you cannot give tallente supreme control over us you will only court disaster because that article will surely appear and the whole position will be made ridiculous i am strong enoughthat is to say those who are behind me will take my word on trustto wreck the position on thursday i can keep ninety labour men out of the lobby and the government will carry their vote of confidence in that case our coming into power may be delayed for years we shall lose the great opportunity of this century tallente is your friend dartrey but the cause comes first i shall leave the decision with you  miller took his departure with a smile of evil triumph upon his thin lips he had his moment of discomfiture however when dartrey coldly ignored his extended hand the two men left behind heard the door slam  this is the devil of a business tallente dartrey said grimly    chapter xv  nora returned to the room as miller left  i dont know whether you wanted me to go she said to dartrey but i cannot sit and listen to that man talk i try to keep myself free from prejudices but there are exceptions miller is my pet one tell me exactly what he came about something disagreeable i am sure  they told her but she declined to take the matter seriously  a position like this is necessarily disagreeable she argued but i have confidence in mr tallente remember this article was written nine years ago stephen and though for twentyfour hours it may make things unpleasant i feel sure that it wont do nearly the harm you imagine and think what a confession to make that man who aims at being a cabinet minister sits here in this room and admits that he bribed mr tallentes secretary with five thousand pounds to steal the manuscript out of his safe how do you think that will go down with the public  a certain portion of the public i am afraid tallente said gravely will say that i discovered the theftand killed palliser  killed palliser nora repeated incredulously i never heard such rubbish  palliser certainly disappeared on the evening of the day when he parted with the manuscript to miller tallente went on and has never been seen or heard of since  but there must be some explanation of that dartrey observed  there was a short silence significant of a curious change in the atmosphere tallentes silence grew to possess a queer significance the ghost of rumours to which neither had ever listened suddenly forced its way back into the minds of the other two dartrey was the first to collect himself  tallente he said as a private person i have no desire to ask you a single question concerned with your private life but we have come to something of a crisis it is necessary that i should know the worst is there anything else miller could bring up against you  to the best of my belief nothing tallente replied calmly  that is not sufficient dartrey persisted have you any knowledge tallente which the world does not share of the disappearance of this man palliser it is inevitable that if you discovered his treachery there should have been hard words did you have any scene with him do you know more of his disappearance than the world knows  i do tallente replied you shall share that knowledge with me to a certain extent i had another cause for quarrel with palliser to which i do not choose to refer but on my arrival home that night i summoned him from the house and led him to an open space i admit that i chose a primitive method of inflicting punishment upon a traitor i intended to thrash palliser a course of action in which i ask you dartrey to believe as a man of honour i was justified i struck too hard and palliser went over the cliff  neither nora nor dartrey seemed capable of speech tallentes cool precise manner of telling his story seemed to have an almost paralysing effect upon them  afterwards tallente continued i discovered the theft of that document a faithful servant of mine and i searched for pallisers body risking our lives in vain as it turns out in the hope of recovering the manuscript the body was neither in the bay below nor hung up anywhere on the cliff one of two things then must have happened either pallisers body must have been taken out by the tide which flows down the bristol channel in a curious way and will never now be recovered or he made a remarkable escape and decided under all the circumstances to make a fresh start in life  nora came suddenly over to tallentes side she took his arm and somehow or other the strained look seemed to pass from his face  dear friend she said this is very painful for you i know but your other cause of quarrel with palliseryou will forgive me if i askwas it about your wife  it was tallente replied you are just the one person in the world nora in whom i am glad to confide to that extent  she turned to dartrey  stephen she said either palliser is dead and his death can be brought to no ones door or he is lying hidden and there is no one to blame you can wipe that out of your mind can you not all that we shall have to consider now is the real effect upon the members of our party as a whole if this article is published  have you a copy of it dartrey asked  tallente shook his head  i havent but if a certain suspicion i have formed is true i might be able to get you one in any case dartrey dont come to any decision for a day or two if it is for the good of the party for you to throw me overboard you must do it and i can assure you ill take the plunge willingly on the other hand if you want me to fight ill fight  dartrey smiled  it is extraordinary he said how one realises more and more as time goes on how inhuman politics really are the greatest principle in life the principle of sticking to ones friends has to be discarded i shall take you at your word tallente i am going to consider only what i think would be best for the welfare of the democratic party and in the meantime well just go on as though nothing had happened  if horlock approaches me tallente began  he can go out either on a vote of confidence or on an adverse vote on any of the three bills next week dartrey said we dont want to drive them out like a flock of sheep they can go out waving banners and blowing tin horns if they like but theyre going its time the country was governed and the country after all is the only thing that countsi am sorry to send you back to work tallente in such a state of uncertainty but i know it will make no difference to you strike where you can and strike hard our day is coming and i tell you honestly i cant believenothing would make me believethat you wont be in at the death  dont forget that we meet tonight in charles street tallente reminded them as he shook hands  trust nora dartrey replied she has been looking forward to it every day  i now tallente said as he took up his hat and stick am going to confront an editor  you are going to try and get me a copy of the article  tallente nodded  i am going to try if my suspicions are correct you shall have it in twentyfour hours  tallente however spent a somewhat profitless morning and it was only by chance in the end that he succeeded in his quest he strolled into the lounge at the sheridan club to find the man he sought the centre of a little group greetings were exchanged cocktails drunk and as soon as an opportunity occurred tallente drew his quarry on one side  greening he said if you are not in a hurry could i have a word with you before lunch  by all means the other replied well go into the smoking room  they strolled off together followed by more than one pair of curious eyes an interview between the editor of the daily journal having the largest circulation in great britain and tallente possible dictator of a new party in politics was not without its dramatic interest tallente wasted no words as soon as they had entered the smoking room and found it empty  do you mind talking shop greening he asked ive been down to your place twice this morning but couldnt find you  go ahead the other invited i had to go round to downing street and then on to see the chief sorry you had a fruitless journey  i will be quite frank with you tallente went on what i am going to suggest to you is pure guesswork a political opponent if i can dignify the fellow with such a term has in his possession an article of mine which i wrote some years ago during the war i have been given to understand that he means to obtain publication of it for the purpose of undermining my position with the labour party has he brought it to you  he has greening answered briefly  are you going to use it  we are the article is in type now it wont be out for a day or two when it does we look upon it as the biggest political scoop of this decade  i protest to you formally tallente said against the publication by a respectable journal of a stolen document  greening shook his head  wont do tallente he replied we have had a meeting and decided to publish the best i can do for you is to promise that we will publish unabridged any comments you may have to make upon the matter on the following day  i have always understood that there is such a thing as a journalistic conscience tallente persisted can you tell me what possible justification you can find for making use of stolen material  the journalistic conscience is permitted some latitude in these matters greening answered drily we are not publishing for the sake of any pecuniary benefit or even for the kudos of a scoop we are publishing because we want to do our best to drive you out from amongst the democrats  did horlock send miller to you tallente enquired  greening shook his head once more  i cannot answer that sort of question i will say as much as this in our justification we stand for sane politics and your defection from the ranks of sane politicians has been very seriously felt we look upon this opportunity of weakening your present position with the democratic party as a matter of political necessity personally i am very sorry tallente to do an unfriendly action but i can only say like the schoolmaster before he canes a refractory pupil that it is for your own good  i should prefer to remain the arbiter of my own destiny tallente observed drily i suppose you fully understand that that noxious person miller paid my defaulting secretary five thousand pounds for that manuscript  my dear fellow if your pocket had been picked in the street of that manuscript and it had been brought to us we should still have used it was the frank reply  tallente stared gloomily out of the window  then i suppose there is nothing more to be said he wound up  nothing sorry tallente but the chief is absolutely firm he looks upon you as the monkey pulling the chestnuts out of the fire for the labour party and he has made up his mind to singe your paws  the democrats will rule this country before many years have passed tallente said earnestly whether your chief likes it or not isnt it better to have a reasonable and moderate man like myself of influence in their councils than to have to deal with miller and his lot  greening shrugged his shoulders and glanced at the clock  orders are orders he declared and even if i disbelieved in the policy of the paper i couldnt afford to disobey come and lunch tallente  can i have a proof of the article  by all means was the prompt reply shall i send it to your rooms or here  send it direct to stephen dartrey at the house of commons  i see greening murmured thoughtfully and then a council of war eh dont forget our promise tallente well publish your counterblast whatever the consequences  tallente sighed  it isnt decided yet he said as they made their way towards the luncheon room whether there is to be a counterblast    chapter xvi  we have achieved a triumph jane declared when the last of the servants had disappeared and the little party of four were left to their own devices we have sat through the whole of dinner and not once mentioned politics  you made us forget them tallente murmured  a lefthanded compliment jane laughed you should pay your tribute to my cook mr dartrey i have told you all about my farms and your wife has explained all that i could not understand of her last article in the national now i am going to seek for further enlightenment tell my why the publication of an article written years ago is likely to affect mr tallentes present position so much  because dartrey explained it is an attack upon the most sensitive the most difficult and the section of our party furthest removed from usthe great trades unions some years ago lady jane since the war one of our shrewdest thinkers declared that the greatest danger overshadowing this country was the power wielded by the representatives of these various unions a power which amounted almost to a dictatorship we have drawn them into our party through detaching the units we have never been able to capture them as a whole even today their leaders are in a curiously anomalous position they see their power going in the dawn of a more socialistic age they cannot refuse to accept our principles but in their hearts they know that our triumph sounds the death knell to their power this article of tallentes would give them a wonderful chance out of very desperation they will seize upon it  have you read the article jane enquired  this evening just before i came dartrey replied gravely  i can understand tallente intervened that you feel bound to take this seriously dartrey but after all there is nothing traitorous to our cause in what i wrote i attacked the trades unions for their colossal and fiendish selfishness when the empire was tottering i would do it again under the same circumstances remember i was fresh from ypres i had seen englishmen not soldiers but just hastily trained citizensbakers commercial travellers clerks small tradesmenbutchered like rabbits but fighting for their country dying for itand all the time those blackguardly stump orators at home turned their backs to france and thought the time opportune to wrangle for a rise in wages and bring the country to the very verge of a universal strike it didnt come off i know but there were very few people who really understood how near we were to it dartrey we sacrifice too much of our real feelings to political necessity i wont apologize for my article ill defend it  dartrey sighed  it will be a difficult task tallente the spirit has gone people have forgotten already the danger which we so narrowly escapedforgotten before the grass has grown on the graves of our saviours  still you wouldnt have mr tallente give in without a struggle jane asked  i hope that tallente will fight dartrey replied but i must warn you lady jane that i am the guardian of a cause and for that reason i am an opportunist if the division of our party which consists of the trades unionists refuses to listen to any explanation and threatens severance if tallente remains then he will have to go  so far as your personal view is concerned tallente asked you could do without miller couldnt you  i could thrive without him dartrey declared heartily  then you shall tallente asserted well show the world what his local trades unionism stands for he has belittled the whole principle of cooperation he twangs all the time one brazen chord instead of seeking to give expression to the clear voices of the millions miller would impoverish the country with his accursed limited production his threatened strikes his parochial outlook englishmen are brimful of common sense dartrey if you know where to dig for it well materialise your own dream well bring the principles of socialism into our human and daily life and those octopus trades unions shall feel the knife  jane laid her hand for a moment upon his arm  why arent you oftener enthusiastic  he glanced at her swiftly their eyes met fearlessly she held his fingers for a momenta long wonderful moment  i was getting past enthusiasms he said i was dropping into the dryasdust schoolthe argumentative logical cold ineffectual school the last few months have changed that i feel young again if dartrey will give me a free hand ill deliver up to him millers bones  dartrey had come to the dinner in an uncertain frame of mind no one knew better than he the sinister power behind miller yet before tallente had finished speaking he had made up his mind  ill stand by you tallente he declared even if it puts us back a year or so miller carries with him always an atmosphere of unwholesome things he has got the bolshevist filth in his blood and i dont trust him no one trusts him he shall take his following where he will and if we are not strong enough to rule without them well wait  it was a compact of curious importance which the two men sealed impulsively with a grip of the hands across the table and down at woolhanger through some dreary months it was janes greatest pleasure to remember that it was at her table it had been made   tallente seeking about for some excuse to remain for a few moments after the departure of the dartreys was relieved of all anxiety by janes calm and dignified remark  i cant part with you just yet mr tallente she said you are not in a hurry i hope and you are so close to your rooms that the matter of taxies need not worry you and mr dartrey next time you come down to my county you must bring your wife over to see me woolhanger is so typically devonshire i really think you would be interested  i shall make stephen bring me in the spring nora promised i shall never forget how fascinated we were with the whole place this last summer dont forget that you are coming to the house with me tomorrow afternoon  jane smiled  i am looking forward to it she declared the only annoying part is that that stupid man wont promise to speak  i shall have so much to say within the next week or so tallente observed a little grimly that i think i had better keep quiet as long as i can  the moment for which tallente had been longing came then the front door closed behind the departing guests jane motioned to him to come and sit by her side on the couch  i love your friends she said i think mrs dartrey is perfectly sweet and dartrey is just as wonderful as i had pictured him they are so strangely unusual she went on i can scarcely believe even now that our dinner actually took place in my little room herestephen dartrey the man i have read about all my life and this brilliant young wife of his thank you so much dear friend for bringing them  and thank you dear perfect hostess he answered do you know what you did you created an atmosphere in which it was possible to think and talk and see things clearly do you realise what has happened dartrey has done a great thing he has thrown over the one menacing power in the advancing cause of the people he is going to back me against miller  what exactly is millers position she asked  let me tell you another time he begged i have looked forward so to these few minutes with you tell me how much time you are going to spare me this next week  she looked at him with the slight indulgent smile of a woman realising and glad to realise her power to tallente she had never seemed more utterly and entirely desirable it was not for him to know that a french modiste had woven all the cunning and diablerie of the sex lure into the elegant shape the apparent simplicity of the black velvet which draped her limbs in some mysterious way the same spirit seemed to have entered into jane herself the evening had been one of unalloyed pleasure she felt the charm of her companion more than ever before the pleasant light in her eyes the courteous halfmocking phrases with which as a rule she fenced herself about in those moments when he sought to draw her closer to him were gone her eyes were as bright as ever but softer her mouth was firm yet somehow with a faint womanly voluptuousness in its sweet curves the fingers which lay unresistingly in his hand were soft and warm  as much time as you can spare she promised him i thought though that you would be busy tearing miller bone from bone  the game of politics is played slowly he answered sometimes so slowly that one chafes dear jane i want to see you all the time so much of what is best in me best and most effective comes from you  if i can help i am proud she whispered  you help more than you will ever know more than my lips can tell you it is you who have lit the lamp again in my life you from whom come the fire and strength which make me feel that i shall triumph that i shall achieve the one thing i have set my heart upon  the one thing she murmured rashly  the one thing outside he answered the desire of my brain the desire of my heart is here  she lay in his arms her lips moved to his and the moments passed uncounted then with a queer little cry she stood up covered her face for a moment with her hands and then held them both out to him  dear man she begged dearest of all menwill you go now tomorrowwhenever you have timelet your servant ring up i will free myself from any engagementbut please  he kissed her fingers and passed out with a murmured word he knew so little of women and yet some wonderful instinct kept him always in the right path perhaps too he feared speech himself lest the ecstasy of those few moments might be broken    chapter xvii  this is how a weekly paper of indifferent reputation but immense circulation brought tallentes love affair to a crisis in a column purporting to set out the editors curiosity upon certain subjects the following paragraphs appeared   whether a distinguished member of the democratic party is not considered just now the luckiest man in the world of politics and love   whether the young lady really enjoys playing the prodigal daughter at home and in the country and what her noble relatives have to say about it   whether there are not some sinister rumours going about concerning the politician in question   janes mother who had arrived in london only the day before was in charles street before her prodigal daughter had finished breakfast she brandished a copy of the paper in her hand jane read the three paragraphs and let the paper slip from her fingers as though she had been handling an unclean thing she rang the bell and pointed to where it lay upon the floor  take that into the servants hall and let it be destroyed parkins she ordered  the duchess held her peace until the man had left the room then she turned resolutely to jane  my dear she said thats posing besides its indiscreet parkins will read it of course and its what that sort of person reads nowadays that counts we cant afford it the aristocracy has had its fling today we are on our good behaviour  i should have thought jane declared that in these democratic days the best thing we could do would be to prove ourselves human like other people  and people call you clever her mother scoffed why my dear child any slight respect which we still receive from the lower orders is based upon their conviction that somehow or other we are after all made differently from them sometimes they hate us for it and sometimes they love us for it the great thing nowadays however is to cultivate and try and strengthen that belief of theirs  how did you come to see this rag jane enquired mildly  your aunt somerham brought it round this morning while i was in bed her mother replied it was a great shock to me also to your father he was anxious to come with me but is threatened with an attack of gout  and what do you want to say to me about it just why did you bring me that rag and show me those paragraphs  my dear i must know how much truth there is in them have you been going about with this man tallente  to a certain extent yes jane admitted after a moments hesitation  chaperoned  pooh you know i finished with all that sort of rubbish years ago mother  i am informed that mr tallente is a married man  jane flinched a little for the first time  all the world knows that she answered he married an american one of william hunters daughters  who has now i understand left him lady jane shrugged her shoulders  i do not discuss mr tallentes matrimonial affairs with him   surely her mother remarked acidly in view of your growing intimacy they are of some interest to you both  jane was silent for a moment  just what have you come to say mother she asked looking up at her cleareyed and composed better lets get it over  the duchess cleared her throat  jane she said we have become reconciled your father and i against our wills to your strange political views and the isolation in which you choose to live but when your eccentricities lead you to a course of action which makes you the target for scandal your family protests i have come to beg that this intimacy of yours with mr tallente should cease  mother jane replied for years after i left the schoolroom i subjected myself to your guidance in these matters i went through three london seasons and made myself as agreeable as possible to whatever you brought along and called a man at the end of that time i revolted i am still in revolt mr tallente interests me more than any man i know and i shall not give up my friendship with him  your aunt tells me that colonel fosbrook wants to marry you  he has mentioned the fact continually jane assented colonel fosbrook is a very pleasant person who does not appeal to me in the slightest as a husband  the fosbrooks are one of our oldest families the duchess said severely arnold fosbrook is very wealthy and the connection would be most desirable you are twentynine years old jane and you ought to marry you ought to have children and bring them up to defend the order in which you were born  mother dear jane declared smiling this conversation had better cease thanks to dear aunt jane i have an independent fortune woolhanger and my little house here i have adopted an independent manner of life and i have not the least idea of changing it you have three other daughters and they have all married to your complete satisfaction i dont think that i shall ever be a very black sheep but you must look upon me as outside the foldi hope you will stay to lunch colonel fosbrook is bringing his sister and the princess is coming  the duchess rose to her feet the family dignity justified itself in her cold withdrawal  thank you jane she said i am engaged i am glad to know however that you still have one or two respectable friends  the setting was the same only the atmosphere seemed somehow changed when jane received her second visitor that day she was waiting for him in the small sitting room into which no other visitor save members of the family were ever invited there was a comfortable fire burning the roses which had come from him a few hours before were everywhere displayed and jane herself in a soft brown velvet gown rose to her feet comely and graceful to welcome him  so we are immortalised she exclaimed smiling  that wretched rag he replied i was hoping you wouldnt see it  mother was here with a copy before eleven oclock  tallente made a grimace  have you sworn to abjure me and all my works  so much so she told him that i have been here waiting for you for at least half an hour and i have put on the gown you said you liked best some one said in a book i was reading last week that affection was proved only by trifles i have certainly never before in my life altered my scheme of clothes to please any man  he raised her fingers to his lips  you are exercising he said the most wonderful gift of your sex you are providing an oasismore than that a paradisefor a disheartened toiler it seems that i have enemies whose very existence i never guessed at  well does that matter very much she asked cheerfully it was one of your late party wasnt it who said that the making of enemies was the only reward of political success  a cheap enough saying tallente sighed yet with the germs of truth in it i dont mind the allusion to a sinister rumour the air will be thick with them before long the otherwell its beneath criticism but it hurts  she laughed wholeheartedly  andrew she said for the first time in my life i am ashamed of you here am i hidebound in conventions and i could just summon indignation enough to send the paper down to the kitchen to be burnt since then i have not even thought of it i was far more angry that any one should anticipate the troubles which you have to face come and sit down  she led him to the couch and held his fingers in hers as she leaned back in a corner  i honestly believe she went on gently that the world is not sufficiently grateful to those who toil for her criticism has become a habit of life nobody believes or wants to believe in the altruist any longer i believe that if today a rich man stripped himself of all his possessions and obeyed the doctrines of the bible by giving them to the poor the daily something or other would worry around until they found some interested motive and the daily something or other else would succeed in proving the man a hypocrite  he smiled and in the lightening of his face she appreciated for the first time a certain strained look about his eyes and the drawn look about the mouth  you are worrying about all this she exclaimed  yes in a way i am worrying he confessed simply not about the storm itself i am ready to face that and i think i shall be a stronger and a saner man when the battle has started in the meantime i think that what has happened to me is this i have arrived just at that time of life when a man takes stock of himself and his doings criticises his own past and wonders whether the things he has proposed doing in the future are worth while  you of all men in the world need never ask yourself that she declared warmly think of your lifelong devotion to your work think of the idlers by whom you are surrounded  i work he admitted but i sometimes ask myself whether i work with the same motives as i did when i was young i started life as an altruist i am not sure now whether i am not working in selfdefence from habit because i am afraid of falling behind  you mean that you have lost your ideals  i wonder he speculated whether any man can carry them through to my age and not be afflicted with doubts as to whether after all he has been on the right path whether he may not have been worshipping false gods  tell me exactly how you started life she begged  like any other third or fourth son of a bankrupt baronet he replied i went to eaton and oxford with the knowledge that i had to carve out my own career and my ambitions when i left the university were entirely personal i chose diplomacy i did moderately well i believe i remember my first really confidential mission he went on with a faint smile brought me to paris where we metthen came parliamentafterwards the war and a revolution in all my ideas i suddenly saw the strength and power of england and realised whence it came i realised that it was our democracy which was the backbone of the country i realised the injustice of those centuries of class government i plunged into my old socialistic studies which i had taken up at oxford more out of caprice than anything and i began to have a vision of what i have always since looked upon as the truth i began to realise that there was some superdivine truth in the equality of all humans notwithstanding the cheap arguments against it that by steady and broadminded government for a generation or so human beings would be born into the world under more level conditions and with the fading away of class would be born or rather generated the real and wonderful spirit of freedom my parliamentary career progressed by leaps and bounds but when in 15 the war began to go against us i turned soldier  you dont need to tell me anything about that part of your career she interrupted with a little smile almost of proprietory pride i never forget it  when i came back he continued i was almost a fanatic i worked not from the ranks of the labour party itself because i flatter myself that i was clearsighted enough to see that the labour party as it existed after the war split up by factions devoted to the selfish interests of the great trades unions and with the taint of miller retarding all progress had nothing in it of the real spirit of freedom it was every man for his own betterment and the world in which he lived might go hang i stayed with the coalitionists though i was often a thorn in their side but because i was also useful to them i bent them often towards the light then they began to fear me or rather my principles it was out of my principles although i was not nominally one of them that dartrey admits freely today he built up the democratic party he had been working on the same lines for years a little too much from the idealistic point of view he needed the formula i gave it to him horlock came into office again and i worked with him for a time gradually however my position became more and more difficult in the end he offered me a post in the cabinet induced me to resign my own seat which i admit was a doubtful one and sent me to fight hellesfield which it was never intended that i should win then miller dug his own grave he opposed me there and i lost the seat horlock was politely regretful scarcely saw what could be done for me at the moment was disposed to join in a paltry little domestic plot to send me to the lords this was at the time i came down to martinhoe the time except for those brief moments in paris when i first met you  pruning roses in a shockingly bad suit of clothes she murmured  and taken for my own gardener well then came dartreys visit he laid his programme before me offered me a seat and i agreed to lead the democrats in the house there i think i have been useful i knew the game which dartrey didnt whilst he has achieved almost the impossible has except so far as regards millers influence amongst the trades unions brought the great army of the people into line i accomplished the smaller task of giving them their due weight in the house  very well then jane declared looking at him with glowing eyes there is your stocktaking taken from your own the most modest point of view with your own lips you confess to what you have achieved to where you stand what doubts should any sane man have how can you say that the lamp of your life has burned dull  insight he answered promptly dont think that i fear the big fight i dont with dartrey on my side we shall wipe miller into oblivion it isnt true today to say that he represents the trades unions for the very reason that the trades unions as solid bodies dont exist any longer the men have learnt to think for themselves many of them are earnest members of the democratic party they have learnt to look outside the interests of the little trade in which they earn their weekly wage no it isnt miller that i am afraid of  then what is it she demanded  how can i put it he went on thoughtfully well first of all then i feel that the democrats when they come into power are going to develop as swiftly as may be all the fevers the sore places the jealousies and the pettiness of every other political party which has ever tried to rule the state i see the symptoms already and that is what i think makes my heart grow faint i have given the best years of my life to toiling for others who believes it who is grateful who would not say that because i lead a great party in the house of commons i have all that i have worked for that my reward is at hand and it isnt if i am prime minister in three months time there will still be something left of the feeling of weariness i carry with me today  it was a new phase of the man who unconsciously had grown so dominant in her life she felt the pull at her heartstrings her eyes were soft with unshed tears as her arm stole through his  please go on she whispered  there is the ego he confessed his voice shaking why it has come to me just at this period of lifebut there it is i have neglected human society human intercourse sport pleasures the joys of a man who was born to be a man i am philosopher enough not to ask myself whether it has been worth while but i do ask myselfwhat of the next ten years  who am i to give you counsel she asked trembling  the only person who can  then i advise you to go on this is just a mood there are muddy places through which one must pass even in the paths that lead to the mountain tops muddy and ugly and depressing places as one climbs one loses the memory of them  but i climb always alone he answered with a sudden fierceness i walk alone in life i have been strong enough to do it and i am strong enough no longerjane he went on his voice a little unsteady his hands almost clutching hers it is only since i have known you that i have realised from what source upon this earth a man may draw his inspiration his courage the strength to face the moving of mountains day by day my heart has been as dry as a seed plot you have brought new things to me the soft humanising stimulus of a new hope a new joy if i am to fight on to the end i must have you and your love  she was trembling and half afraid but her hands yielded their pressure to his her lips and her eyes the little quivering of her body all spoke of yielding  i have done foolish things in my life he went on drawing her nearer to him when i was young i felt that i had the strength of a superman and that all i needed in life was food for the brain i placed woman in her wrong place i sold myself and my chance of happiness that i might gain more power a wider influence it was a sin against life it was a greater crime against myself now that the thunder is muttering and the time is coming for the last test i see the truth as i have never seen it before nature has taken me by the handshows it metell me it isnt too late jane tell me you care help me i have never pleaded for help before i plead to you  her eyes were wet and beautiful with the shine of tears it seemed to him in that moment of intense emotion that he could read there everything he desired in life her lips met his almost eagerly met his and gave of their own free will  andrew she murmured you see you are the only man except those of my family whom i have ever kissed and i kiss you nowagainand againbecause i love you    chapter xviii  tallente notwithstanding the glow of happiness which had taken him down to westminster with the bearing of a young man felt occasional little shivers of doubt as he leaned back in his seat during the intervals of a brief but portentous debate and let his mind wander back to that short hour when he seemed to have emptied out all the hidden yearnings which had been lurking in the dark corners of his heart and soul his love for jane had no longer the boyish characteristics of a vague worship he made no further pretences to himself it was jane herself and not the spirit of her sex dwelling in her body which he desired a tardy heritage of passion at times rejuvenated him and at others stretched him upon the rack  he walked home later with dartrey clinging to the man with a new sympathy and drinking in with queer content some measure of his happiness dartrey himself seemed a little ashamed of its exuberance  if it werent that nora is so entirely a disciple of our cause tallente he said i think i should feel a little like the man in the pilgrims progress who stopped to pick flowers by the way she is such a help though it was she who pointed out the flaw in that second amendment of saundersons which i had very nearly passed did you read her article in the national too  wonderful tallente murmured there is no living woman who writes such vivid and convincing prose  and the amazing part of it all is dartrey went on that she seeks no reward except just to see the cause prosper she hasnt the faintest ambition to fill any post in life which could be filled by a man she would write anonymously if it were possible she has insight which amounts to inspiration yet whenever i am with her she makes me feel that her greatest gift is her femininity  it must be the most wonderful thing in life to have the help of any one like nora tallente said dreamily  my friend the other rejoined i wish i could make you believe this there is room in the life of the busiest man in the world for an understanding woman ill go further no man can do his best work without her  i believe you are right tallente assented  his friend pressed his arm kindly  youve ploughed a lonely furrow for a good many years tallente he said nora talks of you so often and so wistfully she is such an understanding creatureno dont go just one whisky and soda it used to be chocolate but nora insists upon making a man of me  tallente was a little in the shadow of the hall and he witnessed the greeting between nora and her husband saw her come out of the studya soft entrancing figure in the little circle of firelight gleaming through the open door she threw her arms around dartreys neck and kissed him  dear she exclaimed how early you are come and have an easychair by the fire and tell me how every ones been behaving  dartrey with his arm around her waist turned to tallente  an entirely unrehearsed exhibition i can assure you tallente he declared  nora pouted and passed her other arm through tallentes  thats just like stephen she complained advertising his domestic bliss never mind there is room for an easychair for you  tallente took a whisky and soda but declined to sit down  i walked home with stephen he said and then i felt i couldnt go away without seeing you just for a moment nora  dear man she answered i should have been terribly hurt if you had do make yourself comfortable by the fire you will be able to check all that stephen tells me about the debate tonight he is so inexact  tallente shook his head i am restless tonight nora he said simply i shall walk up to the club  she let him out herself holding his hand almost tenderly oh you poor dear thing she said i do wish i knew  what  what to wish youwhat to hope for you  he walked away in silence they both understood so wellhe found his way to the club and ate sandwiches with one or two other men also just released from the house but the more he tried to compose himself the more he was conscious of a sort of fierce restlessness that drove the blood through his veins at feverish pace he wandered from room to room played a game of billiards chafing all the time at the necessity of finishing the game he hurried away pleading an appointment in the hall he met greening who led him at once to a secluded corner  prepared with your apologia tallente he enquired  its in your office at the present moment tallente replied finished this morning  greening stroked his beard he was a lank rather cadaverous man with a face like granite and eyes like polished steel few men had anything to say against him no one liked him  how are you regarding the appearance of these outpourings of yours tallente he asked  with equanimity was the calm rejoinder i think i told you what i thought of you and your journalism for having any dealings with a thief and for making yourself a receiver of stolen property i have nothing to add to that i am ready to face the worst now and you may find the thunders recoil on your own head  no one will ever be able to blame us greening replied for publishing material of such deep interest to every one even though it should incidentally be your political death warrant as a matter of fact tallente i was rather hoping that i might meet you here tonight the chief and horlock appear to have had a breeze  how does that concern me tallente asked bluntly  it may concern you very much indeed a few days ago i should have told you as i did that nothing in the world could stop the publication of that article today i am not so sure at any rate i believe there is a chance would you care to see the chief  i havent the slightest desire to tallente replied i have made my protest nothing in the world can affect the morality of your action at the same time i have got over my first dread of it i am prepared with my defence and perhaps a little in the way of a counterattack no i am not going hat in hand to your chief greening he must do as he thinks well  if that is your attitude greening observed things will probably take their course on the other hand if you were inclined to have a hearttoheart talk with the chief and our other editors i believe that something might come of it  in other words tallente said coldly your chief who is one of the most magnificent opportunists i ever knew has suddenly begun to wonder whether he is backing the right horse  something like it perhaps greening admitted look here tallente he went on youre a big man in your way and i know perfectly well that you wouldnt throw away a real advantage out of pique consider this matter i cant pledge the paper or the chief i simply saysee him and talk it over  tallente shook his head  i am much obliged greening he said but i dont want to go through life with this thing hanging over me miller has a copy of the article without a doubt if you turn him down hell find some one else to publish it i should never know when the thunderbolt was going to fail i am prepared now and i would rather get it over  is dartrey going to back you greening asked  tallente smiled  i cant give away secrets  greening turned slowly away  i am off for a rubber of bridge he said i am sorry tallente better dismiss this interview from your mind altogether it very likely wouldnt have led to anything all the same i envy you your confidence if i could only guess at its source id have a leader for tomorrow morning  tallente walked down the stairs with a smile upon his lips he put on his hat and coat and hesitated for a moment on the broad steps then a sudden wonderful thought came to him an impulse entirely irresistible he started off westward walking with feverish haste  the spirit of adventure sat in his heart as he passed through the crowded streets the night was wonderfully clear the stars were brilliant overhead and from behind the colliseum dome a corner of the yellow moon was showing he was conscious of a sudden new feeling of kinship with these pleasureseeking crowds who jostled him here and there upon the pavement he was glad to find himself amongst them and of them he felt that he had come down from the chilly heights to walk the lighted highways of the world the keen air with its touch of frost invigorated him there was a new suppleness in his pulses a queer excitement in his whole being which he scarcely understood until his long walk came to an end and he found himself at a standstill in front of the house in charles street his unadmitted destination  he glanced at his watch and found that it was half an hour after midnight there was a light in the lower room into which jane had taken him on the night of her arrival in town above the whole of the house seemed in darkness he walked a little way down the street and back again jane was dining he knew with the princess de fénaples her godmother and had spoken of going on to a ball with her afterwards in that case she could scarcely be home for hours yet somehow he had a joyful conviction that history would repeat itself that he would find her as he had once before entering the house his fortune was in the ascendant not even the emptiness of the street discouraged him he strolled a little way along and back again as he passed the door once more something bright lying underneath the scraper attracted his notice he paused and stooped down almost before he had realised what he was doing he had picked up a small key her latchkey and was holding it in his hand  he passed down the street again and there seemed something unreal in the broad pavement the frowning houses the glow of the gas lamps the harmless little key burned his flesh all the passionate acuteness of life seemed throbbing again in his veins he retraced his steps making no plans obeying only an ungovernable instinct the street was empty he thrust the key into the lock opened the door replaced the key under the scraper entered the house and made his way into the room on the right  tallente stood there for a few minutes with fastbeating heart he had the feeling that he had burned his boats he was face to face now with realities there was no sound from anywhere a bright fire was burning in the grate an easychair was drawn up to the side of a small table on which was placed a tumbler some biscuits a box of cigarettes and some matches a copper saucepan full of milk stood in the hearth side by side with some slippersdainty furtopped slippers even these slight evidences of her coming presence seemed to thrill him time dissolved away into a dream of anticipation minutes or hours might have passed before he heard the motor stop outside her voice bidding some friend a cheerful good night the turning of the key in the door the drawing of a bolt a light step in the hall and thenjane  she was wrapped from head to foot in white furs a small tiara of emeralds and diamonds on her head she entered humming a tune to herself serene desirable  andrew  her exclamation the light in her eyes the pleasure which swiftly took the place of her first amazement intoxicated him he drew her into his arms and his voice shook  jane he confessed i tried to keep away and i couldnt i stole in here to wait for you and youre gladthank heavens youre glad  but how long have you been here she asked wonderingly  he shook his head  i dont know i walked down the street hoping for a miracle then i saw your key under the scraper i let myself in and waitedjane how wonderful you are  unconsciously she had unfastened and thrown aside her furs her arms and neck shone like alabaster in the shaded light she looked into his face and began to tremble a little  you ought not to have done this she said  why not he pleaded  if any one had seen youif the servants knew  he laughed and stopped her mouth with a kiss  dear these things are trifles the things that count lie between us two only do you know that you have been in my blood like a fever all day you were there in the house this afternoon you walked the streets with me you drew me herejane i havent felt like this since i was a boy you have brought me back my youth i adore you  again she rested willingly enough in his arms smiling at him as he drew near to her with wonderful kindness the fire of his lips however seemed to disturb her she felt the enveloping turmoil of his passion now become almost ungovernable and extricated herself gently from his arms  put my saucepan on the fire please she begged you will find some whisky and soda on the sideboard there parkins evidently thinks that i ought to have a male escort when i come home late  i dont want whisky and soda jane he cried passionately i want you  she rested her hand upon his shoulder  and am i not yours dear she askedfoolishly unwisely perhaps but certainly yoursthey were all talking about you tonight at dinner and i was so proud she went on a little feverishly our host was almost eloquent he said that democracy led by you instead of proving a curse might be the salvation of the country because you have political insight and imperialistic ideas it is those terrible people who would make a parish council of parliament from whom one has most to fear  tallente made no reply he was standing on the hearth rug a few feet away from her watching as she stirred her milk watching the curve of her body the grace of her long smoothly shining arms and beyond these things he strove to read what was at the back of her mind  we must talk almost in whispers she went on and do have your whisky and soda andrew because you must go very soon  it would disturb you very much if your servants were to know of my presence here he asked in a queer even tone  of course it would she answered without looking at him as you know i have lived from my standpoints an extraordinarily unconventional life but that was because i knew myself and was safe buti have never done anything like this before in my life  you have never been in the same position he reminded her there has never been any one else to consider except yourself  true enough she admitted but oughtnt that to make one all the more careful i loved seeing you when i came in and i have loved our few minutes together but i am getting a little nervous do you see that it is past two oclock  there is no one to whom you are accountable for anything in life except to me he told her passionately  she laughed softly but a little uneasily  dear andrew she said there is my own sense of what is seemly andmust i use the horrid wordmy reputation to be considered as it is you may be seen leaving the house in the small hours of the morning  a little shiver passed through him all the splendid warmth of living seemed to be fading away from his heart and thoughts he was back again in that empty world of unreal persons jane had been a dream this kindly faced beautiful but anxious girl was not the jane to whose arms he had come hotfoot through the streets  i ought not to have come he muttered  dear i dont blame you in the least she answered only be very careful as you go out if there is any one passing in the street wait for a moment  i understand he promised i will take the greatest care  he took up his hat and coat mechanically she thrust her arm through his and led him to the door looking furtively into his face as though afraid of what she might find there her own heart was beginning to beat faster she was filled with a queer sense of failure  you are not angry with me andrew you know that i have been happy to see you  i am not angry he answered  there was a little choking in her throat she felt the rush of strange things her eyes sought his filled with almost terrified anticipation it chanced that he was looking away she clenched her hands his moment had passed  there is something else on your mind andrew i know but tonight we cannot talk any longer she said in something resembling her old tone be very careful dear tomorrowyou will come tomorrow  he walked down the hall with the footsteps of a cat let himself out silently into the empty street and walked with leaden footsteps to his rooms it was not until he had reached the seclusion of his study that the change came a sudden dull fury burned in his heart he poured himself out whisky and drank it neat then he seated himself before his desk and wrote he did not once hesitate he did not reread a single sentence he dug up the anger and the bitterness from his heart and set them out in flaming phrases a sort of lunacy drove him into the bitterest of extremes his brain seemed fed with the inspiration of his suffering fed with cruel epigrams and biting words he dragged his idol down into the dust scoffed at the piecemeal passion which measures its gifts the complacency of an analysed virtue the sense of wellliving and selfcontentment achieved in the rubric of a dryasdust morality she had failed him offered him stones instead of breadhe signed the letter blotted it with firm fingers addressed the envelope stamped it and dropped it himself into the pillar box at the corner of the street then he turned wearily homeward filled with the strange almost maniacal satisfaction of the man who has killed the thing he loves    chapter xix  there followed days of sullen battle for tallente a battle with luck against him with his back to the wall with despair more than once yawning at his feet the house in charles street was closed there had come no word to him from jane no news even of her departure except the somewhat surprised reply of parkins when he had called on the following afternoon  her ladyship left for devonshire sir by the tenfifty train  tallente went back to the fight with those words ringing in his ears he had deliberately torn to pieces his house of refuge success or failure what did it matter now yet with the dogged courage of one loathing failure for failures own sake he flung himself into the struggle  on the fifth day after janes departure the thunderbolt fell tallentes article was printed in full and the weaker members of the democratic party shouted at once for his resignation at a question cunningly framed by dartrey tallente rose in the house to defend his position and acting on the soundest axiom of military tactics that the best defence is attack he turned upon miller and with caustic deliberation exposed the plot framed for his undoing he threw caution to the winds and though repeatedly and gravely called to order he poured out his scorn upon his enemy till the latter white as a sheet rose to demand the protection of the speaker there were very few in the house that day who ever forgot the almost terrifying spectacle of millers collapse under his adversarys hurricane assault or the proud and dignified manner in which tallente concluded his own defence but this was only the first step the labour press throughout the country took serious alarm at an attack which though out of date and influenced by conditions no longer predominant yet struck a very lusty blow at the very existence of their great nervous centres miller as chairman of the associated trades unions issued a manifesto which notwithstanding his declining influence exercised considerable effect it seemed clear that he could rely still upon a good ninety votes in the house of commons horlock became more cheerful he met tallente leaving the house one windy march evening and the two men shared a taxi together westwards  looks to me like another year of office thanks to you the prime minister observed lenton tells me that we shall have a majority of forty on thursday week it is thursday week youre going for us again isnt it  many things may happen before then tallente replied with a little affirmative nod dartrey may decide that i am too expensive a luxury and make friends with miller  i dont think thats likely horlock pronounced dartrey is a fine fellow although he is not a great politician he is out to make a radical and solid change in the government of this country and he knows very well that millers gang will only be a dead weight around his neck hed rather wait until he has weaned away a few more voteseven get rid of miller if he canand stick to you  i think you are right tallente said i am keeping the democrats from a present triumph but if through me they shake themselves free from what i call the little labourites i think things will pan out better for them in the long run  and in the meantime horlock went on lighting a cigar and passing his case to tallente i must give you the credit of playing a magnificent lone hand i expected to see miller fall down in a fit when you went for him in the house if only his army of adherents could have heard that little duel i think youd have won straight through  unfortunately they couldnt tallente sighed and its so hard to capture the attention to reach the inner understanding of a great mixed community  its a curious thing about englishmen horlock reflected especially the englishman who has to vote the most eloquent appeals on paper often leave him unmoved a perfectly convincing pamphlet he lays down with the feeling that no doubt its all right but there must be another side its the spoken words that tell every time what about millers election next week  a great deal depends upon that tallente replied miller himself says that it is a certainty on the other hand saunderson is going to be proposed and with dartreys influence should have a pretty good backing  they travelled on in silence for a short time tallente looked idly through the rainstreaming window at the block of traffic the hurrying passersby the cheerful warmth of the shops and restaurants  you take life too seriously tallente his companion said a little abruptly  do i tallente answered with a thin smile  you do indeed look at me i havent a line on my face as compared with yours and ive held together a patchwork government for five years i dont know when i may be kicked out and i know perfectly well that the government which succeeds mine is going to undo all i have done and is going to establish a state of things in this country which i consider nothing short of revolutionary i am not worrying about it tallente the fog of downing street stinks sometimes in my nostrils but i have a little country houseyou must come and see me there some daydown in buckinghamshire one of these long low bungalow types you know with big gardens two tennis courts and a golf course just across the river my wife spends most of her time there now and every weekend when i go down i think what a fool i am to waste my time trying to hold a reluctant nation to principles they are thoroughly sick of tallente you can turn me out whenever you like the day i settle down for two or three months rest is going to be one of the happiest of my life  you have a wonderful temperament tallente remarked a little sadly  temperament be damned was the forcible reply i have done my best when youve said those four words tallente any man ought to have philosophy enough to add whatever the result may be it isnt going to be my funeral look at youhaggard losing weight every day poring over papers scheming planning writing articles pouring out the great gift of your life twice as fast as you need no one will thank you for it its quite enough to give half your soul and the joy of living to work for others keep something up your sleeve for yourself tallente mark you thats the soundest thing in twentieth century philosophy youll ever hear ofcorner of clarges street right for you eh  tallente held out his hand  horlock he said thank you i know youre right but unfortunately i am not like you i havent an idyllic retreat a charming companion waiting for me there a life outside thats so wonderful i am driven on because theres nothing else  horlock laid his hand upon his companions shoulder his tone was suddenly graveamply sympathetic  my friendand enemy he said if that is soim sorry for you    chapter xx  there was a tense air of expectation amongst the little company of men who filed into one of the smaller lecture rooms attached to demos house a few afternoons later two long tables were arranged with sixty or seventy chairs and a great ballot box was placed in front of the chairman a little round of subdued cheers greeted the latter as he entered the room and took his placethe right honourable john weavel a privy councillor member for sheffield and chairman of the ironmasters union dartrey and tallente appeared together at the tail end of the procession miller sprang at once to his feet and addressed the chairman  mr chairman he said i call attention to the fact that two honorary members of this company are present i submit that as these honorary members have no vote and the present meeting is called with the sole object of voting a chairman for the year honorary members be not admitted  mr weavel shook his head  honorary members have the right to attend all meetings of our society he pronounced they can even speak if invited to do so by the chairman for the day i am sure that we are all of us very pleased indeed to welcome mr dartrey and mr tallente  there was a murmur of approval in one or two cases a little dubious dartrey smiled a greeting at weavel  i have asked mr tallente to accompany me he explained because in face of the great issues by which the party to which we all belong is confronted some question might arise on todays proceedings which would render his presence advisable he does not wish to address you i however with the chairmans permission before you go to the vote would like to say a few words  miller again arose to his feet  i submit mr chairman he said arrogantly that when i had the privilege of being elected last april no honorary member was present or allowed to speak  mr weavel rose to his feet  gentlemen he said you know what this meeting is it is a meeting of fiftyseven representatives of the various trades unions of the country to elect a single representative to take the chair whenever meetings of this company shall be necessary this gathering does not exist as a society in any shape or form and we have therefore neither rules nor usages mr dartrey and mr tallente although they are honorary members are i am sure welcome guests and whatever either of them wishes to say to us will i am sure be listened to there is no business all that we have to do is to vote to choose our leader for the next twelve months there are two names put forwardsaunderson and miller it is my business only to count the votes you may record presuming that no one else wishes to speak i shall ask mr dartrey to say those few words  miller sat frowning and biting his nails dartrey moved to the farther end of the room and looked down the long line of attentive faces  weavel he said and you my friends i am not here to say a word in favour of either of the two candidates between whom you have to choose today i am here just because you are valued members of the great party which before very long will be carrying upon its shoulders the burden of this countrys government to tell you of one measure which some of you know of already which may help you to realise how important your todays choice will be you know quite as much about politics as i do you know very well that the present government is doomed but for an unfortunate difference of opinion between two of our supporters who are present today there is not the slightest doubt that the government would lose their vote of confidence tomorrow and that in that case if i still remained your chief i should be asked to form a democratic government a task which when the time comes it is my intention to pass on to one more skilled in parliamentary routine i want to explain to you that we consider the representative you elect today to be one of the most important personages in that government we have not issued our programme yet when we do we are going to make the country a wonderful promise we are going to promise that there shall be no more strikes that sounds a large order perhaps but we shall keep our word and we are going to end for ever this bitter struggle between capital and labour by welding the two into one and by making the interests of one the interests of the other our scheme is that the person whom you elect today will be chairman of an inner conference of twelve we shall ask you to elect a further three from amongst yourselves which will give the trades unions four representatives upon this inner council four representative cabinet ministers will be chosen by ballot to add to their number four employers of labour elected by the employers association will also join the council and the whole will be presided over by the person whom you elect today there will be a select committee or rather fiftyseven select committees of each industry always at hand and we consider that we shall frame in that manner a body of men competent to deal with the inner workings of every industry they will decide what proportion of the earnings of each industry shall be allocated to labour and what to capital in other words they will fix or approve of or revise the wages of the country they will settle every dispute and their decision will be final the funds held by the various trades unions will form charitable funds or be returned as bonuses to the contributors i have given you the barest outline of the scheme which has been drawn up to form a part of our programme when the time comes for us to present one today you are only concerned to elect the one representative i am here to beg gentlemen that you elect one whose theories whose principles whose antecedents and whose general attitude towards labour problems will fit him to take a very important place in the future government of the country  there was a little murmur of applause miller was once more on his feet  i claim he said that this is neither the time nor the place to spring upon us an utterly new method of dealing with labour questions what you propose seems to me a subtle attack upon the trades unions themselves they have been the guardians of the people for the last fifteen years and even though some strikes have been necessary and although all strikes may not have been successful yet on the whole the trades unions have done their work well i shall not accept in the event of my election the programme which mr dartrey has laid down unless i am elected with a special mandate to do so  saunderson rose to his feet a man of different type blunt of speech rugged the typical workingmans champion except for his voice which was of unexpected tone and quality  mr weavel and the rest of you he said i differ from miller thats lucky because you can vote now not only for the man but the principle i have loathed strikes all my life just because i am political economist enough to loathe waste and to hate to see production fetteredthat is where the fruits of the production are shared fairly with labour i like dartreys scheme and i am prepared to stand by it  saunderson sat down dartrey and tallente left the room while the business of voting went on dartrey had a private room of his own in the rear of the building and he and tallente made their way there  those men have a good deal to decide tallente reflected its queer how the balance of things has changed i dont suppose any cabinet council for years has had to tackle a more important problem  i wonder how theyll vote dartrey speculated weavels our man  you cant tell tallente replied youve given them something fresh to think about they may even decide not to vote today at all miller has some strong supporters he appeals tremendously to a certain class of labourand that class exists you know dartreywhich loves the excitement and the loafing of a strike which feels somehow or other that benefits got in any other way than by force are less than they ought to have been  there was a knock at the door northern put in his head he was the boot and shoe representative  thought id let you know how the things gone he said theres an unholy row there theyve chucked miller saundersons in by five votes im off back again millers up speaking tearing mad  he nodded and disappeared dartrey held out his hand  thank god he exclaimed lets clear cut tallente nora must know about this at once well call at the house and enter your amendment against the vote of confidence and thennora i am not sure tallentethe mans a subtle fellowbut i rather think weve driven the final nail into millers coffin    chapter xxi  the great night came and passed with fewer thrills than any one had imagined possible horlock himself undertook the defence of his once more bitterly assailed government and from the first it was obvious what the end must be he spoke with the resigned cynicism of one who knows that words are fruitless that the die is already cast and that his little froth of words valedictory in their tone from the first was only a tribute to exacting convention tallente had never been more restrained although his merciless logic reduced the issues upon which the vote was to be taken to the plainest and clearest elements he remained studiously unemotional and nothing which he said indicated in any way his personal interest in the sweeping away of the horlock regime he was the impersonal but scathing critic paving the way for his chief it was dartrey himself who overshadowed every one that night he spoke so seldom in the house that many of the members had forgotten that he was an orator of rare quality that night he lifted the debate from the level of ordinary politics to the idyllic realms where alone the lasting good of the world is fashioned he pointed out what government might and should be taking almost a roman view of the care of the citizen his early and late education his shouldering of the responsibilities which belong to one of a great community from the individual he passed to the nation sketching in a few nervous but brilliant phrases the exact possibilities of socialistic legislation and he wound up with a parodied epigram government he declared was philosophy teaching by failures in the end miller led fourteen of his once numerous followers into the government lobby to find himself by forty votes upon the losing side  horlock found tallente once more slipping quietly away from the house and bundled him into his car they drove off rapidly so its buckinghamshire for me the former observed not without jubilation after all it has been rather a tame finale we were beaten before we opened our mouths  even your new adherent tallente said smiling could not save you  horlock made a grimace  you can have miller and his faithful fourteen he declared we dont want him the man was a little englander he has become a little labourite heaven knows where hell end are you going to be prime minister tallente  i dont know was the quiet reply just for the moment i am weary of it all day after day fighting and scheming speaking and writing just to get you fellows out and now weve got you out well i dont know that we are going to do any better weve got the principles weve got some of the men but is the country ready for our programme  if you ask me i think the countrys ready for anything in the way of a change horlock replied i am sure i am i have been prime minister before but ive never in my life had such an army of incompetents at the back of me take my tip tallente dont you have a chancellor of the exchequer who refuses to take a bit off the income tax every year  we shall abolish the income tax before long tallente declared  i shall invest my money in america horlock observed my savings that is where shall i put you down  in chelsea if you would tallente begged we are only just turning off the embankment i want to see mrs dartrey  horlock gave an order through the tube  i am going down to belgrave square he said then i am going back to downing street for tonight tomorrow a dutiful journey to buckingham palace saturday a long weekend i shall take out a season ticket to buckinghamshire now youre not going to nationalise the railwaysor are you tallente what about season tickets then  nationalisation is badly defined tallente replied the government will certainly aim at regulating the profits of all public companies and applying a portion of them to the reduction of taxation  well good luck to you horlock said heartily as the car pulled up outside dartreys little house heres just a word of advice from an old campaigner youre going to tap the peoples pockets thats what you are going to do tallente and i tell you this and youll find its the truthprinciples or no principles your own party or any one elsesthe moment you touch the pockets of any class of the community from the aristocrat to the stonebreaker theyll be up against you like a hurricane every one in the world hugs their principles but there isnt any one whod hold on to them if they found it was costing them moneyso long and the best of luck to you tallente we may meet in high circles before long  horlock drove away a discomfited man jubilant in his thoughts of freedom tallente was met by nora in the little hallnora who had kept away from the house at stephens earnest request  stephen has done it tallente announced triumphantly he made the only speech worth listening to horlock crumbled to pieces miller only got fourteen of the ragtail end of his lot to vote with him we won by forty votes horlock brought me here he is to have a formal meeting of the party hell offer his resignation on thursday  its wonderful nora exclaimed  stephen will be sent for tallente went on that of course is a foregone conclusion nora i wish youd make him see that its his duty to form a government there isnt any reason why he should pass it on to me i can lead in the commons if he wants me to so far as the debates are concerned we are altering the procedure as i dare say you know half the government of the country will be done by committees  its no use nora replied stephen simply wouldnt do it you must remember what you yourself saidprocedure will be altered so much of the government of the country will be done outside the house stephen has everything mapped out you are going to be prime minister  tallente left early and walked homeward by the least frequented ways a soft rain was falling but the night was warm and a misty moon made fitful appearances the rain fell like little drops of silver around the lampposts there was scarcely a breath of wind and in curzon street the air was almost faint with the odour of spring bulbs from the window boxes tallente yielded to an uncontrollable impulse he walked rather abruptly up clarges street past his rooms and paid a curious little visit almost a pilgrimage to the closed house in charles street it seemed to him that those drawn blinds the deadlooking windows the smokeless chimneys typified in melancholy fashion the empty chambers in his own heart weeks had passed now and no word had come from jane he pictured her still smarting under the sting of his brutal words some of his phrases came back to his mind and he shivered with remorse if onlyhe started it seemed for a moment as though history were about to repeat itself a great limousine had stolen up to the kerbstone and a woman in evening dress was leaning out  mr tallente she called out do come and speak to me please  tallente approached at once in the dim light his heart gave a little throb he peered forward the woman laughed musically i do believe that you have forgotten me she said i am alice mountgarronjanes sister i saw you there and i couldnt help stopping for a moment can i drop you anywhere  thank you so much he answered my rooms are quite close by here in clarges street  get in please and i will take you there she ordered tell the man the number i want just one word with you  the car started off lady alice looked at her companion and shook her head  mr tallente she said i am very much a woman of the world and jane is a very much stronger person than i am in some things and a great baby in others you and she were such friends and i have an idea that there was a misunderstanding  there was he groaned it was my fault  never mind whose fault it was she went on you two were made for each other you have so much in common dont drift apart altogether just because one has expected too much or the other been content to give too little jane has a great soul and a great heart she wants to give but she doesnt quite know how and perhaps there isnt any way but two people whose lives seem to radiate towards each other as yours and hers shouldnt remain wholly apart take a day or twos holiday soon even from this great work of yours and go down to devonshire it would be very dangerous advice she went on smiling to a different sort of man but i have a fancy that to you it may mean something and i happen to knowthat jane is miserable  the car stopped tallente held lady alices hand as he had seldom held the hand of a woman in his life a curious incapacity for speech checked the words even upon his lips  thank you he faltered    chapter xxii  upon the moor above martinhoe and the farm lands adjoining spring had fallen that year as gently as the warm rain of april tallente conscious of an unexpected lassitude paused as he reached the top of the zigzag climb from the manor and rested for a moment upon a block of stone below him the forests of dwarf oaks which stretched down to the sea were tipped with delicate green the meadows were like deep soft patches of emerald verdure the fruit trees in his small walled garden were pink and white with blossoms the sea was peaceful as an azure lake into which the hulls of the passing steamers cut like knives leaving behind a long line of lazy foam little fleecy balls of cloud were dotted across the sky puffs of soft wind cooled his cheeks when he rose to his feet and faced inland  soon he left the stony road and walked upon the springy turf bordering the moorland little curledup shoots of light green were springing from the bracken here and there a flame of gorse filled the air with its faint almondlike blossom and the birds farmlands stretched away on his lefthand side and above the tender growth of corn larks invisible but multifarious filled the air with little quiverings of melody bleatng lambs ridiculously young tottered around on this newfound wonderful earth a pair of partridges scurried away from his feet the end of a drooping cloud splashed his face with a few warm raindrops  tallente as he swung onwards carrying his cap in his hand felt a great glow of thankfulness for the impulse which had brought him here already he was finding himself the tangled emotions of the last week were loosening their grip upon his brain and consciousness behind him london was in an uproar his name and future the theme of every journal journalists were besieging his rooms embryo statesmen were telephoning for appointments great men sent their secretaries to suggest a meeting and in the midst of it all he had disappeared the truth as to his sudden absence from town was unknown even to dartrey at the very moment when his figure loomed large and triumphant upon one of the great canvasses in history he had simply slipped away a disappearance as dramatic as it was opportune and all because he had a fancy to see how spring sat upon the moorsand because he had walked back to his rooms by way of charles street and because he had met lady alice  the last ascent was finished and below him lay the house and climbing woodswoods that crept into the bosom of the hills the closely growing trees tipped with tender greens melting into the softest of indeterminate greys as the breeze rippled through their tops like fingers across a harp the darker line of moorland in the background scant as ever of herbiage had yet lost its menacing bareness and seemed touched with the faint colour of the earth beneath almost pink in the generous sunshine the avenue into which he presently turned was starred on either side with a riot of primroses running wild into the brambles with here and there a belt of bluebells the atmosphere beneath the closely growing treeslimes with great waxy budsbecame enervating with spring odours and a momentary breathlessness came to tallente fresh from his crowded days and nights of battle the sunwarmed wave of perfume from the trim beds of hyacinths in the suddenly disclosed garden was almost overpowering and he passed like a man in a dream through their sweetness to the front door the butler who admitted him conducted him at once to janes sanctum without any warning he was ushered in  mr tallente your ladyship  he had a strange impression of her as she rose from a very sea of newspapers she was thinnerhe was sure of thatdressed in indoor clothes although it was the middle of the morning a suggestion of the invalid about her easychair and her tired eyes it seemed to him that for a moment they were lit with a gleam of fear which passed almost instantaneously she had recovered herself even before the door was closed behind the departing servant  mr tallente she repeated you but how is this possible  everything is possible he answered i have come to see you jane  she was glad but amazed even when he had obeyed her involuntary gesture and seated himself by her side there was something incredulous about her expression  but what does it mean that you are here just now she persisted according to the newspapers you should be at buckingham palace today  tomorrow he corrected her i hired a very powerful car and motored down yesterday afternoon i am starting back when the moon rises tonight for these few hours i am better out of london  but why she faltered  he was slowly finding himself  i came for you jane he said on any termsanyhow i came to beg for your sympathy for some measure of your affection to beg you to come back to charles street is it too late for me to abase myself  her eyes glowed across at him she suddenly rose came over and knelt by the side of his chair her arms went around his neck  andrew she whispered i have been ashamed i was wrong that nightthe thought of my pettinessmy foolish selfish fearsoh i was wrong i have prayed that the time might come when i could tell you and if you hadnt come i never could have told you i couldnt have written i couldnt have come to london but i wanted you to know  she drew his head down and kissed him upon the lips tallente knew then why he had come the whole orchestra of life was playing again he was strong enough to overcome mountains  andrew she faltered you really  he stopped her  jane he said i have some stupid news it seems to me incredibly stupid let me pass it on to you quickly you knew didnt you that i was married in america well my wife has divorced me there we married in a state where such things are possible  divorced you she exclaimed  quite legally he went on i saw a lawyer before i started yesterday morning but listen to the rest of it stella is marriedmarried to the man i thought i had thrown over the cliff she is married to anthony palliser  then you are free jane murmured drawing a little away not in the least he replied i am engaged to marry you  at luncheon with parkins in attendance it became possible for them to converse coherently  when i found you at home in the middle of the morning he said i was afraid that you were ill  i havent been well she admitted i rode some distance yesterday and it fatigued me somehow or other i think i have had the feeling the last few weeks that my work here is over all my farms are sold i have really now no means of occupying my time  it is fortunate he told her with a smile that i am able to point out to you a new sphere of usefulness  she made a little grimace at him behind parkins august back  tell me she asked how did you ever make your peace with the trades unions after that terrible article of yours  because he replied except for miller their late chief there are a great many highly intelligent men connected with the administration of the trades unions they realised the spirit in which i wrote that article and the condition of the country at the time i wrote it my apologia was accepted by every one who counted the publication of that article he went on was millers scheme to drive me out of politics it has turned out to be the greatest godsend ever vouchsafed to our cause for it is going to put mr miller out of the power of doing mischief for amany years to come  how i hated him when he called here that day jane murmured reminiscently  miller is the type of man tallente declared who was always putting the labour party in a false position he was born and he has lived and he has thought parochially he is all the time lashing himself into a fury over imagined wrongs and wanting to play the little tin god on olympus with his threatened strikes now there will be no more strikes  i was reading about that she reflected how wonderful it sounds  the greatest power in the country tallente explained is that wielded by these trades unions there will be no more fights between the government and them because they are coaling into the government i am afraid you will think our programme revolutionary on the other hand it is going to be a government of justice we want to give the people their due each man according to his worth by that means we wipe out all fear forever of the scourge of eastern and mideurope the bolshevism and anarchy which have laid great empires bare we are not going to make the poor add to the riches of the rich but on the other hand we are not going to take from the rich to give to the poor the sociological scheme upon which our plan of government will be based is to open every avenue to success equally to rich and poor the human being must sink or swim according to his capacity ours will never be a stateaided socialism  parkins had left the room she held out her hand  how horrid of you she murmured you are gibing at me because i lent my farmers a little money he laughed softly  you dear he exclaimed on my honour it never entered into my head only i want to bring you gradually into the new way of thinking because i want so much from you so much help and sympathy  and she pleaded  he looked around to be sure that parkins was gone and leaning from his place kissed her  if you care for moonlight motoring he whispered i think i can give you quite a clear outline of all that i expect from you  she drew a little sigh of relief  if you had left me behind she murmured i should have sat here and imagined that it was all a dream and i am just a little weary of dreams
