some portraits by raeburn     childs play     walking tours     pans pipes     a plea for gas lamps    chapter i  virginibus puerisque    with the single exception of falstaff all shakespeares  characters are what we call marrying men  mercutio as he was  own cousin to benedick and biron would have come to the same  end in the long run  even iago had a wife and what is far  stranger he was jealous  people like jacques and the fool in  lear although we can hardly imagine they would ever marry  kept single out of a cynical humour or for a broken heart and  not as we do nowadays from a spirit of incredulity and  preference for the single state  for that matter if you turn  to george sands french version of as you like it and i think  i can promise you will like it but little you will find  jacques marries celia just as orlando marries rosalind  at least there seems to have been much less hesitation  over marriage in shakespeares days and what hesitation there  was was of a laughing sort and not much more serious one way  or the other than that of panurge  in modern comedies the  heroes are mostly of benedicks way of thinking but twice as  much in earnest and not one quarter so confident  and i take  this diffidence as a proof of how sincere their terror is   they know they are only human after all they know what gins  and pitfalls lie about their feet and how the shadow of  matrimony waits resolute and awful at the crossroads  they  would wish to keep their liberty but if that may not be why  gods will be done  what are you afraid of marriage asks  cecile in maitre guerin  oh mon dieu non replies  arthur i should take chloroform  they look forward to  marriage much in the same way as they prepare themselves for  death each seems inevitable each is a great perhaps and a  leap into the dark for which when a man is in the blue  devils he has specially to harden his heart  that splendid  scoundrel maxime de trailles took the news of marriages much  as an old man hears the deaths of his contemporaries  cest  desesperant he cried throwing himself down in the armchair  at madame schontzs cest desesperant nous nous marions  tous  every marriage was like another gray hair on his head  and the jolly church bells seemed to taunt him with his fifty  years and fair round belly  the fact is we are much more afraid of life than our  ancestors and cannot find it in our hearts either to marry or  not to marry  marriage is terrifying but so is a cold and  forlorn old age  the friendships of men are vastly agreeable  but they are insecure  you know all the time that one friend  will marry and put you to the door a second accept a  situation in china and become no more to you than a name a  reminiscence and an occasional crossed letter very laborious  to read a third will take up with some religious crotchet and  treat you to sour looks thenceforward  so in one way or  another life forces men apart and breaks up the goodly  fellowships for ever  the very flexibility and ease which  make mens friendships so agreeable while they endure make  them the easier to destroy and forget  and a man who has a  few friends or one who has a dozen if there be any one so  wealthy on this earth cannot forget on how precarious a base  his happiness reposes and how by a stroke or two of fate  a  death a few light words a piece of stamped paper a womans  bright eyes  he may be left in a month destitute of all   marriage is certainly a perilous remedy  instead of on two or  three you stake your happiness on one life only  but still  as the bargain is more explicit and complete on your part it  is more so on the other and you have not to fear so many  contingencies it is not every wind that can blow you from  your anchorage and so long as death withholds his sickle you  will always have a friend at home  people who share a cell in  the bastile or are thrown together on an uninhabited isle if  they do not immediately fall to fisticuffs will find some  possible ground of compromise  they will learn each others  ways and humours so as to know where they must go warily and  where they may lean their whole weight  the discretion of the  first years becomes the settled habit of the last and so  with wisdom and patience two lives may grow indissolubly into  one  but marriage if comfortable is not at all heroic  it  certainly narrows and damps the spirits of generous men  in  marriage a man becomes slack and selfish and undergoes a  fatty degeneration of his moral being  it is not only when  lydgate misallies himself with rosamond vincy but when  ladislaw marries above him with dorothea that this may be  exemplified  the air of the fireside withers out all the fine  wildings of the husbands heart  he is so comfortable and  happy that he begins to prefer comfort and happiness to  everything else on earth his wife included  yesterday he  would have shared his last shilling today his first duty is  to his family and is fulfilled in large measure by laying  down vintages and husbanding the health of an invaluable  parent  twenty years ago this man was equally capable of  crime or heroism now he is fit for neither  his soul is  asleep and you may speak without constraint you will not  wake him  it is not for nothing that don quixote was a  bachelor and marcus aurelius married ill  for women there is  less of this danger  marriage is of so much use to a woman  opens out to her so much more of life and puts her in the way  of so much more freedom and usefulness that whether she  marry ill or well she can hardly miss some benefit  it is  true however that some of the merriest and most genuine of  women are old maids and that those old maids and wives who  are unhappily married have often most of the true motherly  touch  and this would seem to show even for women some  narrowing influence in comfortable married life  but the rule  is none the less certain if you wish the pick of men and  women take a good bachelor and a good wife  i am often filled with wonder that so many marriages are  passably successful and so few come to open failure the more  so as i fail to understand the principle on which people  regulate their choice  i see women marrying indiscriminately  with staring burgesses and ferretfaced whiteeyed boys and  men dwell in contentment with noisy scullions or taking into  their lives acidulous vestals  it is a common answer to say  the good people marry because they fall in love and of course  you may use and misuse a word as much as you please if you  have the world along with you  but love is at least a  somewhat hyperbolical expression for such lukewarm  preference  it is not here anyway that love employs his  golden shafts he cannot be said with any fitness of  language to reign here and revel  indeed if this be love at  all it is plain the poets have been fooling with mankind  since the foundation of the world  and you have only to look  these happy couples in the face to see they have never been  in love or in hate or in any other high passion all their  days  when you see a dish of fruit at dessert you sometimes  set your affections upon one particular peach or nectarine  watch it with some anxiety as it comes round the table and  feel quite a sensible disappointment when it is taken by some  one else  i have used the phrase high passion  well i  should say this was about as high a passion as generally leads  to marriage  one husband hears after marriage that some poor  fellow is dying of his wifes love  what a pity he  exclaims you know i could so easily have got another  and  yet that is a very happy union  or again a young man was  telling me the sweet story of his loves  i like it well  enough as long as her sisters are there said this amorous  swain but i dont know what to do when were alone  once  more a married lady was debating the subject with another  lady  you know dear said the first after ten years of  marriage if he is nothing else your husband is always an old  friend  i have many old friends returned the other but  i prefer them to be nothing more  oh perhaps i might  prefer that also  there is a common note in these three  illustrations of the modern idyll and it must be owned the  god goes among us with a limping gait and blear eyes  you  wonder whether it was so always whether desire was always  equally dull and spiritless and possession equally cold  i  cannot help fancying most people make ere they marry some  such table of recommendations as hannah godwin wrote to her  brother william anent her friend miss gay  it is so  charmingly comical and so pat to the occasion that i must  quote a few phrases  the young lady is in every sense formed  to make one of your disposition really happy  she has a  pleasing voice with which she accompanies her musical  instrument with judgment  she has an easy politeness in her  manners neither free nor reserved  she is a good housekeeper  and a good economist and yet of a generous disposition  as  to her internal accomplishments i have reason to speak still  more highly of them good sense without vanity a penetrating  judgment without a disposition to satire with about as much  religion as my william likes struck me with a wish that she  was my williams wife  that is about the tune pleasing  voice moderate good looks unimpeachable internal  accomplishments after the style of the copybook with about  as much religion as my william likes and then with all  speed to church  to deal plainly if they only married when they fell in  love most people would die unwed and among the others there  would be not a few tumultuous households  the lion is the  king of beasts but he is scarcely suitable for a domestic  pet  in the same way i suspect love is rather too violent a  passion to make in all cases a good domestic sentiment   like other violent excitements it throws up not only what is  best but what is worst and smallest in mens characters   just as some people are malicious in drink or brawling and  virulent under the influence of religious feeling some are  moody jealous and exacting when they are in love who are  honest downright goodhearted fellows enough in the everyday  affairs and humours of the world  how then seeing we are driven to the hypothesis that  people choose in comparatively cold blood how is it they  choose so well  one is almost tempted to hint that it does  not much matter whom you marry that in fact marriage is a  subjective affection and if you have made up your mind to it  and once talked yourself fairly over you could pull it  through with anybody  but even if we take matrimony at its  lowest even if we regard it as no more than a sort of  friendship recognised by the police there must be degrees in  the freedom and sympathy realised and some principle to guide  simple folk in their selection  now what should this  principle be  are there no more definite rules than are to be  found in the prayerbook  law and religion forbid the bans on  the ground of propinquity or consanguinity society steps in  to separate classes and in all this most critical matter has  common sense has wisdom never a word to say  in the absence  of more magisterial teaching let us talk it over between  friends even a few guesses may be of interest to youths and  maidens  in all that concerns eating and drinking company  climate and ways of life community of taste is to be sought  for  it would be trying for instance to keep bed and board  with an early riser or a vegetarian  in matters of art and  intellect i believe it is of no consequence  certainly it is  of none in the companionships of men who will dine more  readily with one who has a good heart a good cellar and a  humorous tongue than with another who shares all their  favourite hobbies and is melancholy withal  if your wife  likes tupper that is no reason why you should hang your head   she thinks with the majority and has the courage of her  opinions  i have always suspected public taste to be a  mongrel product out of affectation by dogmatism and felt  sure if you could only find an honest man of no special  literary bent he would tell you he thought much of  shakespeare bombastic and most absurd and all of him written  in very obscure english and wearisome to read  and not long  ago i was able to lay by my lantern in content for i found  the honest man  he was a fellow of parts quick humorous a  clever painter and with an eye for certain poetical effects  of sea and ships  i am not much of a judge of that kind of  thing but a sketch of his comes before me sometimes at night   how strong supple and living the ship seems upon the  billows  with what a dip and rake she shears the flying sea   i cannot fancy the man who saw this effect and took it on the  wing with so much force and spirit was what you call  commonplace in the last recesses of the heart  and yet he  thought and was not ashamed to have it known of him that  ouida was better in every way than william shakespeare  if  there were more people of his honesty this would be about the  staple of lay criticism  it is not taste that is plentiful  but courage that is rare  and what have we in place  how  many who think no otherwise than the young painter have we  not heard disbursing secondhand hyperboles  have you never  turned sick at heart o best of critics when some of your own  sweet adjectives were returned on you before a gaping  audience  enthusiasm about art is become a function of the  average female being which she performs with precision and a  sort of haunting sprightliness like an ingenious and well regulated machine  sometimes alas the calmest man is  carried away in the torrent bandies adjectives with the best  and outherods herod for some shameful moments  when you  remember that you will be tempted to put things strongly and  say you will marry no one who is not like george the second  and cannot state openly a distaste for poetry and painting  the word facts is in some ways crucial  i have  spoken with jesuits and plymouth brethren mathematicians and  poets dogmatic republicans and dear old gentlemen in birds eye neckcloths and each understood the word facts in an  occult sense of his own  try as i might i could get no  nearer the principle of their division  what was essential to  them seemed to me trivial or untrue  we could come to no  compromise as to what was or what was not important in the  life of man  turn as we pleased we all stood back to back in  a big ring and saw another quarter of the heavens with  different mountaintops along the skyline and different  constellations overhead  we had each of us some whimsy in the  brain which we believed more than anything else and which  discoloured all experience to its own shade  how would you  have people agree when one is deaf and the other blind  now  this is where there should be community between man and wife   they should be agreed on their catchword in facts of  religion or facts of science or society my dear for  without such an agreement all intercourse is a painful strain  upon the mind  about as much religion as my william likes  in short that is what is necessary to make a happy couple of  any william and his spouse  for there are differences which  no habit nor affection can reconcile and the bohemian must  not intermarry with the pharisee  imagine consuelo as mrs  samuel budget the wife of the successful merchant  the best  of men and the best of women may sometimes live together all  their lives and for want of some consent on fundamental  questions hold each other lost spirits to the end  a certain sort of talent is almost indispensable for  people who would spend years together and not bore themselves  to death  but the talent like the agreement must be for and  about life  to dwell happily together they should be versed  in the niceties of the heart and born with a faculty for  willing compromise  the woman must be talented as a woman  and it will not much matter although she is talented in  nothing else  she must know her metier de femme and have a  fine touch for the affections  and it is more important that  a person should be a good gossip and talk pleasantly and  smartly of common friends and the thousand and one nothings of  the day and hour than that she should speak with the tongues  of men and angels for a while together by the fire happens  more frequently in marriage than the presence of a  distinguished foreigner to dinner  that people should laugh  over the same sort of jests and have many a story of grouse  in the gunroom many an old joke between them which time  cannot wither nor custom stale is a better preparation for  life by your leave than many other things higher and better  sounding in the worlds ears  you could read kant by  yourself if you wanted but you must share a joke with some  one else  you can forgive people who do not follow you  through a philosophical disquisition but to find your wife  laughing when you had tears in your eyes or staring when you  were in a fit of laughter would go some way towards a  dissolution of the marriage  i know a woman who from some distaste or disability  could never so much as understand the meaning of the word  politics and has given up trying to distinguish whigs from  tories but take her on her own politics ask her about other  men or women and the chicanery of everyday existence  the  rubs the tricks the vanities on which life turns  and you  will not find many more shrewd trenchant and humorous  nay  to make plainer what i have in mind this same woman has a  share of the higher and more poetical understanding frank  interest in things for their own sake and enduring  astonishment at the most common  she is not to be deceived by  custom or made to think a mystery solved when it is repeated   i have heard her say she could wonder herself crazy over the  human eyebrow  now in a world where most of us walk very  contentedly in the little lit circle of their own reason and  have to be reminded of what lies without by specious and  clamant exceptions  earthquakes eruptions of vesuvius  banjos floating in midair at a seance and the like  a mind  so fresh and unsophisticated is no despicable gift  i will  own i think it a better sort of mind than goes necessarily  with the clearest views on public business  it will wash  it  will find something to say at an odd moment  it has in it the  spring of pleasant and quaint fancies  whereas i can imagine  myself yawning all night long until my jaws ached and the  tears came into my eyes although my companion on the other  side of the hearth held the most enlightened opinions on the  franchise or the ballot  the question of professions in as far as they regard  marriage was only interesting to women until of late days  but it touches all of us now  certainly if i could help it  i would never marry a wife who wrote  the practice of letters  is miserably harassing to the mind and after an hour or twos  work all the more human portion of the author is extinct he  will bully backbite and speak daggers  music i hear is  not much better  but painting on the contrary is often  highly sedative because so much of the labour after your  picture is once begun is almost entirely manual and of that  skilled sort of manual labour which offers a continual series  of successes and so tickles a man through his vanity into  good humour  alas in letters there is nothing of this sort  you may write as beautiful a hand as you will you have always  something else to think of and cannot pause to notice your  loops and flourishes they are beside the mark and the first  law stationer could put you to the blush  rousseau indeed  made some account of penmanship even made it a source of  livelihood when he copied out the heloise for dilettante  ladies and therein showed that strange eccentric prudence  which guided him among so many thousand follies and  insanities  it would be well for all of the genus irritabile  thus to add something of skilled labour to intangible brain work  to find the right word is so doubtful a success and  lies so near to failure that there is no satisfaction in a  year of it but we all know when we have formed a letter  perfectly and a stupid artist right or wrong is almost  equally certain he has found a right tone or a right colour  or made a dexterous stroke with his brush  and again  painters may work out of doors and the fresh air the  deliberate seasons and the tranquillising influence of the  green earth counterbalance the fever of thought and keep  them cool placable and prosaic  a ship captain is a good man to marry if it is a marriage  of love for absences are a good influence in love and keep it  bright and delicate but he is just the worst man if the  feeling is more pedestrian as habit is too frequently torn  open and the solder has never time to set  men who fish  botanise work with the turninglathe or gather seaweeds  will make admirable husbands and a little amateur painting in  watercolour shows the innocent and quiet mind  those who  have a few intimates are to be avoided while those who swim  loose who have their hat in their hand all along the street  who can number an infinity of acquaintances and are not  chargeable with any one friend promise an easy disposition  and no rival to the wifes influence  i will not say they are  the best of men but they are the stuff out of which adroit  and capable women manufacture the best of husbands  it is to  be noticed that those who have loved once or twice already are  so much the better educated to a womans hand the bright boy  of fiction is an odd and most uncomfortable mixture of shyness  and coarseness and needs a deal of civilising  lastly and  this is perhaps the golden rule no woman should marry a  teetotaller or a man who does not smoke  it is not for  nothing that this ignoble tabagie as michelet calls it  spreads over all the world  michelet rails against it because  it renders you happy apart from thought or work to provident  women this will seem no evil influence in married life   whatever keeps a man in the front garden whatever checks  wandering fancy and all inordinate ambition whatever makes  for lounging and contentment makes just so surely for  domestic happiness  these notes if they amuse the reader at all will  probably amuse him more when he differs than when he agrees  with them at least they will do no harm for nobody will  follow my advice  but the last word is of more concern   marriage is a step so grave and decisive that it attracts  lightheaded variable men by its very awfulness  they have  been so tried among the inconstant squalls and currents so  often sailed for islands in the air or lain becalmed with  burning heart that they will risk all for solid ground below  their feet  desperate pilots they run their seasick weary  bark upon the dashing rocks  it seems as if marriage were the  royal road through life and realised on the instant what we  have all dreamed on summer sundays when the bells ring or at  night when we cannot sleep for the desire of living  they  think it will sober and change them  like those who join a  brotherhood they fancy it needs but an act to be out of the  coil and clamour for ever  but this is a wile of the devils   to the end spring winds will sow disquietude passing faces  leave a regret behind them and the whole world keep calling  and calling in their ears  for marriage is like life in this   that it is a field of battle and not a bed of roses   ii   hope they say deserts us at no period of our existence   from first to last and in the face of smarting disillusions  we continue to expect good fortune better health and better  conduct and that so confidently that we judge it needless to  deserve them  i think it improbable that i shall ever write  like shakespeare conduct an army like hannibal or  distinguish myself like marcus aurelius in the paths of  virtue and yet i have my bydays hope prompting when i am  very ready to believe that i shall combine all these various  excellences in my own person and go marching down to  posterity with divine honours  there is nothing so monstrous  but we can believe it of ourselves  about ourselves about  our aspirations and delinquencies we have dwelt by choice in  a delicious vagueness from our boyhood up  no one will have  forgotten tom sawyers aspiration ah if he could only die  temporarily  or perhaps better still the inward  resolution of the two pirates that so long as they remained  in that business their piracies should not again be sullied  with the crime of stealing  here we recognise the thoughts  of our boyhood and our boyhood ceased  well when  not i  think at twenty nor perhaps altogether at twentyfive nor  yet at thirty and possibly to be quite frank we are still  in the thick of that arcadian period  for as the race of man  after centuries of civilisation still keeps some traits of  their barbarian fathers so man the individual is not  altogether quit of youth when he is already old and honoured  and lord chancellor of england  we advance in years somewhat  in the manner of an invading army in a barren land the age  that we have reached as the phrase goes we but hold with an  outpost and still keep open our communications with the  extreme rear and first beginnings of the march  there is our  true base that is not only the beginning but the perennial  spring of our faculties and grandfather william can retire  upon occasion into the green enchanted forest of his boyhood  the unfading boyishness of hope and its vigorous  irrationality are nowhere better displayed than in questions  of conduct  there is a character in the pilgrims progress  one mr lingerafterlust with whom i fancy we are all on  speaking terms one famous among the famous for ingenuity of  hope up to and beyond the moment of defeat one who after  eighty years of contrary experience will believe it possible  to continue in the business of piracy and yet avoid the guilt  of theft  every sin is our last every 1st of january a  remarkable turningpoint in our career  any overt act above  all is felt to be alchemic in its power to change  a  drunkard takes the pledge it will be strange if that does not  help him  for how many years did mr pepys continue to make  and break his little vows  and yet i have not heard that he  was discouraged in the end  by such steps we think to fix a  momentary resolution as a timid fellow hies him to the  dentists while the tooth is stinging  but alas by planting a stake at the top of flood you  can neither prevent nor delay the inevitable ebb  there is no  hocuspocus in morality and even the sanctimonious ceremony  of marriage leaves the man unchanged  this is a hard saying  and has an air of paradox  for there is something in marriage  so natural and inviting that the step has an air of great  simplicity and ease it offers to bury for ever many aching  preoccupations it is to afford us unfailing and familiar  company through life it opens up a smiling prospect of the  blest and passive kind of love rather than the blessing and  active it is approached not only through the delights of  courtship but by a public performance and repeated legal  signatures  a man naturally thinks it will go hard with him  if he cannot be good and fortunate and happy within such  august circumvallations  and yet there is probably no other act in a mans life so  hotheaded and foolhardy as this one of marriage  for years  let us suppose you have been making the most indifferent  business of your career  your experience has not we may dare  to say been more encouraging than pauls or horaces like  them you have seen and desired the good that you were not  able to accomplish like them you have done the evil that you  loathed  you have waked at night in a hot or a cold sweat  according to your habit of body remembering with dismal  surprise your own unpardonable acts and sayings  you have  been sometimes tempted to withdraw entirely from this game of  life as a man who makes nothing but misses withdraws from  that less dangerous one of billiards  you have fallen back  upon the thought that you yourself most sharply smarted for  your misdemeanours or in the old plaintive phrase that you  were nobodys enemy but your own  and then you have been made  aware of what was beautiful and amiable wise and kind in the  other part of your behaviour and it seemed as if nothing  could reconcile the contradiction as indeed nothing can  if  you are a man you have shut your mouth hard and said nothing  and if you are only a man in the making you have recognised  that yours was quite a special case and you yourself not  guilty of your own pestiferous career  granted and with all my heart  let us accept these  apologies let us agree that you are nobodys enemy but your  own let us agree that you are a sort of moral cripple  impotent for good and let us regard you with the unmingled  pity due to such a fate  but there is one thing to which on  these terms we can never agree  we can never agree to have  you marry  what you have had one life to manage and have  failed so strangely and now can see nothing wiser than to  conjoin with it the management of some one elses  because  you have been unfaithful in a very little you propose  yourself to be a ruler over ten cities  you strip yourself by  such a step of all remaining consolations and excuses  you  are no longer content to be your own enemy you must be your  wifes also  you have been hitherto in a mere subaltern  attitude dealing cruel blows about you in life yet only half  responsible since you came there by no choice or movement of  your own  now it appears you must take things on your own  authority god made you but you marry yourself and for all  that your wife suffers no one is responsible but you  a man  must be very certain of his knowledge ere he undertake to  guide a ticketofleave man through a dangerous pass you have  eternally missed your way in life with consequences that you  still deplore and yet you masterfully seize your wifes hand  and blindfold drag her after you to ruin  and it is your  wife you observe whom you select  she whose happiness you  most desire you choose to be your victim  you would  earnestly warn her from a tottering bridge or bad investment   if she were to marry some one else how you would tremble for  her fate  if she were only your sister and you thought half  as much of her how doubtfully would you entrust her future to  a man no better than yourself  times are changed with him who marries there are no more  bypath meadows where you may innocently linger but the road  lies long and straight and dusty to the grave  idleness  which is often becoming and even wise in the bachelor begins  to wear a different aspect when you have a wife to support   suppose after you are married one of those little slips were  to befall you  what happened last november might surely  happen february next  they may have annoyed you at the time  because they were not what you had meant but how will they  annoy you in the future and how will they shake the fabric of  your wifes confidence and peace  a thousand things  unpleasing went on in the chiaroscuro of a life that you  shrank from too particularly realising you did not care in  those days to make a fetish of your conscience you would  recognise your failures with a nod and so good day  but the  time for these reserves is over  you have wilfully introduced  a witness into your life the scene of these defeats and can  no longer close the minds eye upon uncomely passages but  must stand up straight and put a name upon your actions  and  your witness is not only the judge but the victim of your  sins not only can she condemn you to the sharpest penalties  but she must herself share feelingly in their endurance  and  observe once more with what temerity you have chosen  precisely her to be your spy whose esteem you value highest  and whom you have already taught to think you better than you  are  you may think you had a conscience and believed in god  but what is a conscience to a wife  wise men of yore erected  statues of their deities and consciously performed their part  in life before those marble eyes  a god watched them at the  board and stood by their bedside in the morning when they  woke and all about their ancient cities where they bought  and sold or where they piped and wrestled there would stand  some symbol of the things that are outside of man  these were  lessons delivered in the quiet dialect of art which told  their story faithfully but gently  it is the same lesson if  you will  but how harrowingly taught  when the woman you  respect shall weep from your unkindness or blush with shame at  your misconduct  poor girls in italy turn their painted  madonnas to the wall you cannot set aside your wife  to  marry is to domesticate the recording angel  once you are  married there is nothing left for you not even suicide but  to be good  and goodness in marriage is a more intricate problem than  mere single virtue for in marriage there are two ideals to be  realised  a girl it is true has always lived in a glass  house among reproving relatives whose word was law she has  been bred up to sacrifice her judgments and take the key  submissively from dear papa and it is wonderful how swiftly  she can change her tune into the husbands  her morality has  been too often an affair of precept and conformity  but in  the case of a bachelor who has enjoyed some measure both of  privacy and freedom his moral judgments have been passed in  some accordance with his nature  his sins were always sins in  his own sight he could then only sin when he did some act  against his clear conviction the light that he walked by was  obscure but it was single  now when two people of any grit  and spirit put their fortunes into one there succeeds to this  comparative certainty a huge welter of competing  jurisdictions  it no longer matters so much how life appears  to one one must consult another one who may be strong must  not offend the other who is weak  the only weak brother i am  willing to consider is to make a bull for once my wife  for  her and for her only i must waive my righteous judgments  and go crookedly about my life  how then in such an  atmosphere of compromise to keep honour bright and abstain  from base capitulations  how are you to put aside loves  pleadings  how are you the apostle of laxity to turn  suddenly about into the rabbi of precision and after these  years of ragged practice pose for a hero to the lackey who  has found you out  in this temptation to mutual indulgence  lies the particular peril to morality in married life  daily  they drop a little lower from the first ideal and for a while  continue to accept these changelings with a gross complacency   at last love wakes and looks about him finds his hero sunk  into a stout old brute intent on brandy pawnee finds his  heroine divested of her angel brightness and in the flash of  that first disenchantment flees for ever  again the husband in these unions is usually a man  and the wife commonly enough a woman and when this is the  case although it makes the firmer marriage a thick  additional veil of misconception hangs above the doubtful  business  women i believe are somewhat rarer than men but  then if i were a woman myself i daresay i should hold the  reverse and at least we all enter more or less wholly into  one or other of these camps  a man who delights women by his  feminine perceptions will often scatter his admirers by a  chance explosion of the under side of man and the most  masculine and direct of women will some day to your dire  surprise draw out like a telescope into successive lengths of  personation  alas for the man knowing her to be at heart  more candid than himself who shall flounder panting through  these mazes in the quest for truth  the proper qualities of  each sex are indeed eternally surprising to the other   between the latin and the teuton races there are similar  divergences not to be bridged by the most liberal sympathy   and in the good plain cutanddry explanations of this life  which pass current among us as the wisdom of the elders this  difficulty has been turned with the aid of pious lies  thus  when a young lady has angelic features eats nothing to speak  of plays all day long on the piano and sings ravishingly in  church it requires a rough infidelity falsely called  cynicism to believe that she may be a little devil after all   yet so it is she may be a talebearer a liar and a thief  she may have a taste for brandy and no heart  my compliments  to george eliot for her rosamond vincy the ugly work of  satire she has transmuted to the ends of art by the companion  figure of lydgate and the satire was much wanted for the  education of young men  that doctrine of the excellence of  women however chivalrous is cowardly as well as false  it  is better to face the fact and know when you marry that you  take into your life a creature of equal if of unlike  frailties whose weak human heart beats no more tunefully than  yours  but it is the object of a liberal education not only to  obscure the knowledge of one sex by another but to magnify  the natural differences between the two  man is a creature  who lives not upon bread alone but principally by catchwords  and the little rift between the sexes is astonishingly widened  by simply teaching one set of catchwords to the girls and  another to the boys  to the first there is shown but a very  small field of experience and taught a very trenchant  principle for judgment and action to the other the world of  life is more largely displayed and their rule of conduct is  proportionally widened  they are taught to follow different  virtues to hate different vices to place their ideal even  for each other in different achievements  what should be the  result of such a course  when a horse has run away and the  two flustered people in the gig have each possessed themselves  of a rein we know the end of that conveyance will be in the  ditch  so when i see a raw youth and a green girl fluted  and fiddled in a dancing measure into that most serious  contract and setting out upon lifes journey with ideas so  monstrously divergent i am not surprised that some make  shipwreck but that any come to port  what the boy does  almost proudly as a manly peccadillo the girl will shudder  at as a debasing vice what is to her the mere common sense of  tactics he will spit out of his mouth as shameful  through  such a sea of contrarieties must this green couple steer their  way and contrive to love each other and to respect  forsooth and be ready when the time arrives to educate the  little men and women who shall succeed to their places and  perplexities  and yet when all has been said the man who should hold  back from marriage is in the same case with him who runs away  from battle  to avoid an occasion for our virtues is a worse  degree of failure than to push forward pluckily and make a  fall  it is lawful to pray god that we be not led into  temptation but not lawful to skulk from those that come to  us  the noblest passage in one of the noblest books of this  century is where the old pope glories in the trial nay in  the partial fall and but imperfect triumph of the younger  hero 1  without some such manly note it were perhaps  better to have no conscience at all  but there is a vast  difference between teaching flight and showing points of  peril that a man may march the more warily  and the true  conclusion of this paper is to turn our back on apprehensions  and embrace that shining and courageous virtue faith  hope  is the boy a blind headlong pleasant fellow good to chase  swallows with the salt faith is the grave experienced yet  smiling man  hope lives on ignorance openeyed faith is  built upon a knowledge of our life of the tyranny of  circumstance and the frailty of human resolution  hope looks  for unqualified success but faith counts certainly on  failure and takes honourable defeat to be a form of victory   hope is a kind old pagan but faith grew up in christian days  and early learnt humility  in the one temper a man is  indignant that he cannot spring up in a clap to heights of  elegance and virtue in the other out of a sense of his  infirmities he is filled with confidence because a year has  come and gone and he has still preserved some rags of honour   in the first he expects an angel for a wife in the last he  knows that she is like himself  erring thoughtless and  untrue but like himself also filled with a struggling  radiancy of better things and adorned with ineffective  qualities  you may safely go to school with hope but ere you  marry should have learned the mingled lesson of the world  that dolls are stuffed with sawdust and yet are excellent  playthings that hope and love address themselves to a  perfection never realised and yet firmly held become the  salt and staff of life that you yourself are compacted of  infirmities perfect you might say in imperfection and yet  you have a something in you lovable and worth preserving and  that while the mass of mankind lies under this scurvy  condemnation you will scarce find one but by some generous  reading will become to you a lesson a model and a noble  spouse through life  so thinking you will constantly support  your own unworthiness and easily forgive the failings of your  friend  nay you will be i wisely glad that you retain the  sense of blemishes for the faults of married people  continually spur up each of them hour by hour to do better  and to meet and love upon a higher ground  and ever between  the failures there will come glimpses of kind virtues to  encourage and console  1 brownings ring and book   iii  on falling in love   lord what fools these mortals be   there is only one event in life which really astonishes a  man and startles him out of his prepared opinions  everything  else befalls him very much as he expected  event succeeds to  event with an agreeable variety indeed but with little that  is either startling or intense they form together no more  than a sort of background or running accompaniment to the  mans own reflections and he falls naturally into a cool  curious and smiling habit of mind and builds himself up in a  conception of life which expects tomorrow to be after the  pattern of today and yesterday  he may be accustomed to the  vagaries of his friends and acquaintances under the influence  of love  he may sometimes look forward to it for himself with  an incomprehensible expectation  but it is a subject in which  neither intuition nor the behaviour of others will help the  philosopher to the truth  there is probably nothing rightly  thought or rightly written on this matter of love that is not  a piece of the persons experience  i remember an anecdote of  a wellknown french theorist who was debating a point eagerly  in his cenacle  it was objected against him that he had never  experienced love  whereupon he arose left the society and  made it a point not to return to it until he considered that  he had supplied the defect  now he remarked on entering  now i am in a position to continue the discussion  perhaps  he had not penetrated very deeply into the subject after all  but the story indicates right thinking and may serve as an  apologue to readers of this essay  when at last the scales fall from his eyes it is not  without something of the nature of dismay that the man finds  himself in such changed conditions  he has to deal with  commanding emotions instead of the easy dislikes and  preferences in which he has hitherto passed his days and he  recognises capabilities for pain and pleasure of which he had  not yet suspected the existence  falling in love is the one  illogical adventure the one thing of which we are tempted to  think as supernatural in our trite and reasonable world  the  effect is out of all proportion with the cause  two persons  neither of them it may be very amiable or very beautiful  meet speak a little and look a little into each others  eyes  that has been done a dozen or so of times in the  experience of either with no great result  but on this  occasion all is different  they fall at once into that state  in which another person becomes to us the very gist and  centrepoint of gods creation and demolishes our laborious  theories with a smile in which our ideas are so bound up with  the one masterthought that even the trivial cares of our own  person become so many acts of devotion and the love of life  itself is translated into a wish to remain in the same world  with so precious and desirable a fellowcreature  and all the  while their acquaintances look on in stupor and ask each  other with almost passionate emphasis what soandso can see  in that woman or suchanone in that man  i am sure  gentlemen i cannot tell you  for my part i cannot think  what the women mean  it might be very well if the apollo  belvedere should suddenly glow all over into life and step  forward from the pedestal with that godlike air of his  but  of the misbegotten changelings who call themselves men and  prate intolerably over dinnertables i never saw one who  seemed worthy to inspire love  no nor read of any except  leonardo da vinci and perhaps goethe in his youth  about  women i entertain a somewhat different opinion but there i  have the misfortune to be a man  there are many matters in which you may waylay destiny  and bid him stand and deliver  hard work high thinking  adventurous excitement and a great deal more that forms a  part of this or the other persons spiritual bill of fare are  within the reach of almost any one who can dare a little and  be patient  but it is by no means in the way of every one to  fall in love  you know the difficulty shakespeare was put  into when queen elizabeth asked him to show falstaff in love   i do not believe that henry fielding was ever in love  scott  if it were not for a passage or two in rob roy would give me  very much the same effect  these are great names and what is  more to the purpose strong healthy highstrung and  generous natures of whom the reverse might have been  expected  as for the innumerable army of anaemic and  tailorish persons who occupy the face of this planet with so  much propriety it is palpably absurd to imagine them in any  such situation as a loveaffair  a wet rag goes safely by the  fire and if a man is blind he cannot expect to be much  impressed by romantic scenery  apart from all this many  lovable people miss each other in the world or meet under  some unfavourable star  there is the nice and critical moment  of declaration to be got over  from timidity or lack of  opportunity a good half of possible love cases never get so  far and at least another quarter do there cease and  determine  a very adroit person to be sure manages to  prepare the way and out with his declaration in the nick of  time  and then there is a fine solid sort of man who goes on  from snub to snub and if he has to declare forty times will  continue imperturbably declaring amid the astonished  consideration of men and angels until he has a favourable  answer  i daresay if one were a woman one would like to  marry a man who was capable of doing this but not quite one  who had done so  it is just a little bit abject and somehow  just a little bit gross and marriages in which one of the  parties has been thus battered into consent scarcely form  agreeable subjects for meditation  love should run out to  meet love with open arms  indeed the ideal story is that of  two people who go into love step for step with a fluttered  consciousness like a pair of children venturing together into  a dark room  from the first moment when they see each other  with a pang of curiosity through stage after stage of growing  pleasure and embarrassment they can read the expression of  their own trouble in each others eyes  there is here no  declaration properly so called the feeling is so plainly  shared that as soon as the man knows what it is in his own  heart he is sure of what it is in the womans  this simple accident of falling in love is as beneficial  as it is astonishing  it arrests the petrifying influence of  years disproves coldblooded and cynical conclusions and  awakens dormant sensibilities  hitherto the man had found it  a good policy to disbelieve the existence of any enjoyment  which was out of his reach and thus he turned his back upon  the strong sunny parts of nature and accustomed himself to  look exclusively on what was common and dull  he accepted a  prose ideal let himself go blind of many sympathies by  disuse and if he were young and witty or beautiful wilfully  forewent these advantages  he joined himself to the following  of what in the old mythology of love was prettily called  nonchaloir and in an odd mixture of feelings a fling of  selfrespect a preference for selfish liberty and a great  dash of that fear with which honest people regard serious  interests kept himself back from the straightforward course  of life among certain selected activities  and now all of a  sudden he is unhorsed like st paul from his infidel  affectation  his heart which has been ticking accurate  seconds for the last year gives a bound and begins to beat  high and irregularly in his breast  it seems as if he had  never heard or felt or seen until that moment and by the  report of his memory he must have lived his past life between  sleep and waking or with the preoccupied attention of a brown  study  he is practically incommoded by the generosity of his  feelings smiles much when he is alone and develops a habit  of looking rather blankly upon the moon and stars  but it is  not at all within the province of a prose essayist to give a  picture of this hyperbolical frame of mind and the thing has  been done already and that to admiration  in adelaide in  tennysons maud and in some of heines songs you get the  absolute expression of this midsummer spirit  romeo and  juliet were very much in love although they tell me some  german critics are of a different opinion probably the same  who would have us think mercutio a dull fellow  poor antony  was in love and no mistake  that lay figure marius in les  miserables is also a genuine case in his own way and worth  observation  a good many of george sands people are  thoroughly in love and so are a good many of george  merediths  altogether there is plenty to read on the  subject  if the root of the matter be in him and if he has  the requisite chords to set in vibration a young man may  occasionally enter with the key of art into that land of  beulah which is upon the borders of heaven and within sight of  the city of love  there let him sit awhile to hatch  delightful hopes and perilous illusions  one thing that accompanies the passion in its first blush  is certainly difficult to explain  it comes i do not quite  see how that from having a very supreme sense of pleasure in  all parts of life  in lying down to sleep in waking in  motion in breathing in continuing to be  the lover begins  to regard his happiness as beneficial for the rest of the  world and highly meritorious in himself  our race has never  been able contentedly to suppose that the noise of its wars  conducted by a few young gentlemen in a corner of an  inconsiderable star does not reecho among the courts of  heaven with quite a formidable effect  in much the same  taste when people find a great todo in their own breasts  they imagine it must have some influence in their  neighbourhood  the presence of the two lovers is so  enchanting to each other that it seems as if it must be the  best thing possible for everybody else  they are half  inclined to fancy it is because of them and their love that  the sky is blue and the sun shines  and certainly the weather  is usually fine while people are courting    in point of  fact although the happy man feels very kindly towards others  of his own sex there is apt to be something too much of the  magnifico in his demeanour  if people grow presuming and  selfimportant over such matters as a dukedom or the holy see  they will scarcely support the dizziest elevation in life  without some suspicion of a strut and the dizziest elevation  is to love and be loved in return  consequently accepted  lovers are a trifle condescending in their address to other  men  an overweening sense of the passion and importance of  life hardly conduces to simplicity of manner  to women they  feel very nobly very purely and very generously as if they  were so many joanofarcs but this does not come out in  their behaviour and they treat them to grandisonian airs  marked with a suspicion of fatuity  i am not quite certain  that women do not like this sort of thing but really after  having bemused myself over daniel deronda i have given up  trying to understand what they like  if it did nothing else this sublime and ridiculous  superstition that the pleasure of the pair is somehow blessed  to others and everybody is made happier in their happiness  would serve at least to keep love generous and greathearted   nor is it quite a baseless superstition after all  other  lovers are hugely interested  they strike the nicest balance  between pity and approval when they see people aping the  greatness of their own sentiments  it is an understood thing  in the play that while the young gentlefolk are courting on  the terrace a rough flirtation is being carried on and a  light trivial sort of love is growing up between the footman  and the singing chambermaid  as people are generally cast for  the leading parts in their own imaginations the reader can  apply the parallel to real life without much chance of going  wrong  in short they are quite sure this other loveaffair  is not so deep seated as their own but they like dearly to  see it going forward  and love considered as a spectacle  must have attractions for many who are not of the  confraternity  the sentimental old maid is a commonplace of  the novelists and he must be rather a poor sort of human  being to be sure who can look on at this pretty madness  without indulgence and sympathy  for nature commends itself  to people with a most insinuating art the busiest is now and  again arrested by a great sunset and you may be as pacific or  as coldblooded as you will but you cannot help some emotion  when you read of welldisputed battles or meet a pair of  lovers in the lane  certainly whatever it may be with regard to the world at  large this idea of beneficent pleasure is true as between the  sweethearts  to do good and communicate is the lovers grand  intention  it is the happiness of the other that makes his  own most intense gratification  it is not possible to  disentangle the different emotions the pride humility pity  and passion which are excited by a look of happy love or an  unexpected caress  to make ones self beautiful to dress the  hair to excel in talk to do anything and all things that  puff out the character and attributes and make them imposing  in the eyes of others is not only to magnify ones self but  to offer the most delicate homage at the same time  and it is  in this latter intention that they are done by lovers for the  essence of love is kindness and indeed it may be best defined  as passionate kindness kindness so to speak run mad and  become importunate and violent  vanity in a merely personal  sense exists no longer  the lover takes a perilous pleasure  in privately displaying his weak points and having them one  after another accepted and condoned  he wishes to be assured  that he is not loved for this or that good quality but for  himself or something as like himself as he can contrive to  set forward  for although it may have been a very difficult  thing to paint the marriage of cana or write the fourth act  of antony and cleopatra there is a more difficult piece of  art before every one in this world who cares to set about  explaining his own character to others  words and acts are  easily wrenched from their true significance and they are all  the language we have to come and go upon  a pitiful job we  make of it as a rule  for better or worse people mistake  our meaning and take our emotions at a wrong valuation  and  generally we rest pretty content with our failures we are  content to be misapprehended by cackling flirts but when once  a man is moonstruck with this affection of love he makes it a  point of honour to clear such dubieties away  he cannot have  the best of her sex misled upon a point of this importance  and his pride revolts at being loved in a mistake  he discovers a great reluctance to return on former  periods of his life  to all that has not been shared with  her rights and duties bygone fortunes and dispositions he  can look back only by a difficult and repugnant effort of the  will  that he should have wasted some years in ignorance of  what alone was really important that he may have entertained  the thought of other women with any show of complacency is a  burthen almost too heavy for his selfrespect  but it is the  thought of another past that rankles in his spirit like a  poisoned wound  that he himself made a fashion of being alive  in the bald beggarly days before a certain meeting is  deplorable enough in all good conscience  but that she should  have permitted herself the same liberty seems inconsistent  with a divine providence  a great many people run down jealousy on the score that  it is an artificial feeling as well as practically  inconvenient  this is scarcely fair for the feeling on which  it merely attends like an illhumoured courtier is itself  artificial in exactly the same sense and to the same degree   i suppose what is meant by that objection is that jealousy has  not always been a character of man formed no part of that  very modest kit of sentiments with which he is supposed to  have begun the world but waited to make its appearance in  better days and among richer natures  and this is equally  true of love and friendship and love of country and delight  in what they call the beauties of nature and most other  things worth having  love in particular will not endure any  historical scrutiny to all who have fallen across it it is  one of the most incontestable facts in the world but if you  begin to ask what it was in other periods and countries in  greece for instance the strangest doubts begin to spring up  and everything seems so vague and changing that a dream is  logical in comparison  jealousy at any rate is one of the  consequences of love you may like it or not at pleasure but  there it is  it is not exactly jealousy however that we feel when we  reflect on the past of those we love  a bundle of letters  found after years of happy union creates no sense of  insecurity in the present and yet it will pain a man sharply   the two people entertain no vulgar doubt of each other but  this preexistence of both occurs to the mind as something  indelicate  to be altogether right they should have had twin  birth together at the same moment with the feeling that  unites them  then indeed it would be simple and perfect and  without reserve or afterthought  then they would understand  each other with a fulness impossible otherwise  there would  be no barrier between them of associations that cannot be  imparted  they would be led into none of those comparisons  that send the blood back to the heart  and they would know  that there had been no time lost and they had been together  as much as was possible  for besides terror for the  separation that must follow some time or other in the future  men feel anger and something like remorse when they think of  that other separation which endured until they met  some one  has written that love makes people believe in immortality  because there seems not to be room enough in life for so great  a tenderness and it is inconceivable that the most masterful  of our emotions should have no more than the spare moments of  a few years  indeed it seems strange but if we call to mind  analogies we can hardly regard it as impossible  the blind bowboy who smiles upon us from the end of  terraces in old dutch gardens laughingly hails his birdbolts  among a fleeting generation  but for as fast as ever he  shoots the game dissolves and disappears into eternity from  under his falling arrows this one is gone ere he is struck  the other has but time to make one gesture and give one  passionate cry and they are all the things of a moment  when  the generation is gone when the play is over when the thirty  years panorama has been withdrawn in tatters from the stage  of the world we may ask what has become of these great  weighty and undying loves and the sweethearts who despised  mortal conditions in a fine credulity and they can only show  us a few songs in a bygone taste a few actions worth  remembering and a few children who have retained some happy  stamp from the disposition of their parents   iv  truth of intercourse   among sayings that have a currency in spite of being  wholly false upon the face of them for the sake of a half truth upon another subject which is accidentally combined with  the error one of the grossest and broadest conveys the  monstrous proposition that it is easy to tell the truth and  hard to tell a lie  i wish heartily it were  but the truth  is one it has first to be discovered then justly and exactly  uttered  even with instruments specially contrived for such a  purpose  with a foot rule a level or a theodolite  it is  not easy to be exact it is easier alas to be inexact  from  those who mark the divisions on a scale to those who measure  the boundaries of empires or the distance of the heavenly  stars it is by careful method and minute unwearying  attention that men rise even to material exactness or to sure  knowledge even of external and constant things  but it is  easier to draw the outline of a mountain than the changing  appearance of a face and truth in human relations is of this  more intangible and dubious order hard to seize harder to  communicate  veracity to facts in a loose colloquial sense   not to say that i have been in malabar when as a matter of  fact i was never out of england not to say that i have read  cervantes in the original when as a matter of fact i know not  one syllable of spanish  this indeed is easy and to the  same degree unimportant in itself  lies of this sort  according to circumstances may or may not be important in a  certain sense even they may or may not be false  the habitual  liar may be a very honest fellow and live truly with his wife  and friends while another man who never told a formal  falsehood in his life may yet be himself one lie  heart and  face from top to bottom  this is the kind of lie which  poisons intimacy  and vice versa veracity to sentiment  truth in a relation truth to your own heart and your friends  never to feign or falsify emotion  that is the truth which  makes love possible and mankind happy  lart de bien dire is but a drawingroom accomplishment  unless it be pressed into the service of the truth  the  difficulty of literature is not to write but to write what  you mean not to affect your reader but to affect him  precisely as you wish  this is commonly understood in the  case of books or set orations even in making your will or  writing an explicit letter some difficulty is admitted by the  world  but one thing you can never make philistine natures  understand one thing which yet lies on the surface remains  as unseizable to their wits as a high flight of metaphysics   namely that the business of life is mainly carried on by  means of this difficult art of literature and according to a  mans proficiency in that art shall be the freedom and the  fulness of his intercourse with other men  anybody it is  supposed can say what he means and in spite of their  notorious experience to the contrary people so continue to  suppose  now i simply open the last book i have been reading   mr lelands captivating english gipsies  it is said i  find on p 7 that those who can converse with irish peasants  in their own native tongue form far higher opinions of their  appreciation of the beautiful and of the elements of humour  and pathos in their hearts than do those who know their  thoughts only through the medium of english  i know from my  own observations that this is quite the case with the indians  of north america and it is unquestionably so with the gipsy   in short where a man has not a full possession of the  language the most important because the most amiable  qualities of his nature have to lie buried and fallow for the  pleasure of comradeship and the intellectual part of love  rest upon these very elements of humour and pathos  here is  a man opulent in both and for lack of a medium he can put  none of it out to interest in the market of affection  but  what is thus made plain to our apprehensions in the case of a  foreign language is partially true even with the tongue we  learned in childhood  indeed we all speak different  dialects one shall be copious and exact another loose and  meagre but the speech of the ideal talker shall correspond  and fit upon the truth of fact  not clumsily obscuring  lineaments like a mantle but cleanly adhering like an  athletes skin  and what is the result  that the one can  open himself more clearly to his friends and can enjoy more  of what makes life truly valuable  intimacy with those he  loves  an orator makes a false step he employs some trivial  some absurd some vulgar phrase in the turn of a sentence he  insults by a side wind those whom he is labouring to charm  in speaking to one sentiment he unconsciously ruffles another  in parenthesis and you are not surprised for you know his  task to be delicate and filled with perils  o frivolous mind  of man light ignorance  as if yourself when you seek to  explain some misunderstanding or excuse some apparent fault  speaking swiftly and addressing a mind still recently  incensed were not harnessing for a more perilous adventure  as if yourself required less tact and eloquence as if an  angry friend or a suspicious lover were not more easy to  offend than a meeting of indifferent politicians  nay and  the orator treads in a beaten round the matters he discusses  have been discussed a thousand times before language is  readyshaped to his purpose he speaks out of a cut and dry  vocabulary  but you  may it not be that your defence reposes  on some subtlety of feeling not so much as touched upon in  shakespeare to express which like a pioneer you must  venture forth into zones of thought still unsurveyed and  become yourself a literary innovator  for even in love there  are unlovely humours ambiguous acts unpardonable words may  yet have sprung from a kind sentiment  if the injured one  could read your heart you may be sure that he would  understand and pardon but alas the heart cannot be shown   it has to be demonstrated in words  do you think it is a hard  thing to write poetry  why that is to write poetry and of a  high if not the highest order  i should even more admire the lifelong and heroic  literary labours of my fellowmen patiently clearing up in  words their loves and their contentions and speaking their  autobiography daily to their wives were it not for a  circumstance which lessens their difficulty and my admiration  by equal parts  for life though largely is not entirely  carried on by literature  we are subject to physical passions  and contortions the voice breaks and changes and speaks by  unconscious and winning inflections we have legible  countenances like an open book things that cannot be said  look eloquently through the eyes and the soul not locked  into the body as a dungeon dwells ever on the threshold with  appealing signals  groans and tears looks and gestures a  flush or a paleness are often the most clear reporters of the  heart and speak more directly to the hearts of others  the  message flies by these interpreters in the least space of  time and the misunderstanding is averted in the moment of its  birth  to explain in words takes time and a just and patient  hearing and in the critical epochs of a close relation  patience and justice are not qualities on which we can rely   but the look or the gesture explains things in a breath they  tell their message without ambiguity unlike speech they  cannot stumble by the way on a reproach or an allusion that  should steel your friend against the truth and then they have  a higher authority for they are the direct expression of the  heart not yet transmitted through the unfaithful and  sophisticating brain  not long ago i wrote a letter to a  friend which came near involving us in quarrel but we met  and in personal talk i repeated the worst of what i had  written and added worse to that and with the commentary of  the body it seemed not unfriendly either to hear or say   indeed letters are in vain for the purposes of intimacy an  absence is a dead break in the relation yet two who know each  other fully and are bent on perpetuity in love may so  preserve the attitude of their affections that they may meet  on the same terms as they had parted  pitiful is the case of the blind who cannot read the  face pitiful that of the deaf who cannot follow the changes  of the voice  and there are others also to be pitied for  there are some of an inert uneloquent nature who have been  denied all the symbols of communication who have neither a  lively play of facial expression nor speaking gestures nor a  responsive voice nor yet the gift of frank explanatory  speech people truly made of clay people tied for life into a  bag which no one can undo  they are poorer than the gipsy  for their heart can speak no language under heaven  such  people we must learn slowly by the tenor of their acts or  through yea and nay communications or we take them on trust  on the strength of a general air and now and again when we  see the spirit breaking through in a flash correct or change  our estimate  but these will be uphill intimacies without  charm or freedom to the end and freedom is the chief  ingredient in confidence  some minds romantically dull  despise physical endowments  that is a doctrine for a  misanthrope to those who like their fellowcreatures it must  always be meaningless and for my part i can see few things  more desirable after the possession of such radical qualities  as honour and humour and pathos than to have a lively and not  a stolid countenance to have looks to correspond with every  feeling to be elegant and delightful in person so that we  shall please even in the intervals of active pleasing and may  never discredit speech with uncouth manners or become  unconsciously our own burlesques  but of all unfortunates  there is one creature for i will not call him man  conspicuous in misfortune  this is he who has forfeited his  birthright of expression who has cultivated artful  intonations who has taught his face tricks like a pet  monkey and on every side perverted or cut off his means of  communication with his fellowmen  the body is a house of  many windows there we all sit showing ourselves and crying  on the passersby to come and love us  but this fellow has  filled his windows with opaque glass elegantly coloured  his  house may be admired for its design the crowd may pause  before the stained windows but meanwhile the poor proprietor  must lie languishing within uncomforted unchangeably alone  truth of intercourse is something more difficult than to  refrain from open lies  it is possible to avoid falsehood and  yet not tell the truth  it is not enough to answer formal  questions  to reach the truth by yea and nay communications  implies a questioner with a share of inspiration such as is  often found in mutual love  yea and nay mean nothing the  meaning must have been related in the question  many words  are often necessary to convey a very simple statement for in  this sort of exercise we never hit the gold the most that we  can hope is by many arrows more or less far off on different  sides to indicate in the course of time for what target we  are aiming and after an hours talk back and forward to  convey the purport of a single principle or a single thought   and yet while the curt pithy speaker misses the point  entirely a wordy prolegomenous babbler will often add three  new offences in the process of excusing one  it is really a  most delicate affair  the world was made before the english  language and seemingly upon a different design  suppose we  held our converse not in words but in music those who have a  bad ear would find themselves cut off from all near commerce  and no better than foreigners in this big world  but we do  not consider how many have a bad ear for words nor how  often the most eloquent find nothing to reply  i hate  questioners and questions there are so few that can be spoken  to without a lie  do you forgive me  madam and sweetheart  so far as i have gone in life i have never yet been able to  discover what forgiveness means  is it still the same  between us  why how can it be  it is eternally different  and yet you are still the friend of my heart  do you  understand me  god knows i should think it highly  improbable  the cruellest lies are often told in silence  a man may  have sat in a room for hours and not opened his teeth and yet  come out of that room a disloyal friend or a vile calumniator   and how many loves have perished because from pride or  spite or diffidence or that unmanly shame which withholds a  man from daring to betray emotion a lover at the critical  point of the relation has but hung his head and held his  tongue  and again a lie may be told by a truth or a truth  conveyed through a lie  truth to facts is not always truth to  sentiment and part of the truth as often happens in answer  to a question may be the foulest calumny  a fact may be an  exception but the feeling is the law and it is that which  you must neither garble nor belie  the whole tenor of a  conversation is a part of the meaning of each separate  statement the beginning and the end define and travesty the  intermediate conversation  you never speak to god you  address a fellowman full of his own tempers and to tell  truth rightly understood is not to state the true facts but  to convey a true impression truth in spirit not truth to  letter is the true veracity  to reconcile averted friends a  jesuitical discretion is often needful not so much to gain a  kind hearing as to communicate sober truth  women have an ill  name in this connection yet they live in as true relations  the lie of a good woman is the true index of her heart  it takes says thoreau in the noblest and most useful  passage i remember to have read in any modern author 1 two  to speak truth  one to speak and another to hear  he must  be very little experienced or have no great zeal for truth  who does not recognise the fact  a grain of anger or a grain  of suspicion produces strange acoustical effects and makes  the ear greedy to remark offence  hence we find those who  have once quarrelled carry themselves distantly and are ever  ready to break the truce  to speak truth there must be moral  equality or else no respect and hence between parent and  child intercourse is apt to degenerate into a verbal fencing  bout and misapprehensions to become ingrained  and there is  another side to this for the parent begins with an imperfect  notion of the childs character formed in early years or  during the equinoctial gales of youth to this he adheres  noting only the facts which suit with his preconception and  wherever a person fancies himself unjustly judged he at once  and finally gives up the effort to speak truth  with our  chosen friends on the other hand and still more between  lovers for mutual understanding is loves essence the truth  is easily indicated by the one and aptly comprehended by the  other  a hint taken a look understood conveys the gist of  long and delicate explanations and where the life is known  even yea and nay become luminous  in the closest of all  relations  that of a love well founded and equally shared   speech is half discarded like a roundabout infantile process  or a ceremony of formal etiquette and the two communicate  directly by their presences and with few looks and fewer  words contrive to share their good and evil and uphold each  others hearts in joy  for love rests upon a physical basis  it is a familiarity of natures making and apart from  voluntary choice  understanding has in some sort outrun  knowledge for the affection perhaps began with the  acquaintance and as it was not made like other relations so  it is not like them to be perturbed or clouded  each knows  more than can be uttered each lives by faith and believes by  a natural compulsion and between man and wife the language of  the body is largely developed and grown strangely eloquent   the thought that prompted and was conveyed in a caress would  only lose to be set down in words  ay although shakespeare  himself should be the scribe  1 a week on the concord and merrimack rivers  wednesday p 283  yet it is in these dear intimacies beyond all others  that we must strive and do battle for the truth  let but a  doubt arise and alas all the previous intimacy and  confidence is but another charge against the person doubted   what a monstrous dishonesty is this if i have been deceived  so long and so completely  let but that thought gain  entrance and you plead before a deaf tribunal  appeal to the  past why that is your crime  make all clear convince the  reason alas speciousness is but a proof against you  if  you can abuse me now the more likely that you have abused me  from the first  for a strong affection such moments are worth supporting  and they will end well for your advocate is in your lovers  heart and speaks her own language it is not you but she  herself who can defend and clear you of the charge  but in  slighter intimacies and for a less stringent union  indeed  is it worth while  we are all incompris only more or less  concerned for the mischance all trying wrongly to do right  all fawning at each others feet like dumb neglected lap dogs  sometimes we catch an eye  this is our opportunity in  the ages  and we wag our tail with a poor smile  is that  all  all  if you only knew  but how can they know  they  do not love us the more fools we to squander life on the  indifferent  but the morality of the thing you will be glad to hear  is excellent for it is only by trying to understand others  that we can get our own hearts understood and in matters of  human feeling the clement judge is the most successful  pleader    chapter ii  crabbed age and youth    you know my mother now and then argues very notably  always very warmly at least  i happen often to differ from  her and we both think so well of our own arguments that we  very seldom are so happy as to convince one another  a pretty  common case i believe in all vehement debatings  she says  i am too witty anglice too pert i that she is too wise  that is to say being likewise put into english not so young  as she has been  miss howe to miss harlowe clarissa vol  ii  letter xiii   there is a strong feeling in favour of cowardly and  prudential proverbs  the sentiments of a man while he is full  of ardour and hope are to be received it is supposed with  some qualification  but when the same person has  ignominiously failed and begins to eat up his words he should  be listened to like an oracle  most of our pocket wisdom is  conceived for the use of mediocre people to discourage them  from ambitious attempts and generally console them in their  mediocrity  and since mediocre people constitute the bulk of  humanity this is no doubt very properly so  but it does not  follow that the one sort of proposition is any less true than  the other or that icarus is not to be more praised and  perhaps more envied than mr samuel budgett the successful  merchant  the one is dead to be sure while the other is  still in his countinghouse counting out his money and  doubtless this is a consideration  but we have on the other  hand some bold and magnanimous sayings common to high races  and natures which set forth the advantage of the losing side  and proclaim it better to be a dead lion than a living dog   it is difficult to fancy how the mediocrities reconcile such  sayings with their proverbs  according to the latter every  lad who goes to sea is an egregious ass never to forget your  umbrella through a long life would seem a higher and wiser  flight of achievement than to go smiling to the stake and so  long as you are a bit of a coward and inflexible in money  matters you fulfil the whole duty of man  it is a still more difficult consideration for our  average men that while all their teachers from solomon down  to benjamin franklin and the ungodly binney have inculcated  the same ideal of manners caution and respectability those  characters in history who have most notoriously flown in the  face of such precepts are spoken of in hyperbolical terms of  praise and honoured with public monuments in the streets of  our commercial centres  this is very bewildering to the moral  sense  you have joan of arc who left a humble but honest and  reputable livelihood under the eyes of her parents to go a colonelling in the company of rowdy soldiers against the  enemies of france surely a melancholy example for ones  daughters  and then you have columbus who may have pioneered  america but when all is said was a most imprudent  navigator  his life is not the kind of thing one would like  to put into the hands of young people rather one would do  ones utmost to keep it from their knowledge as a red flag of  adventure and disintegrating influence in life  the time  would fail me if i were to recite all the big names in history  whose exploits are perfectly irrational and even shocking to  the business mind  the incongruity is speaking and i imagine  it must engender among the mediocrities a very peculiar  attitude towards the nobler and showier sides of national  life  they will read of the charge of balaclava in much the  same spirit as they assist at a performance of the lyons mail   persons of substance take in the times and sit composedly in  pit or boxes according to the degree of their prosperity in  business  as for the generals who go galloping up and down  among bombshells in absurd cocked hats  as for the actors  who raddle their faces and demean themselves for hire upon the  stage  they must belong thank god to a different order of  beings whom we watch as we watch the clouds careering in the  windy bottomless inane or read about like characters in  ancient and rather fabulous annals  our offspring would no  more think of copying their behaviour let us hope than of  doffing their clothes and painting themselves blue in  consequence of certain admissions in the first chapter of  their school history of england  discredited as they are in practice the cowardly  proverbs hold their own in theory and it is another instance  of the same spirit that the opinions of old men about life  have been accepted as final  all sorts of allowances are made  for the illusions of youth and none or almost none for the  disenchantments of age  it is held to be a good taunt and  somehow or other to clinch the question logically when an old  gentleman waggles his head and says ah so i thought when i  was your age  it is not thought an answer at all if the  young man retorts my venerable sir so i shall most probably  think when i am yours  and yet the one is as good as the  other pass for pass tit for tat a roland for an oliver  opinion in good men says milton is but knowledge in  the making  all opinions properly so called are stages on  the road to truth  it does not follow that a man will travel  any further but if he has really considered the world and  drawn a conclusion he has travelled as far  this does not  apply to formulae got by rote which are stages on the road to  nowhere but second childhood and the grave  to have a  catchword in your mouth is not the same thing as to hold an  opinion still less is it the same thing as to have made one  for yourself  there are too many of these catchwords in the  world for people to rap out upon you like an oath and by way  of an argument  they have a currency as intellectual  counters and many respectable persons pay their way with  nothing else  they seem to stand for vague bodies of theory  in the background  the imputed virtue of folios full of  knockdown arguments is supposed to reside in them just as  some of the majesty of the british empire dwells in the  constables truncheon  they are used in pure superstition as  old clodhoppers spoil latin by way of an exorcism  and yet  they are vastly serviceable for checking unprofitable  discussion and stopping the mouths of babes and sucklings   and when a young man comes to a certain stage of intellectual  growth the examination of these counters forms a gymnastic at  once amusing and fortifying to the mind  because i have reached paris i am not ashamed of having  passed through newhaven and dieppe  they were very good  places to pass through and i am none the less at my  destination  all my old opinions were only stages on the way  to the one i now hold as itself is only a stage on the way to  something else  i am no more abashed at having been a redhot  socialist with a panacea of my own than at having been a  sucking infant  doubtless the world is quite right in a  million ways but you have to be kicked about a little to  convince you of the fact  and in the meanwhile you must do  something be something believe something  it is not  possible to keep the mind in a state of accurate balance and  blank and even if you could do so instead of coming  ultimately to the right conclusion you would be very apt to  remain in a state of balance and blank to perpetuity  even in  quite intermediate stages a dash of enthusiasm is not a thing  to be ashamed of in the retrospect if st paul had not been a  very zealous pharisee he would have been a colder christian   for my part i look back to the time when i was a socialist  with something like regret  i have convinced myself for the  moment that we had better leave these great changes to what  we call great blind forces their blindness being so much more  perspicacious than the little peering partial eyesight of  men  i seem to see that my own scheme would not answer and  all the other schemes i ever heard propounded would depress  some elements of goodness just as much as they encouraged  others  now i know that in thus turning conservative with  years i am going through the normal cycle of change and  travelling in the common orbit of mens opinions  i submit to  this as i would submit to gout or gray hair as a concomitant  of growing age or else of failing animal heat but i do not  acknowledge that it is necessarily a change for the better  i  daresay it is deplorably for the worse  i have no choice in  the business and can no more resist this tendency of my mind  than i could prevent my body from beginning to totter and  decay  if i am spared as the phrase runs i shall doubtless  outlive some troublesome desires but i am in no hurry about  that nor when the time comes shall i plume myself on the  immunity just in the same way i do not greatly pride myself  on having outlived my belief in the fairy tales of socialism   old people have faults of their own they tend to become  cowardly niggardly and suspicious  whether from the growth  of experience or the decline of animal heat i see that age  leads to these and certain other faults and it follows of  course that while in one sense i hope i am journeying towards  the truth in another i am indubitably posting towards these  forms and sources of error  as we go catching and catching at this or that corner of  knowledge now getting a foresight of generous possibilities  now chilled with a glimpse of prudence we may compare the  headlong course of our years to a swift torrent in which a man  is carried away now he is dashed against a boulder now he  grapples for a moment to a trailing spray at the end he is  hurled out and overwhelmed in a dark and bottomless ocean  we  have no more than glimpses and touches we are torn away from  our theories we are spun round and round and shown this or  the other view of life until only fools or knaves can hold to  their opinions  we take a sight at a condition in life and  say we have studied it our most elaborate view is no more  than an impression  if we had breathing space we should take  the occasion to modify and adjust but at this breakneck  hurry we are no sooner boys than we are adult no sooner in  love than married or jilted no sooner one age than we begin  to be another and no sooner in the fulness of our manhood  than we begin to decline towards the grave  it is in vain to  seek for consistency or expect clear and stable views in a  medium so perturbed and fleeting  this is no cabinet science  in which things are tested to a scruple we theorise with a  pistol to our head we are confronted with a new set of  conditions on which we have not only to pass a judgment but  to take action before the hour is at an end  and we cannot  even regard ourselves as a constant in this flux of things  our identity itself seems in a perpetual variation and not  infrequently we find our own disguise the strangest in the  masquerade  in the course of time we grow to love things we  hated and hate things we loved  milton is not so dull as he  once was nor perhaps ainsworth so amusing  it is decidedly  harder to climb trees and not nearly so hard to sit still   there is no use pretending even the thrice royal game of hide  and seek has somehow lost in zest  all our attributes are  modified or chanced and it will be a poor account of us if our  views do not modify and change in a proportion  to hold the  same views at forty as we held at twenty is to have been  stupefied for a score of years and take rank not as a  prophet but as an unteachable brat well birched and none the  wiser  it is as if a ship captain should sail to india from  the port of london and having brought a chart of the thames  on deck at his first setting out should obstinately use no  other for the whole voyage  and mark you it would be no less foolish to begin at  gravesend with a chart of the red sea  si jeunesse savait si  vieillesse pouvait is a very pretty sentiment but not  necessarily right  in five cases out of ten it is not so  much that the young people do not know as that they do not  choose  there is something irreverent in the speculation but  perhaps the want of power has more to do with the wise  resolutions of age than we are always willing to admit  it  would be an instructive experiment to make an old man young  again and leave him all his savoir  i scarcely think he would  put his money in the savings bank after all i doubt if he  would be such an admirable son as we are led to expect and as  for his conduct in love i believe firmly he would outherod  herod and put the whole of his new compeers to the blush   prudence is a wooden juggernaut before whom benjamin franklin  walks with the portly air of a high priest and after whom  dances many a successful merchant in the character of atys   but it is not a deity to cultivate in youth  if a man lives  to any considerable age it cannot be denied that he laments  his imprudences but i notice he often laments his youth a  deal more bitterly and with a more genuine intonation  it is customary to say that age should be considered  because it comes last  it seems just as much to the point  that youth comes first  and the scale fairly kicks the beam  if you go on to add that age in a majority of cases never  comes at all  disease and accident make short work of even  the most prosperous persons death costs nothing and the  expense of a headstone is an inconsiderable trifle to the  happy heir  to be suddenly snuffed out in the middle of  ambitious schemes is tragical enough at best but when a man  has been grudging himself his own life in the meanwhile and  saving up everything for the festival that was never to be it  becomes that hysterically moving sort of tragedy which lies on  the confines of farce  the victim is dead  and he has  cunningly overreached himself a combination of calamities  none the less absurd for being grim  to husband a favourite  claret until the batch turns sour is not at all an artful  stroke of policy and how much more with a whole cellar  a  whole bodily existence  people may lay down their lives with  cheerfulness in the sure expectation of a blessed immortality  but that is a different affair from giving up youth with all  its admirable pleasures in the hope of a better quality of  gruel in a more than problematical nay more than improbable  old age  we should not compliment a hungry man who should  refuse a whole dinner and reserve all his appetite for the  dessert before he knew whether there was to be any dessert or  not  if there be such a thing as imprudence in the world we  surely have it here  we sail in leaky bottoms and on great  and perilous waters and to take a cue from the dolorous old  naval ballad we have heard the mermaidens singing and know  that we shall never see dry land any more  old and young we  are all on our last cruise  if there is a fill of tobacco  among the crew for gods sake pass it round and let us have  a pipe before we go  indeed by the report of our elders this nervous  preparation for old age is only trouble thrown away  we fall  on guard and after all it is a friend who comes to meet us   after the sun is down and the west faded the heavens begin to  fill with shining stars  so as we grow old a sort of  equable jogtrot of feeling is substituted for the violent ups  and downs of passion and disgust the same influence that  restrains our hopes quiets our apprehensions if the  pleasures are less intense the troubles are milder and more  tolerable and in a word this period for which we are asked  to hoard up everything as for a time of famine is in its own  right the richest easiest and happiest of life  nay by  managing its own work and following its own happy inspiration  youth is doing the best it can to endow the leisure of age  a  full busy youth is your only prelude to a selfcontained and  independent age and the muff inevitably develops into the  bore  there are not many doctor johnsons to set forth upon  their first romantic voyage at sixtyfour  if we wish to  scale mont blanc or visit a thieves kitchen in the east end  to go down in a diving dress or up in a balloon we must be  about it while we are still young  it will not do to delay  until we are clogged with prudence and limping with  rheumatism and people begin to ask us what does gravity out  of bed  youth is the time to go flashing from one end of the  world to the other both in mind and body to try the manners  of different nations to hear the chimes at midnight to see  sunrise in town and country to be converted at a revival to  circumnavigate the metaphysics write halting verses run a  mile to see a fire and wait all day long in the theatre to  applaud hernani  there is some meaning in the old theory  about wild oats and a man who has not had his greensickness  and got done with it for good is as little to be depended on  as an unvaccinated infant  it is extraordinary says lord  beaconsfield one of the brightest and best preserved of  youths up to the date of his last novel 1 it is  extraordinary how hourly and how violently change the feelings  of an inexperienced young man  and this mobility is a  special talent entrusted to his care a sort of indestructible  virginity a magic armour with which he can pass unhurt  through great dangers and come unbedaubed out of the miriest  passages  let him voyage speculate see all that he can do  all that he may his soul has as many lives as a cat he will  live in all weathers and never be a halfpenny the worse   those who go to the devil in youth with anything like a fair  chance were probably little worth saving from the first they  must have been feeble fellows  creatures made of putty and  packthread without steel or fire anger or true joyfulness  in their composition we may sympathise with their parents  but there is not much cause to go into mourning for  themselves for to be quite honest the weak brother is the  worst of mankind  1 lothair  when the old man waggles his head and says ah so i  thought when i was your age he has proved the youths case   doubtless whether from growth of experience or decline of  animal heat he thinks so no longer but he thought so while  he was young and all men have thought so while they were  young since there was dew in the morning or hawthorn in may  and here is another young man adding his vote to those of  previous generations and rivetting another link to the chain  of testimony  it is as natural and as right for a young man  to be imprudent and exaggerated to live in swoops and  circles and beat about his cage like any other wild thing  newly captured as it is for old men to turn gray or mothers  to love their offspring or heroes to die for something  worthier than their lives  by way of an apologue for the aged when they feel more  than usually tempted to offer their advice let me recommend  the following little tale  a child who had been remarkably  fond of toys and in particular of lead soldiers found  himself growing to the level of acknowledged boyhood without  any abatement of this childish taste  he was thirteen  already he had been taunted for dallying overlong about the  playbox he had to blush if he was found among his lead  soldiers the shades of the prisonhouse were closing about  him with a vengeance  there is nothing more difficult than to  put the thoughts of children into the language of their  elders but this is the effect of his meditations at this  juncture plainly he said i must give up my playthings  in the meanwhile since i am not in a position to secure  myself against idle jeers  at the same time i am sure that  playthings are the very pick of life all people give them up  out of the same pusillanimous respect for those who are a  little older and if they do not return to them as soon as  they can it is only because they grow stupid and forget  i  shall be wiser i shall conform for a little to the ways of  their foolish world but so soon as i have made enough money  i shall retire and shut myself up among my playthings until  the day i die  nay as he was passing in the train along the  esterel mountains between cannes and frejus he remarked a  pretty house in an orange garden at the angle of a bay and  decided that this should be his happy valley  astrea redux  childhood was to come again  the idea has an air of simple  nobility to me not unworthy of cincinnatus  and yet as the  reader has probably anticipated it is never likely to be  carried into effect  there was a worm i the bud a fatal  error in the premises  childhood must pass away and then  youth as surely as age approaches  the true wisdom is to be  always seasonable and to change with a good grace in changing  circumstances  to love playthings well as a child to lead an  adventurous and honourable youth and to settle when the time  arrives into a green and smiling age is to be a good artist  in life and deserve well of yourself and your neighbour  you need repent none of your youthful vagaries  they may  have been over the score on one side just as those of age are  probably over the score on the other  but they had a point  they not only befitted your age and expressed its attitude and  passions but they had a relation to what was outside of you  and implied criticisms on the existing state of things which  you need not allow to have been undeserved because you now  see that they were partial  all error not merely verbal is  a strong way of stating that the current truth is incomplete   the follies of youth have a basis in sound reason just as  much as the embarrassing questions put by babes and sucklings   their most antisocial acts indicate the defects of our  society  when the torrent sweeps the man against a boulder  you must expect him to scream and you need not be surprised  if the scream is sometimes a theory  shelley chafing at the  church of england discovered the cure of all evils in  universal atheism  generous lads irritated at the injustices  of society see nothing for it but the abolishment of  everything and kingdom come of anarchy  shelley was a young  fool so are these cocksparrow revolutionaries  but it is  better to be a fool than to be dead  it is better to emit a  scream in the shape of a theory than to be entirely insensible  to the jars and incongruities of life and take everything as  it comes in a forlorn stupidity  some people swallow the  universe like a pill they travel on through the world like  smiling images pushed from behind  for gods sake give me the  young man who has brains enough to make a fool of himself  as  for the others the irony of facts shall take it out of their  hands and make fools of them in downright earnest ere the  farce be over  there shall be such a mopping and a mowing at  the last day and such blushing and confusion of countenance  for all those who have been wise in their own esteem and have  not learnt the rough lessons that youth hands on to age  if  we are indeed here to perfect and complete our own natures  and grow larger stronger and more sympathetic against some  nobler career in the future we had all best bestir ourselves  to the utmost while we have the time  to equip a dull  respectable person with wings would be but to make a parody of  an angel  in short if youth is not quite right in its opinions  there is a strong probability that age is not much more so   undying hope is coruler of the human bosom with infallible  credulity  a man finds he has been wrong at every preceding  stage of his career only to deduce the astonishing conclusion  that he is at last entirely right  mankind after centuries  of failure are still upon the eve of a thoroughly  constitutional millennium  since we have explored the maze so  long without result it follows for poor human reason that  we cannot have to explore much longer close by must be the  centre with a champagne luncheon and a piece of ornamental  water  how if there were no centre at all but just one alley  after another and the whole world a labyrinth without end or  issue  i overheard the other day a scrap of conversation which  i take the liberty to reproduce  what i advance is true  said one  but not the whole truth answered the other   sir returned the first and it seemed to me there was a  smack of dr johnson in the speech sir there is no such  thing as the whole truth  indeed there is nothing so  evident in life as that there are two sides to a question   history is one long illustration  the forces of nature are  engaged day by day in cudgelling it into our backward  intelligences  we never pause for a moments consideration  but we admit it as an axiom  an enthusiast sways humanity  exactly by disregarding this great truth and dinning it into  our ears that this or that question has only one possible  solution and your enthusiast is a fine florid fellow  dominates things for a while and shakes the world out of a  doze but when once he is gone an army of quiet and  uninfluential people set to work to remind us of the other  side and demolish the generous imposture  while calvin is  putting everybody exactly right in his institutes and hot headed knox is thundering in the pulpit montaigne is already  looking at the other side in his library in perigord and  predicting that they will find as much to quarrel about in the  bible as they had found already in the church  age may have  one side but assuredly youth has the other  there is nothing  more certain than that both are right except perhaps that  both are wrong  let them agree to differ for who knows but  what agreeing to differ may not be a form of agreement rather  than a form of difference  i suppose it is written that any one who sets up for a  bit of a philosopher must contradict himself to his very  face  for here have i fairly talked myself into thinking that  we have the whole thing before us at last that there is no  answer to the mystery except that there are as many as you  please that there is no centre to the maze because like the  famous sphere its centre is everywhere and that agreeing to  differ with every ceremony of politeness is the only one  undisturbed song of pure concent to which we are ever likely  to lend our musical voices    chapter iii  an apology for idlers   boswell we grow weary when idle johnson that is sir because others being busy we  want company but if we were idle there would be no growing  weary we should all entertain one another   just now when every one is bound under pain of a decree  in absence convicting them of leserespectability to enter on  some lucrative profession and labour therein with something  not far short of enthusiasm a cry from the opposite party who  are content when they have enough and like to look on and  enjoy in the meanwhile savours a little of bravado and  gasconade  and yet this should not be  idleness so called  which does not consist in doing nothing but in doing a great  deal not recognised in the dogmatic formularies of the ruling  class has as good a right to state its position as industry  itself  it is admitted that the presence of people who refuse  to enter in the great handicap race for sixpenny pieces is at  once an insult and a disenchantment for those who do  a fine  fellow as we see so many takes his determination votes for  the sixpences and in the emphatic americanism it goes for  them  and while such an one is ploughing distressfully up the  road it is not hard to understand his resentment when he  perceives cool persons in the meadows by the wayside lying  with a handkerchief over their ears and a glass at their  elbow  alexander is touched in a very delicate place by the  disregard of diogenes  where was the glory of having taken  rome for these tumultuous barbarians who poured into the  senate house and found the fathers sitting silent and unmoved  by their success  it is a sore thing to have laboured along  and scaled the arduous hilltops and when all is done find  humanity indifferent to your achievement  hence physicists  condemn the unphysical financiers have only a superficial  toleration for those who know little of stocks literary  persons despise the unlettered and people of all pursuits  combine to disparage those who have none  but though this is one difficulty of the subject it is  not the greatest  you could not be put in prison for speaking  against industry but you can be sent to coventry for speaking  like a fool  the greatest difficulty with most subjects is to  do them well therefore please to remember this is an  apology  it is certain that much may be judiciously argued in  favour of diligence only there is something to be said  against it and that is what on the present occasion i have  to say  to state one argument is not necessarily to be deaf  to all others and that a man has written a book of travels in  montenegro is no reason why he should never have been to  richmond  it is surely beyond a doubt that people should be a good  deal idle in youth  for though here and there a lord macaulay  may escape from school honours with all his wits about him  most boys pay so dear for their medals that they never  afterwards have a shot in their locker and begin the world  bankrupt  and the same holds true during all the time a lad  is educating himself or suffering others to educate him  it  must have been a very foolish old gentleman who addressed  johnson at oxford in these words young man ply your book  diligently now and acquire a stock of knowledge for when  years come upon you you will find that poring upon books will  be but an irksome task  the old gentleman seems to have been  unaware that many other things besides reading grow irksome  and not a few become impossible by the time a man has to use  spectacles and cannot walk without a stick  books are good  enough in their own way but they are a mighty bloodless  substitute for life  it seems a pity to sit like the lady of  shalott peering into a mirror with your back turned on all  the bustle and glamour of reality  and if a man reads very  hard as the old anecdote reminds us he will have little time  for thought  if you look back on your own education i am sure it will  not be the full vivid instructive hours of truantry that you  regret you would rather cancel some lacklustre periods  between sleep and waking in the class  for my own part i  have attended a good many lectures in my time  i still  remember that the spinning of a top is a case of kinetic  stability  i still remember that emphyteusis is not a  disease nor stillicide a crime  but though i would not  willingly part with such scraps of science i do not set the  same store by them as by certain other odds and ends that i  came by in the open street while i was playing truant  this  is not the moment to dilate on that mighty place of education  which was the favourite school of dickens and of balzac and  turns out yearly many inglorious masters in the science of the  aspects of life  suffice it to say this if a lad does not  learn in the streets it is because he has no faculty of  learning  nor is the truant always in the streets for if he  prefers he may go out by the gardened suburbs into the  country  he may pitch on some tuft of lilacs over a burn and  smoke innumerable pipes to the tune of the water on the  stones  a bird will sing in the thicket  and there he may  fall into a vein of kindly thought and see things in a new  perspective  why if this be not education what is  we may  conceive mr worldly wiseman accosting such an one and the  conversation that should thereupon ensue  how now young fellow what dost thou here  truly sir i take mine ease  is not this the hour of the class and shouldst thou  not be plying thy book with diligence to the end thou mayest  obtain knowledge  nay but thus also i follow after learning by your  leave  learning quotha  after what fashion i pray thee  is  it mathematics  no to be sure  is it metaphysics  nor that  is it some language  nay it is no language  is it a trade  nor a trade neither  why then what ist  indeed sir as a time may soon come for me to go upon  pilgrimage i am desirous to note what is commonly done by  persons in my case and where are the ugliest sloughs and  thickets on the road as also what manner of staff is of the  best service  moreover i lie here by this water to learn  by rootofheart a lesson which my master teaches me to call  peace or contentment  hereupon mr worldly wiseman was much commoved with  passion and shaking his cane with a very threatful  countenance broke forth upon this wise learning quotha  said he i would have all such rogues scourged by the  hangman  and so he would go his way ruffling out his cravat with  a crackle of starch like a turkey when it spread its  feathers  now this of mr wisemans is the common opinion  a  fact is not called a fact but a piece of gossip if it does  not fall into one of your scholastic categories  an inquiry  must be in some acknowledged direction with a name to go by  or else you are not inquiring at all only lounging and the  workhouse is too good for you  it is supposed that all  knowledge is at the bottom of a well or the far end of a  telescope  saintebeuve as he grew older came to regard all  experience as a single great book in which to study for a few  years ere we go hence and it seemed all one to him whether  you should read in chapter xx which is the differential  calculus or in chapter xxxix which is hearing the band play  in the gardens  as a matter of fact an intelligent person  looking out of his eyes and hearkening in his ears with a  smile on his face all the time will get more true education  than many another in a life of heroic vigils  there is  certainly some chill and arid knowledge to be found upon the  summits of formal and laborious science but it is all round  about you and for the trouble of looking that you will  acquire the warm and palpitating facts of life  while others  are filling their memory with a lumber of words onehalf of  which they will forget before the week be out your truant may  learn some really useful art to play the fiddle to know a  good cigar or to speak with ease and opportunity to all  varieties of men  many who have plied their book  diligently and know all about some one branch or another of  accepted lore come out of the study with an ancient and owl like demeanour and prove dry stockish and dyspeptic in all  the better and brighter parts of life  many make a large  fortune who remain underbred and pathetically stupid to the  last  and meantime there goes the idler who began life along  with them  by your leave a different picture  he has had  time to take care of his health and his spirits he has been a  great deal in the open air which is the most salutary of all  things for both body and mind and if he has never read the  great book in very recondite places he has dipped into it and  skimmed it over to excellent purpose  might not the student  afford some hebrew roots and the business man some of his  halfcrowns for a share of the idlers knowledge of life at  large and art of living  nay and the idler has another and  more important quality than these  i mean his wisdom  he who  has much looked on at the childish satisfaction of other  people in their hobbies will regard his own with only a very  ironical indulgence  he will not be heard among the  dogmatists  he will have a great and cool allowance for all  sorts of people and opinions  if he finds no outoftheway  truths he will identify himself with no very burning  falsehood  his way takes him along a byroad not much  frequented but very even and pleasant which is called  commonplace lane and leads to the belvedere of commonsense   thence he shall command an agreeable if no very noble  prospect and while others behold the east and west the devil  and the sunrise he will be contentedly aware of a sort of  morning hour upon all sublunary things with an army of  shadows running speedily and in many different directions into  the great daylight of eternity  the shadows and the  generations the shrill doctors and the plangent wars go by  into ultimate silence and emptiness but underneath all this  a man may see out of the belvedere windows much green and  peaceful landscape many firelit parlours good people  laughing drinking and making love as they did before the  flood or the french revolution and the old shepherd telling  his tale under the hawthorn  extreme busyness whether at school or college kirk or  market is a symptom of deficient vitality and a faculty for  idleness implies a catholic appetite and a strong sense of  personal identity  there is a sort of deadalive hackneyed  people about who are scarcely conscious of living except in  the exercise of some conventional occupation  bring these  fellows into the country or set them aboard ship and you  will see how they pine for their desk or their study  they  have no curiosity they cannot give themselves over to random  provocations they do not take pleasure in the exercise of  their faculties for its own sake and unless necessity lays  about them with a stick they will even stand still  it is no  good speaking to such folk they cannot be idle their nature  is not generous enough and they pass those hours in a sort of  coma which are not dedicated to furious moiling in the gold mill  when they do not require to go to the office when they  are not hungry and have no mind to drink the whole breathing  world is a blank to them  if they have to wait an hour or so  for a train they fall into a stupid trance with their eyes  open  to see them you would suppose there was nothing to  look at and no one to speak with you would imagine they were  paralysed or alienated and yet very possibly they are hard  workers in their own way and have good eyesight for a flaw in  a deed or a turn of the market  they have been to school and  college but all the time they had their eye on the medal  they have gone about in the world and mixed with clever  people but all the time they were thinking of their own  affairs  as if a mans soul were not too small to begin with  they have dwarfed and narrowed theirs by a life of all work  and no play until here they are at forty with a listless  attention a mind vacant of all material of amusement and not  one thought to rub against another while they wait for the  train  before he was breeched he might have clambered on the  boxes when he was twenty he would have stared at the girls  but now the pipe is smoked out the snuffbox empty and my  gentleman sits bolt upright upon a bench with lamentable  eyes  this does not appeal to me as being success in life  but it is not only the person himself who suffers from  his busy habits but his wife and children his friends and  relations and down to the very people he sits with in a  railway carriage or an omnibus  perpetual devotion to what a  man calls his business is only to be sustained by perpetual  neglect of many other things  and it is not by any means  certain that a mans business is the most important thing he  has to do  to an impartial estimate it will seem clear that  many of the wisest most virtuous and most beneficent parts  that are to be played upon the theatre of life are filled by  gratuitous performers and pass among the world at large as  phases of idleness  for in that theatre not only the walking  gentlemen singing chambermaids and diligent fiddlers in the  orchestra but those who look on and clap their hands from the  benches do really play a part and fulfil important offices  towards the general result  you are no doubt very dependent  on the care of your lawyer and stockbroker of the guards and  signalmen who convey you rapidly from place to place and the  policemen who walk the streets for your protection but is  there not a thought of gratitude in your heart for certain  other benefactors who set you smiling when they fall in your  way or season your dinner with good company  colonel newcome  helped to lose his friends money fred bayham had an ugly  trick of borrowing shirts and yet they were better people to  fall among than mr barnes  and though falstaff was neither  sober nor very honest i think i could name one or two long faced barabbases whom the world could better have done  without  hazlitt mentions that he was more sensible of  obligation to northcote who had never done him anything he  could call a service than to his whole circle of ostentatious  friends for he thought a good companion emphatically the  greatest benefactor  i know there are people in the world who  cannot feel grateful unless the favour has been done them at  the cost of pain and difficulty  but this is a churlish  disposition  a man may send you six sheets of letterpaper  covered with the most entertaining gossip or you may pass  half an hour pleasantly perhaps profitably over an article  of his do you think the service would be greater if he had  made the manuscript in his hearts blood like a compact with  the devil  do you really fancy you should be more beholden to  your correspondent if he had been damning you all the while  for your importunity  pleasures are more beneficial than  duties because like the quality of mercy they are not  strained and they are twice blest  there must always be two  to a kiss and there may be a score in a jest but wherever  there is an element of sacrifice the favour is conferred with  pain and among generous people received with confusion   there is no duty we so much underrate as the duty of being  happy  by being happy we sow anonymous benefits upon the  world which remain unknown even to ourselves or when they  are disclosed surprise nobody so much as the benefactor  the  other day a ragged barefoot boy ran down the street after a  marble with so jolly an air that he set every one he passed  into a good humour one of these persons who had been  delivered from more than usually black thoughts stopped the  little fellow and gave him some money with this remark you  see what sometimes comes of looking pleased  if he had  looked pleased before he had now to look both pleased and  mystified  for my part i justify this encouragement of  smiling rather than tearful children i do not wish to pay for  tears anywhere but upon the stage but i am prepared to deal  largely in the opposite commodity  a happy man or woman is a  better thing to find than a fivepound note  he or she is a  radiating focus of goodwill and their entrance into a room is  as though another candle had been lighted  we need not care  whether they could prove the fortyseventh proposition they  do a better thing than that they practically demonstrate the  great theorem of the liveableness of life  consequently if a  person cannot be happy without remaining idle idle he should  remain  it is a revolutionary precept but thanks to hunger  and the workhouse one not easily to be abused and within  practical limits it is one of the most incontestable truths  in the whole body of morality  look at one of your  industrious fellows for a moment i beseech you  he sows  hurry and reaps indigestion he puts a vast deal of activity  out to interest and receives a large measure of nervous  derangement in return  either he absents himself entirely  from all fellowship and lives a recluse in a garret with  carpet slippers and a leaden inkpot or he comes among people  swiftly and bitterly in a contraction of his whole nervous  system to discharge some temper before he returns to work  i  do not care how much or how well he works this fellow is an  evil feature in other peoples lives  they would be happier  if he were dead  they could easier do without his services in  the circumlocution office than they can tolerate his  fractious spirits  he poisons life at the wellhead  it is  better to be beggared out of hand by a scapegrace nephew than  daily hagridden by a peevish uncle  and what in gods name is all this pother about  for  what cause do they embitter their own and other peoples  lives  that a man should publish three or thirty articles a  year that he should finish or not finish his great  allegorical picture are questions of little interest to the  world  the ranks of life are full and although a thousand  fall there are always some to go into the breach  when they  told joan of arc she should be at home minding womens work  she answered there were plenty to spin and wash  and so even  with your own rare gifts  when nature is so careless of the  single life why should we coddle ourselves into the fancy  that our own is of exceptional importance  suppose  shakespeare had been knocked on the head some dark night in  sir thomas lucys preserves the world would have wagged on  better or worse the pitcher gone to the well the scythe to  the corn and the student to his book and no one been any the  wiser of the loss  there are not many works extant if you  look the alternative all over which are worth the price of a  pound of tobacco to a man of limited means  this is a  sobering reflection for the proudest of our earthly vanities   even a tobacconist may upon consideration find no great  cause for personal vainglory in the phrase for although  tobacco is an admirable sedative the qualities necessary for  retailing it are neither rare nor precious in themselves   alas and alas you may take it how you will but the services  of no single individual are indispensable  atlas was just a  gentleman with a protracted nightmare  and yet you see  merchants who go and labour themselves into a great fortune  and thence into the bankruptcy court scribblers who keep  scribbling at little articles until their temper is a cross to  all who come about them as though pharaoh should set the  israelites to make a pin instead of a pyramid and fine young  men who work themselves into a decline and are driven off in  a hearse with white plumes upon it  would you not suppose  these persons had been whispered by the master of the  ceremonies the promise of some momentous destiny and that  this lukewarm bullet on which they play their farces was the  bullseye and centrepoint of all the universe  and yet it is  not so  the ends for which they give away their priceless  youth for all they know may be chimerical or hurtful the  glory and riches they expect may never come or may find them  indifferent and they and the world they inhabit are so  inconsiderable that the mind freezes at the thought    chapter iv  ordered south    by a curious irony of fate the places to which we are  sent when health deserts us are often singularly beautiful   often too they are places we have visited in former years  or seen briefly in passing by and kept ever afterwards in  pious memory and we please ourselves with the fancy that we  shall repeat many vivid and pleasurable sensations and take  up again the thread of our enjoyment in the same spirit as we  let it fall  we shall now have an opportunity of finishing  many pleasant excursions interrupted of yore before our  curiosity was fully satisfied  it may be that we have kept in  mind during all these years the recollection of some valley  into which we have just looked down for a moment before we  lost sight of it in the disorder of the hills it may be that  we have lain awake at night and agreeably tantalised  ourselves with the thought of corners we had never turned or  summits we had all but climbed we shall now be able as we  tell ourselves to complete all these unfinished pleasures  and pass beyond the barriers that confined our recollections  the promise is so great and we are all so easily led  away when hope and memory are both in one story that i  daresay the sick man is not very inconsolable when he receives  sentence of banishment and is inclined to regard his ill health as not the least fortunate accident of his life  nor  is he immediately undeceived  the stir and speed of the  journey and the restlessness that goes to bed with him as he  tries to sleep between two days of noisy progress fever him  and stimulate his dull nerves into something of their old  quickness and sensibility  and so he can enjoy the faint  autumnal splendour of the landscape as he sees hill and  plain vineyard and forest clad in one wonderful glory of  fairy gold which the first great winds of winter will  transmute as in the fable into withered leaves  and so too  he can enjoy the admirable brevity and simplicity of such  little glimpses of country and country ways as flash upon him  through the windows of the train little glimpses that have a  character all their own sights seen as a travelling swallow  might see them from the wing or iris as she went abroad over  the land on some olympian errand  here and there indeed a  few children huzzah and wave their hands to the express but  for the most part it is an interruption too brief and isolated  to attract much notice the sheep do not cease from browsing  a girl sits balanced on the projecting tiller of a canal boat  so precariously that it seems as if a fly or the splash of a  leaping fish would be enough to overthrow the dainty  equilibrium and yet all these hundreds of tons of coal and  wood and iron have been precipitated roaring past her very  ear and there is not a start not a tremor not a turn of the  averted head to indicate that she has been even conscious of  its passage  herein i think lies the chief attraction of  railway travel  the speed is so easy and the train disturbs  so little the scenes through which it takes us that our heart  becomes full of the placidity and stillness of the country  and while the body is borne forward in the flying chain of  carriages the thoughts alight as the humour moves them at  unfrequented stations they make haste up the poplar alley  that leads toward the town they are left behind with the  signalman as shading his eyes with his hand he watches the  long train sweep away into the golden distance  moreover there is still before the invalid the shock of  wonder and delight with which he will learn that he has passed  the indefinable line that separates south from north  and  this is an uncertain moment for sometimes the consciousness  is forced upon him early on the occasion of some slight  association a colour a flower or a scent and sometimes not  until one fine morning he wakes up with the southern  sunshine peeping through the persiennes and the southern  patois confusedly audible below the windows  whether it come  early or late however this pleasure will not end with the  anticipation as do so many others of the same family  it  will leave him wider awake than it found him and give a new  significance to all he may see for many days to come  there  is something in the mere name of the south that carries  enthusiasm along with it  at the sound of the word he pricks  up his ears he becomes as anxious to seek out beauties and to  get by heart the permanent lines and character of the  landscape as if he had been told that it was all his own  an  estate out of which he had been kept unjustly and which he  was now to receive in free and full possession  even those  who have never been there before feel as if they had been and  everybody goes comparing and seeking for the familiar and  finding it with such ecstasies of recognition that one would  think they were coming home after a weary absence instead of  travelling hourly farther abroad  it is only after he is fairly arrived and settled down in  his chosen corner that the invalid begins to understand the  change that has befallen him  everything about him is as he  had remembered or as he had anticipated  here at his feet  under his eyes are the olive gardens and the blue sea   nothing can change the eternal magnificence of form of the  naked alps behind mentone nothing not even the crude curves  of the railway can utterly deform the suavity of contour of  one bay after another along the whole reach of the riviera   and of all this he has only a cold head knowledge that is  divorced from enjoyment  he recognises with his intelligence  that this thing and that thing is beautiful while in his  heart of hearts he has to confess that it is not beautiful for  him  it is in vain that he spurs his discouraged spirit in  vain that he chooses out points of view and stands there  looking with all his eyes and waiting for some return of the  pleasure that he remembers in other days as the sick folk may  have awaited the coming of the angel at the pool of bethesda   he is like an enthusiast leading about with him a stolid  indifferent tourist  there is some one by who is out of  sympathy with the scene and is not moved up to the measure of  the occasion and that some one is himself  the world is  disenchanted for him  he seems to himself to touch things  with muffled hands and to see them through a veil  his life  becomes a palsied fumbling after notes that are silent when he  has found and struck them  he cannot recognise that this  phlegmatic and unimpressionable body with which he now goes  burthened is the same that he knew heretofore so quick and  delicate and alive  he is tempted to lay the blame on the very softness and  amenity of the climate and to fancy that in the rigours of  the winter at home these dead emotions would revive and  flourish  a longing for the brightness and silence of fallen  snow seizes him at such times  he is homesick for the hale  rough weather for the tracery of the frost upon his window panes at morning the reluctant descent of the first flakes  and the white roofs relieved against the sombre sky  and yet  the stuff of which these yearnings are made is of the  flimsiest if but the thermometer fall a little below its  ordinary mediterranean level or a wind come down from the  snowclad alps behind the spirit of his fancies changes upon  the instant and many a doleful vignette of the grim wintry  streets at home returns to him and begins to haunt his  memory  the hopeless huddled attitude of tramps in doorways  the flinching gait of barefoot children on the icy pavement  the sheen of the rainy streets towards afternoon the  meagreanatomy of the poor defined by the clinging of wet  garments the high canorous note of the northeaster on days  when the very houses seem to stiffen with cold these and  such as these crowd back upon him and mockingly substitute  themselves for the fanciful winter scenes with which he had  pleased himself a while before  he cannot be glad enough that  he is where he is  if only the others could be there also if  only those tramps could lie down for a little in the sunshine  and those children warm their feet this once upon a kindlier  earth if only there were no cold anywhere and no nakedness  and no hunger if only it were as well with all men as it is  with him  for it is not altogether ill with the invalid after all   if it is only rarely that anything penetrates vividly into his  numbed spirit yet when anything does it brings with it a  joy that is all the more poignant for its very rarity  there  is something pathetic in these occasional returns of a glad  activity of heart  in his lowest hours he will be stirred and  awakened by many such and they will spring perhaps from very  trivial sources as a friend once said to me the spirit of  delight comes often on small wings  for the pleasure that we  take in beautiful nature is essentially capricious  it comes  sometimes when we least look for it and sometimes when we  expect it most certainly it leaves us to gape joylessly for  days together in the very homeland of the beautiful  we may  have passed a place a thousand times and one and on the  thousand and second it will be transfigured and stand forth  in a certain splendour of reality from the dull circle of  surroundings so that we see it with a childs first  pleasure as wordsworth saw the daffodils by the lake side   and if this falls out capriciously with the healthy how much  more so with the invalid  some day he will find his first  violet and be lost in pleasant wonder by what alchemy the  cold earth of the clods and the vapid air and rain can be  transmuted into colour so rich and odour so touchingly sweet   or perhaps he may see a group of washerwomen relieved on a  spit of shingle against the blue sea or a meeting of flower gatherers in the tempered daylight of an olivegarden and  something significant or monumental in the grouping something  in the harmony of faint colour that is always characteristic  of the dress of these southern women will come borne to him  unexpectedly and awake in him that satisfaction with which we  tell ourselves that we are the richer by one more beautiful  experience  or it may be something even slighter as when the  opulence of the sunshine which somehow gets lost and fails to  produce its effect on the large scale is suddenly revealed to  him by the chance isolation  as he changes the position of  his sunshade  of a yard or two of roadway with its stones and  weeds  and then there is no end to the infinite variety of  the oliveyards themselves  even the colour is indeterminate  and continually shifting now you would say it was green now  gray now blue now tree stands above tree like cloud on  cloud massed into filmy indistinctness and now at the  winds will the whole sea of foliage is shaken and broken up  with little momentary silverings and shadows  but every one  sees the world in his own way  to some the glad moment may  have arrived on other provocations and their recollection may  be most vivid of the stately gait of women carrying burthens  on their heads of tropical effects with canes and naked rock  and sunlight of the relief of cypresses of the troubled  busylooking groups of seapines that seem always as if they  were being wielded and swept together by a whirlwind of the  air coming laden with virginal perfumes over the myrtles and  the scented underwood of the empurpled hills standing up  solemn and sharp out of the greengold air of the east at  evening  there go many elements without doubt to the making of  one such moment of intense perception and it is on the happy  agreement of these many elements on the harmonious vibration  of many nerves that the whole delight of the moment must  depend  who can forget how when he has chanced upon some  attitude of complete restfulness after long uneasy rolling to  and fro on grass or heather the whole fashion of the  landscape has been changed for him as though the sun had just  broken forth or a great artist had only then completed by  some cunning touch the composition of the picture  and not  only a change of posture  a snatch of perfume the sudden  singing of a bird the freshness of some pulse of air from an  invisible sea the light shadow of a travelling cloud the  merest nothing that sends a little shiver along the most  infinitesimal nerve of a mans body  not one of the least of  these but has a hand somehow in the general effect and brings  some refinement of its own into the character of the pleasure  we feel  and if the external conditions are thus varied and  subtle even more so are those within our own bodies  no man  can find out the world says solomon from beginning to end  because the world is in his heart and so it is impossible for  any of us to understand from beginning to end that agreement  of harmonious circumstances that creates in us the highest  pleasure of admiration precisely because some of these  circumstances are hidden from us for ever in the constitution  of our own bodies  after we have reckoned up all that we can  see or hear or feel there still remains to be taken into  account some sensibility more delicate than usual in the  nerves affected or some exquisite refinement in the  architecture of the brain which is indeed to the sense of the  beautiful as the eye or the ear to the sense of hearing or  sight  we admire splendid views and great pictures and yet  what is truly admirable is rather the mind within us that  gathers together these scattered details for its delight and  makes out of certain colours certain distributions of  graduated light and darkness that intelligible whole which  alone we call a picture or a view  hazlitt relating in one  of his essays how he went on foot from one great mans house  to anothers in search of works of art begins suddenly to  triumph over these noble and wealthy owners because he was  more capable of enjoying their costly possessions than they  were because they had paid the money and he had received the  pleasure  and the occasion is a fair one for self complacency  while the one man was working to be able to buy  the picture the other was working to be able to enjoy the  picture  an inherited aptitude will have been diligently  improved in either case only the one man has made for himself  a fortune and the other has made for himself a living spirit   it is a fair occasion for selfcomplacency i repeat when the  event shows a man to have chosen the better part and laid out  his life more wisely in the long run than those who have  credit for most wisdom  and yet even this is not a good  unmixed and like all other possessions although in a less  degree the possession of a brain that has been thus improved  and cultivated and made into the prime organ of a mans  enjoyment brings with it certain inevitable cares and  disappointments  the happiness of such an one comes to depend  greatly upon those fine shades of sensation that heighten and  harmonise the coarser elements of beauty  and thus a degree  of nervous prostration that to other men would be hardly  disagreeable is enough to overthrow for him the whole fabric  of his life to take except at rare moments the edge off his  pleasures and to meet him wherever he goes with failure and  the sense of want and disenchantment of the world and life  it is not in such numbness of spirit only that the life  of the invalid resembles a premature old age  those  excursions that he had promised himself to finish prove too  long or too arduous for his feeble body and the barrierhills  are as impassable as ever  many a white town that sits far  out on the promontory many a comely fold of wood on the  mountain side beckons and allures his imagination day after  day and is yet as inaccessible to his feet as the clefts and  gorges of the clouds  the sense of distance grows upon him  wonderfully and after some feverish efforts and the fretful  uneasiness of the first few days he falls contentedly in with  the restrictions of his weakness  his narrow round becomes  pleasant and familiar to him as the cell to a contented  prisoner  just as he has fallen already out of the mid race  of active life he now falls out of the little eddy that  circulates in the shallow waters of the sanatorium  he sees  the country people come and go about their everyday affairs  the foreigners stream out in goodly pleasure parties the stir  of mans activity is all about him as he suns himself inertly  in some sheltered corner and he looks on with a patriarchal  impersonality of interest such as a man may feel when he  pictures to himself the fortunes of his remote descendants or  the robust old age of the oak he has planted overnight  in this falling aside in this quietude and desertion of  other men there is no inharmonious prelude to the last  quietude and desertion of the grave in this dulness of the  senses there is a gentle preparation for the final  insensibility of death  and to him the idea of mortality  comes in a shape less violent and harsh than is its wont less  as an abrupt catastrophe than as a thing of infinitesimal  gradation and the last step on a long decline of way  as we  turn to and fro in bed and every moment the movements grow  feebler and smaller and the attitude more restful and easy  until sleep overtakes us at a stride and we move no more so  desire after desire leaves him day by day his strength  decreases and the circle of his activity grows ever narrower  and he feels if he is to be thus tenderly weaned from the  passion of life thus gradually inducted into the slumber of  death that when at last the end comes it will come quietly  and fitly  if anything is to reconcile poor spirits to the  coming of the last enemy surely it should be such a mild  approach as this not to hale us forth with violence but to  persuade us from a place we have no further pleasure in  it  is not so much indeed death that approaches as life that  withdraws and withers up from round about him  he has  outlived his own usefulness and almost his own enjoyment and  if there is to be no recovery if never again will he be young  and strong and passionate if the actual present shall be to  him always like a thing read in a book or remembered out of  the faraway past if in fact this be veritably nightfall  he will not wish greatly for the continuance of a twilight  that only strains and disappoints the eyes but steadfastly  await the perfect darkness  he will pray for medea when she  comes let her either rejuvenate or slay  and yet the ties that still attach him to the world are  many and kindly  the sight of children has a significance for  him such as it may have for the aged also but not for others   if he has been used to feel humanely and to look upon life  somewhat more widely than from the narrow loophole of personal  pleasure and advancement it is strange how small a portion of  his thoughts will be changed or embittered by this proximity  of death  he knows that already in english counties the  sower follows the ploughman up the face of the field and the  rooks follow the sower and he knows also that he may not live  to go home again and see the corn spring and ripen and be cut  down at last and brought home with gladness  and yet the  future of this harvest the continuance of drought or the  coming of rain unseasonably touch him as sensibly as ever   for he has long been used to wait with interest the issue of  events in which his own concern was nothing and to be joyful  in a plenty and sorrowful for a famine that did not increase  or diminish by one half loaf the equable sufficiency of his  own supply  thus there remain unaltered all the disinterested  hopes for mankind and a better future which have been the  solace and inspiration of his life  these he has set beyond  the reach of any fate that only menaces himself and it makes  small difference whether he die five thousand years or five  thousand and fifty years before the good epoch for which he  faithfully labours  he has not deceived himself he has known  from the beginning that he followed the pillar of fire and  cloud only to perish himself in the wilderness and that it  was reserved for others to enter joyfully into possession of  the land  and so as everything grows grayer and quieter  about him and slopes towards extinction these unfaded  visions accompany his sad decline and follow him with  friendly voices and hopeful words into the very vestibule of  death  the desire of love or of fame scarcely moved him in  his days of health more strongly than these generous  aspirations move him now and so life is carried forward  beyond life and a vista kept open for the eyes of hope even  when his hands grope already on the face of the impassable  lastly he is bound tenderly to life by the thought of  his friends or shall we not say rather that by their thought  for him by their unchangeable solicitude and love he remains  woven into the very stuff of life beyond the power of bodily  dissolution to undo  in a thousand ways will he survive and  be perpetuated  much of etienne de la boetie survived during  all the years in which montaigne continued to converse with  him on the pages of the everdelightful essays  much of what  was truly goethe was dead already when he revisited places  that knew him no more and found no better consolation than  the promise of his own verses that soon he too would be at  rest  indeed when we think of what it is that we most seek  and cherish and find most pride and pleasure in calling ours  it will sometimes seem to us as if our friends at our  decease would suffer loss more truly than ourselves  as a  monarch who should care more for the outlying colonies he  knows on the map or through the report of his vicegerents  than for the trunk of his empire under his eyes at home are  we not more concerned about the shadowy life that we have in  the hearts of others and that portion in their thoughts and  fancies which in a certain faraway sense belongs to us  than about the real knot of our identity  that central  metropolis of self of which alone we are immediately aware   or the diligent service of arteries and veins and  infinitesimal activity of ganglia which we know as we know a  proposition in euclid to be the source and substance of the  whole  at the death of every one whom we love some fair and  honourable portion of our existence falls away and we are  dislodged from one of these dear provinces and they are not  perhaps the most fortunate who survive a long series of such  impoverishments till their life and influence narrow  gradually into the meagre limit of their own spirits and  death when he comes at last can destroy them at one blow   note  to this essay i must in honesty append a word or  two of qualification for this is one of the points on which a  slightly greater age teaches us a slightly different wisdom  a youth delights in generalities and keeps loose from  particular obligations he jogs on the footpath way himself  pursuing butterflies but courteously lending his applause to  the advance of the human species and the coming of the kingdom  of justice and love  as he grows older he begins to think  more narrowly of mans action in the general and perhaps more  arrogantly of his own in the particular  he has not that same  unspeakable trust in what he would have done had he been  spared seeing finally that that would have been little but  he has a far higher notion of the blank that he will make by  dying  a young man feels himself one too many in the world  his is a painful situation he has no calling no obvious  utility no ties but to his parents and these he is sure to  disregard  i do not think that a proper allowance has been  made for this true cause of suffering in youth but by the  mere fact of a prolonged existence we outgrow either the fact  or else the feeling  either we become so callously accustomed  to our own useless figure in the world or else  and this  thank god in the majority of cases  we so collect about us  the interest or the love of our fellows so multiply our  effective part in the affairs of life that we need to  entertain no longer the question of our right to be  and so in the majority of cases a man who fancies  himself dying will get cold comfort from the very youthful  view expressed in this essay  he as a living man has some  to help some to love some to correct it may be some to  punish  these duties cling not upon humanity but upon the  man himself  it is he not another who is one womans son  and a second womans husband and a third womans father  that  life which began so small has now grown with a myriad  filaments into the lives of others  it is not indispensable  another will take the place and shoulder the discharged  responsibility but the better the man and the nobler his  purposes the more will he be tempted to regret the extinction  of his powers and the deletion of his personality  to have  lived a generation is not only to have grown at home in that  perplexing medium but to have assumed innumerable duties  to  die at such an age has for all but the entirely base  something of the air of a betrayal  a man does not only  reflect upon what he might have done in a future that is never  to be his but beholding himself so early a deserter from the  fight he eats his heart for the good he might have done  already  to have been so useless and now to lose all hope of  being useful any more  there it is that death and memory  assail him  and even if mankind shall go on founding heroic  cities practising heroic virtues rising steadily from  strength to strength even if his work shall be fulfilled his  friends consoled his wife remarried by a better than he how  shall this alter in one jot his estimation of a career which  was his only business in this world which was so fitfully  pursued and which is now so ineffectively to end    chapter v  aes triplex    the changes wrought by death are in themselves so sharp  and final and so terrible and melancholy in their  consequences that the thing stands alone in mans experience  and has no parallel upon earth  it outdoes all other  accidents because it is the last of them  sometimes it leaps  suddenly upon its victims like a thug sometimes it lays a  regular siege and creeps upon their citadel during a score of  years  and when the business is done there is sore havoc  made in other peoples lives and a pin knocked out by which  many subsidiary friendships hung together  there are empty  chairs solitary walks and single beds at night  again in  taking away our friends death does not take them away  utterly but leaves behind a mocking tragical and soon  intolerable residue which must be hurriedly concealed  hence  a whole chapter of sights and customs striking to the mind  from the pyramids of egypt to the gibbets and dule trees of  mediaeval europe  the poorest persons have a bit of pageant  going towards the tomb memorial stones are set up over the  least memorable and in order to preserve some show of  respect for what remains of our old loves and friendships we  must accompany it with much grimly ludicrous ceremonial and  the hired undertaker parades before the door  all this and  much more of the same sort accompanied by the eloquence of  poets has gone a great way to put humanity in error nay in  many philosophies the error has been embodied and laid down  with every circumstance of logic although in real life the  bustle and swiftness in leaving people little time to think  have not left them time enough to go dangerously wrong in  practice  as a matter of fact although few things are spoken of  with more fearful whisperings than this prospect of death few  have less influence on conduct under healthy circumstances   we have all heard of cities in south america built upon the  side of fiery mountains and how even in this tremendous  neighbourhood the inhabitants are not a jot more impressed by  the solemnity of mortal conditions than if they were delving  gardens in the greenest corner of england  there are  serenades and suppers and much gallantry among the myrtles  overhead and meanwhile the foundation shudders underfoot the  bowels of the mountain growl and at any moment living ruin  may leap skyhigh into the moonlight and tumble man and his  merrymaking in the dust  in the eyes of very young people  and very dull old ones there is something indescribably  reckless and desperate in such a picture  it seems not  credible that respectable married people with umbrellas  should find appetite for a bit of supper within quite a long  distance of a fiery mountain ordinary life begins to smell of  highhanded debauch when it is carried on so close to a  catastrophe and even cheese and salad it seems could hardly  be relished in such circumstances without something like a  defiance of the creator  it should be a place for nobody but  hermits dwelling in prayer and maceration or mere borndevils  drowning care in a perpetual carouse  and yet when one comes to think upon it calmly the  situation of these south american citizens forms only a very  pale figure for the state of ordinary mankind  this world  itself travelling blindly and swiftly in overcrowded space  among a million other worlds travelling blindly and swiftly in  contrary directions may very well come by a knock that would  set it into explosion like a penny squib  and what  pathologically looked at is the human body with all its  organs but a mere bagful of petards  the least of these is  as dangerous to the whole economy as the ships powder magazine to the ship and with every breath we breathe and  every meal we eat we are putting one or more of them in  peril  if we clung as devotedly as some philosophers pretend  we do to the abstract idea of life or were half as frightened  as they make out we are for the subversive accident that ends  it all the trumpets might sound by the hour and no one would  follow them into battle  the bluepeter might fly at the  truck but who would climb into a seagoing ship  think if  these philosophers were right with what a preparation of  spirit we should affront the daily peril of the dinnertable  a deadlier spot than any battlefield in history where the  far greater proportion of our ancestors have miserably left  their bones  what woman would ever be lured into marriage so  much more dangerous than the wildest sea  and what would it  be to grow old  for after a certain distance every step we  take in life we find the ice growing thinner below our feet  and all around us and behind us we see our contemporaries  going through  by the time a man gets well into the  seventies his continued existence is a mere miracle and when  he lays his old bones in bed for the night there is an  overwhelming probability that he will never see the day  do  the old men mind it as a matter of fact  why no  they were  never merrier they have their grog at night and tell the  raciest stories they hear of the death of people about their  own age or even younger not as if it was a grisly warning  but with a simple childlike pleasure at having outlived some  one else and when a draught might puff them out like a  guttering candle or a bit of a stumble shatter them like so  much glass their old hearts keep sound and unaffrighted and  they go on bubbling with laughter through years of mans age  compared to which the valley at balaklava was as safe and  peaceful as a village cricketgreen on sunday  it may fairly  be questioned if we look to the peril only whether it was a  much more daring feat for curtius to plunge into the gulf  than for any old gentleman of ninety to doff his clothes and  clamber into bed  indeed it is a memorable subject for consideration with  what unconcern and gaiety mankind pricks on along the valley  of the shadow of death  the whole way is one wilderness of  snares and the end of it for those who fear the last pinch  is irrevocable ruin  and yet we go spinning through it all  like a party for the derby  perhaps the reader remembers one  of the humorous devices of the deified caligula how he  encouraged a vast concourse of holidaymakers on to his bridge  over baiae bay and when they were in the height of their  enjoyment turned loose the praetorian guards among the  company and had them tossed into the sea  this is no bad  miniature of the dealings of nature with the transitory race  of man  only what a chequered picnic we have of it even  while it lasts and into what great waters not to be crossed  by any swimmer gods pale praetorian throws us over in the  end  we live the time that a match flickers we pop the cork  of a gingerbeer bottle and the earthquake swallows us on the  instant  is it not odd is it not incongruous is it not in  the highest sense of human speech incredible that we should  think so highly of the gingerbeer and regard so little the  devouring earthquake  the love of life and the fear of death  are two famous phrases that grow harder to understand the more  we think about them  it is a wellknown fact that an immense  proportion of boat accidents would never happen if people held  the sheet in their hands instead of making it fast and yet  unless it be some martinet of a professional mariner or some  landsman with shattered nerves every one of gods creatures  makes it fast  a strange instance of mans unconcern and  brazen boldness in the face of death  we confound ourselves with metaphysical phrases which we  import into daily talk with noble inappropriateness  we have  no idea of what death is apart from its circumstances and  some of its consequences to others and although we have some  experience of living there is not a man on earth who has  flown so high into abstraction as to have any practical guess  at the meaning of the word life  all literature from job and  omar khayam to thomas carlyle or walt whitman is but an  attempt to look upon the human state with such largeness of  view as shall enable us to rise from the consideration of  living to the definition of life  and our sages give us about  the best satisfaction in their power when they say that it is  a vapour or a show or made out of the same stuff with  dreams  philosophy in its more rigid sense has been at the  same work for ages and after a myriad bald heads have wagged  over the problem and piles of words have been heaped one upon  another into dry and cloudy volumes without end philosophy  has the honour of laying before us with modest pride her  contribution towards the subject that life is a permanent  possibility of sensation  truly a fine result  a man may  very well love beef or hunting or a woman but surely  surely not a permanent possibility of sensation  he may be  afraid of a precipice or a dentist or a large enemy with a  club or even an undertakers man but not certainly of  abstract death  we may trick with the word life in its dozen  senses until we are weary of tricking we may argue in terms  of all the philosophies on earth but one fact remains true  throughout  that we do not love life in the sense that we  are greatly preoccupied about its conservation that we do  not properly speaking love life at all but living  into  the views of the least careful there will enter some degree of  providence no mans eyes are fixed entirely on the passing  hour but although we have some anticipation of good health  good weather wine active employment love and self approval the sum of these anticipations does not amount to  anything like a general view of lifes possibilities and  issues nor are those who cherish them most vividly at all  the most scrupulous of their personal safety  to be deeply  interested in the accidents of our existence to enjoy keenly  the mixed texture of human experience rather leads a man to  disregard precautions and risk his neck against a straw  for  surely the love of living is stronger in an alpine climber  roping over a peril or a hunter riding merrily at a stiff  fence than in a creature who lives upon a diet and walks a  measured distance in the interest of his constitution  there is a great deal of very vile nonsense talked upon  both sides of the matter tearing divines reducing life to the  dimensions of a mere funeral procession so short as to be  hardly decent and melancholy unbelievers yearning for the  tomb as if it were a world too far away  both sides must feel  a little ashamed of their performances now and again when they  draw in their chairs to dinner  indeed a good meal and a  bottle of wine is an answer to most standard works upon the  question  when a mans heart warms to his viands he forgets  a great deal of sophistry and soars into a rosy zone of  contemplation  death may be knocking at the door like the  commanders statue we have something else in hand thank god  and let him knock  passing bells are ringing all the world  over  all the world over and every hour some one is parting  company with all his aches and ecstasies  for us also the  trap is laid  but we are so fond of life that we have no  leisure to entertain the terror of death  it is a honeymoon  with us all through and none of the longest  small blame to  us if we give our whole hearts to this glowing bride of ours  to the appetites to honour to the hungry curiosity of the  mind to the pleasure of the eyes in nature and the pride of  our own nimble bodies  we all of us appreciate the sensations but as for caring  about the permanence of the possibility a mans head is  generally very bald and his senses very dull before he comes  to that  whether we regard life as a lane leading to a dead  wall  a mere bags end as the french say  or whether we  think of it as a vestibule or gymnasium where we wait our  turn and prepare our faculties for some more noble destiny  whether we thunder in a pulpit or pule in little atheistic  poetrybooks about its vanity and brevity whether we look  justly for years of health and vigour or are about to mount  into a bathchair as a step towards the hearse in each and  all of these views and situations there is but one conclusion  possible that a man should stop his ears against paralysing  terror and run the race that is set before him with a single  mind  no one surely could have recoiled with more heartache  and terror from the thought of death than our respected  lexicographer and yet we know how little it affected his  conduct how wisely and boldly he walked and in what a fresh  and lively vein he spoke of life  already an old man he  ventured on his highland tour and his heart bound with  triple brass did not recoil before twentyseven individual  cups of tea  as courage and intelligence are the two  qualities best worth a good mans cultivation so it is the  first part of intelligence to recognise our precarious estate  in life and the first part of courage to be not at all  abashed before the fact  a frank and somewhat headlong  carriage not looking too anxiously before not dallying in  maudlin regret over the past stamps the man who is well  armoured for this world  and not only well armoured for himself but a good friend  and a good citizen to boot  we do not go to cowards for  tender dealing there is nothing so cruel as panic the man  who has least fear for his own carcase has most time to  consider others  that eminent chemist who took his walks  abroad in tin shoes and subsisted wholly upon tepid milk had  all his work cut out for him in considerate dealings with his  own digestion  so soon as prudence has begun to grow up in  the brain like a dismal fungus it finds its first expression  in a paralysis of generous acts  the victim begins to shrink  spiritually he develops a fancy for parlours with a regulated  temperature and takes his morality on the principle of tin  shoes and tepid milk  the care of one important body or soul  becomes so engrossing that all the noises of the outer world  begin to come thin and faint into the parlour with the  regulated temperature and the tin shoes go equably forward  over blood and rain  to be overwise is to ossify and the  scruplemonger ends by standing stockstill  now the man who  has his heart on his sleeve and a good whirling weathercock  of a brain who reckons his life as a thing to be dashingly  used and cheerfully hazarded makes a very different  acquaintance of the world keeps all his pulses going true and  fast and gathers impetus as he runs until if he be running  towards anything better than wildfire he may shoot up and  become a constellation in the end  lord look after his  health lord have a care of his soul says he and he has at  the key of the position and swashes through incongruity and  peril towards his aim  death is on all sides of him with  pointed batteries as he is on all sides of all of us  unfortunate surprises gird him round mimmouthed friends and  relations hold up their hands in quite a little elegiacal  synod about his path and what cares he for all this  being a  true lover of living a fellow with something pushing and  spontaneous in his inside he must like any other soldier in  any other stirring deadly warfare push on at his best pace  until he touch the goal  a peerage or westminster abbey  cried nelson in his bright boyish heroic manner  these are  great incentives not for any of these but for the plain  satisfaction of living of being about their business in some  sort or other do the brave serviceable men of every nation  tread down the nettle danger and pass flyingly over all the  stumblingblocks of prudence  think of the heroism of  johnson think of that superb indifference to mortal  limitation that set him upon his dictionary and carried him  through triumphantly until the end  who if he were wisely  considerate of things at large would ever embark upon any  work much more considerable than a halfpenny post card  who  would project a serial novel after thackeray and dickens had  each fallen in midcourse  who would find heart enough to  begin to live if he dallied with the consideration of death  and after all what sorry and pitiful quibbling all this  is  to forego all the issues of living in a parlour with a  regulated temperature  as if that were not to die a hundred  times over and for ten years at a stretch  as if it were not  to die in ones own lifetime and without even the sad  immunities of death  as if it were not to die and yet be the  patient spectators of our own pitiable change  the permanent  possibility is preserved but the sensations carefully held at  arms length as if one kept a photographic plate in a dark  chamber  it is better to lose health like a spendthrift than  to waste it like a miser  it is better to live and be done  with it than to die daily in the sickroom  by all means  begin your folio even if the doctor does not give you a year  even if he hesitates about a month make one brave push and  see what can be accomplished in a week  it is not only in  finished undertakings that we ought to honour useful labour   a spirit goes out of the man who means execution which out lives the most untimely ending  all who have meant good work  with their whole hearts have done good work although they  may die before they have the time to sign it  every heart  that has beat strong and cheerfully has left a hopeful impulse  behind it in the world and bettered the tradition of mankind   and even if death catch people like an open pitfall and in  midcareer laying out vast projects and planning monstrous  foundations flushed with hope and their mouths full of  boastful language they should be at once tripped up and  silenced is there not something brave and spirited in such a  termination and does not life go down with a better grace  foaming in full body over a precipice than miserably  straggling to an end in sandy deltas  when the greeks made  their fine saying that those whom the gods love die young i  cannot help believing they had this sort of death also in  their eye  for surely at whatever age it overtake the man  this is to die young  death has not been suffered to take so  much as an illusion from his heart  in the hotfit of life  atiptoe on the highest point of being he passes at a bound  on to the other side  the noise of the mallet and chisel is  scarcely quenched the trumpets are hardly done blowing when  trailing with him clouds of glory this happystarred full blooded spirit shoots into the spiritual land    chapter vi  el dorado    it seems as if a great deal were attainable in a world  where there are so many marriages and decisive battles and  where we all at certain hours of the day and with great  gusto and despatch stow a portion of victuals finally and  irretrievably into the bag which contains us  and it would  seem also on a hasty view that the attainment of as much as  possible was the one goal of mans contentious life  and yet  as regards the spirit this is but a semblance  we live in an  ascending scale when we live happily one thing leading to  another in an endless series  there is always a new horizon  for onwardlooking men and although we dwell on a small  planet immersed in petty business and not enduring beyond a  brief period of years we are so constituted that our hopes  are inaccessible like stars and the term of hoping is  prolonged until the term of life  to be truly happy is a  question of how we begin and not of how we end of what we  want and not of what we have  an aspiration is a joy for  ever a possession as solid as a landed estate a fortune  which we can never exhaust and which gives us year by year a  revenue of pleasurable activity  to have many of these is to  be spiritually rich  life is only a very dull and ill directed theatre unless we have some interests in the piece  and to those who have neither art nor science the world is a  mere arrangement of colours or a rough footway where they may  very well break their shins  it is in virtue of his own  desires and curiosities that any man continues to exist with  even patience that he is charmed by the look of things and  people and that he wakens every morning with a renewed  appetite for work and pleasure  desire and curiosity are the  two eyes through which he sees the world in the most enchanted  colours it is they that make women beautiful or fossils  interesting and the man may squander his estate and come to  beggary but if he keeps these two amulets he is still rich in  the possibilities of pleasure  suppose he could take one meal  so compact and comprehensive that he should never hunger any  more suppose him at a glance to take in all the features of  the world and allay the desire for knowledge suppose him to  do the like in any province of experience  would not that man  be in a poor way for amusement ever after  one who goes touring on foot with a single volume in his  knapsack reads with circumspection pausing often to reflect  and often laying the book down to contemplate the landscape or  the prints in the inn parlour for he fears to come to an end  of his entertainment and be left companionless on the last  stages of his journey  a young fellow recently finished the  works of thomas carlyle winding up if we remember aright  with the ten notebooks upon frederick the great  what  cried the young fellow in consternation is there no more  carlyle  am i left to the daily papers  a more celebrated  instance is that of alexander who wept bitterly because he  had no more worlds to subdue  and when gibbon had finished  the decline and fall he had only a few moments of joy and it  was with a sober melancholy that he parted from his labours  happily we all shoot at the moon with ineffectual arrows  our hopes are set on inaccessible el dorado we come to an end  of nothing here below  interests are only plucked up to sow  themselves again like mustard  you would think when the  child was born there would be an end to trouble and yet it  is only the beginning of fresh anxieties and when you have  seen it through its teething and its education and at last  its marriage alas it is only to have new fears new  quivering sensibilities with every day and the health of  your childrens children grows as touching a concern as that  of your own  again when you have married your wife you  would think you were got upon a hilltop and might begin to go  downward by an easy slope  but you have only ended courting  to begin marriage  falling in love and winning love are often  difficult tasks to overbearing and rebellious spirits but to  keep in love is also a business of some importance to which  both man and wife must bring kindness and goodwill  the true  love story commences at the altar when there lies before the  married pair a most beautiful contest of wisdom and  generosity and a lifelong struggle towards an unattainable  ideal  unattainable  ay surely unattainable from the very  fact that they are two instead of one  of making books there is no end complained the  preacher and did not perceive how highly he was praising  letters as an occupation  there is no end indeed to making  books or experiments or to travel or to gathering wealth   problem gives rise to problem  we may study for ever and we  are never as learned as we would  we have never made a statue  worthy of our dreams  and when we have discovered a  continent or crossed a chain of mountains it is only to find  another ocean or another plain upon the further side  in the  infinite universe there is room for our swiftest diligence and  to spare  it is not like the works of carlyle which can be  read to an end  even in a corner of it in a private park or  in the neighbourhood of a single hamlet the weather and the  seasons keep so deftly changing that although we walk there  for a lifetime there will be always something new to startle  and delight us  there is only one wish realisable on the earth only one  thing that can be perfectly attained death  and from a  variety of circumstances we have no one to tell us whether it  be worth attaining  a strange picture we make on our way to our chimaeras  ceaselessly marching grudging ourselves the time for rest  indefatigable adventurous pioneers  it is true that we shall  never reach the goal it is even more than probable that there  is no such place and if we lived for centuries and were  endowed with the powers of a god we should find ourselves not  much nearer what we wanted at the end  o toiling hands of  mortals  o unwearied feet travelling ye know not whither   soon soon it seems to you you must come forth on some  conspicuous hilltop and but a little way further against the  setting sun descry the spires of el dorado  little do ye  know your own blessednes for to travel hopefully is a better  thing than to arrive and the true success is to labour    chapter vii  the english admirals    whether it be wise in men to do such actions or no i am  sure it is so in states to honour them  sir william temple   there is one story of the wars of rome which i have  always very much envied for england  germanicus was going  down at the head of the legions into a dangerous river  on  the opposite bank the woods were full of germans  when there  flew out seven great eagles which seemed to marshal the romans  on their way they did not pause or waver but disappeared  into the forest where the enemy lay concealed  forward  cried germanicus with a fine rhetorical inspiration  forward and follow the roman birds  it would be a very  heavy spirit that did not give a leap at such a signal and a  very timorous one that continued to have any doubt of success   to appropriate the eagles as fellowcountrymen was to make  imaginary allies of the forces of nature the roman empire and  its military fortunes and along with these the prospects of  those individual roman legionaries now fording a river in  germany looked altogether greater and more hopeful  it is a  kind of illusion easy to produce  a particular shape of  cloud the appearance of a particular star the holiday of  some particular saint anything in short to remind the  combatants of patriotic legends or old successes may be  enough to change the issue of a pitched battle for it gives  to the one party a feeling that right and the larger interests  are with them  if an englishman wishes to have such a feeling it must  be about the sea  the lion is nothing to us he has not been  taken to the hearts of the people and naturalised as an  english emblem  we know right well that a lion would fall  foul of us as grimly as he would of a frenchman or a moldavian  jew and we do not carry him before us in the smoke of battle   but the sea is our approach and bulwark it has been the scene  of our greatest triumphs and dangers and we are accustomed in  lyrical strains to claim it as our own  the prostrating  experiences of foreigners between calais and dover have always  an agreeable side to english prepossessions  a man from  bedfordshire who does not know one end of the ship from the  other until she begins to move swaggers among such persons  with a sense of hereditary nautical experience  to suppose  yourself endowed with natural parts for the sea because you  are the countryman of blake and mighty nelson is perhaps just  as unwarrantable as to imagine scotch extraction a sufficient  guarantee that you will look well in a kilt  but the feeling  is there and seated beyond the reach of argument  we should  consider ourselves unworthy of our descent if we did not share  the arrogance of our progenitors and please ourselves with  the pretension that the sea is english  even where it is  looked upon by the guns and battlements of another nation we  regard it as a kind of english cemetery where the bones of  our seafaring fathers take their rest until the last trumpet  for i suppose no other nation has lost as many ships or sent  as many brave fellows to the bottom  there is nowhere such a background for heroism as the  noble terrifying and picturesque conditions of some of our  sea fights  hawkes battle in the tempest and aboukir at the  moment when the french admiral blew up reach the limit of  what is imposing to the imagination  and our naval annals owe  some of their interest to the fantastic and beautiful  appearance of old warships and the romance that invests the  sea and everything seagoing in the eyes of english lads on a  halfholiday at the coast  nay and what we know of the  misery between decks enhances the bravery of what was done by  giving it something for contrast  we like to know that these  bold and honest fellows contrived to live and to keep bold  and honest among absurd and vile surroundings  no reader can  forget the description of the thunder in roderick random the  disorderly tyranny the cruelty and dirt of officers and men  deck after deck each with some new object of offence the  hospital where the hammocks were huddled together with but  fourteen inches space for each the cockpit far under water  where in an intolerable stench the spectacled steward kept  the accounts of the different messes and the canvas  enclosure six feet square in which morgan made flip and  salmagundi smoked his pipe sang his welsh songs and swore  his queer welsh imprecations  there are portions of this  business on board the thunder over which the reader passes  lightly and hurriedly like a traveller in a malarious  country  it is easy enough to understand the opinion of dr  johnson why sir he said no man will be a sailor who has  contrivance enough to get himself into a jail  you would  fancy any ones spirit would die out under such an  accumulation of darkness noisomeness and injustice above  all when he had not come there of his own free will but under  the cutlasses and bludgeons of the pressgang  but perhaps a  watch on deck in the sharp sea air put a man on his mettle  again a battle must have been a capital relief and prize money bloodily earned and grossly squandered opened the  doors of the prison for a twinkling  somehow or other at  least this worst of possible lives could not overlie the  spirit and gaiety of our sailors they did their duty as  though they had some interest in the fortune of that country  which so cruelly oppressed them they served their guns  merrily when it came to fighting and they had the readiest  ear for a bold honourable sentiment of any class of men the  world ever produced  most men of high destinies have highsounding names  pym  and habakkuk may do pretty well but they must not think to  cope with the cromwells and isaiahs  and you could not find a  better case in point than that of the english admirals  drake  and rooke and hawke are picked names for men of execution   frobisher rodney boscawen foulweather jack byron are all  good to catch the eye in a page of a naval history   cloudesley shovel is a mouthful of quaint and sounding  syllables  benbow has a bulldog quality that suits the mans  character and it takes us back to those english archers who  were his true comrades for plainness tenacity and pluck   raleigh is spirited and martial and signifies an act of bold  conduct in the field  it is impossible to judge of blake or  nelson no names current among men being worthy of such  heroes  but still it is odd enough and very appropriate in  this connection that the latter was greatly taken with his  sicilian title  the signification perhaps pleased him  says southey duke of thunder was what in dahomey would have  been called a strong name it was to a sailors taste and  certainly to no man could it be more applicable  admiral in  itself is one of the most satisfactory of distinctions it has  a noble sound and a very proud history and columbus thought  so highly of it that he enjoined his heirs to sign themselves  by that title as long as the house should last  but it is the spirit of the men and not their names  that i wish to speak about in this paper  that spirit is  truly english they and not tennysons cottonspinners or mr  darcy thompsons abstract bagman are the true and typical  englishmen  there may be more head of bagmen in the country  but human beings are reckoned by number only in political  constitutions  and the admirals are typical in the full force  of the word  they are splendid examples of virtue indeed  but of a virtue in which most englishmen can claim a moderate  share and what we admire in their lives is a sort of  apotheosis of ourselves  almost everybody in our land except  humanitarians and a few persons whose youth has been depressed  by exceptionally aesthetic surroundings can understand and  sympathise with an admiral or a prizefighter  i do not wish  to bracket benbow and tom cribb but depend upon it they are  practically bracketed for admiration in the minds of many  frequenters of alehouses  if you told them about germanicus  and the eagles or regulus going back to carthage they would  very likely fall asleep but tell them about harry pearce and  jem belcher or about nelson and the nile and they put down  their pipes to listen  i have by me a copy of boxiana on the  flyleaves of which a youthful member of the fancy kept a  chronicle of remarkable events and an obituary of great men   here we find piously chronicled the demise of jockeys  watermen and pugilists  johnny moore of the liverpool prize  ring tom spring aged fiftysix pierce egan senior writer  of boxiana and other sporting works  and among all these  the duke of wellington  if benbow had lived in the time of  this annalist do you suppose his name would not have been  added to the glorious roll  in short we do not all feel  warmly towards wesley or laud we cannot all take pleasure in  paradise lost but there are certain common sentiments and  touches of nature by which the whole nation is made to feel  kinship  a little while ago everybody from hazlitt and john  wilson down to the imbecile creature who scribbled his  register on the flyleaves of boxiana felt a more or less  shamefaced satisfaction in the exploits of prizefighters   and the exploits of the admirals are popular to the same  degree and tell in all ranks of society  their sayings and  doings stir english blood like the sound of a trumpet and if  the indian empire the trade of london and all the outward  and visible ensigns of our greatness should pass away we  should still leave behind us a durable monument of what we  were in these sayings and doings of the english admirals  duncan lying off the texel with his own flagship the  venerable and only one other vessel heard that the whole  dutch fleet was putting to sea  he told captain hotham to  anchor alongside of him in the narrowest part of the channel  and fight his vessel till she sank  i have taken the depth  of the water added he and when the venerable goes down my  flag will still fly  and you observe this is no naked viking  in a prehistoric period but a scotch member of parliament  with a smattering of the classics a telescope a cocked hat  of great size and flannel underclothing  in the same spirit  nelson went into aboukir with six colours flying so that even  if five were shot away it should not be imagined he had  struck  he too must needs wear his four stars outside his  admirals frock to be a butt for sharpshooters  in honour  i gained them he said to objectors adding with sublime  illogicality in honour i will die with them  captain  douglas of the royal oak when the dutch fired his vessel in  the thames sent his men ashore but was burned along with her  himself rather than desert his post without orders  just  then perhaps the merry monarch was chasing a moth round the  suppertable with the ladies of his court  when raleigh  sailed into cadiz and all the forts and ships opened fire on  him at once he scorned to shoot a gun and made answer with a  flourish of insulting trumpets  i like this bravado better  than the wisest dispositions to insure victory it comes from  the heart and goes to it  god has made nobler heroes but he  never made a finer gentleman than walter raleigh  and as our  admirals were full of heroic superstitions and had a  strutting and vainglorious style of fight so they discovered  a startling eagerness for battle and courted war like a  mistress  when the news came to essex before cadiz that the  attack had been decided he threw his hat into the sea  it is  in this way that a schoolboy hears of a halfholiday but this  was a bearded man of great possessions who had just been  allowed to risk his life  benbow could not lie still in his  bunk after he had lost his leg he must be on deck in a basket  to direct and animate the fight  i said they loved war like a  mistress yet i think there are not many mistresses we should  continue to woo under similar circumstances  trowbridge went  ashore with the culloden and was able to take no part in the  battle of the nile  the merits of that ship and her gallant  captain wrote nelson to the admiralty are too well known  to benefit by anything i could say  her misfortune was great  in getting aground while her more fortunate companions were  in the full tide of happiness  this is a notable expression  and depicts the whole greathearted bigspoken stock of the  english admirals to a hair  it was to be in the full tide of  happiness for nelson to destroy five thousand five hundred  and twentyfive of his fellowcreatures and have his own  scalp torn open by a piece of langridge shot  hear him again  at copenhagen a shot through the mainmast knocked the  splinters about and he observed to one of his officers with a  smile it is warm work and this may be the last to any of us  at any moment and then stopping short at the gangway  added with emotion but mark you  i would not be elsewhere  for thousands  i must tell one more story which has lately been made  familiar to us all and that in one of the noblest ballads in  the english language  i had written my tame prose abstract i  shall beg the reader to believe when i had no notion that the  sacred bard designed an immortality for greenville  sir  richard greenville was viceadmiral to lord thomas howard and  lay off the azores with the english squadron in 1591  he was  a noted tyrant to his crew a dark bullying fellow  apparently and it is related of him that he would chew and  swallow wineglasses by way of convivial levity till the  blood ran out of his mouth  when the spanish fleet of fifty  sail came within sight of the english his ship the revenge  was the last to weigh anchor and was so far circumvented by  the spaniards that there were but two courses open  either  to turn her back upon the enemy or sail through one of his  squadrons  the first alternative greenville dismissed as  dishonourable to himself his country and her majestys ship   accordingly he chose the latter and steered into the spanish  armament  several vessels he forced to luff and fall under  his lee until about three oclock of the afternoon a great  ship of three decks of ordnance took the wind out of his  sails and immediately boarded  thenceforward and all night  long the revenge held her own singlehanded against the  spaniards  as one ship was beaten off another took its  place  she endured according to raleighs computation  eight hundred shot of great artillery besides many assaults  and entries  by morning the powder was spent the pikes all  broken not a stick was standing nothing left overhead  either for flight or defence six feet of water in the hold  almost all the men hurt and greenville himself in a dying  condition  to bring them to this pass a fleet of fifty sail  had been mauling them for fifteen hours the admiral of the  hulks and the ascension of seville had both gone down  alongside and two other vessels had taken refuge on shore in  a sinking state  in hawkes words they had taken a great  deal of drubbing  the captain and crew thought they had done  about enough but greenville was not of this opinion he gave  orders to the master gunner whom he knew to be a fellow after  his own stamp to scuttle the revenge where she lay  the  others who were not mortally wounded like the admiral  interfered with some decision locked the master gunner in his  cabin after having deprived him of his sword for he  manifested an intention to kill himself if he were not to sink  the ship and sent to the spaniards to demand terms  these  were granted  the second or third day after greenville died  of his wounds aboard the spanish flagship leaving his  contempt upon the traitors and dogs who had not chosen to do  as he did and engage fifty vessels well found and fully  manned with six inferior craft ravaged by sickness and short  of stores  he at least he said had done his duty as he was  bound to do and looked for everlasting fame  some one said to me the other day that they considered  this story to be of a pestilent example  i am not inclined to  imagine we shall ever be put into any practical difficulty  from a superfluity of greenvilles  and besides i demur to  the opinion  the worth of such actions is not a thing to be  decided in a quaver of sensibility or a flush of righteous  commonsense  the man who wished to make the ballads of his  country coveted a small matter compared to what richard  greenville accomplished  i wonder how many people have been  inspired by this mad story and how many battles have been  actually won for england in the spirit thus engendered  it is  only with a measure of habitual foolhardiness that you can be  sure in the common run of men of courage on a reasonable  occasion  an army or a fleet if it is not led by quixotic  fancies will not be led far by terror of the provost marshal   even german warfare in addition to maps and telegraphs is  not above employing the wacht am rhein  nor is it only in the  profession of arms that such stories may do good to a man  in  this desperate and gleeful fighting whether it is greenville  or benbow hawke or nelson who flies his colours in the ship  we see men brought to the test and giving proof of what we  call heroic feeling  prosperous humanitarians tell me in my  club smokingroom that they are a prey to prodigious heroic  feelings and that it costs them more nobility of soul to do  nothing in particular than would carry on all the wars by  sea or land of bellicose humanity  it may very well be so  and yet not touch the point in question  for what i desire is  to see some of this nobility brought face to face with me in  an inspiriting achievement  a man may talk smoothly over a  cigar in my club smokingroom from now to the day of judgment  without adding anything to mankinds treasury of illustrious  and encouraging examples  it is not over the virtues of a  curateandteaparty novel that people are abashed into high  resolutions  it may be because their hearts are crass but to  stir them properly they must have men entering into glory with  some pomp and circumstance  and that is why these stories of  our seacaptains printed so to speak in capitals and full  of bracing moral influence are more valuable to england than  any material benefit in all the books of political economy  between westminster and birmingham  greenville chewing  wineglasses at table makes no very pleasant figure any more  than a thousand other artists when they are viewed in the  body or met in private life but his work of art his  finished tragedy is an eloquent performance and i contend it  ought not only to enliven men of the sword as they go into  battle but send back merchant clerks with more heart and  spirit to their bookkeeping by double entry  there is another question which seems bound up in this  and that is temples problem whether it was wise of douglas  to burn with the royal oak and by implication what it was  that made him do so  many will tell you it was the desire of  fame  to what do caesar and alexander owe the infinite  grandeur of their renown but to fortune  how many men has  she extinguished in the beginning of their progress of whom  we have no knowledge who brought as much courage to the work  as they if their adverse hap had not cut them off in the  first sally of their arms  amongst so many and so great  dangers i do not remember to have anywhere read that caesar  was ever wounded a thousand have fallen in less dangers than  the least of these he went through  a great many brave  actions must be expected to be performed without witness for  one that comes to some notice  a man is not always at the top  of a breach or at the head of an army in the sight of his  general as upon a platform  he is often surprised between  the hedge and the ditch he must run the hazard of his life  against a henroost he must dislodge four rascally musketeers  out of a barn he must prick out single from his party as  necessity arises and meet adventures alone  thus far montaigne in a characteristic essay on glory   where death is certain as in the cases of douglas or  greenville it seems all one from a personal point of view   the man who lost his life against a henroost is in the same  pickle with him who lost his life against a fortified place of  the first order  whether he has missed a peerage or only the  corporals stripes it is all one if he has missed them and is  quietly in the grave  it was by a hazard that we learned the  conduct of the four marines of the wager  there was no room  for these brave fellows in the boat and they were left behind  upon the island to a certain death  they were soldiers they  said and knew well enough it was their business to die and  as their comrades pulled away they stood upon the beach gave  three cheers and cried god bless the king  now one or two  of those who were in the boat escaped against all likelihood  to tell the story  that was a great thing for us but surely  it cannot by any possible twisting of human speech be  construed into anything great for the marines  you may  suppose if you like that they died hoping their behaviour  would not be forgotten or you may suppose they thought  nothing on the subject which is much more likely  what can  be the signification of the word fame to a private of  marines who cannot read and knows nothing of past history  beyond the reminiscences of his grandmother  but whichever  supposition you make the fact is unchanged  they died while  the question still hung in the balance and i suppose their  bones were already white before the winds and the waves and  the humour of indian chiefs and spanish governors had decided  whether they were to be unknown and useless martyrs or  honoured heroes  indeed i believe this is the lesson if it  is for fame that men do brave actions they are only silly  fellows after all  it is at best but a pettifogging pickthank business to  decompose actions into little personal motives and explain  heroism away  the abstract bagman will grow like an admiral  at heart not by ungrateful carping but in a heat of  admiration  but there is another theory of the personal  motive in these fine sayings and doings which i believe to be  true and wholesome  people usually do things and suffer  martyrdoms because they have an inclination that way  the  best artist is not the man who fixes his eye on posterity but  the one who loves the practice of his art  and instead of  having a taste for being successful merchants and retiring at  thirty some people have a taste for high and what we call  heroic forms of excitement  if the admirals courted war like  a mistress if as the drum beat to quarters the sailors came  gaily out of the forecastle  it is because a fight is a  period of multiplied and intense experiences and by nelsons  computation worth thousands to any one who has a heart  under his jacket  if the marines of the wager gave three  cheers and cried god bless the king it was because they  liked to do things nobly for their own satisfaction  they  were giving their lives there was no help for that and they  made it a point of selfrespect to give them handsomely  and  there were never four happier marines in gods world than  these four at that moment  if it was worth thousands to be at  the baltic i wish a benthamite arithmetician would calculate  how much it was worth to be one of these four marines or how  much their story is worth to each of us who read it  and mark  you undemonstrative men would have spoiled the situation   the finest action is the better for a piece of purple  if the  soldiers of the birkenhead had not gone down in line or these  marines of the wager had walked away simply into the island  like plenty of other brave fellows in the like circumstances  my benthamite arithmetician would assign a far lower value to  the two stories  we have to desire a grand air in our heroes  and such a knowledge of the human stage as shall make them put  the dots on their own is and leave us in no suspense as to  when they mean to be heroic  and hence we should  congratulate ourselves upon the fact that our admirals were  not only greathearted but bigspoken  the heroes themselves say as often as not that fame is  their object but i do not think that is much to the purpose   people generally say what they have been taught to say that  was the catchword they were given in youth to express the aims  of their way of life and men who are gaining great battles  are not likely to take much trouble in reviewing their  sentiments and the words in which they were told to express  them  almost every person if you will believe himself holds  a quite different theory of life from the one on which he is  patently acting  and the fact is fame may be a forethought  and an afterthought but it is too abstract an idea to move  people greatly in moments of swift and momentous decision  it  is from something more immediate some determination of blood  to the head some trick of the fancy that the breach is  stormed or the bold word spoken  i am sure a fellow shooting  an ugly weir in a canoe has exactly as much thought about fame  as most commanders going into battle and yet the action fall  out how it will is not one of those the muse delights to  celebrate  indeed it is difficult to see why the fellow does  a thing so nameless and yet so formidable to look at unless  on the theory that he likes it  i suspect that is why and i  suspect it is at least ten per cent of why lord beaconsfield  and mr gladstone have debated so much in the house of  commons and why burnaby rode to khiva the other day and why  the admirals courted war like a mistress    chapter viii  some portraits by raeburn    through the initiative of a prominent citizen edinburgh  has been in possession for some autumn weeks of a gallery of  paintings of singular merit and interest  they were exposed  in the apartments of the scotch academy and filled those who  are accustomed to visit the annual spring exhibition with  astonishment and a sense of incongruity  instead of the too  common purple sunsets and peagreen fields and distances  executed in putty and hogs lard he beheld looking down upon  him from the walls of room after room a whole army of wise  grave humorous capable or beautiful countenances painted  simply and strongly by a man of genuine instinct  it was a  complete act of the human drawingroom comedy  lords and  ladies soldiers and doctors hanging judges and heretical  divines a whole generation of good society was resuscitated  and the scotchman of today walked about among the scotchmen  of two generations ago  the moment was well chosen neither  too late nor too early  the people who sat for these pictures  are not yet ancestors they are still relations  they are not  yet altogether a part of the dusty past but occupy a middle  distance within cry of our affections  the little child who  looks wonderingly on his grandfathers watch in the picture  is now the veteran sheriff emeritis of perth  and i hear a  story of a lady who returned the other day to edinburgh after  an absence of sixty years i could see none of my old  friends she said until i went into the raeburn gallery  and found them all there  it would be difficult to say whether the collection was  more interesting on the score of unity or diversity  where  the portraits were all of the same period almost all of the  same race and all from the same brush there could not fail  to be many points of similarity  and yet the similarity of  the handling seems to throw into more vigorous relief those  personal distinctions which raeburn was so quick to seize  he  was a born painter of portraits  he looked people shrewdly  between the eyes surprised their manners in their face and  had possessed himself of what was essential in their character  before they had been many minutes in his studio  what he was  so swift to perceive he conveyed to the canvas almost in the  moment of conception  he had never any difficulty he said  about either hands or faces  about draperies or light or  composition he might see room for hesitation or afterthought   but a face or a hand was something plain and legible  there  were no two ways about it any more than about the persons  name  and so each of his portraits are not only in doctor  johnsons phrase aptly quoted on the catalogue a piece of  history but a piece of biography into the bargain  it is  devoutly to be wished that all biography were equally amusing  and carried its own credentials equally upon its face  these  portraits are racier than many anecdotes and more complete  than many a volume of sententious memoirs  you can see  whether you get a stronger and clearer idea of robertson the  historian from raeburns palette or dugald stewarts woolly  and evasive periods  and then the portraits are both signed  and countersigned  for you have first the authority of the  artist whom you recognise as no mean critic of the looks and  manners of men and next you have the tacit acquiescence of  the subject who sits looking out upon you with inimitable  innocence and apparently under the impression that he is in a  room by himself  for raeburn could plunge at once through all  the constraint and embarrassment of the sitter and present  the face clear open and intelligent as at the most  disengaged moments  this is best seen in portraits where the  sitter is represented in some appropriate action neil gow  with his fiddle doctor spens shooting an arrow or lord  bannatyne hearing a cause  above all from this point of  view the portrait of lieutenantcolonel lyon is notable  a  strange enough young man pink fat about the lower part of  the face with a lean forehead a narrow nose and a fine  nostril sits with a drawingboard upon his knees  he has  just paused to render himself account of some difficulty to  disentangle some complication of line or compare neighbouring  values  and there without any perceptible wrinkling you  have rendered for you exactly the fixed look in the eyes and  the unconscious compression of the mouth that befit and  signify an effort of the kind  the whole pose the whole  expression is absolutely direct and simple  you are ready to  take your oath to it that colonel lyon had no idea he was  sitting for his picture and thought of nothing in the world  besides his own occupation of the moment  although the collection did not embrace i understand  nearly the whole of raeburns works it was too large not to  contain some that were indifferent whether as works of art or  as portraits  certainly the standard was remarkably high and  was wonderfully maintained but there were one or two pictures  that might have been almost as well away  one or two that  seemed wanting in salt and some that you can only hope were  not successful likenesses  neither of the portraits of sir  walter scott for instance were very agreeable to look upon   you do not care to think that scott looked quite so rustic and  puffy  and where is that peaked forehead which according to  all written accounts and many portraits was the  distinguishing characteristic of his face  again in spite of  his own satisfaction and in spite of dr john brown i cannot  consider that raeburn was very happy in hands  without doubt  he could paint one if he had taken the trouble to study it  but it was by no means always that he gave himself the  trouble  looking round one of these rooms hung about with his  portraits you were struck with the array of expressive faces  as compared with what you may have seen in looking round a  room full of living people  but it was not so with the hands   the portraits differed from each other in face perhaps ten  times as much as they differed by the hand whereas with  living people the two go pretty much together and where one  is remarkable the other will almost certainly not be  commonplace  one interesting portrait was that of duncan of  camperdown  he stands in uniform beside a table his feet  slightly straddled with the balance of an old sailor his hand  poised upon a chart by the finger tips  the mouth is pursed  the nostril spread and drawn up the eyebrows very highly  arched  the cheeks lie along the jaw in folds of iron and  have the redness that comes from much exposure to salt sea  winds  from the whole figure attitude and countenance there  breathes something precise and decisive something alert  wiry and strong  you can understand from the look of him  that sense not so much of humour as of what is grimmest and  driest in pleasantry which inspired his address before the  fight at camperdown  he had just overtaken the dutch fleet  under admiral de winter  gentlemen says he you see a  severe winter approaching i have only to advise you to keep  up a good fire  somewhat of this same spirit of adamantine  drollery must have supported him in the days of the mutiny at  the nore when he lay off the texel with his own flagship the  venerable and only one other vessel and kept up active  signals as though he had a powerful fleet in the offing to  intimidate the dutch  another portrait which irresistibly attracted the eye  was the halflength of robert mqueen of braxfield lord  justiceclerk  if i know gusto in painting when i see it  this canvas was painted with rare enjoyment  the tart rosy  humorous look of the man his nose like a cudgel his face  resting squarely on the jowl has been caught and perpetuated  with something that looks like brotherly love  a peculiarly  subtle expression haunts the lower part sensual and  incredulous like that of a man tasting good bordeaux with  half a fancy it has been somewhat too long uncorked  from  under the pendulous eyelids of old age the eyes look out with  a halfyouthful halffrosty twinkle  hands with no pretence  to distinction are folded on the judges stomach  so  sympathetically is the character conceived by the portrait  painter that it is hardly possible to avoid some movement of  sympathy on the part of the spectator  and sympathy is a  thing to be encouraged apart from humane considerations  because it supplies us with the materials for wisdom  it is  probably more instructive to entertain a sneaking kindness for  any unpopular person and among the rest for lord braxfield  than to give way to perfect raptures of moral indignation  against his abstract vices  he was the last judge on the  scotch bench to employ the pure scotch idiom  his opinions  thus given in doric and conceived in a lively rugged  conversational style were full of point and authority  out  of the bar or off the bench he was a convivial man a lover  of wine and one who shone peculiarly at tavern meetings   he has left behind him an unrivalled reputation for rough and  cruel speech and to this day his name smacks of the gallows   it was he who presided at the trials of muir and skirving in  1793 and 1794 and his appearance on these occasions was  scarcely cut to the pattern of today  his summing up on muir  began thus  the reader must supply for himself the growling  blacksmiths voice and the broad scotch accent now this is  the question for consideration  is the panel guilty of  sedition or is he not  now before this can be answered two  things must be attended to that require no proof first that  the british constitution is the best that ever was since the  creation of the world and it is not possible to make it  better  its a pretty fair start is it not for a political  trial  a little later he has occasion to refer to the  relations of muir with those wretches the french  i never  liked the french all my days said his lordship but now i  hate them  and yet a little further on a government in any  country should be like a corporation and in this country it  is made up of the landed interest which alone has a right to  be represented  as for the rabble who have nothing but  personal property what hold has the nation of them  they may  pack up their property on their backs and leave the country  in the twinkling of an eye  after having made profession of  sentiments so cynically antipopular as these when the trials  were at an end which was generally about midnight braxfield  would walk home to his house in george square with no better  escort than an easy conscience  i think i see him getting his  cloak about his shoulders and with perhaps a lantern in one  hand steering his way along the streets in the mirk january  night  it might have been that very day that skirving had  defied him in these words it is altogether unavailing for  your lordship to menace me for i have long learned to fear  not the face of man and i can fancy as braxfield reflected  on the number of what he called grumbletonians in edinburgh  and of how many of them must bear special malice against so  upright and inflexible a judge nay and might at that very  moment be lurking in the mouth of a dark close with hostile  intent  i can fancy that he indulged in a sour smile as he  reflected that he also was not especially afraid of mens  faces or mens fists and had hitherto found no occasion to  embody this insensibility in heroic words  for if he was an  inhumane old gentleman and i am afraid it is a fact that he  was inhumane he was also perfectly intrepid  you may look  into the queer face of that portrait for as long as you will  but you will not see any hole or corner for timidity to enter  in  indeed there would be no end to this paper if i were  even to name half of the portraits that were remarkable for  their execution or interesting by association  there was one  picture of mr wardrop of torbane hill which you might palm  off upon most laymen as a rembrandt and close by you saw the  white head of john clerk of eldin that country gentleman  who playing with pieces of cork on his own diningtable  invented modern naval warfare  there was that portrait of  neil gow to sit for which the old fiddler walked daily  through the streets of edinburgh arm in arm with the duke of  athole  there was good harry erskine with his satirical nose  and upper lip and his mouth just open for a witticism to pop  out hutton the geologist in quakerish raiment and looking  altogether trim and narrow and as if he cared more about  fossils than young ladies fullblown john robieson in  hyperbolical red dressinggown and every inch of him a fine  old man of the world constable the publisher upright beside  a table and bearing a corporation with commercial dignity  lord bannatyne hearing a cause if ever anybody heard a cause  since the world began lord newton just awakened from  clandestine slumber on the bench and the second president  dundas with every feature so fat that he reminds you in his  wig of some droll old court officer in an illustrated nursery  storybook and yet all these fat features instinct with  meaning the fat lips curved and compressed the nose  combining somehow the dignity of a beak with the good nature  of a bottle and the very double chin with an air of  intelligence and insight  and all these portraits are so pat  and telling and look at you so spiritedly from the walls  that compared with the sort of living people one sees about  the streets they are as bright new sovereigns to fishy and  obliterated sixpences  some disparaging thoughts upon our own  generation could hardly fail to present themselves but it is  perhaps only the sacer vates who is wanting and we also  painted by such a man as carolus duran may look in holiday  immortality upon our children and grandchildren  raeburns young women to be frank are by no means of  the same order of merit  no one of course could be  insensible to the presence of miss janet suttie or mrs  campbell of possil  when things are as pretty as that  criticism is out of season  but on the whole it is only  with women of a certain age that he can be said to have  succeeded in at all the same sense as we say he succeeded  with men  the younger women do not seem to be made of good  flesh and blood  they are not painted in rich and unctuous  touches  they are dry and diaphanous  and although young  ladies in great britain are all that can be desired of them i  would fain hope they are not quite so much of that as raeburn  would have us believe  in all these pretty faces you miss  character you miss fire you miss that spice of the devil  which is worth all the prettiness in the world and what is  worst of all you miss sex  his young ladies are not womanly  to nearly the same degree as his men are masculine they are  so in a negative sense in short they are the typical young  ladies of the male novelist  to say truth either raeburn was timid with young and  pretty sitters or he had stupefied himself with  sentimentalities or else and here is about the truth of it  raeburn and the rest of us labour under an obstinate blindness  in one direction and know very little more about women after  all these centuries than adam when he first saw eve  this is  all the more likely because we are by no means so  unintelligent in the matter of old women  there are some  capital old women it seems to me in books written by men   and raeburn has some such as mrs colin campbell of park or  the anonymous old lady with a large cap which are done in  the same frank perspicacious spirit as the very best of his  men  he could look into their eyes without trouble and he  was not withheld by any bashful sentimentalism from  recognising what he saw there and unsparingly putting it down  upon the canvas  but where people cannot meet without some  confusion and a good deal of involuntary humbug and are  occupied for as long as they are together with a very  different vein of thought there cannot be much room for  intelligent study nor much result in the shape of genuine  comprehension  even women who understand men so well for  practical purposes do not know them well enough for the  purposes of art  take even the very best of their male  creations take tito melema for instance and you will find  he has an equivocal air and every now and again remembers he  has a comb at the back of his head  of course no woman will  believe this and many men will be so very polite as to humour  their incredulity    chapter ix  childs play    the regret we have for our childhood is not wholly  justifiable so much a man may lay down without fear of public  ribaldry for although we shake our heads over the change we  are not unconscious of the manifold advantages of our new  state  what we lose in generous impulse we more than gain in  the habit of generously watching others and the capacity to  enjoy shakespeare may balance a lost aptitude for playing at  soldiers  terror is gone out of our lives moreover we no  longer see the devil in the bedcurtains nor lie awake to  listen to the wind  we go to school no more and if we have  only exchanged one drudgery for another which is by no means  sure we are set free for ever from the daily fear of  chastisement  and yet a great change has overtaken us and  although we do not enjoy ourselves less at least we take our  pleasure differently  we need pickles nowadays to make  wednesdays cold mutton please our fridays appetite and i  can remember the time when to call it red venison and tell  myself a hunters story would have made it more palatable  than the best of sauces  to the grown person cold mutton is  cold mutton all the world over not all the mythology ever  invented by man will make it better or worse to him the broad  fact the clamant reality of the mutton carries away before  it such seductive figments  but for the child it is still  possible to weave an enchantment over eatables and if he has  but read of a dish in a storybook it will be heavenly manna  to him for a week  if a grown man does not like eating and drinking and  exercise if he is not something positive in his tastes it  means he has a feeble body and should have some medicine but  children may be pure spirits if they will and take their  enjoyment in a world of moonshine  sensation does not count  for so much in our first years as afterwards something of the  swaddling numbness of infancy clings about us we see and  touch and hear through a sort of golden mist  children for  instance are able enough to see but they have no great  faculty for looking they do not use their eyes for the  pleasure of using them but for byends of their own and the  things i call to mind seeing most vividly were not beautiful  in themselves but merely interesting or enviable to me as i  thought they might be turned to practical account in play   nor is the sense of touch so clean and poignant in children as  it is in a man  if you will turn over your old memories i  think the sensations of this sort you remember will be  somewhat vague and come to not much more than a blunt  general sense of heat on summer days or a blunt general  sense of wellbeing in bed  and here of course you will  understand pleasurable sensations for overmastering pain   the most deadly and tragical element in life and the true  commander of mans soul and body  alas pain has its own way  with all of us it breaks in a rude visitant upon the fairy  garden where the child wanders in a dream no less surely than  it rules upon the field of battle or sends the immortal war god whimpering to his father and innocence no more than  philosophy can protect us from this sting  as for taste  when we bear in mind the excesses of unmitigated sugar which  delight a youthful palate it is surely no very cynical  asperity to think taste a character of the maturer growth   smell and hearing are perhaps more developed i remember many  scents many voices and a great deal of spring singing in the  woods  but hearing is capable of vast improvement as a means  of pleasure and there is all the world between gaping  wonderment at the jargon of birds and the emotion with which  a man listens to articulate music  at the same time and step by step with this increase in  the definition and intensity of what we feel which accompanies  our growing age another change takes place in the sphere of  intellect by which all things are transformed and seen  through theories and associations as through coloured windows   we make to ourselves day by day out of history and gossip  and economical speculations and god knows what a medium in  which we walk and through which we look abroad  we study shop  windows with other eyes than in our childhood never to  wonder not always to admire but to make and modify our  little incongruous theories about life  it is no longer the  uniform of a soldier that arrests our attention but perhaps  the flowing carriage of a woman or perhaps a countenance that  has been vividly stamped with passion and carries an  adventurous story written in its lines  the pleasure of  surprise is passed away sugarloaves and watercarts seem  mighty tame to encounter and we walk the streets to make  romances and to sociologise  nor must we deny that a good  many of us walk them solely for the purposes of transit or in  the interest of a livelier digestion  these indeed may look  back with mingled thoughts upon their childhood but the rest  are in a better case they know more than when they were  children they understand better their desires and sympathies  answer more nimbly to the provocation of the senses and their  minds are brimming with interest as they go about the world  according to my contention this is a flight to which  children cannot rise  they are wheeled in perambulators or  dragged about by nurses in a pleasing stupor  a vague faint  abiding wonderment possesses them  here and there some  specially remarkable circumstance such as a watercart or a  guardsman fairly penetrates into the seat of thought and  calls them for half a moment out of themselves and you may  see them still towed forward sideways by the inexorable nurse  as by a sort of destiny but still staring at the bright  object in their wake  it may be some minutes before another  such moving spectacle reawakens them to the world in which  they dwell  for other children they almost invariably show  some intelligent sympathy  there is a fine fellow making mud  pies they seem to say that i can understand there is some  sense in mud pies  but the doings of their elders unless  where they are speakingly picturesque or recommend themselves  by the quality of being easily imitable they let them go over  their heads as we say without the least regard  if it were  not for this perpetual imitation we should be tempted to  fancy they despised us outright or only considered us in the  light of creatures brutally strong and brutally silly among  whom they condescended to dwell in obedience like a  philosopher at a barbarous court  at times indeed they  display an arrogance of disregard that is truly staggering   once when i was groaning aloud with physical pain a young  gentleman came into the room and nonchalantly inquired if i  had seen his bow and arrow  he made no account of my groans  which he accepted as he had to accept so much else as a  piece of the inexplicable conduct of his elders and like a  wise young gentleman he would waste no wonder on the subject   those elders who care so little for rational enjoyment and  are even the enemies of rational enjoyment for others he had  accepted without understanding and without complaint as the  rest of us accept the scheme of the universe  we grown people can tell ourselves a story give and take  strokes until the bucklers ring ride far and fast marry  fall and die all the while sitting quietly by the fire or  lying prone in bed  this is exactly what a child cannot do  or does not do at least when he can find anything else  he  works all with lay figures and stage properties  when his  story comes to the fighting he must rise get something by  way of a sword and have a setto with a piece of furniture  until he is out of breath  when he comes to ride with the  kings pardon he must bestride a chair which he will so  hurry and belabour and on which he will so furiously demean  himself that the messenger will arrive if not bloody with  spurring at least fiery red with haste  if his romance  involves an accident upon a cliff he must clamber in person  about the chest of drawers and fall bodily upon the carpet  before his imagination is satisfied  lead soldiers dolls  all toys in short are in the same category and answer the  same end  nothing can stagger a childs faith he accepts the  clumsiest substitutes and can swallow the most staring  incongruities  the chair he has just been besieging as a  castle or valiantly cutting to the ground as a dragon is  taken away for the accommodation of a morning visitor and he  is nothing abashed he can skirmish by the hour with a  stationary coalscuttle in the midst of the enchanted  pleasance he can see without sensible shock the gardener  soberly digging potatoes for the days dinner  he can make  abstraction of whatever does not fit into his fable and he  puts his eyes into his pocket just as we hold our noses in an  unsavoury lane  and so it is that although the ways of  children cross with those of their elders in a hundred places  daily they never go in the same direction nor so much as lie  in the same element  so may the telegraph wires intersect the  line of the highroad or so might a landscape painter and a  bagman visit the same country and yet move in different  worlds  people struck with these spectacles cry aloud about the  power of imagination in the young  indeed there may be two  words to that  it is in some ways but a pedestrian fancy  that the child exhibits  it is the grown people who make the  nursery stories all the children do is jealously to preserve  the text  one out of a dozen reasons why robinson crusoe  should be so popular with youth is that it hits their level  in this matter to a nicety crusoe was always at makeshifts  and had in so many words to play at a great variety of  professions and then the book is all about tools and there  is nothing that delights a child so much  hammers and saws  belong to a province of life that positively calls for  imitation  the juvenile lyrical drama surely of the most  ancient thespian model wherein the trades of mankind are  successively simulated to the running burthen on a cold and  frosty morning gives a good instance of the artistic taste  in children  and this need for overt action and lay figures  testifies to a defect in the childs imagination which  prevents him from carrying out his novels in the privacy of  his own heart  he does not yet know enough of the world and  men  his experience is incomplete  that stagewardrobe and  sceneroom that we call the memory is so ill provided that he  can overtake few combinations and body out few stories to his  own content without some external aid  he is at the  experimental stage he is not sure how one would feel in  certain circumstances to make sure he must come as near  trying it as his means permit  and so here is young heroism  with a wooden sword and mothers practice their kind vocation  over a bit of jointed stick  it may be laughable enough just  now but it is these same people and these same thoughts that  not long hence when they are on the theatre of life will  make you weep and tremble  for children think very much the  same thoughts and dream the same dreams as bearded men and  marriageable women  no one is more romantic  fame and  honour the love of young men and the love of mothers the  business mans pleasure in method all these and others they  anticipate and rehearse in their play hours  upon us who are  further advanced and fairly dealing with the threads of  destiny they only glance from time to time to glean a hint  for their own mimetic reproduction  two children playing at  soldiers are far more interesting to each other than one of  the scarlet beings whom both are busy imitating  this is  perhaps the greatest oddity of all  art for art is their  motto and the doings of grown folk are only interesting as  the raw material for play  not theophile gautier not  flaubert can look more callously upon life or rate the  reproduction more highly over the reality and they will  parody an execution a deathbed or the funeral of the young  man of nain with all the cheerfulness in the world  the true parallel for play is not to be found of course  in conscious art which though it be derived from play is  itself an abstract impersonal thing and depends largely upon  philosophical interests beyond the scope of childhood  it is  when we make castles in the air and personate the leading  character in our own romances that we return to the spirit of  our first years  only there are several reasons why the  spirit is no longer so agreeable to indulge  nowadays when  we admit this personal element into our divagations we are apt  to stir up uncomfortable and sorrowful memories and remind  ourselves sharply of old wounds  our daydreams can no longer  lie all in the air like a story in the arabian nights they  read to us rather like the history of a period in which we  ourselves had taken part where we come across many  unfortunate passages and find our own conduct smartly  reprimanded  and then the child mind you acts his parts   he does not merely repeat them to himself he leaps he runs  and sets the blood agog over all his body  and so his play  breathes him and he no sooner assumes a passion than he gives  it vent  alas when we betake ourselves to our intellectual  form of play sitting quietly by the fire or lying prone in  bed we rouse many hot feelings for which we can find no  outlet  substitutes are not acceptable to the mature mind  which desires the thing itself and even to rehearse a  triumphant dialogue with ones enemy although it is perhaps  the most satisfactory piece of play still left within our  reach is not entirely satisfying and is even apt to lead to  a visit and an interview which may be the reverse of  triumphant after all  in the childs world of dim sensation play is all in  all  making believe is the gist of his whole life and he  cannot so much as take a walk except in character  i could  not learn my alphabet without some suitable miseenscene and  had to act a business man in an office before i could sit down  to my book  will you kindly question your memory and find  out how much you did work or pleasure in good faith and  soberness and for how much you had to cheat yourself with  some invention  i remember as though it were yesterday the  expansion of spirit the dignity and selfreliance that came  with a pair of mustachios in burnt cork even when there was  none to see  children are even content to forego what we call  the realities and prefer the shadow to the substance  when  they might be speaking intelligibly together they chatter  senseless gibberish by the hour and are quite happy because  they are making believe to speak french  i have said already  how even the imperious appetite of hunger suffers itself to be  gulled and led by the nose with the fag end of an old song   and it goes deeper than this when children are together even  a meal is felt as an interruption in the business of life and  they must find some imaginative sanction and tell themselves  some sort of story to account for to colour to render  entertaining the simple processes of eating and drinking   what wonderful fancies i have heard evolved out of the pattern  upon teacups  from which there followed a code of rules and  a whole world of excitement until teadrinking began to take  rank as a game  when my cousin and i took our porridge of a  morning we had a device to enliven the course of the meal   he ate his with sugar and explained it to be a country  continually buried under snow  i took mine with milk and  explained it to be a country suffering gradual inundation   you can imagine us exchanging bulletins how here was an  island still unsubmerged here a valley not yet covered with  snow what inventions were made how his population lived in  cabins on perches and travelled on stilts and how mine was  always in boats how the interest grew furious as the last  corner of safe ground was cut off on all sides and grew  smaller every moment and how in fine the food was of  altogether secondary importance and might even have been  nauseous so long as we seasoned it with these dreams  but  perhaps the most exciting moments i ever had over a meal were  in the case of calves feet jelly  it was hardly possible not  to believe  and you may be sure so far from trying i did  all i could to favour the illusion  that some part of it was  hollow and that sooner or later my spoon would lay open the  secret tabernacle of the golden rock  there might some  miniature red beard await his hour there might one find the  treasures of the forty thieves and bewildered cassim beating  about the walls  and so i quarried on slowly with bated  breath savouring the interest  believe me i had little  palate left for the jelly and though i preferred the taste  when i took cream with it i used often to go without because  the cream dimmed the transparent fractures  even with games this spirit is authoritative with right minded children  it is thus that hideandseek has so pre eminent a sovereignty for it is the wellspring of romance  and the actions and the excitement to which it gives rise lend  themselves to almost any sort of fable  and thus cricket  which is a mere matter of dexterity palpably about nothing  and for no end often fails to satisfy infantile craving  it  is a game if you like but not a game of play  you cannot  tell yourself a story about cricket and the activity it calls  forth can be justified on no rational theory  even football  although it admirably simulates the tug and the ebb and flow  of battle has presented difficulties to the mind of young  sticklers after verisimilitude and i knew at least one little  boy who was mightily exercised about the presence of the ball  and had to spirit himself up whenever he came to play with  an elaborate story of enchantment and take the missile as a  sort of talisman bandied about in conflict between two arabian  nations  to think of such a frame of mind is to become disquieted  about the bringing up of children  surely they dwell in a  mythological epoch and are not the contemporaries of their  parents  what can they think of them what can they make of  these bearded or petticoated giants who look down upon their  games who move upon a cloudy olympus following unknown  designs apart from rational enjoyment who profess the  tenderest solicitude for children and yet every now and again  reach down out of their altitude and terribly vindicate the  prerogatives of age  off goes the child corporally smarting  but morally rebellious  were there ever such unthinkable  deities as parents  i would give a great deal to know what  in nine cases out of ten is the childs unvarnished feeling   a sense of past cajolery a sense of personal attraction at  best very feeble above all i should imagine a sense of  terror for the untried residue of mankind go to make up the  attraction that he feels  no wonder poor little heart with  such a weltering world in front of him if he clings to the  hand he knows  the dread irrationality of the whole affair  as it seems to children is a thing we are all too ready to  forget  o why i remember passionately wondering why can  we not all be happy and devote ourselves to play  and when  children do philosophise i believe it is usually to very much  the same purpose  one thing at least comes very clearly out of these  considerations that whatever we are to expect at the hands of  children it should not be any peddling exactitude about  matters of fact  they walk in a vain show and among mists  and rainbows they are passionate after dreams and unconcerned  about realities speech is a difficult art not wholly learned  and there is nothing in their own tastes or purposes to teach  them what we mean by abstract truthfulness  when a bad writer  is inexact even if he can look back on half a century of  years we charge him with incompetence and not with  dishonesty  and why not extend the same allowance to  imperfect speakers  let a stockbroker be dead stupid about  poetry or a poet inexact in the details of business and we  excuse them heartily from blame  but show us a miserable  unbreeched human entity whose whole profession it is to take  a tub for a fortified town and a shavingbrush for the deadly  stiletto and who passes threefourths of his time in a dream  and the rest in open selfdeception and we expect him to be  as nice upon a matter of fact as a scientific expert bearing  evidence  upon my heart i think it less than decent  you do  not consider how little the child sees or how swift he is to  weave what he has seen into bewildering fiction and that he  cares no more for what you call truth than you for a  gingerbread dragoon  i am reminded as i write that the child is very  inquiring as to the precise truth of stories  but indeed this  is a very different matter and one bound up with the subject  of play and the precise amount of playfulness or  playability to be looked for in the world  many such burning  questions must arise in the course of nursery education   among the fauna of this planet which already embraces the  pretty soldier and the terrifying irish beggarman is or is  not the child to expect a bluebeard or a cormoran  is he or  is he not to look out for magicians kindly and potent  may  he or may he not reasonably hope to be cast away upon a  desert island or turned to such diminutive proportions that  he can live on equal terms with his lead soldiery and go a  cruise in his own toy schooner  surely all these are  practical questions to a neophyte entering upon life with a  view to play  precision upon such a point the child can  understand  but if you merely ask him of his past behaviour  as to who threw such a stone for instance or struck such and  such a match or whether he had looked into a parcel or gone  by a forbidden path  why he can see no moment in the  inquiry and it is ten to one he has already half forgotten  and half bemused himself with subsequent imaginings  it would be easy to leave them in their native cloudland  where they figure so prettily  pretty like flowers and  innocent like dogs  they will come out of their gardens soon  enough and have to go into offices and the witnessbox   spare them yet a while o conscientious parent  let them doze  among their playthings yet a little for who knows what a  rough warfaring existence lies before them in the future    chapter x  walking tours    it must not be imagined that a walking tour as some  would have us fancy is merely a better or worse way of seeing  the country  there are many ways of seeing landscape quite as  good and none more vivid in spite of canting dilettantes  than from a railway train  but landscape on a walking tour is  quite accessory  he who is indeed of the brotherhood does not  voyage in quest of the picturesque but of certain jolly  humours  of the hope and spirit with which the march begins  at morning and the peace and spiritual repletion of the  evenings rest  he cannot tell whether he puts his knapsack  on or takes it off with more delight  the excitement of the  departure puts him in key for that of the arrival  whatever  he does is not only a reward in itself but will be further  rewarded in the sequel and so pleasure leads on to pleasure  in an endless chain  it is this that so few can understand  they will either be always lounging or always at five miles an  hour they do not play off the one against the other prepare  all day for the evening and all evening for the next day   and above all it is here that your overwalker fails of  comprehension  his heart rises against those who drink their  curacoa in liqueur glasses when he himself can swill it in a  brown john  he will not believe that the flavour is more  delicate in the smaller dose  he will not believe that to  walk this unconscionable distance is merely to stupefy and  brutalise himself and come to his inn at night with a sort  of frost on his five wits and a starless night of darkness in  his spirit  not for him the mild luminous evening of the  temperate walker  he has nothing left of man but a physical  need for bedtime and a double nightcap and even his pipe if  he be a smoker will be savourless and disenchanted  it is  the fate of such an one to take twice as much trouble as is  needed to obtain happiness and miss the happiness in the end  he is the man of the proverb in short who goes further and  fares worse  now to be properly enjoyed a walking tour should be  gone upon alone  if you go in a company or even in pairs it  is no longer a walking tour in anything but name it is  something else and more in the nature of a picnic  a walking  tour should be gone upon alone because freedom is of the  essence because you should be able to stop and go on and  follow this way or that as the freak takes you and because  you must have your own pace and neither trot alongside a  champion walker nor mince in time with a girl  and then you  must be open to all impressions and let your thoughts take  colour from what you see  you should be as a pipe for any  wind to play upon  i cannot see the wit says hazlitt of  walking and talking at the same time  when i am in the  country i wish to vegetate like the country  which is the  gist of all that can be said upon the matter  there should be  no cackle of voices at your elbow to jar on the meditative  silence of the morning  and so long as a man is reasoning he  cannot surrender himself to that fine intoxication that comes  of much motion in the open air that begins in a sort of  dazzle and sluggishness of the brain and ends in a peace that  passes comprehension  during the first day or so of any tour there are moments  of bitterness when the traveller feels more than coldly  towards his knapsack when he is half in a mind to throw it  bodily over the hedge and like christian on a similar  occasion give three leaps and go on singing  and yet it  soon acquires a property of easiness  it becomes magnetic  the spirit of the journey enters into it  and no sooner have  you passed the straps over your shoulder than the lees of  sleep are cleared from you you pull yourself together with a  shake and fall at once into your stride  and surely of all  possible moods this in which a man takes the road is the  best  of course if he will keep thinking of his anxieties  if he will open the merchant abudahs chest and walk armin arm with the hag  why wherever he is and whether he walk  fast or slow the chances are that he will not be happy  and  so much the more shame to himself  there are perhaps thirty  men setting forth at that same hour and i would lay a large  wager there is not another dull face among the thirty  it  would be a fine thing to follow in a coat of darkness one  after another of these wayfarers some summer morning for the  first few miles upon the road  this one who walks fast with  a keen look in his eyes is all concentrated in his own mind  he is up at his loom weaving and weaving to set the  landscape to words  this one peers about as he goes among  the grasses he waits by the canal to watch the dragonflies  he leans on the gate of the pasture and cannot look enough  upon the complacent kine  and here comes another talking  laughing and gesticulating to himself  his face changes from  time to time as indignation flashes from his eyes or anger  clouds his forehead  he is composing articles delivering  orations and conducting the most impassioned interviews by  the way  a little farther on and it is as like as not he  will begin to sing  and well for him supposing him to be no  great master in that art if he stumble across no stolid  peasant at a corner for on such an occasion i scarcely know  which is the more troubled or whether it is worse to suffer  the confusion of your troubadour or the unfeigned alarm of  your clown  a sedentary population accustomed besides to  the strange mechanical bearing of the common tramp can in no  wise explain to itself the gaiety of these passersby  i knew  one man who was arrested as a runaway lunatic because  although a fullgrown person with a red beard he skipped as  he went like a child  and you would be astonished if i were  to tell you all the grave and learned heads who have confessed  to me that when on walking tours they sang  and sang very  ill  and had a pair of red ears when as described above the  inauspicious peasant plumped into their arms from round a  corner  and here lest you should think i am exaggerating is  hazlitts own confession from his essay on going a journey  which is so good that there should be a tax levied on all who  have not read it  give me the clear blue sky over my head says he and  the green turf beneath my feet a winding road before me and  a three hours march to dinner  and then to thinking  it is  hard if i cannot start some game on these lone heaths  i  laugh i run i leap i sing for joy  bravo  after that adventure of my friend with the  policeman you would not have cared would you to publish  that in the first person  but we have no bravery nowadays  and even in books must all pretend to be as dull and foolish  as our neighbours  it was not so with hazlitt  and notice  how learned he is as indeed throughout the essay in the  theory of walking tours  he is none of your athletic men in  purple stockings who walk their fifty miles a day three  hours march is his ideal  and then he must have a winding  road the epicure  yet there is one thing i object to in these words of his  one thing in the great masters practice that seems to me not  wholly wise  i do not approve of that leaping and running   both of these hurry the respiration they both shake up the  brain out of its glorious openair confusion and they both  break the pace  uneven walking is not so agreeable to the  body and it distracts and irritates the mind  whereas when  once you have fallen into an equable stride it requires no  conscious thought from you to keep it up and yet it prevents  you from thinking earnestly of anything else  like knitting  like the work of a copying clerk it gradually neutralises and  sets to sleep the serious activity of the mind  we can think  of this or that lightly and laughingly as a child thinks or  as we think in a morning dose we can make puns or puzzle out  acrostics and trifle in a thousand ways with words and  rhymes but when it comes to honest work when we come to  gather ourselves together for an effort we may sound the  trumpet as loud and long as we please the great barons of the  mind will not rally to the standard but sit each one at  home warming his hands over his own fire and brooding on his  own private thought  in the course of a days walk you see there is much  variance in the mood  from the exhilaration of the start to  the happy phlegm of the arrival the change is certainly  great  as the day goes on the traveller moves from the one  extreme towards the other  he becomes more and more  incorporated with the material landscape and the openair  drunkenness grows upon him with great strides until he posts  along the road and sees everything about him as in a  cheerful dream  the first is certainly brighter but the  second stage is the more peaceful  a man does not make so  many articles towards the end nor does he laugh aloud but  the purely animal pleasures the sense of physical wellbeing  the delight of every inhalation of every time the muscles  tighten down the thigh console him for the absence of the  others and bring him to his destination still content  nor must i forget to say a word on bivouacs  you come to  a milestone on a hill or some place where deep ways meet  under trees and off goes the knapsack and down you sit to  smoke a pipe in the shade  you sink into yourself and the  birds come round and look at you and your smoke dissipates  upon the afternoon under the blue dome of heaven and the sun  lies warm upon your feet and the cool air visits your neck  and turns aside your open shirt  if you are not happy you  must have an evil conscience  you may dally as long as you  like by the roadside  it is almost as if the millennium were  arrived when we shall throw our clocks and watches over the  housetop and remember time and seasons no more  not to keep  hours for a lifetime is i was going to say to live for ever   you have no idea unless you have tried it how endlessly long  is a summers day that you measure out only by hunger and  bring to an end only when you are drowsy  i know a village  where there are hardly any clocks where no one knows more of  the days of the week than by a sort of instinct for the fete  on sundays and where only one person can tell you the day of  the month and she is generally wrong and if people were  aware how slow time journeyed in that village and what  armfuls of spare hours he gives over and above the bargain  to its wise inhabitants i believe there would be a stampede  out of london liverpool paris and a variety of large towns  where the clocks lose their heads and shake the hours out  each one faster than the other as though they were all in a  wager  and all these foolish pilgrims would each bring his  own misery along with him in a watchpocket  it is to be  noticed there were no clocks and watches in the muchvaunted  days before the flood  it follows of course there were no  appointments and punctuality was not yet thought upon   though ye take from a covetous man all his treasure says  milton he has yet one jewel left ye cannot deprive him of  his covetousness  and so i would say of a modern man of  business you may do what you will for him put him in eden  give him the elixir of life  he has still a flaw at heart he  still has his business habits  now there is no time when  business habits are more mitigated than on a walking tour   and so during these halts as i say you will feel almost  free  but it is at night and after dinner that the best hour  comes  there are no such pipes to be smoked as those that  follow a good days march the flavour of the tobacco is a  thing to be remembered it is so dry and aromatic so full and  so fine  if you wind up the evening with grog you will own  there was never such grog at every sip a jocund tranquillity  spreads about your limbs and sits easily in your heart  if  you read a book  and you will never do so save by fits and  starts  you find the language strangely racy and harmonious  words take a new meaning single sentences possess the ear for  half an hour together and the writer endears himself to you  at every page by the nicest coincidence of sentiment  it  seems as if it were a book you had written yourself in a  dream  to all we have read on such occasions we look back  with special favour  it was on the 10th of april 1798  says hazlitt with amorous precision that i sat down to a  volume of the new heloise at the inn at llangollen over a  bottle of sherry and a cold chicken  i should wish to quote  more for though we are mighty fine fellows nowadays we  cannot write like hazlitt  and talking of that a volume of  hazlitts essays would be a capital pocketbook on such a  journey so would a volume of heines songs and for tristram  shandy i can pledge a fair experience  if the evening be fine and warm there is nothing better  in life than to lounge before the inn door in the sunset or  lean over the parapet of the bridge to watch the weeds and  the quick fishes  it is then if ever that you taste  joviality to the full significance of that audacious word   your muscles are so agreeably slack you feel so clean and so  strong and so idle that whether you move or sit still  whatever you do is done with pride and a kingly sort of  pleasure  you fall in talk with any one wise or foolish  drunk or sober  and it seems as if a hot walk purged you  more than of anything else of all narrowness and pride and  left curiosity to play its part freely as in a child or a man  of science  you lay aside all your own hobbies to watch  provincial humours develop themselves before you now as a  laughable farce and now grave and beautiful like an old tale  or perhaps you are left to your own company for the  night and surly weather imprisons you by the fire  you may  remember how burns numbering past pleasures dwells upon the  hours when he has been happy thinking  it is a phrase that  may well perplex a poor modern girt about on every side by  clocks and chimes and haunted even at night by flaming  dialplates  for we are all so busy and have so many faroff  projects to realise and castles in the fire to turn into  solid habitable mansions on a gravel soil that we can find no  time for pleasure trips into the land of thought and among the  hills of vanity  changed times indeed when we must sit all  night beside the fire with folded hands and a changed world  for most of us when we find we can pass the hours without  discontent and be happy thinking  we are in such haste to be  doing to be writing to be gathering gear to make our voice  audible a moment in the derisive silence of eternity that we  forget that one thing of which these are but the parts   namely to live  we fall in love we drink hard we run to  and fro upon the earth like frightened sheep  and now you are  to ask yourself if when all is done you would not have been  better to sit by the fire at home and be happy thinking  to  sit still and contemplate  to remember the faces of women  without desire to be pleased by the great deeds of men  without envy to be everything and everywhere in sympathy and  yet content to remain where and what you are  is not this to  know both wisdom and virtue and to dwell with happiness   after all it is not they who carry flags but they who look  upon it from a private chamber who have the fun of the  procession  and once you are at that you are in the very  humour of all social heresy  it is no time for shuffling or  for big empty words  if you ask yourself what you mean by  fame riches or learning the answer is far to seek and you  go back into that kingdom of light imaginations which seem so  vain in the eyes of philistines perspiring after wealth and  so momentous to those who are stricken with the disproportions  of the world and in the face of the gigantic stars cannot  stop to split differences between two degrees of the  infinitesimally small such as a tobacco pipe or the roman  empire a million of money or a fiddlesticks end  you lean from the window your last pipe reeking whitely  into the darkness your body full of delicious pains your  mind enthroned in the seventh circle of content when suddenly  the mood changes the weathercock goes about and you ask  yourself one question more whether for the interval you  have been the wisest philosopher or the most egregious of  donkeys  human experience is not yet able to reply but at  least you have had a fine moment and looked down upon all the  kingdoms of the earth  and whether it was wise or foolish  tomorrows travel will carry you body and mind into some  different parish of the infinite    chapter xi  pans pipes    the world in which we live has been variously said and  sung by the most ingenious poets and philosophers these  reducing it to formulae and chemical ingredients those  striking the lyre in highsounding measures for the handiwork  of god  what experience supplies is of a mingled tissue and  the choosing mind has much to reject before it can get  together the materials of a theory  dew and thunder  destroying atilla and the spring lambkins belong to an order  of contrasts which no repetition can assimilate  there is an  uncouth outlandish strain throughout the web of the world as  from a vexatious planet in the house of life  things are not  congruous and wear strange disguises the consummate flower is  fostered out of dung and after nourishing itself awhile with  heavens delicate distillations decays again into  indistinguishable soil and with caesars ashes hamlet tells  us the urchins make dirt pies and filthily besmear their  countenance  nay the kindly shine of summer when tracked  home with the scientific spyglass is found to issue from the  most portentous nightmare of the universe  the great  conflagrant sun a world of hells squibs tumultuary roaring  aloud inimical to life  the sun itself is enough to disgust  a human being of the scene which he inhabits and you would  not fancy there was a green or habitable spot in a universe  thus awfully lighted up  and yet it is by the blaze of such a  conflagration to which the fire of rome was but a spark that  we do all our fiddling and hold domestic teaparties at the  arbour door  the greeks figured pan the god of nature now terribly  stamping his foot so that armies were dispersed now by the  woodside on a summer noon trolling on his pipe until he  charmed the hearts of upland ploughmen  and the greeks in so  figuring uttered the last word of human experience  to  certain smokedried spirits matter and motion and elastic  aethers and the hypothesis of this or that other spectacled  professor tell a speaking story but for youth and all  ductile and congenial minds pan is not dead but of all the  classic hierarchy alone survives in triumph goatfooted with  a gleeful and an angry look the type of the shaggy world and  in every wood if you go with a spirit properly prepared you  shall hear the note of his pipe  for it is a shaggy world and yet studded with gardens  where the salt and tumbling sea receives clear rivers running  from among reeds and lilies fruitful and austere a rustic  world sunshiny lewd and cruel  what is it the birds sing  among the trees in pairingtime  what means the sound of the  rain falling far and wide upon the leafy forest  to what tune  does the fisherman whistle as he hauls in his net at morning  and the bright fish are heaped inside the boat  these are all  airs upon pans pipe he it was who gave them breath in the  exultation of his heart and gleefully modulated their outflow  with his lips and fingers  the coarse mirth of herdsmen  shaking the dells with laughter and striking out high echoes  from the rock the tune of moving feet in the lamplit city or  on the smooth ballroom floor the hooves of many horses  beating the wide pastures in alarm the song of hurrying  rivers the colour of clear skies and smiles and the live  touch of hands and the voice of things and their significant  look and the renovating influence they breathe forth  these  are his joyful measures to which the whole earth treads in  choral harmony  to this music the young lambs bound as to a  tabor and the london shopgirl skips rudely in the dance   for it puts a spirit of gladness in all hearts and to look on  the happy side of nature is common in their hours to all  created things  some are vocal under a good influence are  pleasing whenever they are pleased and hand on their  happiness to others as a child who looking upon lovely  things looks lovely  some leap to the strains with unapt  foot and make a halting figure in the universal dance  and  some like sour spectators at the play receive the music into  their hearts with an unmoved countenance and walk like  strangers through the general rejoicing  but let him feign  never so carefully there is not a man but has his pulses  shaken when pan trolls out a stave of ecstasy and sets the  world asinging  alas if that were all  but oftentimes the air is  changed and in the screech of the night wind chasing navies  subverting the tall ships and the rooted cedar of the hills  in the random deadly levin or the fury of headlong floods we  recognise the dread foundation of life and the anger in  pans heart  earth wages open war against her children and  under her softest touch hides treacherous claws  the cool  waters invite us in to drown the domestic hearth burns up in  the hour of sleep and makes an end of all  everything is  good or bad helpful or deadly not in itself but by its  circumstances  for a few bright days in england the hurricane  must break forth and the north sea pay a toll of populous  ships  and when the universal music has led lovers into the  paths of dalliance confident of natures sympathy suddenly  the air shifts into a minor and death makes a clutch from his  ambuscade below the bed of marriage  for death is given in a  kiss the dearest kindnesses are fatal and into this life  where one thing preys upon another the child too often makes  its entrance from the mothers corpse  it is no wonder with  so traitorous a scheme of things if the wise people who  created for us the idea of pan thought that of all fears the  fear of him was the most terrible since it embraces all  and  still we preserve the phrase a panic terror  to reckon  dangers too curiously to hearken too intently for the threat  that runs through all the winning music of the world to hold  back the hand from the rose because of the thorn and from  life because of death this it is to be afraid of pan  highly  respectable citizens who flee lifes pleasures and  responsibilities and keep with upright hat upon the midway  of custom avoiding the right hand and the left the ecstasies  and the agonies how surprised they would be if they could  hear their attitude mythologically expressed and knew  themselves as toothchattering ones who flee from nature  because they fear the hand of natures god  shrilly sound  pans pipes and behold the banker instantly concealed in the  bank parlour  for to distrust ones impulses is to be  recreant to pan  there are moments when the mind refuses to be satisfied  with evolution and demands a ruddier presentation of the sum  of mans experience  sometimes the mood is brought about by  laughter at the humorous side of life as when abstracting  ourselves from earth we imagine people plodding on foot or  seated in ships and speedy trains with the planet all the  while whirling in the opposite direction so that for all  their hurry they travel backforemost through the universe of  space  sometimes it comes by the spirit of delight and  sometimes by the spirit of terror  at least there will  always be hours when we refuse to be put off by the feint of  explanation nicknamed science and demand instead some  palpitating image of our estate that shall represent the  troubled and uncertain element in which we dwell and satisfy  reason by the means of art  science writes of the world as if  with the cold finger of a starfish it is all true but what  is it when compared to the reality of which it discourses  where hearts beat high in april and death strikes and hills  totter in the earthquake and there is a glamour over all the  objects of sight and a thrill in all noises for the ear and  romance herself has made her dwelling among men  so we come  back to the old myth and hear the goatfooted piper making  the music which is itself the charm and terror of things and  when a glen invites our visiting footsteps fancy that pan  leads us thither with a gracious tremolo or when our hearts  quail at the thunder of the cataract tell ourselves that he  has stamped his hoof in the nigh thicket    chapter xii  a plea for gas lamps    cities given the problem was to light them  how to  conduct individual citizens about the burgesswarren when  once heaven had withdrawn its leading luminary or  since we  live in a scientific age  when once our spinning planet has  turned its back upon the sun  the moon from time to time  was doubtless very helpful the stars had a cheery look among  the chimneypots and a cresset here and there on church or  citadel produced a fine pictorial effect and in places  where the ground lay unevenly held out the right hand of  conduct to the benighted  but sun moon and stars abstracted  or concealed the nightfaring inhabitant had to fall back   we speak on the authority of old prints  upon stable  lanthorns two stories in height  many holes drilled in the  conical turretroof of this vagabond pharos let up spouts of  dazzlement into the bearers eyes and as he paced forth in  the ghostly darkness carrying his own sun by a ring about his  finger day and night swung to and fro and up and down about  his footsteps  blackness haunted his path he was beleaguered  by goblins as he went and curfew being struck he found no  light but that he travelled in throughout the township  closely following on this epoch of migratory lanthorns in  a world of extinction came the era of oillights hard to  kindle easy to extinguish pale and wavering in the hour of  their endurance  rudely puffed the winds of heaven roguishly  clomb up the alldestructive urchin and lo in a moment  night reestablished her void empire and the cit groped along  the wall suppered but bedless occult from guidance and  sorrily wading in the kennels  as if gamesome winds and  gamesome youths were not sufficient it was the habit to sling  these feeble luminaries from house to house above the fairway   there on invisible cordage let them swing  and suppose some  cranenecked general to go speeding by on a tall charger  spurring the destiny of nations redhot in expedition there  would indubitably be some effusion of military blood and  oaths and a certain crash of glass and while the chieftain  rode forward with a purple coxcomb the street would be left  to original darkness unpiloted unvoyageable a province of  the desert night  the conservative looking before and after draws from  each contemplation the matter for content  out of the age of  gas lamps he glances back slightingly at the mirk and glimmer  in which his ancestors wandered his heart waxes jocund at the  contrast nor do his lips refrain from a stave in the highest  style of poetry lauding progress and the golden mean  when  gas first spread along a city mapping it forth about evenfall  for the eye of observant birds a new age had begun for  sociality and corporate pleasureseeking and begun with  proper circumstance becoming its own birthright  the work of  prometheus had advanced by another stride  mankind and its  supper parties were no longer at the mercy of a few miles of  seafog sundown no longer emptied the promenade and the day  was lengthened out to every mans fancy  the cityfolk had  stars of their own biddable domesticated stars  it is true that these were not so steady nor yet so  clear as their originals nor indeed was their lustre so  elegant as that of the best wax candles  but then the gas  stars being nearer at hand were more practically efficacious  than jupiter himself  it is true again that they did not  unfold their rays with the appropriate spontaneity of the  planets coming out along the firmament one after another as  the need arises but the lamplighters took to their heels  every evening and ran with a good heart it was pretty to see  man thus emulating the punctuality of heavens orbs and  though perfection was not absolutely reached and now and then  an individual may have been knocked on the head by the ladder  of the flying functionary yet people commended his zeal in a  proverb and taught their children to say god bless the  lamplighter  and since his passage was a piece of the days  programme the children were well pleased to repeat the  benediction not of course in so many words which would  have been improper but in some chaste circumlocution  suitable for infant lips  god bless him indeed  for the term of his twilight  diligence is near at hand and for not much longer shall we  watch him speeding up the street and at measured intervals  knocking another luminous hole into the dusk  the greeks  would have made a noble myth of such an one how he  distributed starlight and as soon as the need was over re collected it and the little bullseye which was his  instrument and held enough fire to kindle a whole parish  would have been fitly commemorated in the legend  now like  all heroic tasks his labours draw towards apotheosis and in  the light of victory himself shall disappear  for another  advance has been effected  our tame stars are to come out in  future not one by one but all in a body and at once  a  sedate electrician somewhere in a back office touches a spring   and behold from one end to another of the city from east  to west from the alexandra to the crystal palace there is  light  fiat lux says the sedate electrician  what a  spectacle on some clear dark nightfall from the edge of  hampstead hill when in a moment in the twinkling of an eye  the design of the monstrous city flashes into vision  a  glittering hieroglyph many square miles in extent and when  to borrow and debase an image all the evening streetlamps  burst together into song  such is the spectacle of the  future preluded the other day by the experiment in pall mall   starrise by electricity the most romantic flight of  civilisation the compensatory benefit for an innumerable  array of factories and bankers clerks  to the artistic  spirit exercised about thirlmere here is a crumb of  consolation consolatory at least to such of them as look  out upon the world through seeing eyes and contentedly accept  beauty where it comes  but the conservative while lauding progress is ever  timid of innovation his is the hand upheld to counsel pause  his is the signal advising slow advance  the word electricity  now sounds the note of danger  in paris at the mouth of the  passage des princes in the place before the opera portico  and in the rue drouot at the figaro office a new sort of  urban star now shines out nightly horrible unearthly  obnoxious to the human eye a lamp for a nightmare  such a  light as this should shine only on murders and public crime  or along the corridors of lunatic asylums a horror to  heighten horror  to look at it only once is to fall in love  with gas which gives a warm domestic radiance fit to eat by   mankind you would have thought might have remained content  with what prometheus stole for them and not gone fishing the  profound heaven with kites to catch and domesticate the  wildfire of the storm  yet here we have the levin brand at  our doors and it is proposed that we should henceforward take  our walks abroad in the glare of permanent lightning  a man  need not be very superstitious if he scruple to follow his  pleasures by the light of the terror that flieth nor very  epicurean if he prefer to see the face of beauty more  becomingly displayed  that ugly blinding glare may not  improperly advertise the home of slanderous figaro which is a  backshop to the infernal regions but where soft joys prevail  where people are convoked to pleasure and the philosopher  looks on smiling and silent where love and laughter and  deifying wine abound there at least let the old mild lustre  shine upon the ways of man
